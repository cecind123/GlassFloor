bad,That management all they care about is themself and the employees  were just a number.  Employees will get written up for the everything including the they breezy.
bad,No comments at this time about the job trucking industry freight is always up and down in the industry this is always playing a roll in driver employment so I have no complaints
bad,"I gave an entire year of my life to this rat hole. The management walk around as if they are disgusted with your presence, and let's not get started on their reactions when you SPEAK to them. They don't care about their people at all, they only care about the numbers. Management get a bonus off the hard work of the employees who don't see a cent. The warehouse in the warmer months (which are a lot in TX) is over °100 and they cannot keep their ice machines working to give the employees ice, and when they do work they put locks on them so only the management can access it. The water they offer is sink water, makes almost every employee who is forced to drink it sick. I wouldn't recommend for ANYONE to work there, they will treat you like dirt!"
bad,Very challenging with the managers.They do not care about your well being.You will just have to find out for yourself. Fast pace and dangerous. Thank you
bad,Terrible place to work at you could be doing a good job management will still not pick and bother you for no reason. Management won’t like you for no reason and make your days at work miserable.
bad,It became obvious to me after working here that this is a revolving door job for either fit or dumb people. The managers are not qualified. Extra effort is only awarded with a higher workload and the expectation to improve upon that new higher workload
bad,"- Managers treat you like a slave."
bad,This contract company management is not on the same page. They hire people full time  and they don’t have the work. Do not waste your time. Bad compan
bad,I only use Fedex system at Ernst & Young to process and ship packages. This is a heavy responsiblity that I do especially during 2 tax busy seasons every year.
bad,Awful place to work. You get the same pay if you work 12 hours a day an someone else works 5. Management is lost an only cares about themselves. Awful
bad,Each state is different and each person can decide their own opinion. Each location has their pros and their cons. I can only speak for myself and definitely not any one else.
bad,Terrible managers & they terminate everyone for no reason . People get high on the job & nobody cares & ive literally seen someone smoke a cig in a trailer before . People get Vapes and knives other metal stuff past their METAL DECTECTOR . What a joke
bad,Bad place to work if your not an favorite .you might get something out of being there. Some of the people were not all had. The management was not kind at all.
bad,"Definitely a company that needs restructuring.  Floor managers, supervisors, and leads need to be trained in a more efficient manner.  Slavery ended  decades ago.....I don’t think FedEx got the message.  Very sad and discouraging company to work for."
bad,"Company sucks, you better watch or stuff or people will steel from you, your co-workers are lazy and they eat lunch on the clock, poor manangement, people their cheat and lie about everything, girls hide in bathrooms, guys too. This is a very bad company. Their on cnn all the time for wrong doings and that is rrom higher up people."
bad,"Poor management, bad work conditions, lack of help, team work awful everything was a rush no plan involved ......................................................"
bad,"It seems they only care about the tax break the government awards them when they hire a new employee, right after your are hired, you are thrown in your new position with no training whatsoever. If you make a mistake due to the lack of training, they will still give you warnings stating you don’t have to acknowledge it but they oblige you to. Most of managers lack the communication and professional skills to perform their duties. They will send you messages for personal and sensitive information with other employees for things you don’t want to share with others. They will have you working on a 6 hour shift without breaks as per company’s policy. The pay isn’t worth for the number of things they expect you to do at once. It’s like the system is designed for you to fail, so they can get rid of you and hire the next one in line to get the tax break from the government."
bad,"B&B Logistics in Mississippi is the contractor for fedex ground that I worked for. Terrible. Long hours for no additional pay, no benefits, paper checks with no direct deposit, damaged unsafe trucks, and if you leave or get fired good luck getting all your pay. They'll just come up with some fake thing to charge you for."
bad,"Whole place is terrible, but what can you expect with a corporate business. no one cares at all but themselves company is s**t people there are worse."
bad,"I worked in the warehouse part if I could give a negative 0, I definitely would. Surprised I lasted as long as I did, nobody but God strength. Hated every moment there especially towards the end."
bad,They don’t train people at all and pretty much just take you to your spot and say HERE YOU GO instead of training people the real way trainers should train new people.
bad,"Work responsibilities change day to day based upon what needs to get done, very little supervision from higher up positions, awful work environment in extreme weather conditions."
bad,They dont pay enough..you dont even get 20hours..i spend the money i make on gas there to home every week..i hate this job..cant wait to find another job.
bad,"Very poor pay, doesn’t change in holiday season when 30% more stops are added and weather is bad, NO benefits. This is not a job that anyone who is worth it will work for any real amount of time. Neither corporate nor the contractors care about real innovation or improvement for the workers"
bad,Fedex and the employees “Team Lead” think they can just tell you what to do well  their seating down not doing nothing . Nothing even a helping hand .
bad,He does not care for the laws or the well being of his employees and was the worst and most laziest manager I've ever had at a job. It was just a really bad job experience and I hope you bear this as a warning.
bad,I moated trucks a whole day can And stack boxes am I told you rigs off the belt and put them in the semi trailer and they were heavy the people there were nice
bad,U load ur own truck for in the morning and don’t get paid for it! U are paid by the stop not by the hour pay is up and down every week and contractors over load u being greedy sometimes 200 to 300 stops a day
bad,I was working nonstop for them and I miss a couple of days because I couldn't get rides and stuff I was always tired. Always someone getting hurt there
bad,Horarios que no te permiten hacer nada. Únicamente vives para trabajar. Además no son fijos. Trabajas días festivos. Contratan por outsourcing. Salario bajísimo. Sin estabilidad laboral. Te explotan hasta el agotamiento. NO ES RECOMENDABLE trabajar aquí. Horrible empresa
bad,"Don’t work there  Trash place to work at, they contact you when to work. I’ve made plenty of calls to them for the past 2 weeks. You work whenever they tell you on call"
bad,It's a great place to work .if you are single with no kids or extracurricular activities going on then this is a excellent place to work and receive great pay .
bad,"It's unfortunate that their original motto of ""People/Service/Profit"" has been flipped upside down. Management seems to feel it's more important to impose severe discipline than to be grateful for the service of their employees. Ultimately, it's customers that pay the price by receiving less service."
bad,"Worked here 3 years. Every time it was time to promote, I was told that I was to valuable where I was at and someone with no experience would be put above me"
bad,The manager at the time was a thief she always stole time I worked several hours of overtime and was never paid for when confronted it was always an excuse
bad,It is a good place to work and the managers are very understanding with outside of the job problems. But in the mornings you are frowned upon for using the bathroom and or take a water break. They overwork their employees all the time. They cut off people and expect those remaining to pull their workload. We are breaking our backs and ankles and wrists trying to stay on top ofour jobs.
bad,Working there for couple of years too much drama inside the organization its  not what you know its who you know to step up plus the Human Resources are no help they just want to fire people
bad,Extremely disappointed. Walked when accused of work place violence by a petty coworker.  This person almost cause me to fall when they placed a bin right behind me while I was on a step stool. When I step down and pushed the cart out of my way to the spot to where it belonged and I did not know she was there and Bcart tapped her. She reported it as work place violence and manger conducted near miss as if it was violence not a near miss investigation. No thank you
bad,Sad and I want to go home I've been having too many headaches since I've been working there just doesn't feel right I'm there early in the morning and I'm the last to leave in the morning and I'm also the last to get done for the day
bad,Zero management. Stressful working day. Nobody care about drivers. A lot of problems on the road and always drivers have to resolve them. Very poor customer service team.
bad,"Long hours and no overtime pay. contractors are on a daily basis try to make a fool out of employees, there's always problem with the trucks and somewhat it always ends up been the drivers fault they say and most of this are old trucks. I would never work for these company with no benefits again."
bad,"Crybaby drivers, mechanics brag about not doing anything, no teamwork, theft, two faced employees, office personnel are ""better"" than you. These people are crooks"
bad,Contractors at this location pay bare minimum for drivers. If you have a family you have to provide for it is not work it. If you have an issue it will not be resolved. All of your business is talked about by management and other employees. It's sad and it was an awful experience. I have nothing nice to say about them.
bad,the team was great fun busy around Christmas management was friendly team was outgoing we did everything to ensure a job well done and to meet daily quoter.
bad,"My experience at FedEx was not so great I applied to the Wayne Location in NJ got an interview then hired went through orientation like everyone else. I was assigned to be a loader. At first the managers like the sort manager bought us food and all. Then as time went time they really started disrespecting everyone and yelling at everyone for no reason. I was fired after I got sick and called out during a sort even though I had a doctor's note and I was one of the hardest workers in that building, but they don't care how hard you work your just another number to them and they like to talk about how much they don't need unions because of their open door policy no they don't like unions because then they have to give breaks which they don't do or give good reasons to fire you this job is mentally and physically degrading my best advice DO NOT APPLY HERE."
bad,"Set way to much u will go broke u have 2 bid on loads ,dont doit dont doit I've been driving for 28 years set everywhere dont let know one lie to u ,,you will go broke fleet owners get priority on loads"
bad,225 transfer drive is the worst place I have ever worked at in my entire life. Management trains you to do nothing and have very poor communication skills along with no real management techniques. They do not train you to do anything but they hold you accountable for everything. Pure trash. Save yourself the time and grief.
bad,"They pay by salary, not matter how many hours do you work a day or a week, is a really hard work, they need more organization, and pay better to the drivers"
bad,Please don’t make the same stupid mistake I did. Do yourself a favor and stay far away from this hellhole. Worst company I have ever worked. For the management is so unorganized and unprofessional.
bad,"The warehouse in Wilmer,Tx is terrible!! The management is poor. They are having relationships with employee, just tacky !!! I do NOT recommend working there!!"
bad,"No benefits as a contractor, money can be good one week and nothing the next. Load board constantly changing the only people making good money of course are the ones who own their trucksown"
bad,"Muito difícil de trabalhar ."
bad,"I worked for janitorial inside the Fed ex facility in little Rock .,I wouldn't recommend no one to work there because it's not a come up in life& also they don't teach u anything there.,and on top of that the dumb rules to be brought in discussing.just all I'm saying is h&b cleaning inside Fed ex is not the job for anyone with experience."
bad,"terrible upper management"
bad,Company uses fear to manage and bully people.  Always asking more from its employees than will to give to them.  No loyalty.  Highly unsafe work environment.  Management are bullies.
bad,"The managers will rush you to finish a truck at unreasonable times. "
bad,They are a terriable place to work and not worth it at all. Honestly pay is to low and not enough hours to live off of. I wouldn't tell anyone to get a job there
bad,OK job not a professional atmosphere. Management one sided. And the pay was quite low with empty promises to employees. This job was a very good stepping stone job if you are looking to get into the customer service field.
bad,"Never been in such a negative harassment filled workplace before or since. I was lied to and bullied from the first day and that guy was a ""supervisor"". Go to max prison like Reneuse as a prisoner and you will get more respect than from any colleague at Fed Ex!"
bad,"I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND ANY OWNER OPERATER TO WORK FOR THIS COMPANY"
bad,"Overworked over stressed people that work very hard, but the company pays them the least amount possible and management blocks advancement for more qualified people in lieu of less experienced people that they want to be friends with."
bad,Place is just terrible to work at. Your treated like a number and nothing more. You will be worked like a dog. My experience this is not a job for a woman unless your a manger' s favorite.
bad,They over worked us . they expected more than 3 trailers per ever 2 hours . unfair . as a part timer there is no love for us at all . even if you worked harder than the others
bad,"Reputation for cutting hours, favoritism, and unsafe environments and practices even tho the companies top priority is safety. You won't get paid enough for your work or credited enough for your work. Very toxic and very stressful. Would not recommend"
bad,"Referring only to the SmartPost/ Grounds location that is located at 5025 knollwood St. and Anderson Road you should run as fast as possible from that place, you do not want to work there management and supposed trainer's are the Worst.  All most of them do, the Men I'm referring too, All Men Manager's on Night Shift, Women Apply, but never get the Management Positions. They walk around all day or on the tugger talking to their friends that get away with everything, not working or less working and they""flirt"" with the Women all Day every Day."
bad,"I recently had started a job at Fedex ground, i started as unloading trailers. It wasn't bad, but lets say they have a lot of expectations. Working with managers that don't care if you get hurt or don't feel good can really get out of hand. They do not care if you have something else to do after work as my manager said ""fedex is now your home."" I had dropped a 80 pound box on my foot, it was nice to get a bag of ice and nothing else. They expected me to get back up after 10 minutes and get right back to work. I find it so funny how management doesn't even get along. They'll talk smack behind your back also they'll talk smack to management. I had bad experiences trusting people in the work place. Managers only want you to work so they won't have tp hop in a trailer. overall my advice is that you really watch how they treat you and don't let them use you, because they will, they'll sweet talk you into doing anything."
bad,treated like you are just a dime a dozen from management!!!!!  Management very uneducated and had their employee pets!!!!! very unruly and ignorant management!!!!!!
bad,place had bed bugs and fleas/ they didnt reallly take care of us how they should have. hours sucked schedule was never the same. i did not enjoy working there.
bad,"This place sucks!! Poor training and management. Very low pay high stress you will do other peoples work and your own. Nothing here will work the system is always down, email you name it and it's not working. They stress you out over their inadequacies and UNORGANIZATION. And dont even pay you enough to be able to afford life!! DONT DO IT!!!!!"
bad,I would never recommend no one and it's very poor management i really was unhappy there i waa treated poorly never received a fair chance. Shift never started on time management waa rude and unprofessional disrespectful employees waa treated poorly never really cared about safety.
bad,There are very lazy people there that don't want to do anything or work saw coeworkers do drugs in the bathrooms and girls as well are on drugs there are alot of favoritism there and very poor management there
bad,My overall work experience at FedEx wasn't the best. I had the worse experience with management The workers were treated like animals and not people. Also black people were faced with racism daily.
bad,It was like working in high school with all the drama. Management didnt do there jobs and no one wanted to work. If u had a personal issue its was scv spread like wildfire.
bad,"An employer that is changing daily."
bad,"No safety training. Many employees get injured due to bad work conditions and being rushed and understaffed. After, it is highly likely they will find reason to fire employees."
bad,Between terrible hours and even worse mangers this could be the worst job I've had in my 2 decades of working.  They refuse to fire even the wrost of employees.  Even the best and hardest working employees are often overlooked.  And when your opinion is voiced is falls on deaf ears.  Save yourself the headache and look elsewhere for a better job.
bad,"Seems like everyone's ex's works for the postal service , 19yr olds that seem to love wearing sheer spandex I didn't enjoy all of the bs show that happened everyday."
bad,the job is boring very stressful. If you work there you do get music. I would rather work at a dog shelter. The management is very rude and they dont help at all. Atleast you gert to listen to music
bad,"Depends on the contractor your with unfortunately for me the one I’m with is not the best including no type of benefits as far as (health, dental, etc). The working conditions are not great either."
bad,"I worked overtime  unpaid for 5 months, any problems that the truck had came my own, they treat you like robots if you have a life outside of fed ex they don 't want you to take care of it"
bad,"The turnover is very high, almost all the people you are hired with will be gone in less that a month. This statistic should speak for it self. Apply at your own risk!"
bad,Terrible. Sold me a story but was completely the opposite. Worked dock as a driver and only pulling in about 29 hours a week. Couldn't even afford to pay bills working there. Best part time job ever.
bad,"A certain group of people is asked to do what they can while others are demanded to go above and beyond to make up the difference. Rules like being on time or performance minimums are enforced selectively etc.  If you want to know what it was like to build pyramids in Egypt, and you look like you descended from the people who did........ This is the place for you"
bad,Needed a job and was desperate. Next time I'll have standards for the places I work. FedEx will never be in my future because of the unsafe work environment some of the supervisors created.
bad,"If you’re a good employee the managers work you to death to cover for slower employees. You are constantly pushed to work faster and harder in a warehouse and trailer that are both unbearable due to whatever weather is going on outside. Not worth it, anyone who stays past 6 months is closer to a God than a man. This work is brutal."
bad,"The owner manager of the  company,  "" Elite One "" contractor is full of himself. He will cheat employees."
bad,It’s too hot in those warehouses they should really have air in them so I wouldn’t recommend if u want to sweat really hard it’s just either too hot or too cold
bad,"Where to begin, slave job, nonsense meetings, no break, back breaking and unsafe environment. In the summer it's hot inside cause no air conditioner inside, winter it's colder inside. Shame on you FedEx, you make millions of profit every year and you can't put a cooling and heating system in your facility. The scanners don't work, the system is badly designed, nothing works as it supposed to do. Packages come through the chute and fall on the side or just remain stuck on it. Shame on you FedEX, shame"
bad,"cant get a hold of your ""managers"" and if you talk to HR you are doing the wrong thing... they dont care about their workers. main ""boss"" laughed in my face eating a snickers bar in regards to my employment."
bad,"If you have any self worth at all, AVOID THIS JOB. Sure, this job is getting ""Paid to Workout"", if your workout is the insanity workout for 4 hours straight with no breaks and some guy telling you he has more work for you when things ""slow down"". The benefits are great if you live long enough to enjoy them. The best part about this job is when you quit. I can't even begin to tell you how many damaged packages get sent out because of the ungodly workload on the employees. Standardization? Forget it, you'll be told what to do and left by yourself to figure out the rest. Good luck!"
bad,"I worked here and busted my behind for this company. I was injured a big piece of metal broke threw a box I was lifting threw the bottom. Landing directly on my big toe. I was told that I should not go to the doctor by the manager at the time, that it was fine and that it wasnt broken and that they would just say the same thing I went home, then later that night went to the doctors in so much pain they gave me meds, wrapped it and gave me a boot. The manager then acted like I had wronged them when I gave them all the information for said doctors visit so they could take care of my visit because it was on company time at there facility. As well as their fault for having us in such poor conditions. It took them almost a full year to get my bills taken care of. I would not really you work for this company unless you're truly so desperate for work that breaking your back, for not even livable wages. They will not take care of you. I had co workers who had gone threw the same exact stuff at this place be aware and find something else."
bad,I could write a book about this company but I will keep it short. They do not care about women. They don't not care about their employees' medical or financial status. They support upper management that sexually harass female employees.
bad,"it does not matter how fast you're going, you are always going as fast as you can, but its never fast enough. they switch your hours whenever they want, without warning. awful soul crushing work."
bad,FedEx doesn’t pay enough and I’m gone 15+ hours a day and only paid for 8. They also use guilt trips on their employees. They demand you work on your days off and none of the trucks would pass inspection.
bad,The bosses are always changing their minds about what is and is not right and blaming the employees when things go wrong. You get assigned a job then they pull you off of it when you start doing it well. Bosses play favorites and the ones who stickup get what they want. Terrible place to work.
bad,This company sucks all the managers are on each other side because they all have some type of personal relationship with each other they fire people for dumb stuff and don’t give second chances the store manager #3610 sells drugs out his office
bad,"No load opportunity, unfair pay, poor despatch service, resettlement or payment not fast, their insurance charges you extra money and so on. I can say a lot about this company and very trapped."
bad,This is the worst job I ever had. I've seen too many good employees leave while they keep the dead weight. Overworked and underpaid. They don't actually train you on how to do anything. The management is terrible. I wouldn't recommend this job to a rat.
bad,No human can keep up with what FedEx expects of you. They have a scan rate that not one person hits...because its too high. Management does not motivate you...they scare you about being wrote up or fired. Everyone is replaceable and thats how you are treated. Worked like a dog for pennies !!! Hot as the devils butt crack in that warehouse but they want you working at top speed !!!! Hours are never the same the manager text you everyday with a different start time. This place is ridiculous !!!
bad,"loved my hours, nice place to work with really friendly coworkers that I learned a lot from. I only wish they had more hours for employees to work as I needed more money"
bad,"I only worked shortly there, too much work and heavy duty,, its not for me.. also un balance hours to work.. so I have to leave  for another job . thats all I say"
bad,"If you don't reach your quota, you're gone."
bad,It was one of the worst places I ever worked. There are no bathroom breaks during the overnight shift.  They expect an employee to unload a truck in far less time than it actually takes.
bad,"Supervisor staff is mean and they yell like your a child. No talking to teach before scolding.  People are human beings and should be treated as such. If you have outside problems, don't bring it to your job."
bad,The only thing they care about is stops per hour. This creates an extremely unsafe and unpleasant work experience.  Someone will eventually get killed by a speeding courier trying to make his stop.
bad,"They don't train newbies well, don't really blame them managers are just lazy. Veterans are treat like dirt, they depends on them way too much. Bad Place to woto at, newbies eventually quit on day 1."
bad,i worked for fedex there over christmas season i had 92.5 hour in one week and they laid me off after i worked so hard so i wouldnt work for them ever again
bad,"Poor management, lifting boxes of 150 lbs. or less, Requirement is 75 lbs. maximum, and they don't pay you on time.  They seem to not be able to keep their employees and there is high turnover."
bad,It’s absolutely absurd to work for a company that do not care about you as a person or anyone as a person. I got terminated with no warning because of small things that could of been talked about
bad,I dont mind hard work....but this place treats you like a robot. Make a mistake and they crucify you rather than explain it the right way. So that's the way I see it
bad,I was working a FedEx because I needed more money while I was in school. This job is not based on employees. It doesn’t help me go further with my career.
bad,"It's always the people that have never driven a truck or safety people who run drivers off.They can't keep drivers, because the people who don't drive make it impossible for the ones that do. To many does and don'ts"
bad,"I started at FedEx in the middle of a Florida summer, the interview was short (1-2 questions if that) in the air conditioned security/HR office. The next two days consisted of a day of paperwork and general job description. The next day was a tour of the facility. The first day of actual work, you get assigned an area, load or unload. The titles are pretty straightforward, you either load or unload semi trailers. These trailers consist of a top and a bottom section, called the belly. The belly is underneath these large flaps that lift up and secure via magnet or hooks. The magnets are often missing and the hooks cannot be reached from within the belly. While in the belly the rollers are in the middle on a raised strip, with space underneath for packages. On unload you will have to lift 50-100+ pound packages from the ground to about chin height (I'm 5'5""). On load you will have to take boxes off the rollers and put them into the belly, making sure every space possible is filled. If the chute and rollers get jammed packages will fall on you, and they are very heavy.  There is no air conditioning, the fans are inadequate, the managers aren't particularly good at their jobs and the higher up managers are very disrespectful. Water is provided but breaks are not. If you get out of your trailer to refill your bottle, you have to inform your manager and they reluctantly will let you spare 2 minutes to hydrate yourself. Your first week they will send you home about halfway through your shift due to the heavy amount of work in order to get you accustomed to it. After that, if the manager"
bad,"FedEx isn’t what they promise you, I was promised and told we were paid salary so they will make stay from 3 to 6 just to do a 6 o’clock pick up but won’t pay more, but when you cal off for being sick the minus that day from “salary” but only for certain employees."
bad,"Job is stressful, Management is not good. Only get 4 hours weekly and other workers do not show up for work. However you get paid every Friday but can not grow in the company."
bad,"Its has fast days or slow."
bad,It was too Hot to work here. They need to pay more for working under those extreme weather conditions. Im surprised I been there as long as I was. This is a job for Men and only Men.
bad,"When you sign up to work for this company, you sign your right away.They can do what ever they want to you.They bought every lawyer in this country.You can't sue them.So here's my advice find a good company to work for.They offer you all these benfits at what cost. And they treated me the same way.This company praises lazy people.If your a good worker,your out of luck.And don't report any misconduct or your going to get fired.This company make money hand over foot. And doesn't even care about there employee's.You get a 3 percent raise a year. They jack the medical up so high you can't afford the premiums or the copays.Stop praising this company. Find yourself another place to work at. Maybe they will treat you better."
bad,Over worked  the paid was always incorrect they change u every other day to a different location they suck  I don’t know how they still in business cause I would not work there or tell anybody to apply to e
bad,"Horrible, back breaking work. You will have no life. As soon as you get home (whenever that is) you will be too tired to do anything and you will need more sleep than normal to do this job. Every day is random"
bad,"Very bad communication skills and terrible training. Very poorly managed no one cares about efficiency, the routes are all disorganized there are millions of dollars being wasted in inefficiencies and employees taking advantage of the company and not being held accountable for vehicle damage and maintenance etc."
bad,Worst place i have ever worked. Its a toxic work place with horrible management. I wouldn't want my worst enemy to work there. Christmas rush is insane..run!
bad,i have been there for 4 years and i was the best worker there. they worked me hard to the point my body hurt all the time and the pay was not worth it. the management sucks and treat you any kind of way.
bad,"Don't be fooled by the copied & pasted job description. The real job title should be Dispatch Receptionist. You will only perform a few tasks at Santa Clara, CA, all of which are ridiculous, & a waste of time. Your main repetitive task will be calling customers to schedule a delivery appointment. Most of the customers are awful, & will yell & scream for what time they want you to deliver, and your job is to only offer 5 hour windows. When they ask to speak to a manager, the pathetic creepy manager Edward will pretend he cannot hear you, even though you will be sitting 2 feet away from him. Then when he knows he can't ignore you any longer he will cowardly give in to the time the customer asks for. The dispatch supervisor will do exactly the same as the manager. But this is your job, to keep the supervisors/managers from working, and to defend an awful company. Your other main task will be giving ETA's, and apologizing to irate customers. This job is always in demand for FedEx Freight, because once workers are exposed to their true role, they leave. The supervisors, and managers make jokes, & talk poorly about all of the past workers in this role, because there are so many; actually they talk about every worker poorly. The managers, & supervisors also talk about the few women who work here like the creepy 55+ year old virgins they are, and salivate as they stare at them, I wish I was exaggerating. The managers & supervisors are rude, & speak to employees with complete disrespect, daily."
bad,"Will work you to death "
bad,"I was working for  B. A Honeycutt Trucking. "
bad,Works you like a slave no time for your self always ways on the move no lunch break over worked management is crape so long the box's are derived they don't care about that
bad,"I used to like working here. But now its gotten so bad that even HR don't know how to handle some of the staff. If you wish to go back to the stone age where you are harassed by other members of staff and bullied ,shouted at , sworn at on a daily basis .Then please apply, in return you will receive discount on shipping but you will find it almost impossible to sign up .A certificate dumped on your desk for 5 and 10 years service.Free uniform. Limited resources ,faulty equipment. I've struggled on for many years thinking i could improve the workplace but i'm tired and i have had more abuse than the police on match day."
bad,"We received a package yesterday and today . Earlier the guy delivering,  didn't ring and showed customer not available , when I was at home ! Next day after us following up,  the guy came back and just after 2 rings , he cut the call and said customer not available! My husband had to call him again asking to ring back ."
bad,Driver for a contractor. All are shady. On armstrong road. Nothing is organized. Start 2am finish around 4pm (illegal) 14 stops a day in ny or nj. For $150 a day salary and 1099. Dot pulls in ghe trucks all the time. Contractors are - prosper auto m&m 1220 trucking . they dont care about you and fedex personel are ignorant fat lazy idiots that do nothing but complain. I hate fedex.
bad,"Fedex custom critical! Could care less about its drivers. Your best bet is to stay away from this company no benefits, no consideration for good drivers slowly sucking the life out of you."
bad,"I was injured and not compensated at all. Also with me being injured they had me come in the next day and tape boxes with one arm. I had a severe shoulder injury and due to doctors instructions I was not supposed to move that arm until healed. Now I have neck, shoulder, and upper back problems."
bad,"I recently was working for FedEx and the experience working there was horrible.  FedEx does not care for their employees at all, all they care about is the packages and dont care if you out there super late or the weather conditions. Customers make the job even worse because they always complaining,  is hard to find houses because most customers dont have their house numbers visible, if you out there struggling the manager wont send anyone to help,  the contractors are money hungry and will continue to give you more work than you can handle to benefit them and they dont respect their drivers at all. Horrible experience I will never work for them again."
bad,"No orientation managers or bosses don't have time for that. They hire all the time because people are quitting all the time. They promise you a route that you can manage and run at a comfortable pace and stop for lunch then they through you in with a driver that drives like a idiot tailgating, blowing the horn at people, yelling, hitting speedbumps at top speeds, because all they care about is getting the packages delivered at top speed because it is all about the money. You sit in a jumpseat and hang on so you don't fly out of the vehicle because they drive, stop, turn corners, at top speeds. Good luck trying to eat or hold onto anything while being flung around the vehicle. If you talk to management they don't care at all. And the security you have to go through everyday in the morning and evening just to get in and out of your job is ridiculous. Alot of the Fed Ex jobs you can not even place a review on indeed about and I notice my review keeps getting taken off of her every day. They moniter and watch the site because management has mentioned things they saw on indeed reviews that quickly vanish. If you like stress, aggravation and being lied to and forced to work like a idiot then this is the place for you. But if not avoid this place at all cost."
bad,I left because I had relocated and quite frankly blew my knee out..i asked them to mail my checks they assured me it would be mailed on the 6th they didnt come. I called found out they did not mail out till. The 11th I called the fedex employeel line found out it tajes them up to 7 days to get a response from them Its now the 18th and I just find out after calling payroll I have. to wait another 7days because the bank wwants to make sure they havent been cashed. This is so typical.
bad,"FedEx Ground is a terrible company to work for you may want to do you research on them before you apply to them. For the work their employees/drivers do there's no reason they shouldn't offer their employees benefits, overtime, 401k, or at least a small benefit plan. Someone in corporate should really consider making sure that everyone is taken care of and not just the contractors. I had to leave the company because contractors started shortening my checks and making excuses for why they couldn't pay me for work that had already been done. That's completely unacceptable and very unorganized company from a big name company like this."
bad,Didn't really like the environment. It was already loud then you have the manager yelling at you to do something that you're already doing. I'm sure the manager knew none of our names he would just yell AYY YOO and we had to guess who he was talking to.
bad,"The two years i spent here at fedex it was an experience but i truly wouldn't recommend it. i worked for a contractor and got paid 1 dollar per packaged delivered not paid time off, no paid lunch, no benefits and long hours. you have to load your own trucks and not get paid the time you load them. you don't actually work for fedex you work for a fedex contractor. so every contractor is different my experience wasn't pleasant, but i was a great stepping stone onto a better paying delivery job."
bad,They just put you somewhere and don't train you. This job isn't good and the pay isn't worth some of the dangerous risks. They will take advantage of your work.
bad,"Management does not help you or assist you in any way when you have issues that need to be addressed. The HR department does not support supervisors when they need help with their employees. But most importantly, they fire people for reasons that make no sense. They fire people who try to change the organization for the better, and choose the opinion of outsiders over their own employees. I would recommend no one to work here, as you will either leave after a short amount of time, or get fired."
bad,Was told I would be a permanent team member only to get moved to another contracter that didn't regard my safety. Plus was never given benefits and when moved it was like I was a new hire all over again.
bad,Worse place I have worked at broke my finger and they told me to suck it up got cut and had to go get bandages my self hurt shoulder and still haven't paid for that but makes everyone else out to be the bad guys they claim you won't lift over 75 lbs. Bs I've had stuff to go on a home delivery truck that weight of 150+ and they don't care about your body or if you get hurt suck it up and keep going
bad,"Lied to from the beginning of the interview, was told I was being hired at peak season only to find out I'm only guarantees 17 hours a week if you complain they wouldn't even give you an hour and a half worth of work. Very vindictive and Senior workers some of them not all who are low-key racist."
bad,"I worked all day with no help, I worked picking up heavy boxes and no one ever cared how the day went only work work and thats it and no days off. I dont recommend"
bad,"Delivery Driver Load and unload packages quickly and efficiently. Prepare for delivery, and organize packages by scanning them in and sorting them out. Move products and materials by hand or with basic material handling equipment. Safely handle fragile, dangerous, and/or hazardous product"
bad,"A typical day at work: break your back and no more pay that you already make no yearly rise or anything,"
bad,"I worked for 1 week, 50 hours in 4 days. I haven't worked since late September so I went from doing nothing to nonstop lifting stuff & being gone 12 hour days. Of course I was going to be dire & exhausted but I kept going. I twisted my back but was fine to go in but the boss told my trainer to just drop me off at my car without ever talking to me. I went to the Drs to make sure it was just that I was out of shape & got a Drs note to return a day later. I called/text my boss to make sure I was all good to go back & he said he would call me back & he never did. His wife was the person who hired me but she works for a company that handles the hiring. I had to call/text her to get told ""this isn't working out"" no explanation nothing. The BOSS couldn't even talk to me when I had him on the phone, he told me he would call me back & I waited hours before texten his wife who is not an employee of FedEx & she told me. I worked close to 50 hours got paid for 42 & 1$ less than i was told."
bad,hard to make a living working here fast pace they want freight done by a before drivers got in you unloaded and loaded trucks then clean the building up
bad,"Should've never came here!!!! But we all make mistakes, live and learn and then move on. The place just  sucks. If you got no experience good place to start but don't make it your only place."
bad,FEd Ex was a very stressful job due to management. Once you learn your route it becomes easy peasy. Management was late with checks weekly also would change your schedule to accommodate his personal life and said deal with it or quit.
bad,they worked you and treated you like dogs pay was good but the hours were not management was not helpful nor were they understanding about any situations they worked you nonstop without brakes and treated you like an animal there.
bad,Not worth it to waste your time cost more then u make cant pay Bill's on suck little pay. To many chiefs not enuff Indians lots of lazy people just skating thought wont money but don't wont to work for it.
bad,"Only cared about making money. Not about the employees. There was a time I was THROWING UP, I went to get some water, and was told to get back to work."
bad,"The driver of one of the delivery trucks killed my nephew while he was walking in the bike lane on Freedom Drive, Charlotte, NC.  I have nothing good to say about FedEx"
bad,This place Is like a zoo very unorganized  drivers treated  unfairly almost like slaves no Benefit at all paid less than minimum wages  no job security whatsoever
bad,"Management is very poor, if they even bother to show up for work. Co workers are rude and conceited. Hardly any hours to go around. Extremely lazy staff!"
bad,This environment was not good.  It is stressful and demanding with no regard to the employee.  They push you to work in extreme conditions and penalize if you are injured due to those conditions.
bad,Fedex would be ok if u could work at least 40 ho4or more but u only work 4 to 5 hours a day not enough for living arrangements so i had to leave there as soon as possible
bad,"not recommended, management had no disregard for others and there well being, pay was consistent but not enough to live on lunch breaks are not paid for and job security is very low"
bad,Had to deliver what was on your delivery. Some places were very difficult to locate since they were on rural routes and delivery during the late evenings made it more difficult.
bad,I was responsible for filling large trucks full of boxes intended for delivery. The boxes weighed up to 100lbs. The job was not easy and I did not have a pleasant experience.
bad,"Job security"
bad,"A typical day starts at 1 or 2 in the afternoon, and goes until 6pm at the latest. The warehouse is run at a blistering speed, and most days workers are unable to keep up with the high volume of freight coming in. "
bad,Never had a chance to succeed. I was constantly on the road with little to no training for the environment I was working at. They trained me in Pheonix for their city but its totally different in the rural areas.
bad,"The management doesn't assist you, or bring you assistance in the form of other workers or helpers. Its a Dog-Eat-Dog world in there. Survival of the fittest, and if you are not friends with your managers they will throw you under the bus and help out their friends. Very stressful place for introverts and people who like to just do their job and go home. The most enjoyable part of the day was going home."
bad,"If you like a deep dive job then this is the position for you. If you like constant stress then this is the perfect position. "
bad,your management suck that is why your going to keep losing people cannot treat people without respect and expect to get it so that is that and I want nothing to do with this company
bad,They have no structure when it comes to training and work distribution. They do provide health benefits but are not well educated on mental health. The management has difficulties in utilizing problem solving skills when faced with situations that need to be handle in a safe and efficient manner.
bad,management was very disrespectful in the new castle Delaware branch the hours are all over the place pay suck barely reach 200 dollars before peak....
bad,"very very tribal, training was horrific. if your not family you are not made to be welcomed. cyber stalking, phone harassment and always belittled because of an accent. poor performance reviews if your not related. threats of physical harm"
bad,"i was placed in trucks and boxes flowed into the truck never received any help even when i was still in training, mangers only care about them selves and it was just a bad work environment"
bad,"terribly sedentary position with no room to grow, horrible compensation for the time that workers put into the job, contractors that own the routes are greedy and do not care about or invest in their drivers whatsoever"
bad,the location worked at was a dirty dusty grimy place filthy disgusting place. the water filters on the docks water machines not replaced like they should be.
bad,Management doesn't care about their employees. They'd rather line their pockets than to put money into the safety of vehicles. You're screwed if you have a flat!
bad,Worst mistake was applying working 12 hrs days and only getting paid for 8hrs pick ups  no benefits no vacation pay long long long long long long hours Brooklyn home delivery is very unprofessional
bad,They treat you like a farm animal.  They expect you to go and go and go and don't care if you need a water break or rest in between shifts.  Management is horrible. No one knows what the other is doing.  The managers there are uneducated and they have no idea what they are doing.  There is no way to advance unless you are either 1. sleeping with a manager or 2. a yes man.  And I refuse to do either.  The worst place I have ever worked.
bad,"I did not like Fedex at all it was hard, hot, fast , and stressful. there was too much going on and everything was way too heavy and it was really hard on my mental health."
bad,"Fed ex is by far the worst place i could have ever worked at. "
bad,The management treat you like you are nobody for a couple of days that I was with the company I reserved nothing but attitudes the gate captain team leader will tell you something and when the management come to you real reverse on you to make you look bad like that you ain't doing your job real messed up company I worked at for a car company before I went there and I would never work for a company like that again in my life
bad,"Hard work through out the day, very long hours on the road. the management was not accepting of ethnicity which made the job very hard to achieve my best"
bad,"This could be a very good job. FedEx puts a slogan called the ""purple promise"" management makes it impossible to perform this promise and its sad. Management doesn't recognize jobs well done. There was a revolving door or excellent drivers they drove out catering to old unproductive drivers. Definitely need a Teamsters Union to protect and negotiate for these poor men and women but they threaten to fire you if they catch you talking about unity with a Union."
bad,this is a company that does not understand how to manage its driver as independent contractors. As an agent it was stressful and management did not know how to communicate the issues we faced daily to the client FED EX
bad,"Fluctuating start times, one will never know their schedule more than 24 hours in advance. No set dismissal time; not off until work is completed. Generally no breaks, even on shifts exceeding 8 hours. No sick days. Minimal vacation. Penalties for illness, injury, or non work-related emergencies. Terrible climate conditions; extreme heat in summer and extreme cold in winter. Outdated and often broken equipment with company refusal to replace/upgrade. Low chance of actually getting to use earned vacation time. Lack of holidays. Lack of cleanliness or proper sanitation."
bad,"It was a good job, I loved the environment.  The people there are awesome, especially management.  However this job doesn't pay enough and it doesn't provide you with enough hours to work."
bad,very tough on your body. must be ready to be fit to work in this environment when its cold its super cold inside and when its hot its hotter inside. easy to get sick
bad,"Unloading and loading FedEx trucks are not easy,you have to extend your speed to keep up,you also have to stack the boxes right so they don't fall. This company is good to work for if you just want part time work or your a student,the hours at this job are very short not enough for me."
bad,Fedex was a poorly run company. Fedex uses contractors as driver this allows fedex to keep all the profits and pays the driver very little. Fedex kills managers
bad,"I liked doing my job. The men were cutthroat. The environment sucked. It was a part time job. Sometimes i was there for the full 4 hours sometimes, not."
bad,I hate my job. A lot of drama . Easy for people to get fired.  Management is a joke. No management on weekends.  Over working employees. Unrealistic expectations and goals
bad,"I worked from 3am until around 8:30am (when I was hired I was told it would be typically 4 hour shifts from about 4am-8am). It was an absolute sweatshop, where they work you as hard as they can. Management did not care about individuals, only the goals they were suppose to meet. Management was also extremely poor, as they were often the opposite of efficient, and had no clue how to properly run the warehouse. Example: I loaded 3 trucks and averaged a total of 450 packages a day. However, one day on the report, it said that one of my trucks was going to have 900 packages by itself. Managements response was, ""Good luck, do the best you can."" Hands down, not even close, the worst jon I have ever and will ever have!"
bad,"Typical day in day out pays well benefits are pretty good, Company cares little for its employees. Not much room for growth once in a high paying position. No employee recognition or incentives."
bad,I was fired after a heavy packaged fell on my back effectively crippling me. The doctors they sent me to only made things worse and then the FedEx doctor lies on a report about me.
bad,"Real hard working place that gets very hot at times, the hourly pay was decent. the managers were some what professional and was very difficult to go for a higher position"
bad,The people are not friendly. They don't care if you need help or not. They are very selfish. They don't have benefits. They expect for you to work hard and receive no raise.
bad,"Worked to many hours over 40 a week and never got paid for them.Arrived at work at 7am, wasn't allowed to punch in til 830ish when I left the hub, after I straightened my truck out for a hour and a .half. They over work their drivers and try and follow DOT time rules."
bad,No team work no care about anybody but there selves long long horrible days no family life no sick days no insurance and dont have a family emergency because it's not there problem.
bad,"If it’s one thing they do is lie, so be prepared for that. They aren’t paying fairly for all the work that we have to do. They don’t place  enough people on shift to get the work done appropriately. And most of the packages say team lift and they want you to break your back lifting it all by yourself. They don’t offer benefits until after 1000 hours which will take you more than a year to get because they barely have you working 4 hours a day if even. Management was a joke. It’s sad when none of the employees like the manager that makes it become a hostile environment. For me it was a hostile environment because I hate when I’m working and they are calling me here there and everywhere and if it gets slow they don’t even let you drink water they just want you to working. And they lie and say that you will have a break but you don’t ."
bad,"Seems like we switch new managers every year, and the manager I had before I resigned didn't care if I had a shoulder injury. He wanted me to keep working on the load side. He didn't care about me having back pains after my car accident. He didn't suggest any light duty work for me. He told me to just fill out for FMLA because the smalls area was ""full of people with accomodations"" when most of them people in that area finessing them so good."
bad,"Back breaking labor. No breaks. No advancement options. They do not treat you as “family” as they will tell you at orientation. Hours are not constant, or steady."
bad,Not fun part time work sweat in the summer loading the trucks no air conditioning freeze in the winter not much heat no benefit because you work part-time it sucks
bad,I didn’t enjoy fed ex they took advantage of my hours and pay it was harsh environments and I was only working 3hours a night I got paid more at McDonald’s
bad,bad place to work the boss talked so low you couldnt hear her and would yell at you if you did something wrong they dont train you for anything bad place to work but i didnt have no othe place to go at the time
bad,If you're looking to be over worked by lazy mangers this would be the place to work honestly it feels like an high school environment I can't take this place seriously
bad,I’m sure anybody with a clean background but other than it’s a ugly job for a person who don’t like to sweat and go crazy with a short amount of time it’s crazy
bad,Wouldn’t recommend these people are clearly racist trust me it’s not righteous there so think before you fill an application out they’re really cut throat to minorities
bad,"Ground being all contractors, there are good ones and there are bad ones. I got the bad one to work for. Individual unable to sustain my route after I was injured and route was taken from him and split, then given to another contractor."
bad,"hot and muggy days"
bad,everything was horrible form the trainer to employees nobody helps you when you are struggling with extremely heavy packages and you feel hopeless and defeated.
bad,"its just a job and you get paid but you have to be ready to do a lot and get a almost fair pay,because customers are in rush and rude and when they come to self service they think you should help them just because they paying a penny"
bad,The manager was erratic.  She had emotional outburst in the workplace.  She accepted gratuities from customers.  She showed outward sexual interest with customers.
bad,good easy going job. go in at whatever time you want and check boxes in and put in the company vehicle to deliver. very easy going and layback enviroment.
bad,Not a great company.  Virtually NO HR... you have no clue on your benefits...  been with company 6 months now and still have not received any benefits package.  You are suppose to have coverage after 3 months... lol.  The turn over is so high that corporate can't handle new hires.  Benefits are NOT like they use to... fyi.
bad,the new management team is racists they have their favs and the white people are always right the supervisor is sleeping with his employees so they never do no wrong
bad,You will get 20-25 hrs per week never knowing your schedule until the morning of.   You will work 8 hrs monday and 3 or 5 hours tuesday-thursday. If you are a hard worker its frustrating to watch others stand around and stare off while you literally do 3 peoples jobs for them. Not fair with the culture of the people who work there.  If you are a hard worker you will never move up only 2 supervisors during the days. Management only has 4 managers on the floor for 200 people so dont expect to be heard. I worked there for a few months and was so over it. Wished i wouldve just kept looking for something else rather than put myself through that.
bad,"Looking for a new and exciting career, meeting people from all around the world and visiting some of the most amazing destinations that the United States"
bad,My typical day there is stressful at times. It's very hot&the work is getting harder&harder. I need a change. The culture&Management is horrible. There's nothing enjoyable about this job. This is all I'm going to say about this job.
bad,"The work environment is extremely stressful and the manager I work with does not care about any injuries I sustained, (which have been many). I do not recommend anyone work at FedEx."
bad,Fed Ex does not care about its employees unless they are in danger of dying. The managers lie about advancement opportunities when the truth is that it takes 5+ years just to advance to each step and then you have to be friends with upper management (not a hard/competent worker) to be considered. I would never recommend anyone to work there.
bad,"the job is a fast pace job.  you have to be able to follow directions, but at times have to be the one to make last minute decisions, especially when in route to a location.  The people are friend and nice to work with.  Management is always trying to work with you on days that you need off."
bad,"none d ont like this company, no benefits, make you work hard and do not pay as you work, you pay your uniform, work on holidays, weekends,cold weather,rain day,etc,and heavy boxes with no help"
bad,"Management is unfair, discriminate against educated women.  Grab female employees.  Harass older employees and find stupid reasons to fire them.  Nasty and arrogant"
bad,"This job is nothing but modern day slavery, but by choice i should add. To them you are just another body to lift those heavy boxes. They dont care if they are understaffed they will just crack the whip and tell you work harder."
bad,"a typical work day would include you working non-stop for 4 hours with work never being completed.  this was a slave camp, with cut-throat people.  management was no better."
bad,"They will work you to death, but the team members are the BEST, not management. Not a bad place if you are willing to work hard. Hours are great, but there are no advancement, and I mead none at all."
bad,"This was a difficult job because I was hired with the understanding that I would be working a swing shift and would get home about 10 pm.  After I was hired, I was told I would have to work a graveyard shift instead and that it would be temporary.  After working the graveyard shift, my body could not handle staying awake in my college classes, so I left the company."
bad,"The worst place I've ever worked , I work as full time but after 2 months we cut the hours of work , Health insurance is carisimo and covers almost nothing"
bad,"I started driving for Fedex Custom Critical at a time when I had no home to call my own and only a class A cdl in my pocket, hoping to save up enough money to get an apartment. "
bad,I wouldn't recommend working here to anyone! Especially the biggest hub in Maryland! They don't pay you your paid time off like they're supposed too. My check was always messed up! They guarantee you all these hours & then you get hired & your lucky of you work 3 full hours a day... Stay away
bad,"Honestly, I enjoyed working for the company, I just needed more hours and the company would like to have part-time employees rather than hiring full-time.Its business saves more the company."
bad,no idea i just wanna get my resume online . fedex was easyfor me cause i am young but htey do not offer good hours.. .you spend more time trying to get ready to park and get to work than the hours you actually work.
bad,Have to unload the packages from the truck and the vans to the moving belt. Sort the big boxes to the smallest boxes. The peak season workload were the longest time and the hardest days to work.
bad,it was an ok place to work. had a lot to do during the day. fast place to move around. bosses always wanted something more done during the day then what I was working on .
bad,"Low pay and high stress. Working in a FedEx warehouse pays minimum wage for hard work, no benefits and incompetent management. "
bad,FedEx is the very last company and place of employment that I would ever recommend to any of my freinds and family. Overall FedEx is the worst company I've ever worked for and I don't advise anyone to pursue a career with them.
bad,FedEx is not a good place to work. I was over worked an underpaid. The management is poor and rude. They are not understanding to your outside problems.
bad,The package is more important than the person. They will send you out in the worst of weather regardless of road conditions. Your start time is always changing and you never know what time you will finish. Stay away from this company if you have a CDL.
bad,"I would honestly say this job is very stressful you have managers and employees who think they can talk to you any type of way..Working around the planes are dangerous people are cruel for no reason,Managers yell at you and talk to you like you are dumb and treat you as if you are beneath them and this job is hard on your body."
bad,"The work place is annoying, the guys are dh and FedEx ground is the worst. The drivers should get paid more because the work isn't really complex but having to deal with heavy packages over 130lb are the worst"
bad,"Do you value your health? Well, if so then FedEx isn't for you. "
bad,well back breaking job with know benifts to show for it. Fast paste and dengerus loiading trucks in the time witch I thought was slavery. It was a  lousy job
bad,"The was no organization, no benefits, no paid overtime but they want to you to work over but with out overtime pay which is illegal. It was a very unprofessional atmosphere."
bad,"FedEx used to be a people first company. That changed over the last 21 years.  Corporate America has changed in regards to FedEx, they don't take care of their Senior employees."
bad,Okay very stressful especially during Xmas season. If you get hurt they really don't care. But it put's food on the table so I'll take anything I can to pay some bills.
bad,You’re put on Salary by a Contractor and no matter what time you get you’re route done the pay is the same. I was given a busy route and pay sometimes worked out to $6.00 an hour.
bad,"I like working there it only no raise or advancement "
bad,"Stressful environment and everything is based on how friendly you are to the managers, If they happen to not like you then you usually get blamed for everything. Sometimes the expect you to work like slaves but when they had people come and look at the place they would send un-loaders throughout the building to help loaders and they ""puppy dog"" the process but when the visitors leave its back to slavery like working conditions."
bad,"Would not recommend to anyone. Horrible mentality towards staff, and no enjoyment in the role. The building that we work in, is old, broken, and the heating does not work. "
bad,"Load / Unload trucks delivery at my own pace to customers, skin every package organize where packages are to found at a fast delivery to assure customers are happy with deliveries"
bad,Had to live in a truck 24 - 7. Not fun at all. living in a truck really is not mine cup of tea. You have to eat on the run and sleep when the schedule lets you so you could end up driving when you are sleepy.
bad,poor management everything was completely disorganized and theyve given me less hours below the part time limit . My pay check every week was very small.
bad,"The people at FedEx are like working zombies who just come to work then go home.  FedEx employees are extremely rude.  They drive the tubs like maniacs without blowing there horn and they don't stop.  The management is extremely poor and they are very neglectful towards the safety of employees.  They treat employees like 3rd class citizens with know rights because of overwhelming favoritism.  The write up the employees every time the hurt their hands, lower back, or foot."
bad,There is a high rate of turn over among package handlers due to fast pace to meet package quotas. No benefits and FedEx takes great pride in being non-union.
bad,started off as a great place to work. but didn't end that way. They have great benefits but there was no room for job advancement. I worked there for 10 years.
bad,They work you till you are ready to fall over. They don't train you have to figure it out yourself. People you work with can barely understand English.
bad,"It's the worst job ever,I don't recommend it to anyone, management are not helpful and they don't care about employees."
bad,"The level of nepotism is outrageous everyone that works there is family or a close friend to the family, there is absolutely no privacy or professionalism."
bad,I thank FedEx can do stuff differently it seems like they have favoritism with employees. They don't treat everyone the same. But overall it's a eazy fast going job.
bad,very poor managers that make it a hostile work environment to be employed. No rewards for being an exceptional worker except more work piled on you while company favorites stand around.
bad,high and fast paste very intense work environment it was to stressful  over all didn't really like working there. especially during the holiday seasion
bad,"I was considered a swing driver due to my versatility and adaptability which meant I would drive for every contractor in the terminal. I would never have the same route which obviously became quite exhausting especially when I lived 50 miles away from the terminal. FedEx Corporate takes complete advantage of the private contractors and more especially the drivers. You will not get any benefits, no bonuses, no time off, no respect and FedEx management will treat you as if you are a criminal and low class."
bad,"no break, just didnt like it, worked you hard. horrible  job. Management was fair. pay is good , just less hours. Hardest part about fedex was liting Erays"
bad,"Drivers get punished for everything, late trucks it our fault, misloads our fault,truck breaks our fault ,nobody takes accountability for they wrongs."
bad,sup are very poor untrained rules not enforced no break time  all ways under pressure bad or junk fork lifts working in zero degree no heat untrained work staff
bad,"Had to find something different.. not my type of work.. manager was not very manageable, not a lot of hours given, very hard to become full-time they want you to over work yourself."
bad,"Worst company I have ever worked for!!!!! Management is very poor, had no backbone!!! Has no idea how to do any part of there job.  Will turn on you every single time they get a chance"
bad,Great people to work with. If you are looking for a job to get by I would recommend it. There is alot of people who have been around for years but some of them just ended up being stuck there.
bad,Not good not able to get off when needed driving semi P& D was ok for time off.But was part time and temp.during Dec peak only. Was not able to get full time at P& D
bad,"That place was so disrespectful and rude , ... I have honestly nothing nice to say .they wanted you to unload / load a truck by yourself they only put someone in there unless you get back up that was the only time . I felt like if you a woman you should have had some one in there with you overall that was not the place for me .. "
bad,The job was not union the owners were all for them self they lied saying the job was as long as you wanted it to go like for ever as I thoug Christmas Day called me and said they discontinued my route and no longer needed me .
bad,"I worked here for a little while and I hated every minute of it. The management was terrible, constantly on our backs, there  said was no room to grow within the company whatsoever. The place was extremely dusty and everyone was to themselves. If you need help with anything, you're better off doing it wrong and being yelled at than to ask for help and never get it."
bad,The job encompasses working over the road with Fed Ex Custom Critical. Pick up and deliveries to multiple locations. System is set up through sending load information through qualcoom.
bad,"Distinguishing between what lie or who to lie to is the character of Fed Ex in Casper WY. Especially targeted women when the rest of employees were pre-occupied."
bad,"Management is terrible.There is no accountability, no team meetings, lack of communication overall, poor team leads, gossip, poor leadership, poor idea implementation, and leadership isn't open to any criticism. The most enjoyable part of the job is going home."
bad,"This place is terrible! the only labor job working for a monster company and has no vacation, no paid holiday,  no benefits and the managers don't care about anything until it reflects on them."
bad,it  was not a good job for hours. I didn't like it at all it was a waste of my time they  was underpaying us and have the trucks  be late and I was not happy with the job.i worked there 10 months
bad,A typical day at fed ex was very hard a lot of heavy duty. they are not family friendly to single parents I learned that if you have to be flexible the workplace is not suitable for the
bad,They do not appreciate the people they do not appreciate the people they have they take everybody for granted expect you to go beyond what you can do the brakes in the lunches you only get two a 10 minute and a 30 minute that's all you get in a day and you work 10-hour shifts
bad,Poor management. Their was no training. Went to the orientation and change the schedule at what time you are suppose to work. They lie about what days you be working. They don’t communicate with you at all.  Waste of time.
bad,fedex was a fast paced job that i didn't mind. The environment there was great i loved all the people everyone was treated fairly and help was given when needed. The competition was amazing and pushed everyone to be better and move up in the industry
bad,"scan packages before you leave the building, load in truck ,get map of area i would deliver,then fuel up trucks and start my day delivering fedex home delivery packages , managment would pressure you to get out of building as soon as you can. workplace culture was fast paced ,the hardest part of the job was not knowing if i was going to work everyday,the most enjoyable part was getting all packages deliverd."
bad,"worked in the warehouse and wow, definitely not worth working there. it might be different being a delivery driver but other than that, i do not recommend"
bad,"Wasted 8 years of my life. The contractors only care about making money, and paying the drivers a salary, which ends up make for long days. No insurance, 401k, short term disability, or overtime."
bad,Very poor training and management. The supervisors were always rude. We were given very little time for breaks. The other employees do not follow the rules and there is a lot of favoritism that goes on.
bad,"terrible job, would not recommend anyone. There is no appreciation at all in the job and your treated as if you are just another machine. It is not a very good job especially considering the wages for the job performed."
bad,I wouldn't work here ever again i felt so low working here. Thank you for your services but working there big no no. No benefits. I got sick and didn't have coverage.
bad,"Not a place that I would recommend to anyone.  No benefits and the Managers are not friendly.  The better you are at your job, the meaner they are to you."
bad,I like the physical part of the job. But the job sucked for the most part. We only got 15 minute lunches doing peek season. The supervisor always scream at people to move faster. People passed out all the time.
bad,It was either too hot or too cold in the building depending on the temperature outside. I learned to use a RF gun the enjoyable part of working here was going on my breaks.
bad,"load trucks, unload trucks, sort packages and work on top of the belts to make sure packages are going to the right places. also scan packages as they come down the belt."
bad,"The work experience was awful. I was lied to, I was humiliated, they gave poor safety guidelines. Over worked us, overly push out of our limits in hot hot temperatures with only water provided by self, no reliable fanning in heat temperatures of 109•or more, bullied, they had favoritisms. It was the most worst experience ever."
bad,Had to load/ unload simi trailers and scan packages to right schute to keep everything organized . Supervisors are relentless in speed and is never satisfied with how fast you're going and will stand and watch you without offering a hand.
bad,I really hated this job.  I was always expected to do more even though the right materials needed to do my job were NEVER provided.  I was SO happy to leave that I jumped ship as soon as the opportunity presented itself.
bad,"If you are working under contracting guy, and if their guy did not came that their load will add on to your load, and depend on the demand sometimes they will give you way."
bad,"The store I worked at the manager had no management or people skills. It was a very stressful and angry atmosphere. The pay was not comparable to the job expected. There is no training, you have to learn the job by yourself. Schedules are changed constantly and employees are sent to other stores."
bad,"The pay is good the hours suck I would not recommend this job if your a woman "
bad,be prepared to work hard for nothing and little to no pay. FedEx was fine until the pay wasn't matching the type of work that is performed. honestly if you need a correctional job to get you to realize that anything else is better then this job than fedex is the job for you.
bad,"The company did not meet expectations nor hold up to it's great reputation. Although there are and has been many job posted for the company, they are always given to friends of management which leave  great and highly qualified individuals at a disadvantage. This is possibly the worst job ever."
bad,the company and people could have been more understanding and can talk with us and be more understanding and commuciate with us and let us know whats going and and not be in the dark with us.
bad,They make poor business decisions. No work life balance. Would never work for this company again. Have hidden Agendas and close minded.  They  work you long hours and have people in leadership that are not qualified for the job.
bad,It's a fast paced environment!! Most days we don't get out of the terminal until 9:30 or 10 o'clock! There are no benefits for the Drivers because we are considered contractor's!
bad,it was a horrible place to work just very physical lots of lifting and bending managers were really rude the hardest part was having no one there with you to help you grab 100lb boxes from the conveyer belt and loading it into the truck!
bad,"They lie, they discriminate when you get done with your route you have to go help other people do theirs and you don't get paid for it. You don't advance. I will never work for these subcontractors again."
bad,It can be a good job. Always on your feet moving quickly. Have to know how to pace yourself. It can be fun. You have lots and lots of freedom which is good.
bad,"Responsible for physical loading, unloading, and sorting of packages in a safe and efficient manner. Maintained schedules, organization, and promoted teamwork."
bad,"I was not told off all the stresses of the job, including dog attacks, gun wielding customers, unforgiving FedEx corporation bigwig's and not to mention the weekly...weekly! mechanical problems."
bad,all the mangers in Natick FedEx suck don't come work there. all they is talk down to you. all them need to a class and how to manger. if you call HR the call get bounds back and nothing get  gets done. because the senor manger does nor want to do anything about it. the say there is a open door.  there's not open doors its a close door
bad,"FedEx Does not care about employees, or customers. Fedexs treats their employees like dirt, harass them over not hitting  bill count each hour, because the freight is just shoved into trailers and not properly taken care of. FedEx does not care one bit about their customers, or their freight that is shipped out on them."
bad,"Working at FedEx World Hub as a material handler was the WORST job I have ever had the misfortune of having. You are treated like a slave, only difference is you get paid to be belittled and worked to the bone. Some days I would come home and could barely walk but was always being told I wasn't ""hitting my numbers"". The goal was to scan 425 packages an hour, some days I would scan 480 and others I would scan 345. No matter what, I was constantly belittled and degraded by my manager and her boss the Sr. Manager. This company does not treat you like a person you are treated like a cog in a corporate machine and they could care less if you get injured or even die while you're on the job. I was harassed by multiple employees at this job, because I was the minority there, and if I dared stand up for myself I was written up. The final straw was a male employee sexually harassing me and cyber stalking me on Facebook. I ""made a scene"" at work telling him to leave me alone and I was fired. My so called manager even got in on the gossip and the harassment because the individual was related to her, completely unprofessional. There are no advancement opportunities at this company unless you're related to someone who can help you advance or you're willing to sleep with someone who can help you advance, and I was neither. I now have a permanent injury that I have to live with bc of this job, not to mention the mark on my record. If you value your sanity and your good record, don't work for this company as a material handler."
bad,"only concern was meeting production quotas, no other cosideration for other work ethics or participation"
bad,"As a package handler, working at fed ex was an extremely negative experience. Management was horrifically unprofessional with the gossip, the favoritism and the lack of consideration for hard working employees who are physically putting all of their effort into their jobs. The job was difficult enough, but when you aren't receiving any sort of appreciation and instead are getting belittled and verbally degraded for your performance in front of co workers, it makes the job that much harder. Going to HR for the issues I was experiencing was basically unnecessary since no improvements were made after your complaint.. I really hope improvements are made very soon because I know for a fact I'm not the only employee that feels that way and I am aware of several employees who resigned for these reasons"
bad,this was the worst job i have ever worked. it was so hard to make sales. you would sell overpriced kitchen knives. it was hard because the stuff that you were selling wasnt a need so allot of people didnt want it.
bad,I was a girl and busted my butt day in and day out at that job. They didn't care about me the boss on duty did not like that I was a girl and was working with as he called it the big boys I would not recommend this to any girl!
bad,"A typical day at work is 11 hours, 30 minute lunches, with am email every 15-minutes from leadership telling you to work harder.  Do not expect an 8-hour day or a 60 minute lunch as promised when going through the hiring process. No chance for advancement."
bad,"De plus en plus dur , stressant et fatiguant nerveusement"
bad,From what I hear it still sucks 😂 you have to work 2 shifts if you want to be fulltime. It's always dirty. They over work they employee's till the point you are about to fallout.
bad,"They treat you like you are in boot camp, they have no clue on what there employees need or care ..The worst company I ever worked for and there location sucks to . You have to leave for work an hour early spend most of that time on the eit just trying to get to work smh..."
bad,"This is a stressful and hard place to work. For the amount they pay you, it isn't worth the money. Plus I was only working for 2 hours then they would send me home. Then the give you little to none training. Basically throw you out there and it's hard to catch up on work."
bad,The work was so much fun.  Very physical fast pace.  Low pay and only 2 hours a day of work.  I applied twice for office work but did not get the job. I wanted full time.  I don't think I was treated fairly.
bad,"Unless you are a truck driver, I would not recommend this place for employment. They don't believe in family. You work crazy shifts when convenient for them, and they will not work with you."
bad,"i worked for fedex for over ten years and i saw so much mistreatment of employees including ripping items forcefully from employees hands by management, numerous physical altercations and just a bad overall experience. the amount of stress this job creates is not worth it at all. sometimes employees were kicked out and not allowed to finish the job and then written up the following day for not completing the job. i also experienced strange deductions and edits on my timecard and paycheck. when i inquired and ask to see the deductions, i was met with hostility. would not recommend this job to anyone."
bad,"""Some"" management is allowed to swear at employees  and the employees can't reply without reprisal or termination. Unsafe equipment. Dock is cluttered"
bad,Promoted for doing a great job but as soon as I reached the office no  pay raise but a lot of work within the 5 hours I was suppose to be there terrible place for blacks....
bad,i do not and will never recommend this job to anyone. This job is so unprofessional for the amount of work and the labor done you do not get paid enough. The job itself is not hard but it's a lot of lifting and dirty work. If you are in school this is also not a good job because they claim to work around your school schedule but they don't. I did not enjoy this job at all the managers are lazy and they don't have enough people to get the amount of work done that they want. The office is unprofessional and have horrible attitudes.
bad,typically work day would be a 4 hour shift  loading and unloading boxes i started when i was 18 was there for 6 years no room for growth they over work you and not enough pay great co workers
bad,Not a good place to work at all. Management is terrible and people are not friendly. Supervisor never calls when work is cancelled.
bad,Long nights and early mornings. Manual labor with exposure to weather conditions. great pay with great benefits. Good for full time or part time students.
bad,work 3 hour shift great pay no hours 5 days a week great co workers fast pace warehouse environment loud  cold during the winter need gloves loading trucks
bad,this  was not a good place to work i would recommend this for anybody the supervisors were jerks and very unreasonable with every thing
bad,your not going to employed by FedEx it a contract company and no benefits offered but money can be ok if thats what your looking for but your not working up to anything unless your looking to contract with FedEx on your own
bad,it was alright but didn't have da transportation i needed to get as many hours as i wanted so it just felt like i was working there for no reason 200-300$ a week wasn't cutting it.
bad,Not Enough Opportunity for hours. Have to deal with the elements was the hardest thing other then working over night. Coworkers have bad attitudes and Supervisors are incompetent.
bad,"No leadership not a great place to work."
bad,It was a job . I did not like this job it was to cold and had very very horrible management. FedEx express is the devil. I wish it could have been a better job.
bad,Fedex did not care about drivers or trucks ..management let vans leave with bad tires brakes.will never use FedEx will never work there again
bad,"no cumplen con las prestaciones prometidas en el contrato, el gerente encargado de la estación no ayuda y solamente te da largar para resolver un problema."
bad,Not much room to grow as an employee. Would rather the company offers more hours for employees. This job requires a lot of lifting and movement.
bad,I do not want to speak badly of FedEx especially as big as they are however the management wasn't very friendly. I did my best to keep my head down and focus on my work however there were many instances where people would shout at each other and the manager would sit in the office. The pay wasn't very good and the drive was really far. I don't believe all fedex facilities are like this one.
bad,They never sent my final check in the mail. Its been 3 months since I worked there. Every time i called to inquire about where it was and was told to call payroll who in turn would say the ground hub had it. I finally gave up after 3 months of hassle. This company is awful. Terrible company to work for.
bad,"Asked to move packages far to fast and management's disregard for safety. "
bad,Nice company good employees well organized when it comes to their work environment. You can be very sucessful in their company in many ways
bad,very medium paced job hard work you don't really interact with other people in the place its as you go thing a average day for me at FedEx it was fast paced but didn't get a lot of hours at all
bad,"This is a contracted job!"
bad,decent pay. short breaks and lunch. point system is terrible.  hardest part of the job is trying to figure out someone elses problem without knowing anything about said problem and finding a resolution in minimum time.
bad,"They don't care about your children at all let alone yourself,  it's a lot of favortisum going on,  managers are terrible & treat you like dirt. Big wigs are disrespectful and makes nothing better.  Don't ever get pregnant because they will make you go on a medical leave without pay then displace you."
bad,"Uncomfortable work conditions and pay to work the body into heat exhaustion in the summer. "
bad,"Sadly, FedEx Ground has not lived up to their standards in regard to how people are treated. When workers are talked down to, you don't need any standards for that. In trying to give a fair review I find it difficult to list   any positive aspects of the job and the culture that leaders foster. My advice to would be job seekers: STAY AWAY! Look elsewhere and you'll have peace and joy in your life."
bad,Terrible company to work for. Lazy people. Stupid managers. this place does not support hardworking individuals. It caters to lazy incompetent people. Advancement is hard to achieve here. The starting pay is a slap in the face to anyone who has been there over five years. Oh did I mention you have to park across the interstate and take a bus in. Management is a joke there. There are a few good managers but mostly they are looking for someone to blame their workgroups misfortune on. There is no incentive to be a good worker there. Hardworkers are given more to do and held to a higher standard than the lazy worker while both make the same amount of money. Oh and there is bird feces everywhere.
bad,I worked 3rd shift the hours were terrible full time employee with part time hours. I wouldn't recommend it to another. treat you like a number.
bad,I had to leave that place because there was no way I could live on $8.65/Hr working barely 3 hours a day. The job wasnt worth my time.
bad,"FedEx had good management, nice co-workers, good pay/ benefits, a promote from within mentality. The hardest part of the job was it's physical aspect. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people. I learned a lot about logistics and management."
bad,says it right here it just sucks they treat you like a slave and pay you like one i hated it there you worked 2 hours a day thats it
bad,the expectations and standard of this job were awful. it was good that the job was available when needed but isn't some place you want to stay long term.
bad,I did not enjoy working there. They were giving jobs meant for two people to one person. Not good enough pay and not enough hours. Manager would send you home for even being a minute late. They were laying people off and hiring more people at the same time.
bad,"Waking up out of my bed to be at a job where management was unprofessional, no benefits, the pay could not provide for me and my family was the hardest part of working at this job."
bad,"Fed Ex sells its routes like McDonalds sells its franchise restaurants, therefore you are not directly employed by Fed Ex. You wear the Fed Ex uniform but you don't have the benefits that people think you have because you wear that uniform. For example no paid sick days, no paid vacation days, no medical insurance etc. Fed Ex Ground workers at the hardest working people I ever had the privilege to work with bar none !!!"
bad,Mala  no tiene conocimiento  desde adentro del trabajo ni conocimento sobre los clientes  se deprecio la calidad tanto humana como laboral
bad,management was the worst. extremely disrespectful to their employees i would never recommend anyone work there. Would never work there again in life.
bad,not good to make money. but great experience and not easy in big city to make enough money to living.  work as unload boxes co work is good as team work.
bad,In texarkana u do not work for fed ex. You work for a contractor. The pay 50 a day will training for ever how long they want. No benefits nothing but a check. People are cool but what a waist.if u drive u finally get more not a whole more though. No overtime pay either. What a joke.no g.p.s no airconditioning in vehicles seat belts don't work either. Needs to be inspected.
bad,"really disappointed at the management, they are all worst management that I ever worked with. this company using un-education people to be management and they have no idea of what they are doing"
bad,Although it is a great workout it is a glorified sweatshop.  I didn't mind the early mornings but the more you do the more they expect.  The management are nothing more than highly paid slave drivers.  They gave us a raise and then cut our hours.  We were threatened with termination if we called in sick during the busy season but people were sent home after working one hour. A few times they were sent home from the parking lot as they arrived to work.  You don't get benefits until after1000 hours worked which will take you 2 years to get.  The employees are great to work with but management sucks.  There is no room for promotion or more hours so if you take the job expect your paycheck to be around $100 per week. By far the worst job I've ever had.
bad,"A typical work day consisted of starting at 7 and working 10-11 hrs a day. No real lunch break, no benefits, no overtime. I was told that I didn't have to deliver packages over 75 lbs. A few days into the job, I was told the route I was on, I had to take packages up to 150 lbs. Employees would stand around and watch you struggle to load heavy packages into your truck. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to manage yourself on the route once you left the terminal and getting to see the nice animals while on my route."
bad,I rather not comment on this position.  You're not really working for Federal Express but for contractors with them.  No more to say.
bad,The front line supervisor had little to say about daily operations and the company did not take care of its people. The long hours and lack of support made this a poor place to work.
bad,I only lasted one day. I went into the job expecting it to be as fast paced as ups. Felt myself wanting to leave mid shift on the first day. Their sort method is full of numbers which i hated. Only way I would go back is if I could unload trailers. I hate standing around.
bad,Awful place to work. No training and threats of write ups after one week on the job. Poor management.  Lack of training  will result in you getting wrote up.
bad,"My personal and professional objective is to constantly enrich my knowledge and advance my occupational skills along the various phases of my career, so as to provide for a fulfilling growth throughout my life. By continuously being in a ‘learning mode’, I wish to add value to myself and the organization I work with."
bad,"While working with FedEx I gained invaluable experience in management in the areas of Ramp Operations, Logistics, Import/Export, Customer Service, Best Practices."
bad,"My typical day at work at Fed-X is challenging its all about hardwork and satisfaction. I come in and clock in, go to destined area and begin to start working loading and unloading truck trailers until they make the announcement that the shift is over."
bad,This is a job to go to if you have nothing else available. they work you that's for sure. not enough compensation. very low pay.
bad,Days of hard labor in a warehouse with no ac/heat. Loading trucks at fast past. Free banking with bank of America. The hardest part of the job was loading 500ft trucks.
bad,"Worst Job EVER!!! Not a good company to work for, unless youve been working there for a long time, management will not side with you on nothing"
bad,Not the best to work at if you want to make good money. By that I mean 700-800$ weekly. Only way to make this money is by working your off day and by coming in at night if you work during the day
bad,"The material handler position at FedEx needs improvement to say the least. The income and job tasks do not match, management is very unprofessional and not excited about employees who want to succeed and move further."
bad,Love going to work every day.  Always something different and challenging.  Never a dull moment making the day go by fast.
bad,"I enjoyed working for FedEx,  I have been with the company for 21 years and just retire on June 1, 2015. If the first rating is excellent."
bad,employment with Fed Ex was limited and no real room for promotions. There is a waiting list for advancement opportunities.
bad,"This was a terrible work experience at Fed Ex.  They did things wrong and I did things wrong.  However, they made me employee of the month several times during my time there.  There were drugs everywhere, which served as a temptation to me. Since working there, I have cleaned up my life and feel better about myself."
bad,"Early start, time sensitive heavy workload, late finish."
bad,unloading cans and maintain a grade on how I was performing at work. Didn't like the way the team leader was acting with certain employees.
bad,Company is not very customer service oriented. They have streamlined their work which made it difficult to meet the deadlines. Lots of overtime offered. Low pay.
bad,this is a great company to earn from especially experience. and how important it is to help ppl in there daily life so there life could become better
bad,"I worked for a contractor so I was not able to enjoy the job like I wanted to. Money was not worth the stress. The hours were very lon sometimes 12 hours or longer. the driving was intense during rush hour. If a package was delivered and the customer claimed they did not get it, I had to pay for it out of my own money. I did not like this job but had to stick with it because I couldn't find another one."
bad,Fun easy job to deal with.  people willing to help you work if needed.  co workere were fun to be around.  i would love to work for this company in the future. i would recommmend anyone to work for tis company
bad,sorting out packages uploading trucks . i learned how to sort out the packages by state. managment was rude cowokers were nice
bad,"It is a very dark and gloomy facility.  Management stands around talking BS, or playing with their smart phones the entire shift, and some of the management team are vaping inside the facility.  There is low moral here.  The hardest part of the job is knowing that you are stuck in an environment where there is no upward mobility/advancement.  There are no enjoyable parts of my job."
bad,"Just overall terrible, much less professional than people lead me to believe. They claim safety is their number one priority but they couldn't care less."
bad,part-time job means part time pay.fedex has a good insurance package.thats about it.If you are ready to break your back go ahead and fill out an application
bad,High turnover rate and a lack of accountability make for an unsafe job. Management is severely lacking. Do not recommend.
bad,"I worked as a loader and a driver, only bad part about this is when youre a driver you don't work for fedex you work for a route contractor,they own the routes. so , no benefits, bad pay"
bad,"As much as Fedex tries to sell itself as a good company to work for it is far from it. Very few opportunities for advancement, and working hard is not going to get you a raise either. Do not allow yourself to get stuck working at this dead end. the younger generations are carrying the dinosaurs here in every way possible."
bad,horrible job i hated every bit of  it i feel they could have down alot better with what they were doing there with the employees
bad,Nothing to say about this job.Move boxes all day.There were no breaks.Only good thing you get paid every week.Work environment is working by yourself.
bad,"I total pit of unprofessional despair. Save yourself the agony and don't waste your time as this ""organization"" surely will."
bad,"Typical day of work would be to deliver and pickup packages. I leared great customer service skills. The hardest part of the job were the long hours on a non hourly pay, and the most enjoyable part of the job was to put a smile on my customers faces."
bad,"I transferred here and they had me unloading trucks , clerical work ,sorting mail or just sent me home. I didn't learn anything. I would only work for two days if that . I didn't enjoy nothing , I was making 13.00 before I transferred when I got there I was making 9.00.My pay checks would be missing my last one was mailed a month later."
bad,"It is a great company to work for, it cares about it's customer and  even more about their employee's.  The opportunities to grow are enormous, its just a great company."
bad,"The worst company to work for I would not recommend to nobody"
bad,"EXTREMELY long hours, will promise to have you on there team and as SOON as the  holidays are over they will let you go without notice. I didn't miss ANY days, worked at LEAST 12 hours and was STILL let go.  I was picked up by another contractor that paid even Worse then the first one!! I don't know how stable this company is but for a hard worker like myself it scares me to work for this company. There are No benefits or retirement. Hardest job you'll do and managers DON'T care. All they care about is having a person there to get THEM through the holidays and after that, your on your own. Don't believe me, go work for them."
bad,"job is ok, but there is no opportunities for advancement and growth within the company in closing this employer offers no benefits and no competitive wages."
bad,All that's to this job is staking boxes over 75 pounds. I had to stack boxes in a tight wall. I was in charge of packing two 16 wheelers in three hours time a day.
bad,I was required to load and unload boxes from the trucks. I was also required to scan packages and put the packages in a plastic bag to go to New Hamphire. I thought managers was fair . My co-workers were like brother and sister. The hardest part of the job was make sure everything was scan and put in the right place. The most enjoyable part was working witt my coworkers.
bad,"Fedex Home Delivery & Fedex Hiring Dept. they have horrible attitudes, & even worst communication skills, I was offered a full time position & booted after the holidays. They have varies positions open In which I have applied for & upon receiving a call back. The representative was rude, and never returned my call as I was in the doctors office when she called. I have applied for several positions there, even with my current experience with them no luck!"
bad,"a typical day at work isn't all that bad, even though it can be quite overwhelming. I've learned how to deal with it throughout my time, it becomes easier when you have co-workers who are willing to help get the job done. The hardest part of the job is when you constantly have to unload heavy boxes while your co-workers lean, but overall FedEx is definitely the job."
bad,FedEx promotes people to management who have no idea what they are doing and get rid of people they don't like personally regardless of how experienced and productive they are.
bad,"People I've met over the years, who had once worked there, never had a kind word to say about the job.  I didn't fully understand it before..."
bad,"basically you are just a number in the system they will use you until they don't need you. There is a lot of favoritism managers get away with alot of things. you work sun up till sun down. i worked as a courier for them in stamford  ct was loyal and dedicated would do anything for the company bend over backwards and still get treated like i was nothing. Managers there have no manager experience they force you to make service knowing fully well you wont make it. expect alot of write ups alot of being talked down on, i worked there any they fired me for timecard falsification manager editted my timer card wrong and i got all the backlash of it. he was a new manager didnt know what he was doing. funny thing is when he did manager classes i was doing it as well and he got to go further in the program than me. they dont care if you have personal issues at home or a family at home. i dont understand how their raise system works u get a measly 30 cent raise or someone who came after u where hired gets a higher raise than you. they make picking up and delivering packages harder than it should be. managers will leave knowing they need to be present for the night sort, managers handle personal issues when they should be at the job site. stamford express station is horrible. every employee is unhappy.  fedex is a good company just the people they put in management are trash they need to do a undercover boss at every station to see how these managers really are. FEDEX is horrible to work. stop per hour goal need to be over 100% every day, must have all the airway bills or u get written"
bad,"If you like being treated like an animal while unqualified managers who probably couldn't run a lemonade stand try to make a simple job of delivering packages into rocket science, than this is the place for you!!! You will be treated like a piece of dirt throughout the day as you speed through town trying to make your stop per hour goal with no regards to the community around you.  If you don't hit your goal you will be written up and threatened, and if you do make your goal they will raise it so you can't make it next time.  Unless you like being under the thumb of a Hitler style administration, this career is probably not for you!!!!!!!!"
bad,"Good steady work daily, but only problem was that some days they only let you work 2 hours and you got moved around so much you did not have time to finish a task."
bad,"I have been working at FedEx Office full-time for more than 5 years and in my opinion:"
bad,"Long hours"
bad,"体力第一"
bad,"strong basic management, human relations & communications skills & is responsible for selecting, training, & developing a staff of 1 to 7 direct reports; oversees in the administration of generating annual revenue; conducts meetings to provide employees with information regarding division/operation; applies consistent administration of disciplinary procedures; maintains all required reports, payroll records, performance reviews, etc. through established guidelines; ensures safety methods & programs are implemented & maintained; instructs employees on methods to instill a service-conscious attitude & to minimize service failures; ensures cost effectiveness of branch operations through established control of equipment, utilities and supplies; maintains contact with internal & external customers with regard to conditions affecting the service level of area served & controls movement & activities of all related products to ensure maximum efficiency."
bad,Under current reviews for overtime rules is just the tip of the ice berg.  Horrible environment and my heart goes out to the route contractors trapped and forced to do things not correct in their areas.
bad,No pay but they require you to be on call all the time whenever the company demands it
bad,"No benefits, low pay, and incompetent management. I remember I had a doctor's appointment and I let my boss know 2 weeks in advance and he made me change it to another day, because someone was on vacation that day."
bad,not good stay away too many temps inside of that building they run it like a sweat shop.
bad,"Thought this was going to be an opportunity of a life time.  Very disappointing outcome.  Broken promises, No promotion w/in the company.  Hired day side workers from outside of the company instead of promoting w/in after promising several employees that they will be moved to day side once business growth had taken off.  Management incompetent and make knee jerk reactions and decisions."
bad,Over worked and underpaid. no breaks no full time no benefits workers comp doesn't get used because they make it ur fault management needs to get it together
bad,You work long hours. The only thing Fed Ex cares about are the packages being delivered. They don't care about the workers or workers needs. And you can be fired at any time.
bad,Bad management and its very organized its too hot. But they start u off good
bad,"I've worked here for 4 1/2 years and haven't had a single chance to move up.  They rig employment opportunities and choose whoever they want for the positions when its supposed to be based on a bidding system that goes by seniority.  They also violate your privacy by talking bad about you to every manager if you make mistakes.  If you accidentally have an accident every manager will know your name and all your history they will also make an example of you by telling everyone about what you did.  Overall the managers treat you like a piece of trash, your co workers don't respect you and the security guards treat you like trash when you go through the metal detectors each night."
bad,"bad management and a general feeling of slavery. no job security."
bad,"Looking for an additional income with a company, while I continue to "
bad,"The full time managers work 10-12 without a break.  If you have grown folks bills you can't pay them on this salary.  With the hours you work, you would come out better being a package handler.  Sr. Management is clueless.  Drivers are rude and ignorant.  Can't rely on the place you work to get your package delivered correctly."
bad,there is tons of favoritism here. they do not pay as well as many other warehouses as far as management.
bad,Management sucks. Can't get anything done. No one knows what's going on. Coworkers are all drug addicts who can't pass drug tests for a normal job. Hours suck so you have literally no personal life. Always tired through the day and can't ever stay up late. Tasks are tedious and not enjoyable at all. Management sets a work pace for everyone that is completely unrealistic and impossible for anyone to keep up with. When you need help management disappears and you have to deal with your problem yourself. Force you to do things a certain way even when that way doesn't work for you. They will smash you with a huge work load and then yell at you when you ask for help and can't get it done when they want it done. The hours you get are few in number and even if you were able to work more hours the pay still would not be worth it at all. All in all I would not recommend working here to anyone. Ever. I would sooner recommend going to McDonald's.
bad,"This company has no real direction anymore. Everything is tailored around making a profit to please the investors. PSP is the motto, which once stood for People Service Profit but is now referred to by employees as PROFIT Service People. It's really sad that a BIG billion dollar company would take every known perk from the employees (couriers), the main artery of the company such as adequate annual raises, hours, etc. There is a top out rate but no one here knows how many years it will take you to reach it. I'm currently in my 7th year and I am nowhere near top pay. As an Full time employee of 7 years I would not refer an enemy to this company."
bad,Typical day of sweat and moving boxes. Management is terrible because the boxes and the speed it gets on the belt  is more important to the well being of employees. Most enjoyable part is when you quit.
bad,"Loading unloading truck at high speed rates"
bad,Fexdex is definely the company i would choose searchig for good benefits and just a great first job and good if you are looking to move foward in the company .
bad,"work at night and learned a warehouse job, unjust supervisors .. often lifting parcels, heavy than norm, the nicest part of the work is finished"
bad,I Would not Recommend this job to anyone. They were very rude and unfriendly eviroment.
bad,It wasn't the best job but something good for a part time gig. I would say this job is more for high school students.
bad,Not enough hours .. Less pay. Not enough shifts to work. Stressful yet low pay
bad,"make sure you have plenty of energy, cause once it starts it doesn't stop until the all trailers are unloaded"
bad,"	Responsible for RF Scanners ensuring all equipment is properly working and all new assets are collected accurately throughout FEDEX"
bad,The work day was pretty the same. I learned to stack trailers properly. Management was great. Co-workers was fun to work with. No hard part to the job. I enjoyed everything about this job.
bad,they make u drive over hours there's absolutely no benefits an the contractors don't care about his drivers
bad,I got fired for being sic during work hours. when I asked a manager they treated me like I was a criminal. I would never refer this job to anyone unless you need holiday money
bad,FedEx ground has poor management which makes FedEx an extremely difficult job to work for. As a full time employee I barely received 30 hours a week. FedEx ground is not fair to the other employees. They expect you to meet standards even while in training.
bad,"There is a ""The beatings will continue untill moral improves mentality"
bad,"This is a warehouse job where you have to be on your feet, moving around, for the entire shift. You do hard work, with little pay, barely any hours, and limited benefits. There are no room for advancement unless you are a male with some sort of a management degree. It is an excellent place to work only if you are fresh out of high school, have no work experience, and you needed a job. They hire anyone who is willing to work."
bad,Great place if the rest of you family works their. good ole boy system in harrison ar. If they want you gone so they can hire family member next day they will fire you on some bogus intrapment. very stressfull environment a lot of backstabber posers and don't forget if your from up north your a yankee taking all their good jobs I've heard that way to many times. the day i was fired i never seen it coming had perfect attendance no warning or right ups for 7 yrs i was employed their. I had high hopes for this company and am devastated by what they did
bad,working for FedEx it was fun in the terminal in new jersey great team love all the coworkers. the staff were helping each other miss them all.
bad,"I had far more ineffective managers than effective ones but the few I did have taught me a great deal about management, operations and achieving results. I learned how to independently run a large scale operation with over 30 employees and know exactly what was going on without being in each area to see it for myself, I learned how to train, motivate, coach, discipline and trust my people in order to not only get the job done but to improve the job on an efficiency level and job satisfaction level for everyone. Typically I arrived 2 hours before the operation was to begin to setup for the day and run reports from the previous day's operation to show the results and communicate where and what to improve or maintain. The operation consisted of running an average of 8000 packages from over 60 vehicles, sorting and scanning and loading them into 16 trailers bound for specific destinations by utilizing a crew of 25 employees I trained to perform specialized tasks to facilitate the operation. There was a very strict time crunch, the trailers had to be dispatched at the same time each day and we could not start too early because we had to maintain a productive operation. Problems arose daily concerning late arrivals, equipment and technology problems, staffing and damages but I learned to make decisive actions and find the best solutions to maintain the priorities."
bad,when you worked a 5 6 or 7 hour shift you never would get a 10 min break and when it was brought to the labor boards attention you get fired
bad,"Just sorting boxes. there wasn't anything that i learned. It was just the same boring thing everyday, no breaks"
bad,"Worked 16 hours daily: in @ 5:30 am (loaded packages for 2 hours which we couldn't count as ""on duty"" time) then drove for 11-14 hours with no lunch breaks. ONLY able to go to bathroom when I just couldn't hold it any longer (because of large number of stops). Encouraged to falsify work times to keep under 11 hour rule. Encouraged to speed excessively and roll through stop signs to timely complete stops. Packages sometimes weighed two to three times the limit of 70 lbs. Delivered large, heavy packages to businesses when I worked in HOME Delivery. I rarely worked less than 8 hours daily. i learned I am better off working smart than working hard, so I am getting out of the driving business. I would enjoy this work if stops were greatly reduced, packages were only delivered to homes, packages weighed less than 70 lbs., there was actually time for a 30 minute break after 8 hours driving, bathroom breaks were available every one to two hours, I could include my loading time into my ""on duty"" times, days only lasted 8 hours from load time to back at terminal, etc."
bad,"It was a big chain for multi buiness like Shipping,money transfer,passport photo,binding,photocopying,printing,business cards."
bad,"Labor jobs like fedex aren't my type of jobs, it is a good place to work for but it was my time to go."
bad,Data Entry and billing for freight transportation.  On the computor all day.
bad,Unload items from trucks and put the on forklift and package any items that were damaged.
bad,Get to work and expect to work continusly hard getting things from the truck to belt and to another truck with an hour span.
bad,bad place to work pay is bad and no benefits if working for contractors plus no way to ensure they will pay you.
bad,Just didn't feel like they had safety. The boxes came down the belt fast and bascially everywhere.
bad,"Excelente empresa para trabalhar bons realacionamentos com gerentes etc,"
bad,My review is Above all Satisfactory!  Im very good with my customer and dispatcher....
bad,"Fast Paced"
bad,"Once you get the hang of things it's super easy to advance, everyone is cool and willing to help out if need be."
bad,I am training one individual whom has no experience. We load packages ranging from 1-175lbs. We work 4-6 hrs 5 days a week
bad,horrible absolutely horrible no security. no work they dont care
bad,it a great job to work at and some of the people there are friendly and kind.
bad,A typical day at work is coming in and loading my truck and then waiting for more packages to get added on to me from people who are lazy. I have learned more customer service skills and using their RF scanner and their system. Management and the co-workers are unprofessional and its not a good working environment. The hardest part is lifting heavy packages and working with the unprofessional people at the fedex ground facility. The most enjoyable part is knowing that on Saturday I wont have to return for 2 days.
bad,"heavily cut hours on a regular basis. over worked while you are there and soo under payed. l'very been here for 7 years and I'm still treated like a piece of labor meat by the head office and local district managers, etc. This company is very disorganized and will look away anytime there is something illegal."
bad,"no beneifits,trucks are not safe to drive,contractor don't pay good,fedex is not professional at all"
bad,"Scanning barcodes, indexing information, sorting mail and mailroom duties. Co-workers were nice, mangement was ok."
bad,"This company is a cult you will have to be a slave for this company to be happy with you.The company uses positive reinforcement to con you into working long hours for no extra compensation . The health insurance has a $2500 deduct.for family and dont even cover lab work 100% $40.00 and $50.00 co-pays, express scripts for medication.You also will not get any sick days as a manager and be expected to work 14hrs or better a day and told we here at fedex help do our bosses job its a company practice to ensure you work long hours."
bad,when i start working at fedex it was good but wen the time go been it start to get bad because the manger only like there people.
bad,"I worked here for about 8 months, and I did not care for it at all. The pay was low, I had to haggle to even get 10.50 per hour. A basic day consists of helping people make copies and helping them pick out the right color of paper. The co workers were average, with the exception of one who used to be a manager and was demoted who still thought she was in some sort of managerial position and liked to boss people around regularly. I was told upon starting that I would be eligible for a pay increase after 6 months. However, since we got a new manager who didn't ""have time to evaluate"" me properly my pay increase was not given. I also was promised this would evolve to full time work which it did not, along with the promise that I could transfer to a regular FedEx shipping center position from this one. That too was untrue - I feel that the company mislead me and that favoritism was highly active, as a girl who was barely old enough to work was hired 6 months after I was and received over 3 dollars more per hour though I had much more professional experience. I would not recommend working at a FedEx office."
bad,"Well, a typical day for primarily consist of either scanning packages, sort packages to be placed on appropriate pallets, or assist co-workers with the unloading of the shuttle. What I have learned form this job, other than accuracy, is that when performing any task it is just best to stay in your own world and not speak to anyone. Honestly, since I am currently on suspension, I would have to say that management at the facility is very 'shady.' As far as co-workers are concerned, there is really nothing to say because I refrain from speaking to them. The hardest part of the job, besides having the will to show up, is having to deal with the crooked co-workers and managers. The most enjoyable part of the job is clocking out being able to class right after."
bad,"boss is a phycho, yells at everyone and will fire anyone who looks at him funny"
bad,"the idea in my terminal is just make the delivery anyway,it is not the kind of environment that encourage efficiency"
bad,load boxes that where to be shipped in to the truck. i had to work at a very fast past in a hot truck. i learned that some thing cant be done with out team work. i really did not have a enjoyable part with working at this job because every day i went home with a new bruise on me. the hardest part of this job was stacking boxes higher thin my self hoping the dent fall on me
bad,"Fed Ex does not hire anyone directly.You either must own your own truck and get a contract or work for a contractor and drive their truck.Only some contractors have benefits,and unless you find one that has a dedicated run you will find yourself waiting ""ON CALL"" either all day or all night depending on the shift you manage to find.Work is slow 70% with more trucks than work.Holiday season is the heaviest work time going from November to January.If your desperate for a job real quick for the holidays than go for it.Beware for Fed Ex assumes 0 responsibility for a contractor not paying you.You will have to sue if you don't get paid."
bad,"Hard work, Seasonal. Non stop back breaking work for six hours with only two 15 min breaks"
bad,Adding more responsibilities no increase in pay. Being micro managed.
bad,I recommend this job to teenagers. A very good daily workout.
bad,"It was a horrible place to work ,very hot and not enough hours."
bad,the work load varies day to to day. The hours are very few and far between . Very bad working conditions.
bad,Terrible Company...awful manager...do not work for company.
bad,Working at night can sometimes be a good thing but working in a hot box like ffedex isnt a good thing
bad,Production was the name of the game. Base salary plus commission. Stats and goals were so unattainable that bonuses were so low or non existant.
bad,After over 4 years with this company all the thanks i got was my hours cut because I wasn't a man or a single mom. They tried to force me to work in a location i did not feel safe in and when i refused they cut my hours even knowing i was the only member of my household currently working and trying to support my self my husband and my elderly parents.
bad,"A culture of ""Disposable Employees"""
bad,Typical day consist of delivering 10 to 12 hours a day. You have to load your own truck too.
bad,Overworked-Underpaid. It just depends on the contractor you can be worked 12 to 13 hours for about 500 a week. but different contractors different pay. Ill Ask first.
bad,Very poor company to work for. Needs better management. I enjoyed the job but not the headache.
bad,Fedex is a good company to start as a first job. It shows you the ins an out of how work in a forntune 500 company will help you in the long run.
bad,"Never really knew about contracting jobs, or then sub-contracting jobs for that matter. Be ready to work, hard and long hours, with few days of 12+ hours of moving those boxes. Work climate is cold - always - while your body is steaming away. At least you stay in shape if your back isn't going out in the process. Pay may hoover around $10 an hour, the actual pay, for the 8 hrs a day is distant dream if you say yes to the machine. Stay off if you can, if you can't then keep looking by all, ALL, means."
bad,If you want a life outside of your job... dont work here.
bad,Working at FedEx seemed good at first. After about 2 months in i found out working in a warehouse wasn't for me. I am a people person.
bad,"I worked at Fed-Ex Ground briefly for about 2 in a half months. Starting from May 9th 2011 - July 28, 2011. During that time I have seen so many people come & go the turn over rate is so high it's unbelievable. There were people that would just work 1 day then quit. The chute would spit packages out and they fell on my head. I had a massive H.P. Laser printer fall on my head and when I went to report it my supervisor did nothing. Same when my leg got caught in between the tractor and the dock. Then the load stands they made us use were all broken but we all still had to use them regardless. You were mandated to load 650 - 750 packages an hour of all shapes, sizes & weights. You had no help what so ever. One person had to go to the bathroom they denied him the use to the bathroom so he asked polity again they said NO. he went in the trailer and they fired him. It was really hot in the ware house during those months & they would lecture us to stay hydrated yet when any of us went to get a drink they threatened to wright us up or fire us. When our scanners went dead or went out of range they wouldn't beep and you have to have a 100% scan rate or you get wrote up. if you scanner dies and you miss 1 package you get wrote up. it's really hard when it's 112 degrees in there and packages are flying off the chute at 90 MPH. Plus you only work 2 in a half hours at the most the moneys not that good. Plus you have to lift boxes that weigh up to and more 100 LBS + your self with no help and no back support."
bad,The job requires you to work on holidays. The job also pays a flat rate which you overwork within the first 3 days of the week. May be demanding on health.
bad,I work for a subcontractor Beeline services of fedex we get paid a flat rate of $140 a day no benefits no insurance they say they only pay this but men get paid $150 they lie and say you are full-time permanent and only keep you through the peak season which is from thanksgiving through newyears
bad,"This company pays a barely livable wage. The employee morale is terrible, constant fighting between shifts(shift wars). Nobody knows what they are doing, you are told a different way to do something by everyone. Nobody is on the same page.The work is so boring, it is the same thing everyday. You are like a robot after the first month of working there, so repetitive that you want to rip your eyes out. Management is seriously lacking leadership qualities. You can move up in the company, but it takes a couple of years and it is hardly rewarding to move up, so there is no sense in caring about the work that you are doing. They give a yearly 2% raise which is like a slap in the face considering nearly everyone who works there makes under $35,000. If you are ""lucky"" enough to get a promotion, your pay increase is that nice slap in the face 2% again. The only good thing that they offer is cheap insurance which is actually only good for check-ups and dental cleanings, if you have any major health issue, you are in trouble. You'll be paying the majority of your medical bills until you reach the deductible which is absurdly high. And they offer a somewhat generous vacation package, your first year of working there you receive 6 floating holidays which you can freely use and 2 weeks of vacation, along with 10 sick days(highly recommend using). There is nothing hard about this job and there is nothing enjoyable about this job. The only enjoyable thing is having time off. "
bad,"Very unprofessional company and miles behind the times when it comes to processes. No automation, the warehouse is an accident waiting to happen with forklift trucks moving at full pelt in crowded areas. Goods are thrown around and frequently damaged. If you want to join the parcel industry then there are better options."
bad,Fedex Ground is a physical labor intensive environment. When hired you are intentionally misled by members of the human resource department to deter applicants from withdrawing their application. Fedex Ground 3000 directors row has a 80% turnover rate. Most new hires do not pat the first 30 days.
bad,"Alot of stressful and strenuous package moving and throwing while managers and team leaders yelling at people to go faster, very unsafe work environment as well as very bad air quality due to all the tugs, trucks, forklifts and planes. management is untruthful and lazy for the most part, in the end they have little care for there employees well being, i would not recommend working here."
bad,Had high expectations now I am saddened and disappointed. Made the mistake of believing everything I was told I feel very naive. Safety message every morning  but if you get hurt they don't  care.
bad,"Lunches are not free btw whoever wrote that. Management is LOST and have no idea what is going on half the time, stressful and extremely unorganized. They say you can go up and stuff but you dont half the time lol unless ur a kiss A55 Dont appreciate hard workers & treated like a fool. Worst place ive ever worked for by far. Hours are not flexable and you can stay there for 10 hours and theyll force you to stay or make you feel like you will lose ur job"
bad,Not needed at this time. Poor working environment. Mgmt lied about compensation. Hours are brutal. No life and ran to the ground. Felt guilty when I had to use the bathroom cause there isn't enough time. Etc.
bad,if you get hurt on the job they just let you go without telling you at all! also they have a problem with workmans comp also. So now i am stuck paying the bills!!!
bad,Fed Ex doesn't guarantee you full time hours they tell you are full time but give you part time hours. Managers at Fed Ex just walk around and tell you to hurry up and give no assistance at all you would think of the company they would treat their employees better than what they do there is no 401k plan for package handlers only for managers that what company only give managers 401k andmkt their employees
bad,"At FedEx Freight Dorval, bureaucracy is extremely deep in the heart of management. Supervisors and managers are so poor at leading people, initiating idea and influencing people because of their poor leadership skills and overall abilities to improve performance."
bad,Extremely HOT in summer they shove a 8 hour day into a four hour day or less work isn’t hard but the way they turn new workers loose with no training is very annoying not only can they not use the scanner right but they also don’t know how to build a simple pallet and keep it square it’s just like a puzzle hello and I have never seen so many lazy young adults ...and it’s usually the lazy ones that get the lead position and manage the quads and some of the managers there try to befriend the young employees instead of being a manager the ones that do there job and do it well never get any acknowledgment only the ones that loaf around with there pants hanging off there back side like really who wants to see that ? And profanity is unbelievable if your work here you really need Jesus in your life also pay is not great insurance is awesome but after 8 years and still not at 14 dollars it’s a shame and there is a big turnover here some can handle it and some can’t for the pay it’s not worth it .
bad,"Easy to sign up with, cost is your soul and sanity if you can't handle the hours and management."
bad,"Terminal Manager and most recent OM are the most toxic to work with. Multiple supervisors have quite and the Regional Manager has done nothing to investigate why. Constantly understaffed with expectations for the operation supervisors to never get sick or have a family life. Employees are too scared of retaliation, so posts regarding this location are rarely honest."
bad,"As a custom critical driver, I was disappointed when I discovered that Fedex actually does not have a viable load board, to pick real time loads from.  It place me as a driver in a stressful environment.  "
bad,The worst leadership ive ever seen. All they care about is the unloading and loading of the packages.  If you dont mind getting crushed by boxes all day....go for it. I dont recommend it. Id honestly rather work at McDonald's.
bad,Unless you wanna be a paid robot then spare yourself. They race you off the clock and refuse to help even though they see you drowning in work. The managers talk about you over the walkie talkies and have no respect
bad,"It’ll be easy when you start out everyone is nice to you then once you get used to it all that change. You get in trouble for stuff that is out of your control, favoritism within the company, equipment doesn’t work, you can request something and they’ll get back to you on their time. Certain co workers are nice and some are rude. Pay is good but it’s not a liveable wage, this job is for kids who just graduated high school who need the experience and quick money. Then managers aren’t considerate of your outside life."
bad,"the good workers are taken for granted and poor workers continue and take up space that could be for others to promote and grow, the management and HR are not dependable.  Safety procedures are not followed on the dock, seatbelts on the forklifts are being tied in knots and not used or they are being taped and just hung on the side of the forklift.  "
bad,"messed up workshifts, inconsistent hours, people who work there are backstabbing snakes and rats who talk in your back and smile at your face. you wont be recognized for hard, quality and high output work. people who work there will degrade your potential and ruin you to become a rat like them. managers are dumb and do not know how to do their job which is to optimize money flow in order to better the company. safery hazard is a big problem. warehouse is dirty you will get asthma within 3rd month of work. overrall depressing work environment, you may give your all and be positive as much as you can but this place is so rotten that it will get to you no matter what. you look at your bosses and coworkers and all you can think of is ‘god forbid i become like that’, when it should be the opposite - you should be motivated to follow in the steps of your leaders and collegues. everyone there is fake. worst place ive worked for. sometimes i wondered if these people were for real with their bs, and they were. stay away for your own good, dont waste your time. this is sad because fedex is a big name company which was featured in my favourite movie ‘cast away’ back in the day. it’s silly but i felt pride when i first started there and was super motivated to do well. but as time went i saw that no matter how big a company is, if the people at that certain location are low quality then the place wont be great, and it is the case for Fedex warehouse in mirabel. low quality people will ruin everything even the best company name will get dirty. i cannot say for other locations but the one"
bad,Got hurt on job off a3 days then got fired trucks are not dot up to date. They overheat and headlights go out going down the road but they don't give about you as long as they make money
bad,You come in and load your truck and get your paperwork. Deliver package at a timely manner.I enjoy the fact of working alone at my own pace. Didn't think that i was treated fairly but other then that. I enjoyed working the job.
bad,Very hard work for unfair pay. Package handler comes with a pay cap so its either move on to being a manager or waste your time and your body as an package handler.
bad,extremely low paying job. very strenuous and back breaking work. weird hours of tedious work with no real management. Also the warehouse is not climate controlled so its really hot in the summer and freezing in the winter.
bad,Not a place to work if you are looking for support and fair compensation for the work you are doing.  Lack of peer support and upper management support.
bad,If youve been there 30 or more years youre good..if you come in especially in customer service dont expect to move up or go anywhere for a few years and they are so nit picky youll have a  below average score and youll be forever stuck because you cant improve to their ridiculous never ending changes and so called coaching...which is NEVER anything youve done thats GOOD its ALWAYS the negative they focus on
bad,"No room for advancement, only if you're there favorite, I'm miserable working there to much favoritism, your work Performance is not based on how well you do but based on if they like you. I don't have much more to say."
bad,All anyone cares about is production numbers and how many trucks they can flip. Management is a joke and HR is just a bunch of lazy women. I would never work here if you aren't somewhat fit.
bad,"stressful and aggravating,you load your truck and then you have to go to your route and deliver,they recently changed the system and and made it very difficult to find the right package you need,also the directions they give you is a very old software from the end of the 90s and you get to pass trough same street several times and hour later deliver on the same street,You don't know if you are going to work 1 week or 6 years in my case and be let go,no guarantees...They have very strange and unrealistic policies."
bad,Do not ever work for ground! It’s all contracted work and the contractors have one thing in mind and that is money. My truck had an exhaust leak that went into the cab and I had to drive with the windows and doors open  during winter in Syracuse NY. Working 10-15 hours a day for a daily pay rate is not worth it.
bad,I spent most of my time in trailers.  We were constantly watched they did not even like it if we were talking with other employees. Everyone including managers were on edge.
bad,"micro managed by managers and supervisors that have not done the work them selves, have no idea how long things take or how to do the job. and they do not listen to employees that have been there many years longer then them"
bad,"a typical day at work at fedex would consist of working at a very fast pace putting up with constant reprimands from management you never can do enough for the company. you are just a number and reminded all the time that your replaceable. its typical corporate america. "
bad,"My experiences working at FedEx:"
bad,I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone. It barly paid bills. They're want any training they just tell you to come in and throw you into loading and unloading.
bad,"I don't mind to work hard, but Fedex Ground  is a place where you have to give all of you for nothing in return. No overtime, no vacations, no bonus, no support for the management."
bad,"Fed ex managment is ok, supervisors need an attitude adjustment.   Constant yelling,  constant beign put down.   Just a bad place to work.   Co workers are great and managers are ok.  I would consider  coming back just have the supervisors fired and hire new ones"
bad,the pay isn't worth the amount of you will have to do. The communication between the drivers and management is terrible. As a driver you work for a contractor and not fedex the company itself.
bad,"Fedx is run on favoratism, if your not part of the in crowd your the odd man out. I was terminated for having a incident that broke a plastic horn on my vehicle. And the same manager was crused at and totally disrepected by a senior employee, that employee was suspended how was that fair?"
bad,It started out a good place to work than the harder I worked and tryed to advance and become full time they discriminated on me people called hr on me because I'm a hard worked and I lost my job over it!
bad,"I really do not have a comment that is pleasant, if you cannot say anything positive, its best not to say nothing at all.  I was able to do the work, but they constantly took hours away from employees."
bad,"No advancement, Turn over rate high. Mandatory overtime weekly without notice, overall moral in building is down due to lake of advancement and turn over rate"
bad,"Working at this fed-ex terminal location so far is not good. Lack of communications, No air conditioning inside the trucks when working in the heat weather and not enough pay for the hard work. I'm willing to put my full time working for the right pay never the less."
bad,"I hear every facility is different but my experience working at fedex ground in brooklyn ny was my worst experience at any company thus far. Each day i felt like i worked at a sweatshop. 5 days a week. Bringing in barely 400 every 2 weeks. Management has an issue with harrasing the employees..so god forbid you have a death in your family and it affects the sort. Also traveled an hour to pick up my last check, only to be given another persons check."
bad,"Customer service reps are micro managed down to seconds. You must handle calls in a certain amount of time, you must say exactly the same thing over and over again. All I can say is DO NOT DO IT!!"
bad,"Answer the phone, reroute packages, call to get correct addresses. Assist couriers with problem packages. Take packages from customers and ship them, open or close the office. Solving problems daily, most managers were great to work with or for"
bad,"Pay is not enough to live, little hours, terrible management promotions only given to close friends or relatives of higher ups. Equipment barely works. You will regret applying."
bad,"A typical day at work with poor management skills, lack of communication and not enough employees. The hardest part of the job is injuries can happen and the company does not care about their employees."
bad,"I worked for FedEx for over 8 years and I wish I left sooner. Maybe I just had managers. The first few years weren't too bad. But I tried numerous times to advance in the company and I was always passed up. I was always told ""you were our second choice"". In reality they would rather promote within their own stations. Pay raises were about 20 cents a year and I am dead serious on that! If your a woman stay away unless you like to get harassed from the drivers you work with. Only managers get bonuses for the work of the clerical staff. I got a flimsy drawstring FedEx back pack (which they got for about $5 on the company website) for Christmas. That went straight into the garbage. Overall I would recommend to NOT work here unless you're the type of person who loves to do meaningless work for mediocre pay and doesn't want to go away in life."
bad,I  was shock when I  work for fedex ground  contractors will lie to you no benefits  they push you hard trucks  are junk some of them are dangerous to be on road  the contractor  i work for didn't  care  all he was worried about  was the almighty  dollar
bad,"Work very hard. Manager didn't give us information for schedule, etc. Terminated for one minute late. I'm deaf and had hard time to communicate with workers."
bad,e uma empresa que não ofereci plano de crescimento mas eu indicaria sim pra um amigo.
bad,foi uma empresa que em algum momento deixou a deseja mais foi boa.
bad,"The full time courier position is a very demanding and stressful job to say the least.  It drains you physically and mentally. If you're family oriented, this is not a job for you. I'd only recommend a part time position as a courier, if you're currently employed part time elsewhere and do not have medical benefits."
bad,It is a nice place to meet others it is a fast paced jobs and overall fun if you want a second job.lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
bad,"Started working under a different company American Freightways.  They loved their employees, and took very good care of them.  In turn the employees took very good care of them.  FedEx bought out and the employees were last on the list of priorities. All down hill from there.  I still have many friends that work there and they are all miserable."
bad,"This company dose not care about the well being of its employees."
bad,"horrible company, not what i expected. Fedex Ground hires Independent Contractors who they use to reduce any form of benefits including overtime. Fedex Managers will control the way your work is done and scrutinize the contractor for a driver bringing back packages back in order to reduce loss. In the even a package is lost, they setup interviews with cameras like if your involved in a homicide & treat you like a criminal with police like tactics."
bad,"Was suppose to do 300 or so packages an hour. Managers would set my line to have 1000+ inflow an hour. Ruben was the worst. fat, lazy and didn't know how to do his job. Be careful if working here. They will send 80+ pound boxes fly at you from behind for fun. And if somebody slips and falls, they will try to get you to sign off liability if that would happen to you or fire you for not signing..."
bad,"I worked for a total of 3 weeks and was hired as a driver.  In my offer letter I signed and a benefit to me for working at FedEx, they gave me a guarantee of 35 hours per week, regardless of actual hours worked during the week if it was less than 35 hours, typical week for me was around 15 hours.  The three weeks I spent there I worked a few hours in the morning sorting and moving packages then an hour in the evening unloading the trucks from their package pickups, so about 3 to 4 hours a day, I still was guaranteed 35 hours. I sent my resignation letter on a Friday and FedEx payday's are every Friday.  The following Friday I received only 12 hours worked.  I spoke to one of the Managers and he told me since I didn't work Thursday or Friday's (week prior) evening shift I was exempt from my guaranteed 35 hours.  I never read or signed any policy or rule indicating that if you do not work a shift, (morning or evening) you would not receive your guaranteed hours. I was hired and as a driver not a package handler, my driving course (company mandatory driving course) wasn't set up until after two weeks of employment. I accepted another job and left this place. Drivers are unhappy here and work is labor intensive, managers running around during sorting rushing and pushing employees to make timelines. Managers don't want to pay overtime, because it's policy coming down from the top.  This organization is all about making money and pay is horrible.  I would keep looking for employment elsewhere. Don't waste your time with FedEx unless you have no experience in anything else."
bad,"poor place to work. little to no room for advancement. your degree dose not hold any weight with the company. over worked employees, package handlers are expect to do the work of 3 men in a fast paced manner."
bad,"Was excited to be working for FedEx until I learned about the 14 hour days. The hours are almost unbearable and when I complained I was told that I'm working for a # one company and they only hire # 1's. I took that as, suck it up and get back to work. I am really disappointed, never would have believed the work environment, until I seen it for myself."
bad,"Sound work environment, and positive communications. Employer has the employee best interest. Safety is a main priority. The supervisors take time out to explain things, ensuring the employee understands what and why of the job."
bad,"FedEx is not what it's made out to be.  The management is terrible and the leadership is not aware of what the couriers have to deal with out on the road ( or they just don't care ).  There is no job security.  If you receive three letters in you file within a year, you get fired.  And the items that can be placed in your file are completely out of your control.  For instance, if you deliver packages late, you can get written up for.  If you get sick for instance pneumonia and are out with a doctors note, you will get a letter and it is held against your attendance.  You must be within the 96% in attendance or you get written up.  Also, when you are transferred to a new route, they say that they are not responsible to train you on the new route.  The training in courier school is supposed to be enough.  No maps are given and you can't use a GPS, plus the expect you to make service.  I can go on and on, but you get the idea.  FedEx also does not allow couriers to join a union to protect them from the garbage that they have to deal with from day to day.  The stress level that you have to deal with is mind boggling. No way to work, looking over your shoulders.  I miss working with these very hard working men and women."
bad," it was boring not good at all to work there , i didnt like to work there it was not my dream job but i needed a job."
bad,Typical days involve a presort briefing and daily volume information. Consistent pushing of personnel is involved to stress each person to their limits of exhaustion. There is typically lots of yelling from line supervisors and ignoring basic safety policies. Management is chosen from mostly younger workers and isolated from traditional levels of education and mentorship. Line supervisors are allowed to believe they are managers while ignoring facts of classification. The hardest part of the job is ignoring the inefficiency and waste. The most enjoyable part of the job was going home and knowing that part-time members can obtain health benefits.
bad,started as a temp and the job was great even though the pay rate was minimum wage. Three month later hire as a FedEx as a Parcel Assistance sometime you can be a temp for almost a year and the job is a part time but the pay rate was ok and only 1 or 2 position open for full time. No benefits for part time only for full time. The hours was great until they cut our hours because they add 4 shift instead of 3 shift. Managers switch every year which is not good because some manager can not run the falcitiy. Manager favor there people. This job is great but highly recommended only for College Students. No break. Very Unprofessional place. Co-Worker is great feels like a family. The hardest part of the job is that working so hard that they dont recognize your hard work. the enjoyable part of the job is loading and unloading from trucks. But overall recommended only for College students.
bad,This Job was the least enjoyable job ive had. No advancement offered . low hours .very difficult working eviroment
bad,"I was hired by Tri-State I didn't work for Fed Ex officially, I seen a lot of issues with the way people were treated at Fed Ex and I didn't want to be apart of that. They work you hard for little pay, no bonuses no team players everyone was always looking out for themselves. I have learned a lot from working there, I learned how to use all of the equipment except for driving for lifts and walkies. Management was not on their jobs as in helping the employees. The hardest part of my job was no team work. I like to work as a team. The most enjoyable time at this job was training other people, helping them learn how to do things was a good feeling."
bad,Empresa boa mas o salario não é bom e tem muito desconto.
bad,long hrs. tthey donot care about their people this all i am going to say
bad,"Stressful place to work due to high turnover, hubris and insolence."
bad,Hourly rate not terrible but no guaranteed hours.
bad,though this job gives u a sense of duty but its a dead end job with no benefits and sucks up all your time with no balance result except u get paid a salary amount. you don't get compensation for overtime or bonuses. Also no raises are given or paid vacation days.
bad,"I learned after working for fedex freight all they had to offer was their name. management was so bad I still wonder how they stay in business."
bad,The work environment was horrible. Management was always great but the worker that have been there for a while or felt some type of entitlement made this place almost unbearable.
bad,"Senior Managers and Director allows for EEO violations to occur and allow verbal abuse to employees. Witnessed harassment to Disabled employees and Leads sitting at their desk not working, but playing games on their phones"
bad,"FedEx supply chain. highly overworked, low pay for the work you are doing. Lying management & favoritism, Was told I would work 6:30 am to 3 only to be out on 10 hours and mandatory 8 hours on Saturdays. Now being forced to work sundays. Your job is threatened daily."
bad,Company is moving the Buffalo office jobs to the new facility in Memphis. They have handed out letters advising certain employees they will only remain employed until April 2020 and have also taken back letters. It is a horrible atmosphere to work in. Negativity and uncertainty from the top down. Do not get caught up in this mess unless you have no other options.
bad,"They have people there that treat you unfairly...I was just put on paid suspension for something that’s unfair...I feel like the girl lied too a manager and the manager didn’t want to hear anything I had to say...unfair...I show up everyday on time and do my job..so I don’t see why I was suspended or having a hard time with them...to be honest I believe the girl likes me and she found out I have a wife and started acting weird toward "
bad,"I left FedEx Ground because the job thermostat was very toxic and the delivery vehicles were falling apart and dangerous, The people who worked here were not safe at all and caused damage to themselves and the parcels,"
bad,I would never work for or spend any money with this company I never have had people call you or your name and it's normal. They know how it is but know one cares it's toxic. Most people just don't speak up because they like there check. I quit with no other job because I was being targeted. And everyone knew.
bad,"Don’t even think you’ll last doing this"
bad,"The whole hub needs a lot of work.  They say safety is  #1, but in fact it’s not.  Their turnover rate is very high.  And their outlook is ( anyone can be replaced.)  All my hard work is never acknowledged."
bad,they will try to hassle you when you get behind. When working the trucks they don't like letting you leave the truck till you are done. very hot no ac just giant fans.
bad,It would be a better organization to work for if they offered benefits. For the lack of time that some contractors and their employees have been working there and it not being offered is sad and a disgrace.
bad,"The managers were cool for the most part and coworkers were nice and easy to get along with.  However, people were never on time and it was an every day occurrence for the same people over and over again. Then the same people that came in late every day had to leave early because they supposedly had school. They would leave a mess outside their trucks for someone else to clean up and if enough people had to leave early for their supposed classes, one person then had to do the work of three or four people. I would come in early every day to scan packages to the building (I sometimes switched off with someone else but most of the time it was just me) then had to do everyone else's jobs for them. How about FedEx try hiring people that can work the shift they were hired for? The morning shift was Tuesday to Saturday, but some people (the same ones that would come in late every day) somehow managed to fix it so they worked Monday to Friday instead. Yeah, the rest of us would have liked the weekend off too. If you can't work the shift you applied and were hired for, don't take the job. My advice? Don't take a job here. Not worth it."
bad,"You work too hard for the little bit of money they pay you. They will make you unload trucks by YOURSELF and expect you to unload about 6 to 7 trucks in 4 to 5 hours back-to-back with no break. They offer benefits but you have to work forever to get them, and working only part time, you can't really afford that. There's no real training, management could be better, operations could be a WHOLE  lot better. And they should definitely start out paying at least $14 an hour for all the work you do. It's very fast-paced and somewhat strenuous. Oh, and everyday there's a different start-up time-- which is very annoying. Just pick a time and stick to it."
bad,"Management sucks, its every man for themselves, they train you with the bare minimum am after that your on your own, especially at HTOA AT JFK, was a horrible experience."
bad,"Its a terrible job, literally the worst job I've ever had. They make you work 6 days a week, 14 hour days, and after 6 months i was suppose to get a dollar raise and was outright lied to."
bad,The managers know very little and rely on the good employees to do everything while the lazy people do nothing. The pay is based on how long you've been there so if you work hard you do more work and make the same as the lazy people. It is a backwards company and I do not recommend
bad,"Corporate Policy in not evenly enforces."
bad,"The place where I worked is only good for a temporary job.  The management is extremely abusive.  They will expect you to work very fast and work yourself out of a job.  You may only be there for a few hours, so if you don't live close by it isn't worth it.  They do have their favorite workers that they give full time work to, but most workers get messed around.  A lot of workers like it because they have other jobs, and they work there to pick up some extra money.  FedEx does give their workers raises though.  I would describe the management as sneeky, manipulative and evil.  The management was also very stupid."
bad,"bad manegement, they forgot to put me in pay role i work 4 days they pay me late and 2 days . bad experience at that job i dont recomend you to apply they and they pay day by day no hourly 100 dollars"
bad,You don't get enough hours even though the pay is good. You usually work 1-2 hours on the weekday and work 6-8 hours on Saturday. It's back breaking labor with not enough compensation for the effort. They rush you so you have a higher chance of getting injured at work. They say safety first but it seems that they care more for the speed.
bad,"This is a review in the FEDEX EXPRESS department only. This job is only worth it if you are part-time. Because seniority plays a huge part, disregarding skill, takes 20 years to get an average route with good hours. Insurance rises every year that counters your raise. Have to plan all your vacation days 1 year ahead (Seniority prevents others from getting summer and around holidays off),you always get leftovers.  Fedex Guarantees 35 hours, but if your late 1 minute, have jury duty, or a holiday is in the week, you forfeit those hours and stuck with around 25 hours. Managers try to find reasons to not give you guaranteed hours, like offering you work and if you are unable that one day then you also forfeit the guaranteed hours and they won't tell you that. Good people to work with. I learned FedEx tries to own you with words of growth the company is undertaking. Hardest part of this job is getting placed on bulk routes and dealing with management and HR because they secretly work against those they don't like."
bad,The managers didnt care about people who did things wrong unless the drivers recorded it or they saw it i got hurt and had to come to work the next day it was exhausting
bad,"Working here to build your call center resume is good. This place teaches you how to take calls, and work computer systems at the same time and in a timely manner, and attain metrics as put forward by the contracts they hold. "
bad,"Most depressing job I've had. Don't do it to yourself if you have the choice.If you're going to college, this might work for you. But again, it's depressing... af."
bad,Never know what is going on day too day they keep changing your start time they hire drivers telling them your a city drive but all you really are is a dock worker
bad,The local center has a retaliatory environment when you speak up about issues.   Work assignments are issued based on how much management likes or dislikes you.
bad,The IT security leadership had no qualifications or certifications in security. The director did not understand most of what was required and was extremely indecisive
bad,"Worked here three years accident free. Hostile work environment, I was placed in unsafe work conditions without proper training then threatened regularly for minor details that didn't matter while other workers got away with anything and were given their fair share by their friends, favoritsm, bullying, nepotism, discrimination, being lied to, lied about, people constantly trying to get you fired when your one of the best employees, never being given enough hours to make it worthwhile. Working here I was placed on payed suspension and fired after being cornered by management, cursed at, had my work and supplies yanked away from me and was physically assaulted by two managers because I said no to an unreasonable request. There are much better jobs out there, stay far away from FedEx, it's highly unsafe with terribly abusive narcissistic unreasonable disrespectful management with a personal bias, an axe to grind and an inflated god like opinion of themselves. I also had co-workers shining powerpad lasers at my face repeatedly after I told them to stop and probably caused permanent damage to my vision."
bad,If the assistant manager is not your friend your stuck doing the same job with no chance of advancement. Lower level suffers because upper management is corrupt.
bad,"Honestly, It depends on who your contractor is but they just expect too much and the hours are rough if your new. The money is good if taxes weren't taking out."
bad,One African-American on management staff at a time. People are disposable and shifted around like mannequins. Upper management is hungover on a regular basis and won't remember what he said to you 15 minutes ago. Basically negatively rolls down hill.
bad,management is a joke they talk about everyone with out any consequences dont follow their own policies try to talk to her and the shrug everything off
bad,"Worst management I've ever seen, pay it poor for what you do, and hours suck, if you want to be over worked and underpaid then please apply but otherwise stay away!"
bad,"If favoritism and a hostile work environment is what you seek, look no further. Managers have had several law-suits filed against them, and I can see why."
bad,"Trained for 2 days,"
bad,Get to work at 6am scan and load all packages to be delivered that day.Leave the terminal about 8pm. Deliver packages to businesses and homes. Learned how to drive a truck really well.Call customers to see if I could meet them to sign for package.  Enjoyed talking with my customers.
bad,"Poor communication, loose morals, and lack of leadership. FedEx is a job not a career. Felt like they sacrificed the well being of employees to make a dollar."
bad,"I love the job in itself, the customers, and the accounts. I love being able to work independently without minimal supervision. I do not always enjoy working with the team members I have."
bad,"The supervisors and managers were complete jerks and have never worked for such physio's before in my life. They made the drivers feel like dirt and always talked down to us like we were children. They would harass us and always had us stressing out some drivers were picked on more than others, and when you would bring this to HR they simply would say will you need thick skin working around here. Really? I don't know why this type of prison behavior is allowed in a workplace but, it is and the culture there will not change anytime soon. This is from the highest to the lowest management and supervisor roles. Do yourself a favor and find another driving job, even if it's for 3 or 4 dollars less an hour. Simply not worth the stress and toll that it will have on your body and mind."
bad,Overall my biggest concern is the poor equipment provided for us to enable our progress in a quick flow pace. Especially they rollers you're most likely to leave with a cut or bruised on a normal day.
bad,"Management was very inconsistent with how they wanted packages to be sort meaning everyone had a difference of what is considered a ""smalls"" package but of course you being the sorter that responsibility falls on your shoulders"
bad,Recommended for men only not a female job unless you like working like a man. I have got muscles now when I did not before. The job is hard. However I recommend you work two shifts if you want more money.
bad,"I could not sleep at night if I told the number of lies that an ops manager and senior manager tell throughout the day. They can't keep employees and blame it on the young workforce. They need to look in the mirror and take note. They treat their employees bad.  Money and numbers are the most important issue with them"
bad,"Vous souhaitez travailler avec des cas sociaux, incompétents avec un égo surdimensionné, allez-y!!"
bad,Fed Ex began to rely too heavily on programs and inadequate management to control the routes. It was inefficient and stressful. Senior management begin to push out the employees and lower management to get their way.
bad,"Management was horrible. I only had one good manager that actually cared about the package handlers. But they were relocated to a different facility. Some people were alright to work with, you do get a nice work out but only apply if you want an overnight job for some extra cash."
bad,i am not saying fedex themselves are a poor company but the contractor i worked under for fedex did not know how to manage his routes. There was no paid days off and we were all very underpaid.
bad,prework meeting. then go load/offload trailers with containers via the forklift. fix dollies with containers on them. stage empty containers at other facilities; put them on wood for future use.
bad,not worth the stress and money. if have a chance take a job working somewhere where you look forward to going and not somewhere that make you miserable
bad,"The typical day at Fed EX consisted of you have to resort your entire truck because they could not keep good sorters due to pay."
bad,"Extremely low pay for what was expected.  Inadequate staffing, especially evenings and weekends.  Managers encouraged by DMs to 'delegate' every aspect of their job; they end up leaving early every day while everyone else, particularly the AMs, are EXPECTED to do all the administrative tasks while working alone on a shift and doing all the production work required by customers.  And then are criticized for having overtime.  You can't make ends meet unless there are 2 incomes to a household. A lot of people have to take on second jobs in order to surrvive.  Advancement opportunities are few unless you're willing/able to relocate.  Think long and hard before taking a job here!"
bad,FedEx only has part time jobs for those who work the graveyard shift. You end up doing the most physically demanding job for the least amount of money and the worst hours.
bad,"Decent company to work for. Days are faced paced. Good benefits, Health care, vision, dental, and 401K is decent. Management overall is concerned about the employees."
bad,They don’t know how to run the company.You are workin for a little nothing with long hours in no time for family. People have been out there since company open in only make 13.00 hr
bad,They are hard demanding in meeting a quota that is extremely difficult to maintain. The department I worked in would not participate in the activities they have for customer appreciation week. High demand job stress filled watched all the time.
bad,There wasn’t even time to use the bathroom the scanning system was a joke a lot of people were put on indirect which means that they didn’t have to account for every second every day. Favoritism was so obvious that everyone could see it. Men were held in higher regards than women ever were. Women were definitely singled out and picked on.
bad,"fedex uses contractors so they don't have to pay employees as much. contractor pays a salary which is not worth it. no benefits ,no overtime. heavy lifting , fast pace"
bad,"Company department is dying. No new accounts being added, old accounts allowed to leave with little to no effort made to retain them. Employees aren't allowed to progress. All hiring at management level is done from the outside. Hiring below that level has to be approved at the VP level. Micro managed. Leaders often lack experience in the roles they lead."
bad,"Stressful, hard working,lazy managers,quick to fire you, disrespectful upper management,not too many hours, lazy co workers,depend on you for too much"
bad,I was a package handler and it was very hard to work to life some of the packages. I asked my boss to move me and he refused to do so. It was not a job for me.
bad,This job is ment for a highschool student. You literally work your butt off for just 3 or 4 hours and get sent home. It is not enough hours let alone pay.
bad,FedEx is a ok place to work it's just they over work you sometimes and no hours they don't give u a break it be out and it be cold when the winter come
bad,"management does not care about any excuses, you cannot be late, you cannot call off, you cannot be sick, you cannot clock in or out incorrectly. NOTHING is excused and after 2 or 3 strikes you are terminated due to company policy whether managers like you or not."
bad,very fast paced work sometimes you get breaks sometimes you dnt nobody cares very cold outside cause you work outside very windy if you work by the airport very loud environment cant really here anybody have to talk very loud to here each other so people scream at you
bad,Not a very nice place to work. The only good thing about working at the Memphis hub is the benefits. Management is poor and workers are lazy. There is also a high risk of getting injured.
bad,"Load and unload cargo to and from air crafts."
bad,The benefits only completely support you once you reach management. This job has caused myself and other co-workers several health problems. Sign up at your own risk.
bad,"They push and push, let lazy workers get away with anything, if your not a favorite they treat you like ____, bad communication, hours are awful, avoid like the plague."
bad,Most of the management has no idea what they are doing always under staffed and cant keep people not worth the headache of working there they dont care about you you are just a body for them
bad,"Worked 3rd shift, 11pm to 7:30 am, busy nights, lots of paperwork and computer time.  There were only 4 people on the night shift, got along well with coworkers, hardest part was working the 3rd shift and getting correct training."
bad,The contractor situation is horrible. Needs lots of attention and revamping. I liked meeting the customers. FedEx doesn't listen to the drivers. It's a lot like 'whip and chain' employment. They don't monitor the HOS as they should.
bad,"Horrible company to work for, company is number driven and willing to put workers safety at risk to turn a profit. Often when work gets slow you sit at home for awhile and will be forced to work the dock in the evening which only guarantees a couple hours a day. If you have a family this can be a horrible way of making a living. Supervision isn't always fair and doesn't show equal respect for employees."
bad,"I was told by management there was no chance for advancement and there was no room for extra hours."
bad,"Task is to answer 85 to 90% negative calls and you are restricted to your desk...time in/out for bathroom breaks, etc. The calls are from customers that bully, demean and swear. Forty hours is way too many hours of mental stress and you are micromanaged to the extreme.  Often being evaluated twice a day twice a week.  Nerve racking and there is never a positive word to any of the agents.  There is a back-stabbing culture that encourages co-workers to inform on any slight mistake.  So, not only do you have managers and third party quality control listening in and reporting on your every word, but you cannot trust co-workers to assist you with their knowledge without also reporting you.  I cannot emphasize how unpleasant the atmosphere is.  Part of working is also socializing...if this is important to your satisfaction forget this position.  You have no opportunity to talk, to break, or to lunch together.  All of the schedules are created by a remote location revolving around numbers.  No personal touches here."
bad,"I have work there for 6 month and was told that job opportunity is a great place to start as a full time. I requested training to be a tugger at hagerstown and its been 2 week that it hasnt happened, i assume it must be due to my deafness. I have performed multi tasking doing loading ic and belt - removing package from the belt. I have seen managers not putting alot of effort to help the team and mostly drop more loads to those deaf people and its really sad that the managers all cares is the packages, nothing else"
bad,"High rate of turnover as a package handler, difficult work, poor management, low pay, co-workers needed the job and often worked other jobs as well. Very temporary job if you have to take it."
bad,"a typical day answering the phones, calls had to be answered within 20 seconds and the call had to be finished as quickly as possible, the more calls you answered the better appreciated you were, lack of support from management when there was a problem other than if it was a customer on the phone, the higher up you went the less support you got"
bad,"FedEx Ground does not give you any safety gear the company is short staff,and they require that you to work at your own risk."
bad,"Fedex in Pittston is a sweat shop. Pay isn't great and expected to work hard enough to get injured.  Company doesn't give breaks. On my last day I worked a 9 hour shift with no break. Morale was low, I couldn't find a person there that enjoyed their job."
bad,"FedEx used to be a great company to work for, but now they are simply out of touch with there workforce. Extremely low salary for Administrators, Operations Planners, and Quality Assurance personnel. However manager positions make slightly reasonable pay, but very hard to get into manager positions and to get promoted. Only thing going well with this company is great cheap insurance plan."
bad,"No benefits to the employees, limited work shift /only 3 hours daily"
bad,"Fedex lives by its ""Purple Promise"" to customers, but they do not stand by their employees.  Attention to detail is a huge key factor in the safety of such an environment.  Management does not apply attention to employees and standards are lax."
bad,Upper management is horrible.  Work life balance is horrible.  Pay is horrible compared to equivalent jobs in the area.  Stay away.
bad,"I was promised to be trained so that I could be the best at my job. That was a big fat LIE !! All they wanted to do was write you up when you make errors instead of training you the correct way ! "
bad,Its was a grate job until i got hurt on the job and got let go..i loved to drive the forklift loading and unloading trucks.The management was so bad i seen people walk off the job.
bad,"i think, no i know this is one of the worst jobs in upstate ny. No advangment that i seen, being part time you only get 3 hrs per night!!"
bad,"It's  a paycheck but they work you like a dog  for scraps they're are 4 sorts day, twilight, midnight, and sunrise. You won't really feel part of the fedex team unless you are a manager or some type of admin. security checks a needful but tiresome"
bad,"Where do I begin. I applied at FedEx Express because the pays seemed okay for the work and I figured that with me previous delivery experience, this would be a good fit for me. Man was I wrong."
bad,this company is unsure of what teamwork and leadership involve. selfishness and politics is the reality of this company
bad,Part time job that was very strenuous work with low hours.  The management team wasn't helpful and seem deliberate not to help me succeed.
bad,I worked 4am-10am Tuesday-Saturday. I made 150 a week. I shouldn't  have to say anything more. Terrible job.
bad,They like to puff themselves out but later you find out you have more experience than the managers. It begs how some ever got hired there. Hudson Ohio is a complete joke with management and Uniontown discriminates on males who apply for customer service and dispatch.  They  were fined by the EEOC for this....
bad,I was not happy working for this company and my supervisor always picked on me but I should say my former co-workers are nice
bad,"The job requires a lot of quick, heavy lifting. That's just fine, but the problem arises when managers and supervisors don't tell their employees what's expected of them, even when they ask. Hot headed supervisors are constantly being replaced and employees are being fired left and right. It's an absolute mess."
bad,When I clocked in the package handling began.  I would have to move 300+ boxes an hour of all sizes.
bad,It's sub contractor company and fedex do not care how the drivers are treated by the contractors all they care is that you get your pkgs out on time and thats it decent pay but the company is no good.
bad,Unloading heavy packages for about 4 hours a day. The Pay was okay but there wasn't enough hours a week we were given.  It was pretty laid back.
bad,I worked at this company for less than a year.
bad,well its a fun place to work free food on fridays also the routes are bilt pretty nice and the managers are also on hand to and the turn by turns are good to also over all its a good company to work for the only bad thing is that you dont have no benefits.
bad,To attend depot at 5.30am - sort route and parcels.
bad,I was lied to about everything was told I would work 10 hour days and only did that for the first two weeks then I never worked less than 12 hours. The center manager is a horible boss he could care less about his employees they curse at you for nothing and treat everyone with complete disrespect. There are no breaks and you barely have enough time to go to the bathroom. I could go on and on but I hope you get the point
bad,"Let's just start out with that the management has absolutely no respect from anyone. The reason for this is due to their lack of organizational leadership. Training is non-existent, except for driver training and loader ""scanner training"". I have wasted 5 years of my life at this 'resume killing' company and can't wait to move on. Everyone thinks fedex=ups; this is just not true. The drivers are Not union and don't actually work for fedex. For the Axctuall employes, what little benefits there are, are insulting. I'd highly recommend you look elsewhere."
bad,"Typical work day consisted of working out of your house. Started career working for American Freight Ways which was later purchased by FedEx Freight. I was leading producing salesman twice out of the first five years with American Freightways. Here I sold ltl (less than truck load) freight for eleven and one half years. Later, transitioning over to FedEx Services I was required to sell all the FedEx Services products: express, package and international for 1 1/2 years."
bad,profit before people company for the last several years. let seasoned employees go for absurd reasons.
bad,"learned alot working for this company, was giving room for advancement, training, and ability to continuously better oneself"
bad,Hard work under paid. Management was horrible Did the Job for two years with a 2:30am start time the changed the hours frequently
bad,"I was a package handler. I would start work at 2:30 AM and work to 8:30 AM. It was hard work. Each PH was expected to move 260 packages per hour from a conveyor belt to trucks that were lined up along side the conveyor. The pay was was $9.30 / hr. The were no designated break periods, only bathroom breaks.Once, the supervisor, wwho opened the building, was 45 minutes late. We had all been sitting in our cars waiting. He didn't apologize. The employees didn't get paid. I got paid because I complained, and he was afraid I'd go higher up.There are 8 employees making over 3 million per year at Fedex."
bad,"Working for FedEx is no easy task at all, all employees are hired as part time. The work is hard and very fast paced, the hours you receive are horrible. The only way to move up in the company is to take on triple your work load and kiss up to the managers. Those people who come to work everyday and work above and beyond the call of duty are stuck with the same entry level position they started out with, because the managers are afraid they will excel beyond them."
bad,best and worst place i've ever worked.
bad,"was very difficult, they didn't really try to work with you if you were struggling."
bad,The job is simple enough. But the culture and management ruin it for me. The worst part about working at my particular location is the schedules that they offer are terrible.
bad,"Dead end job, only 3 promotion areas, lack of money, cut  throat employees, little respect for employees, ""customer service"" is a joke. And during flu season it's like working in a petri dish!"
bad,"There is no room for human error. The management is a joke and the only thing they care about is their numbers. You don't get to explain your actions and they only look at your numbers, not the work that you do. You are not recognized for helping the team only getting your numbers up. Management only cares about making their boss happy by faking numbers."
bad,I have no review for this company but they do not value your time and stresses production and pushing files for their daily goal and the manager allows the leads to manage and the manager just sit in the office and do nothing but talk to her grandbaby on the phone. Very unprofessional
bad,"First of all I'm talking about fedex Express (Not ground)!! The trucks look the same but are definitely different..They stress you out with too many deliveries,want it done super fast! And if you get hurt bending over backwards for them, they are quick to point the finger at you and tell you that it's your fault! Management are pure puppets. Stay clear!"
bad,The workplace had bad lighting and no motivation for any worker to want to succeed. The managers lacked actual leadership skills and failed to motivate and control their workers. The workers themselves acted like they never wanted to be there and made new employees feel like they made a mistake.
bad,This place dont care about anyone but the company  hire bad people and fires good people no help at all and the managers dont care one bit who cares not fedex
bad,"Work role is not bad, corporate is solid. Extremely wide range of working Enviroments depending on direct managers/branch. Some are great some are other."
bad,"I honestly used to enjoy this job a lot until I learned more about the company and management at this particular location. At the FedEx Ground station in Grimsby, training for package handlers is minimal. You learn so much more by talking to the drivers who can show you the best way to load the trucks but FedEx Ground management dissuades drivers from talking to the loaders because the drivers ""are not FedEx employees"". True, FedEx Ground doesn't hire the drivers, they hire contractors who bring with them a team of drivers and this is a terrible business model. It saves FedEx money but also allows them to use the contracts as a noose around the contractors' necks when they want. They bully the contractors into firing drivers if they don't like them by threatening to pull the contract or by preventing them from getting new delivery routes. If FedEx management really wants someone gone, they'll back the contractors into a corner. So there is a lot of mistrust and a lack of teamwork between FedEx management and contracted employees."
bad,"Great Operations Manager but horrible belt supervisors.  Belt managers talk down to package handlers and treat them with no respect.  They “talk” safety but then yell at you if you are taking too long to get a team member to assist in a team lifting.  There is one manager, younger than everyone there, and he had the knowledge and people skills and surpasses all management!"
bad,Garbage company. They treat drivers like trash. Trucks are all falling apart. As a delivery driver you will be working for a third party contractor. They do not care about you or your saftey. Revolving door of employees. Training provided is not nearly long enough. Steer clear of this place if you value your time.
bad,"Managers just flirt and make the pretty girls do nothing and make everyone do all the hard work. Mostly managers are hired in 3s they choose one black, one Mexican and one white person, and they usually have no package handling experience"
bad,"Did my duties. And left. You only advance if they allow you too. Dont matter what's on your resume. these people will just tell you  to do something. People leave whenever. Its all types of reasons on why finishing your task will drain you, hurt you,and stress you out. Frfr"
bad,If you want to work like a pack mule while constantly being yelled at and harrassed by managers then this job is for you. Not much concern for your safety because you're a dime a dozen. They have to constantly recruit new workers because people constantly quit.
bad,Managers gives the company a bad name and make the job so much harder then what it should be. We also feel like if the manager dont like u they will do everything in thier power to get u fired. One girl on my team had a miscarriage and her doctor took her off work for 3 days and the manager wrote her up when she got back n said it didn’t matter that she had had a miscarriage and Fedex has a no at fault policy.
bad,"You will be shocked at how this warehouse operates. It got me thinking how is this warehouse not on panorama! The conditions are horrible! Cramped space to work (you are guaranteed to bump into at least 3 people per shift) heavy lifting which I accept BUT to lift something heavy inside of a container that keeps moving and shaking because there is 4 people in a small container full of boxes is not on, on top of that when there is a spillage they do nothing about it because they are in such a rush to get the job done. People are very angry in that warehouse, so many people swearing/shouting at one another. The manager was shouting at someone the other day saying ""1 box every 3 seconds or you're out, you got that!!) I overheard and thought wow the poor man has been working tirelessly all day. Fair enough he's the manager. Health and safety wise I cannot believe nobody has investigated this place! The whole warehouse is a hazard, ropes, plastic, spillage, sticks, wood everywhere you look, people trip all the time but I don't know why nobody says anything, maybe they don't know who to speak to. Agency workers get treated like rubbish but thats everywhere I guess and it shouldn't be like that. Induction was signing papers and then off to work, no videos on health and safety no clear demonstration of the work & it all lasted 15 minutes top! 1 man started shouting at me saying you put the box in the wrong trolley, he was screaming! I said I'm sorry I didn't know, he replies dont you have eyes are you blind, I said sorry again and then I said who's the manager here he replies I am in"
bad,"Management all came from fedex call centers and they have a chip on their shoulder for anyone that didn't get to ""go home"" like them and was actually hired as an at home agent.  The managers could careless about the customers they are only out for the almighty dollar."
bad,"Good job if you like working at night and sundays pulling doubles"
bad,"Bad management, start time for the preload shift constantly changes. always under staff and try to slave you with work. Start time and end time are not always accu so you can get overtime."
bad,"Was told when hired that Full Time hours were available, but when I started working, manager said there were too many employees and not enough need for work for full time. Wouldn’t recommend unless looking for a second job."
bad,"If your a person who values your family, keep looking. If your not ok with being harassed and bullied, keep looking. If your not ok with doing your lazy coworkers work ""and their are many"", keep looking. Training is dismal and your ridiculed for errors, job is always threatened. Management doesn't care, your seen as their servant. You'll start as a part timer and work so little that bankruptcy will cross your mind. If you survive part time and earn full time, go ahead and cancel all future Doctor, Dentist,  special events because your moving up 14 hour days, 6 days a week! Why not 40 hour week you ask? Remember, lazy coworkers."
bad,FEDEX is a company just like many ...it was work for and definitely a building stone .Long hours and Nights taught me many things in safety..I learned mostly everything I know here.
bad,"provides steady work,but does not treat employees well. work/life balance is not good.  employees are underpaid for what is expected of them. benefits are decent"
bad,"management is horrible, change schedules at the drop of a dime. insurance benefits are the best part of the job. favoritism  displayed regularly try to force you to work over scheduled time to get off. no set   time to go in in most areas."
bad,"A typical day of work consisted of me picking up the slack for lazy people who just showed up for a check.  Some in management overworked the good employees, and allowed the slackers to do nothing, for the most part.  The hardest part of the job was finding another employee who could actually do the job correctly, to be honest.  Simple instructions were hardly ever followed, and telling someone how to do it correctly was taboo.  The most enjoyable part of the job was when it was over."
bad,"Do not take this job you want to work 50 plus hours a week. The overtime is mandatory and excessive. Management and leads are the worst that I have ever experienced. Especially leads. They get no leadership training and are constantly telling you to work harder and faster. You are encouraged not to take breaks and don’t even think about asking a question. You will be talked to like you are an idiot. Really, really sad place that needs a takeover."
bad,"You don’t have an end time, you’re done when everyone’s met the daily load number. Some get a half hour break for 12 hours of work, you’re only provided a coat rack, it’s uncomfortably hot in the summer."
bad,The pay isn't what it should be for the type of work and the expectations of the job is more than one person should handle. Constantly losing people due to low hours and and low pay.
bad,Fedex borde uppdatera deras sätt att jobba. Vissa chefer har jobbat alldeles för länge och jobbar på samma sätt de jobbade för 20 år sen. Det känns som man jobbar för en livsbutik runt hörnet.
bad,"Not a job in which you can retire. Strenuous, and no time for family or self. Great pay, but overall, not worth it. Has no benefits because it is contracted. Must be able to move up to boxes up to 150lbs five to six days per week. Work long hours five to six days per week. Very physically and fast paced if you want to get home"
bad,A normal day would consist of setting up the area in order to prepare to get started loading the freight very efficiently.  It is very fast paced at night so setting up the area is very important.  I have learned a lot from this company that can better prepare me in life as an individual.
bad,"FedEx is a in between, i just have to work, i need somerhing ASAP type job. The Management across the board is terrible starting at the top and trickling down to the ops managers. They talk to you any kind of way and expect you to be scared of them, they don’t respect you. Highly competitive, no recognition other than working you harder cause you prove can do it. Temperatures are extreme, and please don’t get hurt that’s another battle in itself even if it’s not your fault."
bad,"The most physically demanding job ever,and to make matters worse have to do split shift 6/10 then back in 2/6.30 workload terrible management only interested in meeting targets staff are just cannon fodder,Be warned keep away as go thru ridiculous amount of staff,this comes from the top so don't see any change any time soon."
bad,"Company pays great, but it's a ""hog board"" situation. There were weeks where I only worked one night to cover for someone who called off. Every bid, you can get bumped off your run for something else."
bad,Its very productive and the emolyees get things done.  However the management at fedex can be improved.  The supervisor can be nicer with her language.
bad,was out sick with the flu even had a doctor's note the halethorpe md location is out of order. They fired me and then turn around and put a 6 months ineligible on me from being hired a better fedex. There is always short work favoritism
bad,I hate working here. the management wasn't good and the pay rate was not good at all for the hard work we had to do. The schedule wasn't working good with my school schedule
bad,"my time at fedex was terrible. i was never allowed hours that i needed to literally live. their would be weeks that they would call me saying ""dont come in all week unless we say so"" the job draws you in with 16+ per hour then you end up getting 1 hour a week if you dont do 6 bills per hour."
bad,They don’t like veterans at the Reno Sparks Nv. terminal. Since I was there the only two veterans that were there were let go because of the racist remarks and political remarks from the Hispanics. They don’t like anyone who is affiliated with the Republican Party. I would not recommend any veterans apply with them.
bad,I worked there for over 6 years as a supervisor.  Typically we worked 10 - 12 hour days and never was allowed to take a lunch break.  You are treated like a number not a person.
bad,"very high paced work, extremely long hours, demerited for packages that were undeliverable, incorrect address on packages, scanning equipment failure occasionally"
bad,"At my store they cut down the staff from 6 to 3 but addded more metrics to conquer. There are no yearly bonus, there is a .30 raise(hopefully) Professional expectations with amateur wages. They have an extremely high turn over rate, because of their lack of care for the retail stores."
bad,"A typical day includes 8+ hours, quick decision making, and a overall feeling of satisfaction from taking care of our customers' freight and making sure it arrives on time and damage free.The most enjoyable part of my job has been interacting with the employees there."
bad,People talk about each other and are disrespectful.  I lot of safety issues.  They say they are safety conscious but nothing is enforced. No one follows rules.
bad,"Fedex is a great company to work for, however my terminal itself was so poorly managed. Communication was very poor, shady things were happening behind the scenes and the operations manager was having relations with the full time assistant so she was allowed to get away with everything."
bad,"no quailty of life other than constant working from morning till night."
bad,Management shoves responsibility and tasks off to others. Manager in particular constantly changes the rules of the workplace and abuses power. Metrics for success are inconsistent and depend on the mood of the shift manager. Hard work isn't fairly compensated. Work reviews are more about what emotional state the manager is in rather than any hard facts or metrics.
bad,Very unorganized  the management  over work employees to save time slow paced advancement opportunities no incentives need to offer training in different positions for advancement opportunities
bad,"FedEx is very strict. If they showed more appreciation to the employee's I wouldn't have minded the lack of personal involvement. I understand it a business and they have a company to run, however when you start to be move concerned about the numbers and quantity over  quality of the work and the state of mind your employees are in its not a good combo."
bad,Not a well ran location....most employees were upset with manager and manager would be upset with them...not a team atmosphere. Needed leadership from above to come in train everyone on correct systems
bad,"Do not work here unless you plan on losing weight.It is a sweat shop, it sucks to work at. Its in a cold open warehouse and the supervisors are slave drivers."
bad,Meet new friends when first time work fedex and they be telling me be work hard and no break so u got be positive but one thing managr don't care who stress or angry manger and boss too so my friend help me and make me happy so I miss them
bad,"These are some snakes... If you have a deep throat and are willing to get bent over atleast once a week its Great!! the guys in the shop are mostly cool, atleast one guy on each shift is trained to be a rat. overall the company is ok, benifits are decent. but the staff and management seem to all have their own agenda and none of the policies are are consistant with other shops or for operations for that matter. If you can show up on time,thats all the experience and knowlege you need."
bad,a typical day was exciting. I learned how to deal with co workers. the management was horrible. my co workers were horrible. the hardest part was management.
bad,"I was bullied continually through out my employment, management did nothing to help. I broke my leg and they said I didn't do it at work, denied my claim and I went without pay for 3 weeks. When I was out my medical benefits were not taken out and when I returned to duty they hit my check for 8 weeks leaving me with $100 a week. Terrible place to work. Management sucked, my co-workers sucked. I hated every day I went there"
bad,it's too crowded and hot. The pay isn't well and you don't get enough hours. The management is awful. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you clock out.
bad,"Wouldn't recommend this, even if your struggling... Slight easy work, BUT you have people that still think that there in high school, and complain about the job all day!  You don't work long enough to complain! 4hr Max! That's all you get each day, barely made $145 a week.... Management is just as lost, finger up ther butt all day. Throwing boxes all day! Sad to say it.  FedEx USED to be a great company! But bottom of the barrel and then Some!"
bad,"Fast pace company rules and regulation base environment, no room for individuality. No room for creativity. People are very closed minded, everyone is running around, having dozens of meetings and conference calls but nothing is truly being done unless it is  already in the rule book. I don't know how the company maintains, because everyone is always  trying to do something but no one knows what to do or how to do it unless there is a meeting or conference call. If you are a square peg this is not the company  for you. They will try and fit you into a round hole,mold you into one of their players, beware you will not  know what you are doing all the time.They have no idea what they want as a productive, happy team member."
bad,"A typical work day is coming in super early and making it home super late. For the most part, I came in at 5:30-6AM. Upon arrival, I begin to load up my assigned van. Depending on the size and amount of packages, I leave to drive the route between 8AM-10AM. My route was Locust Grove. There was much traffic and dirt roads to deal with. To make matters worse, I was expected to know the route by heart within the first week. Moreover, the printout of the route provided was almost always full of errors leading to missed stops and much wasted time. On top of all that, I was working under a contractor with promises of making a certain amount per week, which never happened. Long story short, I came early and made it to the terminal usually between 10-12PM EVERYDAY for about a month straight. The only thing that was good was being alone and listening to my personal playlists of music."
bad,little to no leadership supervisor  had no mechanical background 3rd shift is the busiest shift there is no one in charge on this shift when problems occur everyone points the finger at the mechanics outbound after outbound with no time to get secluded work done it don't matter how good you are someone will always nock you down and throw you under the buss no one cares about 3rd shift  I could go on but im going to  leave it at this don't make the same mistake I did look around go to more than one interview the manager is a nice guy and will rope you into something you don't want to go into cameras everywhere people always watching and waiting for you to make a mistake probably the worst job ive ever had
bad,"No life work balance, too demanding, too many road blocks."
bad,I didn't have a good manager or team leader it was a stressful environment working with the manager and team leader I was put in a uncomfortable position to make the manager and team leader look good but at the end all the work fell on me
bad,"Asst. manager is bias, promotion should be  based on qualification, Asst. manager does not follow those rules, Asst. manager promotes if he likes u or what can u do for him. He surround himself on people he can rule and control. Working 12 to 13 hours a day, with no relief in sight. If you work 9 to 10 hrs. Asst. manager  will look for a way to keep u there for 12 to 13 hrs."
bad,I was lied to about everything was told I would work 10 hour days and only did that for the first two weeks then I never worked less than 12 hours. The center manager is a horible boss he could care less about his employees they curse at you for nothing and treat everyone with complete disrespect. There are no breaks and you barely have enough time – more...
bad,"I have work there for over 15 years  and each year was harder than  the previous year, all though most employee are hard working and kind people  the few that are mean and make it hard for the rest of the working crew"
bad,micromanaged company zero error environment an a mundane management crew
bad,I was here for 5 years.  It took them 18 months to hire me from the agency.  When they hired me I was then a temp for another year.  So it took half the 5 years I was there even to just be an employee.  Very little teamwork goes on at Fedex Trade Networks.  The supervisors/managers were not really interested in teaching you anything new.
bad,"The pay and benefits are very good, but they will stab you in the back if given a chance.  Co-workers will lie through their teeth to avoid taking the blame for their own screw up."
bad,"A typical work day would consist of a staff of 4 employees doing the work of 6 or 8 people at times. Management at times turned a blind eye to the needs of their employees when requesting more employees for help. I learned that management requires constant communication with all levels of staff from top to the employees doing the work as well. My co-workers were a joy to work with giving the working conditions, very upbeat and positive along with hardworking. The hardest part of the job was trying to take breaks with a shorten staff. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with hardworking people."
bad,The Contractor i had was the worst. You only did well as long as you slaved for him. You couldn't take off to adopt to a family emergency or you will be fired. There were no benefits and you slaved for minimum wage. The only good thing was their value ob safety and the networking potential. 
bad,Fed Ex Freight is the reason there are unions. Management does whatever they want to who ever they want.
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of unloading packages off of delivery trucks and placing them onto the shipping conveyor belt to be sorted. Once sorted packages were scanned and reloaded onto the appropriate delivery trucks to be taking to their final destinations. This is because of this job I have learned how to be through and efficient with my daily tasks."
bad,I Would want to encourage any one to work there. Did learn anything. Co-workers are great. Management show favoritism
bad,"a typical day at Fedex was long days and fun coworkers, horrible management,"
bad,"A typical day is lifting up to 150 lbs and driving a forklift.. the dockworkers treat each other with respect, but the supervisors just treat the dockworkers horribly and with no respect.. The most enjoyable part of the job is driving the forklift."
bad,"A reasonably compensating place but that`s about it. By far the most frustrating place ever. If something can go wrong, it absolutely will. There is some ability for advancement, if you feel like putting in that much work. I have always found my co workers to be the most amazing people ever."
bad,"Do not work here if you value your sanity or your dignity. Management has unreasonable expectations and HR is not there to help YOU. There is no work/life balance because they expect you to be on-call/ go on break if you don't have enough work/ stay out all night if you have too much work. Their core values are numbers, and the stock price."
bad,"Do not work for Fed Ex in Anniston, AL. They make you work for 14-16 hours a day with little pay. And the management is bad."
bad,Don't trust no one they only look out for who they want and they try all about you to other employees the management is poorly. It's a favorite type iij f job if they don't like you your getting no hours
bad,I responded rudeness with their forceful nature and over aggressive rude behavior is disgusting and despicable.... they pick on little guy mentality bullying people ..... you don’t know hours til a few hours you have to b there.... they expect you to b on time even tho you don’t know when they have to b there..... your expected to be flexible with them without them understanding they don’t tell you.... they defend indecent behavior.
bad,Sups and dockworker are great people just hope you never have to deal with the oms in a 1 on 1.  Terrible people both at work and outside. Don't understand how they even made it where they are.  They have no clue what actually goes on on that dock
bad,"A typical day at work consist of co workers talking about each other. "
bad,"Managers are slave drivers. throw you under the bus. "
bad,"There's nothing much to say besides they don't pay enough while they hire few permanent staff members while rest of staff is on yearly contracts with no benefits or sick/vacation days.  Also, lack of growth is another reason why there's a high turnover rate in FedEx Trade network who don't seem to care to retain.  Only good thing is dress code (causal) and random BBQ/Pizza parties they have to show their appreciation"
bad,Horrible place to work at. No breaks. Managers are good and awesome people but ignore when there is a problem between you and a co worker. Wouldn't recommend to anyone working there.
bad,"I didn't enjoy it not on bit, it was almost impossible to learn my route since it was being changed every other day the pay wasn't good since it was a contractor pay not hourly. No benefits at all very fast paced and sort of competitive since you had to rush to get the job done on time or in a timely manner."
bad,This place was awful. Completely overwhelmed with work. Short staffed and it shows. If by chance you can catch up on your own work they immediately send you to help somewhere else. You barely have time to breathe! No breaks at all. Even using the restroom for five minutes will put you so far behind you'll never catch up. The shifts suck! Never the same start or end time. There are better jobs out there.
bad,I did  not like  the job to many  heavy boxes  and the employees were very unfriendly  but they did have great  benefits  401k good hours  and a okay management  team
bad,The management is unorganized. The site its self is unorganized. If something goes wrong on the line it always comes back to the package handler not moving fast enough or not doing their jobs. You get less the 17 hours a week but they do garuantee 17 1/2 hours. There is no overtime no matter how much they say there is and it almost seems as if there is special treatment for drivers...
bad,Ask about Fed Ex Direct in the interview its something new they ever said any thing to me about Fed Ex Direct i was hire under the influence i would be working for Fed Ex Freight but Direct is like working for a moving company its completely different from each other so if you got a bad back this is not the job for you and all new hire got to go to Direct tell some one new come under you the different one you are just dropping pallets the other you are lifting coughs and refrigerator with your back.
bad,"The management at fed ex shows extreme favoritism."
bad,"If you are anything other than a full-time employee or driver then you mean absolutely nothing to this company. They could care less about anmout of hard work that you do, it's all about time you've put in. I've seen people who are some of the worst employes I've ever seen get promoted just because they were there longer. One of the worst company to work for today."
bad,I was only averaging about 25 hours or less weekly. The pay wasn't even enough to support my lifestyle. Driving from where I was and working the hours I was I only had time and money for gas.
bad,I worked there for 5 months .. in 98 degree weather they got irritated when we wanted WATER . I was the only girl on my dock and I swear my boss didn’t take it into consideration that I might’ve just developed slower than the MEN who have been working there long before me . Good money tho if you feel like killing you self for more than 4 hours a day . Good Luckkkk
bad,"The management care more about filling in forms and ticking boxes than getting the job done "
bad,"I worked for Fedex Logistics as a Sr ECO Import Coordinator for a year and a half. There was a three week training, they will tell you during training that you will not be taught the actual work you are expected to know when actually get on the floor working! After training I was lost! They gave me so much work I couldn’t keep up with, being as though I was new. Management is HORRIBLE! I wouldn’t recommend this job to no one!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME! You will regret it!"
bad,"Fedex does not care about the employees, this company does things just to make themselves look good. Fedex Freight is a racist company, the only way a Minority can advance, is to belittle themselves."
bad,"At first its a great job using a fork lift and driving around, then after about two weeks it sucks so bad because it is the same thing over and over it makes me lose my mind, I would say stay clear as well it took them almost six months for them to connect me to set up an interview and thats with me calling weekly to check the status of my application"
bad,you're lifting heavy packages and sorting them by destinations. the hardest part is lifting and working in hot and freezing cold environment. the most enjoyable part is the cafeteria.
bad,The work day varied from day to day. Work loads were unpredictable. Upper management was not supportive of lower level employees. The work environment was unstable. FedEx does provide fantastic employee benefits.
bad,"This was the worst job I have ever experienced in my life . The managers are unreasonable and don’t know a thing about respect. If you cannot lift over 100 pounds while working in a fast pace you might not work here because the managers will complain to you . This job is extremely stressful on the body . You will wake up sore every single day . This job will hurt your body in some many ways from your back to your hand and feet. You get out every day at a different time depending on how many trucks there are which is very annoying. If you like a hardcore workout and getting disrespected by poorly trained managers , go head."
bad,Been part of the winning team in building FedEx for the past 20 years. It has now become a profit focused company that doesn’t care for its people. Leadership is terrible and mixed with poor talent from TNT. They had removed the annual incentive program and likely to cut pay soon. Workplace culture is also toxic and robotic while career progression is bad because many middle managers are not willing to move. Please think twice before joining them.
bad,Very unorganized and dysfunctional workplace every day there was a new obstacle to overcome. You never know from one day to the next whether or not you will work 6 hours or 10
bad,"I enjoyed working for Fedex. However, after years when i tried to apply for management. I spoke to all of my supervisors even the ones above my own in the store to make them aware i wanted to improve my skills and be a manager. Well for 6 months i tried over and over again. But it never went through the position i applied for was given to someone else with no skills in our business coming from another company. I was very angry with the decisions they made when i have been training to be a manager. My original hiring manager saw my skills but when she left (retired) i was left in the dark. No one to help me to move up. SO YOU NEED TO KNOW SOMEONE TO GET MOVED UP IN POSITION. Its not fair! I will not recommend Fedex unless its only temporarily. I am a veteran with enough leadership skills. But Fedex lost a good person and working employee. Good luck on their business. They will ""manage."" Also what i noticed too in different locations the people who are managers suck! I had to step up and find solutions or connect with customers to come back for Fedex."
bad,If you are seeking employment with (fedex) for whatever position you applied for learn everything you can about that position. And unless you’re trying to move to a different position Stay I the one you apply for . Management will ask you to   fulfill other duties with out  being trained for them as well as receiving proper compensation for the tasks asked of you
bad,"I have learned a lot in FTN, the experience has been great, and I am graceful  that a big company is in Miami to give opportunities to diverse people."
bad,"The North Salt Lake Location (NSL) has very low morale."
bad,Working for a contractor just depends on the contractor.  Typically the pay should be better for the work that you are doing.  And the benefits don't really exsist.  no work life balance.  Constant work.
bad,Advancement you can go above and beyond. But do not hold your breath. The management is bad and you are dealing with a quick in and out type of work space. So do not expect to gain a work relationship with peers.
bad,"Lack of full time positions, only part time positions. No growth no stability. Working conditions horrible. Management goes with only favorite employess"
bad,"Bad experience for me, start as casual could not get permanent part time, full time dont even think about it. "
bad,bad place to work the manager is so unorganized and does not know how to run the floor at all he has packages coming down every shoot witch is like 20 but only has 10 works so everyone is running all over to take care of backed up trucks and it never gets any better.
bad,"They will work you to death, they lie about packages weights. Blame drivers and try to charge you for complaints they don't follow up on. The they just allow Chewy,Amazon and Ebay to ship anything without scrutiny of the packages. Place you in unsafe vehicles ."
bad,It's a good job if your trying to keep good  benefits and that is all it's also good for you if you are going to school everything after is not worth it they don't give good hours the managers are very rude and uncomfortable to work with also they do a lot of hour cutting for no reason
bad,"Everything is smooth unless the managers want to mess with you."
bad,Was fun but stressful and fast paced. Really short hours and low pay for the amount of hard work load we had to do. Job was extremely tiring and exaggasting.
bad,I do not prefer to answer. I barely remember. I remember i had to pack the boxes/package in the truck. I was very hot in the work place. Sometimes they over worked us.
bad,"i had a awful experience,it was a lot of work driving during winter time those big trucks it was too scary, but that was my opinion for those who like to drive and have a daily amout of stops to accomplish i recomend the job"
bad,It's a lot of drama with the supervisors they are not organized at all in Ashland Virginia. AND THEY MESS UP YOUR MONEY. The customer service is never answering the phones.
bad,"The company provides what I feel is great benefits to the employees. However, there is not a lot of opportunity for growth. Job is challenging at times. Truly learning a lot at this company."
bad,Depending on what contractor you work for will determine how much you enjoy the job. Management that I worked for  was so so. Only issue I had with the company was the days being 12+ hrs
bad,I couldnt keep up the boxes where way bigger then me and they wanted me to pick them up by my self I rehurt my back from not getting help like I should have
bad,"Hands down worst work experience of my life."
bad,Supervisors show favoritism. One in particular will work the good hard working people in the most strenuous positions and be lenient on the others giving them next to nothing to do. Very unfair of him. He never wanted to shift the people to different positions because of them complaining about it and he losing out in friendship with them or them quitting on him.
bad,"It was nice being outdoors and alone working at your own pace. "
bad,"I really cannot give a good review, I did not have my dream job, however, I was able to accomplish taking the ASPIRE training."
bad,I worked for Fedex Freight  in Alabama for over 10 years they claim to be diverse but there not the only way you see minority workers are when your in a minority based city all small towns I would bet my last dollars they have bare minimum minority workers they didnt even have no minotiry help in the office and few part tomw dock hands.The management is horrible they micromanage everything drivers are just a number especially a minority driver with a voice and opinion even when he or she is right every minority driver that works for FedEx would agree with me but most are scared of loosing their job or too blind and act like it's not happening like the civil rights movement didn't happen.If you work In the North Alabama area pay attention to the race of the Drivers in the FedEx Freight Trucks trust me it's very few minorities and it's not because we're not available and qualified they just not hiring us or they find a reason to fire us.
bad,Negligent young managers and older management unwilling to change who only promote those they like. I worked there nine years was passed over for multiple jobs because I was outspoken. Poor level of respect for the customers packages. Don't use fed ex unless you get the insurance and even then be ready for an in convienence.
bad,"terrible. lack in numbers of employees so 1 person calls out, youre stuck working harder than you are to get out. managment plays favoritism and ignores practically any request you make. they talk behind youre back. bad place. good pay."
bad,Late nights/ hard labor days are done/nice respectable people/very quiet not a lot of talking/ physical labor/getting off work.
bad,"A pretty easy job once you learn the myriad details about how everything MUST be done.Forced to work very long days, e.g. store closes at 5pm but not leaving until 10pm or 11pm. Scheduling is hardly consistent cannot even make plans a week ahead. Was employed there for a decade and left making what is considered a typical starting salary at many other major companies.Easily become overwhelmed when there is a line out the door and there are two staff members behind the counter. The worst is the micro managing that happens at every turn. This coincides with the fact that a procedure is taught one way for about a month than voila it is changed and has to be learned all over again. It is really fun when a procedure is brought back from many years ago, one that team members spoke up and stated this procedure works well, but corporate said no our way is better. It is an extremely frustrating place to work, one is not appreciated by the company or the customers."
bad,"From 4:30-9:45 we were to have 3 trailers unloaded then after completing that, you would have to take the boxes that weren't able to go upon then belts,. We would have to carry and transfer them to other  sections of belts on the ground floor."
bad,"the problem was way too much work in a very short amount of time, not an employee friendly workplace and would not recommend"
bad,"coworkers are jaded and hate their lives"
bad,"Hours, pay & benefits are good while attending college"
bad,"If you like being talked to like a dog, this the job for you.! Management is Very unorganized, and  walk around with their nose in the air. This is one of the many reason fedex can't keep employee's. When hired they preach about the fedex family...FAMILY??!!. I WOULD NEVER TREAT OR TALK TO MY FAMILY LIKE I WAS TREATED AT FEDEX.! Do you self a favor keep looking."
bad,Top Heavy Corporation. View older employees as a burden and expensive liability. Would prefer young inexperienced workers than older experienced workers.
bad,"unloaded trucks"
bad,"Difficult days because weather can be a factor if it's extremely hot or cold.  Job has no variety, it's very routine and boring so one must be able to make the best out of a boring, difficult, and hard environment.  Most managers are cold, deceitful, unsympathetic and completely uncaring about employees' personal issues.  Managers are TOTALLY focused on their jobs, afraid for their jobs, and generally unhappy people which filters down to the work force.  The only thing which makes the job tolerable is the people with whom one works, and if they are cold and difficult like the managers, it's almost intolerable.  FedEx really doesn't have much to offer people except great benefits and tuition reimbursement."
bad,"Awful place to work!! they do not care about special needs, Just the money and resourceful doors that are opened up because of their disabilities. Was not impressed at all they are very unprofessional!! they are always putting adds in the newspaper stating that they are hiring......They never advertise the name of the Buisness ( because they don't have a good reputuation) they just advertise the job description and a telephone number!!! .......And they don't like individuals who aren't afraid to speak out........which is why im no longer there!!!!"
bad,"I was hired as a Linehaul Driver making $22.50 an hour.  I was laid off. After, I was rehired as a Linehaul Driver, I was responsible for picking up and dropping trailers averaging $14.00 hour (pay scale was based on how many drops and hooks you could do).   I was with this company for over a year waiting in line for a Linehaul run.  Of course, I never got that chance because FedEx could not retain anyone after me so I could be promoted.  At that pay, I worked very long hours and the employees that were making a higher wage got very few hours.  If you work for this company, make sure you are hired for what is advertised.  And you know dispatch was absolutely horrible."
bad,"Sups give little or no direction when needed, and say next to nothing when you ask them an important question, and then you are left to guess, and if you guess wrong, then they tell you to change it.  Which wastes time. You drive all the way in there and they could cut you after working 2 hours--and it can happen quite often."
bad,Wouldn't recommend it to experienced warehouse workers. Rules change constantly. Management is sub-par. Equipment is below standard. Almost everyone is out for personal gain. Very few actually care about doing well for the sake of the company. No sense of motivation for workers.
bad,"A typical work day at FedEx Employee includes negative emails, very low work morals when it comes to other employees. I have learned a lot working here, however there is no advancement within the company. I enjoy my job very much just not the negative atmosphere. The managers here are nice however they are people pleasers, and that will not get the job done in a timely manner if we are not working as a team. The most enjoyable part of my job is when the members that I help are happy and leaving my office smiling.  "
bad,Kept us after 5 years then replaced everyone who was with Watkins earlier before they sold out to fedex
bad,They only let you work 3 hrs for five days they dont offer full time
bad,Co-workers are enjoyable to work around. Everyone is trained to pretty much do everything. Your job title doesn't really matter too much. Management is okay for the most part.
bad,This company does not promote a quality of life. No promotion opportunity. A person can start out with a good work week and by Friday you are wrote up and almost unemployed.
bad,Hardest place I have ever worked. I was never valued after putting 14 hrs days and did work that was not mine. They made me work on my days off and up to the end I was working 6 days a week.They don't care if you are burned out. I worked 2 yrs without vacation and if you don't use them you lose them with no pay. The bosses don't care to here your side of the story. The most misable place to work. Up side I made good friends.
bad,"Management falsified my first day of work. Then, when I had trouble with reimbursement receipts, I was automatically accused of falsification."
bad,"I like the atmosphere of not being in the same place all day, benefits of meeting new people."
bad,"Unless you are a brown nose, forget the gaylord plant (freight) the drivers run the way it works. they don't follow company procedure. Was told when hired it would upset some because of overtime and a new guy.....but would be backed up by management. WRONG. the first time I stood up for myself I was let go and told well he's been here 19 years......Its hard to be so perfect. Stay away. Only 2-3 hours a day after being promised 5-6 hours plus begin driving???? right!"
bad,Good company. There is no promotions within the company. They do not seem to help their workers advance in the company
bad,"Many issues at this  company.  Management is lacking extremely in many areas.  Poor communication.  Hub breaks their on policies. Ops Manager does not enforce t as tardiness, therefore  expects you to carry the load of the repeated offender."
bad,"Going on my third week here but I wanted to leave by the second day. I'm not digging the scene here at all.Seriously,this place blows.Safe to say I won't be here long. just got to have something else lined up."
bad,"Here are just three reasons why I would never EVER work for them again. There were many many more reasons, but here are the top three."
bad,"Hi es gibt bei FEDEX keine stabile Struktur es mangelt bei Managern die man einfach so oben eingestellt haben ,sowie den Mitarbeiter die einfach so eingestellt werden ohne Qualifikationen keine ausreichende Deutsch -Kenntnisse "
bad,Tooo much favortism supervisers dont respect the employees always cursing. And show no compasion when it comes to family émetgancys ..one minute they seem sincere the next there trying to fire you for no reason
bad,"The managers make it seem like you don’t exist. There is almost no way to tell the time when you are working. The managers claim that they “work” with you on things but in reality, I tried talking about my schedule multiple times and was never called to discuss about it. The time I had to miss work, I was told to “just not show up, when I write you up, just remind me why you weren’t at work.” The job application/interview/orientation is misleading."
bad,They will make you feel awful about yourself. They assume that anything else going on in your life isn't as important as your job. Its ran like a high school lunch room.
bad,Very stressful work inviorment only place i ever worked that starts to look for reasons to fire you the same day that they hire you managment requires all employees to how write ups in there work folders at all times for termination purposes.
bad,"It a challenging job and u have to be willing to work,u get benefits and raised,incentive,you can move up,work hard but be safe, you have to aware of your surrounding."
bad,You were require to unload 3 to 4 trucks a night in a very short 2 to 3 hour time span. This is too much work to ask some one to do in that amount of time..
bad,"Horrible, no hours, I'll be lucky to get 14 hours a week..yes I said 14, yes I said : A WEEK, managers always on so much more, but only 150 characters"
bad,"They work you hard, be friendly to you face, but sometimes it slips when they treat you like a misfit. They talk trash behind your back and what you to work harder. This is management im talking about. Everything you talk to them about goes in one ear and out the other all the way to HR. Senior manager is a functioning alcoholic. Nothing will every change, it just gets worse and worse every day."
bad,"It pays good money, but honestly if you just want to be treated like udder garbage, then this is the place for you! Rewards tattle tales for giving false information and false threats. If you decide to go anyways, well it's your funeral."
bad,"I don’t recommend anyone who has asthma to work here. I’ve seen people who had to get rush to the ER because of how hot it be in the summertime. Managers sleeps with employees. Managers shows favoritism. Very fast paced. Alot  of RF scanning, palletizing and wrapping pallets."
bad,"Absolutely horrible New Management! "
bad,I leader truck and life heavy boxes  I like the people it good company they paid u good  and have sat off it good company work for if didnt wanna work ur body
bad,"You don't work for FedEx, you work for a contractor, so there's no benefits no retirement no sick leave, very little vacation days, job is very hard on your body most stuff is heavy and big"
bad,"My time at FedEx started really well. I love the first two months. Hard work, but it was good work. No drama or anything. Just mostly heavy lifting. It took the company a month and a half to get me a badge which we needed to work properly or ensure payment. After that, I was moved to tug driving and worked under s different manager. It was all down hill from there. Turns out that the area I begsn in was kind of designed to be ""nicer"" than everywhere else to ""boost moral"". Everywhere else was drama and a complete lack of rules or disipline. The managers often would make unreasonible or unsafe demands and anyone who disagreed was suject to bias. The managers go unchecked, leaving them to bicker mostly and cause drama and they would often ignore problems with the employees."
bad,"Fedex can have the potential to be a GREAT working environment, but unfortunately with management that's impossible. Nobody take's responsibility for they're mistakes and overall no one works as a team."
bad,Worked there for over 9 years to begin with was a good job but declined over the years especially when they were buying TNT I was buillied into changes they forced through no work/life balance they played worker against worker treating one more favourably divide and conquer I was sacked at the second attempt
bad,This company doesn't care about their employee's or their customers products. They see packages that say Fragile and literally toss them on the ground. You hear the contents of packages break and management does NOTHING.
bad,Fed ex does not pay enough for the hard work. The hours are very low. Employees consistenly quit because of the hard work and no pay. I would not recommend this ob.
bad,Great benefits .Just watch your hour many managers have you to clock in 15 minutes early then refuse to pay you for time worked. In the process of leaving been taking 15 minutes  Every night for about a year or so. I did not apply to work for free. A EEOC matter but I am just going to leave quietly because FedEx sponsors A lot of people and companies. 🗣🗣🗣The struggle  is real #5111293
bad,"Learned more about receiving, hardest part of the job was standing in one spot the whole time and only getting 2 breaks for 12hr shifts.I only enjoyed being able to be paid during lunch breaks."
bad,"Very fast paced, low volume warehouse, they expect you to move around 40,000 packages on an average of about 2 1/2 hours.  Rules only apply to certain people, favoritism is shown especially towards people who have family also employed at the same location. Little to NO opportunity for advancement. DO not depend on this job to keep your bills paid, the benefits compensate for the small checks. I would advise anyone over 30 to keep looking for a part time job, the environment is very elementary so there is alot of two faced, back biting going on."
bad,Part time employees have a set amount of hours but as time goes on hours are usually cut. Seniority is the number one priority around the place. No breaks.
bad,"If you want an off-balance work life, working long hours and feel unappreciated...work at FedEx! Poisonous work culture with no support. Training system is non-existent."
bad,"The majority of the work required is outside. You will experience all the elements of the weather. If it is hot outside, you will be hot and so on. Uniforms are provided but only after you complete the 90 day probation will you receive the rest of the uniform you need such as coat, jacket, and rain gear."
bad,"Started each day at 6 am and scanned and loaded your own vehicle with usually 180 or more packages.  Dispatch was usually late due to a late trailer.  Delivery usually took 6-8 hours and usually were not able to begin delivering until 9:30-10.  In addition to running a route, I was also a manager and responsible for Safety and training all new employees and I was paid about the same as a regular driver."
bad,"Managers do not care about your wellbeing. Being a package handler may have a lot of benefits, but the employs often refer going to work as going to jail. ""They treat us like criminals"" - former coworker"
bad,"it is a good place of work for people, the salary is bad, it works many hours for little pay, no benefits, many hours of work and a lot of stress, the prsonas keep stressed by the hard work"
bad,They work the employees hard and there’s no recognition with the hard work you put. They don’t go above and beyond for their employees they’re not always treated fairly
bad,"Never should management tell employees they are just a number and can be replaced in 15 minutes."
bad,"The hours are unpredictable, The will send you home early whenever they feel like it. They give you the mandatory break every three hours but it feels like its too short."
bad,they dont care about their people. We got outsourced and some people event taught the people who were replacing them. Glad I did get outsourced to move on in my career
bad,I would recommend better management and ways to handle the work load. Also I would recommend better compensation for the hard work being done there. Along with that more hours.
bad,fed ex ground warehouse. package handling and distribution company. the work is very physical and hands on. it can be tough starting off but a person can adjust over time
bad,FedEx is it very aggressive performance job oriented corporation requires workers to work beyond their ability at times very difficult to work with management
bad,"I managed 6 to 8 drivers depending on the volume make sure they scan and load there truck help them to get out so they can go and deliver packages to customers, there's nothing hard about the job the most enjoyable part of the job is I have good employees team work"
bad,"Very stressful job for the small wage they give the workers on the sort (package handler). everybody except the one's who do the hard labour get the credit and the big pay cheque  ,team leaders play the role of boss and half the time they can't answer a question related to the job."
bad,Working at Federal Express was a fast paced environmental company that required you to have the speed and accuracy needed to fulfill the job...I enjoyed working there however what was told to me wasn't as promised once I began to work for that company...There was a lot of mislead information and I was sorely displeased...
bad,working at fedex is not funpay sucks hours suck and there is no opportunity for self improvement working at fedex is hard but not really just not a good place to work for personal and mental reasons
bad,"no hours no break and nothing that interested me to move up too"
bad,Nobody stays long. Terrible management. They are too laid back with the people they like. Workers are not treated equally.
bad,"Email- Checked email for updates and important topics that need to be followed up with employees. Checks for hot topics that need to be presented for employees (printed out these topics and saved for meeting). . "
bad,"They expect a timed delivery which is impossible to do, then they get rid of you for poor performance. You actually work for an outsourced contractor whom doesn't stick up for at all."
bad,"His turnover with employees is ridiculous, don't work with him unless you want to lose your DOT. What he does is illegal and he shouldn't be allowed to have a business license. There are better owners to work for than him."
bad,A company that has only just taken over old ANC delivery firm in the UK. Mon - Fri. 30 minute unpaid meal break in a 8 hour shift Most enjoyable part of the day -  going home for a shower!
bad,"Fedex ground auburn location "
bad,"Fedex has horrible hours from what im working it is only 1.5 hours a day which isnt even worth the time it takes me to get there. The management is not any better. they scream at you for not moving fast enough and the way people move up in the company is by being buddy buddy with the ops managers, theres no other way around it. only thing working at fedex has going for it are the benfits."
bad,"Management was awful. They treated employees like slaves, that's the best comparison I can make. I was injured on the job and wasn't at fault but they treated me horribly and when I was removed from work (doctors orders) my boss called me and told me if I did not return to work he would fire me."
bad,"onloading and offloading aircraft for the ramp portion. I've learned a lot about people and how to dress for any type of weather. Some of the management is great. Others so so. The hardest part of the job is trying to inspire everyone to work hard. Everyone gets the same raise, even if you have perfect attendence and the person next to you calls in the time. No motivation for employess to perform above others. Since Obama care, the insurance isn't so great anymore. And you have to work days and nights to get any hours. This is a great job for someone living with parents. You can't make a living here and since there are no performance based incentives, you can imagine the attitude that a lot of employees have adopted. You can move up the ladder if you interview well, it's not performance based. Hence so so managers. They do have tuiition assistance, but they don't pay for your books. I used to love this company, but it has been heading downhill for years now. They can't keep any help because they don't reward their people for their skills and hard work. Your just a number here, it's grown too large. They also put people into positions that they aren't capable of because they don't want to be sued for discrimination. But you wouldn't just send anyone to space or to a construction site, but they put 70 year old frail women pushing 3000 pound cans, who can't climb ladders or pick up heavy boxes. Just no longer a fan of this company, I used to be proud to work here."
bad,Job security is ensured but management has a long way to go. A lot of learning is provided along with skills as well.
bad,"This company treats you like a worthless slave. The management is completely two faced. And every package handler hates the job. The main reason we put up with FedEx is the benefits. Job should pay $20/hour for the kind of labor they insist upon."
bad,Harsh work environment and with low benefits. Would never work here again if i have a choice.
bad,"The Perrysburg  location is very racist, and when people try to advance, they are shot down, unless your kissing supervisor's behinds, you will not advance HR is ignorant, the gossip ing is so out of control, I met sone very down to earth people there, but of the other co-workers I worked with was beyibd lazy, and multiple compliants were made and nothing ever happened, I eventually left, along with about 5 other very good worker's, I kept getting harrased by a supervisor, because I did not care for working with someone on my team but I expressed multiple time and so did others I almost got injured on the job twice, because of that person, but still got harrassed, because I wanted to be moved somewhere else. Thos company says that they strive on diversty and ethics..yeah right! The pay and benefits was the only good thing there, and the few people I met and worked with."
bad,"Lots of great folks in IT, for the most part. Very serious violations"
bad,"Was a great company to work for when I started, but it is not the same anymore."
bad,When their I position opening if you're not a friend of the management team. You won't get the job .to much favorites in the company it would be a better place if they got rid of the management.And. start with a new one.
bad,"Zero funding of bonus incentives and declining pay increases, despite strong profit margins/results.  Benefits are no longer competitive, as compared to other fortune 100 companies."
bad,The money can be good ..ground driver earning 1100 a week . Hours are terrible. Get used to the fact that you might be getting home at 8oclock at night and while driving home you will see families out together or walking in resteraunts together and know that will never be you.
bad,"Nothing left to say. Nothing to say "
bad,Management does little to nothing about overall morale. The f word is common place and the drivers are so pressured that they HATE their job. Lack of respect across the board. The cleaning man knows more about you than you... due to management yelling across the hallway to each other rather than just getting up and going to the next office to converse without advertising who is doing what. Favortisim towards employees who have 15+yrs in as those who have this seniority stay at the conveyor line from punch in to leaving while everyone else is unloading aircraft and distributing packages working to no end. Why those who have been there the longest do not have to sweat and others work to exhaustion is questionable in defining teamwork.
bad,Way over worked for the salary no time off and if you call out sick you get in trouble the next day honestly it’s like being in grade school where if you did something wrong you got punished
bad,"Service JDP (jour de plus) jour ruiné par une manageuse ultra incompétente (Nathalie S), hypocrite et qui s'accroche à son poste envers et contre tous."
bad,typical day starts at 4am. the belt starts and im pulling 50-100lbs boxes off the belt to load down a trailer ranging anywhere from 80-110 degrees until about sunrise. I suffered massive dehydration and rhabdomylosis.  fedex showed no sympathy and told me that's what I signed up for. when I asked to speak to someone else. they ignored me. I then asked to speak with corporate and they said fedex ground didn't have a corporate office and refused to help me in further
bad,"Very bad place to work, I never  work in canada  as fedex. My experience  was terrible with this company. Hr department training department even all management is   poor..."
bad,"fast but enjoyed it, good part time work,hate management, hot and cold and I hated working with racist white people and manager. also good pay for pt work"
bad,Working at FedEx was not good. The pay didn’t match the amount of work I was doing was there was also no breaks. The managers there were kind of rude and expected to much at a time.
bad,Management is a big problem. The pay is pretty good and the discounts are too. You have no breaks unless you are full time. You must work for time off.
bad,"Fedex is a terrible place to work and want to grow with. The people are rude and the pay is good, but the management is unnoticeable and lacks want of acknowledgement."
bad,it was a great place to work unfortunately you needed to be with the company 20 plus years to expand to higher levels and i was being stagnant when with my military background should have more advance position in due time.
bad,"this was a fast paced job. The management would push contantly until finally you make a mistake, then they want to write you up or worse. Also they don't listen when you try and explain that there is a problem."
bad,"Long hours, poor management, good benefits, low pay. Not really any room for career advancement. Management is bad and doesn’t care about their employees. Work is stressful & days are long and you are unappreciated, overworked & underpaid."
bad,A typical day at Fedex Ground was stressful. Manager have impossible expectations and were never willing to help. The hardest part of the job was the managers expecting you to lift something outside of your limits.
bad,I left FedEx freight because there is no room for advancement. I really hate saying this because honestly I loved the job! I loved the hustle&bustle! I have alot of energy so my nights went very quick and it was great pay. But I wanted to move forward with the career but there was so many family members and friends working there it seemed impossible to move forward.
bad,Management does not appreciate hard working dedicated employees. Case load and Investigations relative to customer needs. Never a chance to be a real investigator. Other  things not related to job title.
bad,"It does not matter how fast or slow you work, your job will be safe. One person they make run around all over doing lots of pickups and deliveries, the next guy has 1 or 2 stop and can take all day and nothing is said. Some guys drag their feet and get 10 or 12 hours a day, others they say go quicker we need to watch overtime. Really hard to plan finances with a bipolar manager and supervisors."
bad,"a lot of heavy lifting by myself ...normally have to stay when others don't show up, manager was trying to leave so not really concerned with issues that need to be addressed"
bad,"Stressful place to work at. Full of people looking to pull you down and slow your growth. Management is not really supportive about complains, totally bias, and unfair in how they treat employees. One basically have to suck lots of boots to get anywhere....Monstrous amount of gossiping going round the company and at all levels...."
bad,FedEx is the perfect job for insurance benefits. But is also a hard job because of the work load. 4 hours feels like 8 hours.
bad,unloading the trucks and making sure all the boxes went to the right place the hardest part was working a double over night shift
bad,From the moment you clocked in it was go time. I myself am motivated naturally so to due such a demanding job is easy. I expect to challenge myself thru my will to succeed. The job alone takes a toll on the body but as simple as it was I enjoyed the workout.
bad,"HR dept. is the worst  I've ever experience in my life, the lies and deceit.  They make up there own rules and don't follow protocol."
bad,"Over worked, under paid where managers steal your checks. Warehouse does not have air condition and during summer days can be very hot and uncomfortable."
bad,i used to start work at 3 am and get all the parcels ready for the drivers when they came in at 7 am it meant loading and unloading of trunk lorrys
bad,typical day at work is being assigned to a truck to unload.Learn how to work at a fast pace.Management is very nice.My co- workers where the best.The hardest part of the job is have to pick up big packages and load them on the line.
bad,"The only good thing about this company is the benefits and somewhat the pay. Company is shady...if you are looking for advancement, you can only get ahead if you are favored or injured. When it comes to injury it is ignored."
bad,"FedEx was not what I expected it to be,"
bad,Over-rated company to work for. Makes profit by engaging in illegal labor activities to cut the cost of labor like: no Overtime pay for workers who actually work overtime and no breaks for management.
bad,"I worked for FedEx as a Line Haul Driver. Due to limited freight. I had no runs. The manager asked that I shuttle until thing pick up. This was ONE BIG MISTAKE ON MY PART. Shuttling from terminal to terminal (2 mile radius), paid very little money. You are NOT paid a wage or milage pay: you are paid on the number of trails (doubles), drop/hooks and fueling. Please do not take this job on Mooreland Ave. in Atlanta, GA. You will work 50 plus hours and bring home around $575.00. I was there for 9 months and I never got a line haul run."
bad,very rude management.
bad,The hardest part of the job is dealing with the other employees. Someone always out to make their job easier by being lazing and having the next guy fix it. When it's slow they cut hours like crazy. Management rarely if ever does anything that lasts more than 2 weeks.
bad,"Una gerente mujer me presionó porque yo le caía mal desde un inicio en su oficina me hizo renunciar a la semana que me conoció y  yo todavía estaba en capacitación de sombra. Me acerqué a ella para que me ayudara a solucionar un problema de acoso laboral que se presentó con tres compañeros nuevos y en lugar de apoyarme a pesar de tener pruebas  me acoso ella para renunciar y salirme en lugar de reunirme con los tres acosadores laborales y tratar de ayudarme con mi situación ya que ellos eran los del problema conmigo , yo con ellos para nada. No te apoyan ,solo te usan mientras les sirvas y eso solo nos contrataron para la época del buen fin 2019.FedEx SMO apesta !!!!"
bad,"Fed Ex wasn’t as big a problem as the sub contractor that ran for them, worst contractor in the whole depot. They lied and stole money from you. They were always setting people they wanted gone up to fail. The people were always the higher paid,"
bad,"If you don’t own route(s) you’re basically going to top out at or around 130-150 per day. No benefits, no sick pay, some contractors don’t even do vacations no matter the time put in. Fedex doesn’t care anymore since they contracted everything out. It’s also going to 7 days a week."
bad,"Empresa TOP filosofia maravilhosa "
bad,"First i would like to say, it was ok job but the only way you get paid decent is if you know your manager and he/she acknowledges your hard work effort, because they'll use you up like a rag doll to make sure you sweating and drenched before the morning is over, 2 nd the hours sucks badly on Monday's it would always be short Staffed and double the work and mind you its in 100 degrees stuffy warehouse with only one side of Big doors open, 3rd they don't discuss hygiene so you'll most likely work with someone with a horrible smell thats unbearable have you about to barf and breath that was terrible, certain managers we're rude and lazy. I have nothing else to write about but my personal experiences"
bad,"Algumas pessoas lá na empresa são capazes de TD para se dá bem , quando falo são capazes de TD é de TD mesmo"
bad,Nothing was like when I first started. I really like the upper management. They were polite and legitimately wanted to hear for you. My immediate manager never had anything good to say about my group. I enjoyed working there during peak. After peak the environment became so negative. I had 50 awkward packages that weighed 68 lbs. The label on all packages says how much it weighs. 2 days later I woke up and couldn’t get out of bed. My back pain was so severe that I called off work for a week. 2 weeks went by and my back pain was no better. I couldn’t bend over. I couldn’t bend it over. Walking up stairs was painful. I asked to be moved and they wouldn’t move me without a doctors note. They knew I didn’t have insurance and couldn’t go to the doctor. They didn’t even try to help me even though I was fourth coming.
bad,"I started at 2:45am and worked until I was dismissed, usually 6:30am. Work was very fast paced and stressful, with much lifting of heavy and light packages. I worked for three different managers, two of which were competent and understanding of how hard the work was. The culture there was fast paced and stressful! The hardest things about working for FedEx Ground was EVERYTHING (lifting, carrying and NEVER being allowed to slow down, EVER!) The most enjoyable parts of the job were the friends I made and GOING HOME EVERY morning."
bad,this was a fun place to work but there was no space to work towards management  also the compensation was very low for the name fedex. i would not recommend anybody to work there
bad,"I did not like this job. I like fast pace ,but this is a high energy job requiring physical work. I often got sick and woozy. I also had a mental break down when told to ""have fun"" and that have to improve my work. They expect 500 packages loaded an hour. For some who wants to move a whole lot and has energy, this place is for you. They will hire ANYONE"
bad,It’s a alright job very hot you dont get brakes water is provided if you don’t like the heat and moving fast this isn’t the job for you and there’s a way to stack the boxes correctly
bad,"I enjoy working with people and working as a team mate. I've learned alot on the job like, scanning packages to where it goes, and pulling and putting containers on to where it goes and also to the flight or truck routes.  Management I don't wanna speck about that.  The hard part is the material or package, product can be so huge its hard to carry and hard on the body.  Most, of all I enjoy the people who i meet and work with laughter and move on!"
bad,"great company .. got the good ole boy stuff going on in the fleet side"
bad,The managers preach safety once a week in a meeting and then proceed to tell you to ignore it so you can work faster. Little to no accountability. Best part of the job is the very occasional free food.
bad,Its a production based job. If you can't make the department goals they threaten your job. Lots of over time. Management is very unorganized. Treat employees like children. Management makes job very stressful. Hard to move around in company because of favoritism. Just note you can do better than this job!
bad,terrible schedule and too heavy of a workload with hours in the early morning no appreciation for your hard work and dedication to the company
bad,"Loading and unloading trucks, Organizing addresses and packages for delivery, Highly multi tasking past paced"
bad,"This is a hard job. Most people never make it through the training process. There is no cutoff for how many boxes/stops you get a day. What is on your truck is expected to be delivered that day no matter what. 100% delivery rate is the only thing that is important. You work as a contractor, and receive none of the benefits from fedex, but your required to follow all fedex rules. Overall not a job for everyone. Too be fair, you may get a route that's actually easy but that's rare because people who have them don't quit so you are usually stuck working a route no one wanted. And don't forget about peak season and tax season in which your life outside of work, for 3 months, will be non-exsistent. Treadmill, king size mattresses in boxes, exercise bike, engine blocks, dresses, tv stands, and anything else heavy(150lb max) will be on your truck every day."
bad,"This job is designed for people who can do no better than work mindlessly for 12 hours a day, five days a week.  If the lack of communication and intelligence from management doesn't drive one to the brink of insanity, the mandatory 12 hour days and inclement weather will.  I was once told this job will make smart people miserable, and dumb people happy.  This couldn't be more true.  If picking up boxes and putting them down sounds like your dream job, then Fed Ex Freight is the place for you."
bad,they have wonderful management. I was just not cut out to handle that type of shipping and handling..
bad,it was good but part time and very limited hours and no benefits
bad,"Import agents never talk to each other, except discussing shipment problems. If you are an introvert and can sit 8 hours a day this job is for you. They have the cleanest restrooms in the world because I was the only one who used it, literally. Chained to that computer...ugh."
bad,"Non climate control... hard work very very hard work ... low pay ... bad management.. disrespectful, rude managers .. no breaks .. only get 3 to 4 hours no help on heavy boxes & a total back breaker"
bad,"So I’ve worked for Fedex almost a year I came in as a lead and it’s been the worst experience of my life. Not only am I treated poorly and the staff have no respect for you the center manager doesn’t know much about his crew and how they treat people. The last few weeks I regret working here ,I wasted time and I could be anywhere with less money and be happier. Store 1703 makes u feel like a idiot no matter what."
bad,if you are weak or fragile dont work here unless youre in an office. its hard labor everyday either loading or unloading a truck. managers for the most part are nice. money is decent
bad,"Not sure why fedex is rated so high with 4 stars. The pay is low, .50c above minimum wage. No AC. Personal items have to be left in your car or lockers, which are outside in the heat.  Long boring orientation that really isn't needed.  Oh and if you quit dont depend on them paying you.  It's been over 7 months and they still haven't paid me. Look elsewhere!"
bad,"This could be the number one Company to work for. Management and policy makes it hard. No laughing or making the job fun. Military style ethics. If I wanted that, I would have joined the military. No one cares if you're sick, your child sick or dying. They want you to show up and after your finish, go take of the situation. They don't care if your not making hours, not making enough money, your treated like an animal. They USE people and discard them when they are through. The turn around speaks to it. No positive moral in this environment. Appearance sakes, looks good, behind the scenes God Awful. Shame, Shame, Shame. Depression and Suicide levels should be extremely high here. You will definitely need therapy after working here. Seasonal work is fine because it's temporary, otherwise, STAY FAR AWAY, PLEASE!!!!!!"
bad,"If you ever wanted a career where you can make money fast. Fedex is there for that but the price is your soul. Say goodbye to any semblance of a social life because you'll be at work six days a week, fifteen hours a day."
bad,"You never know what you'll be doing from day to day, the hours are constantly changing, even from day to day, and the hours can be really long....even when you think your going to get by with an 8 hour day...it will change"
bad,While individual members of management will work with you the over all culture is to bully and belittle employees to work at unsafe pace. No amount of hard work is rewarded. You are constantly left feeling demoralized.
bad,"I been working there for a few weeks the managers are really rude I mean really rude. You have to come every day on peak season no days off if you work part time you work 4-5 hours and there’s 4 sorts Day sort - 1:00pm-5:00pm twilight sort 6:00pm to 11:00pm mid-night 11:30pm-3:30 am and sunrise 4:30am to around 9:00am you work 1,000 hours you got benefits this job is really hard and not for everyone. People are bad so go there make your money and leave. Paid Time off after you complete your 90 days and benefits after 1,000 hours or 6 months. They don’t drug test you on Fedex and for my understanding they hired felons depends on the case misdemeanors they don’t care. Start pay 12.00 hour. You meet a lot of people there 400 employees per shift"
bad,"The people are pleasant to work with, management is terrible. Nobody does their job and nobody does anything about it. They've honestly run the place into the ground, the warehouse is growing, and every manager they hire has less and less brain cells. It's really a shame to see it happen. For those of us that did our jobs, it was a pleasant place to work with fair pay."
bad,"The expression, "" You are paid for your work."" is as serious as it gets when you work at FedEx. You are part time because of the horrible shifts and nights or morning you sacrifice to load the trucks with packages. Pay was okay and it was weekly but it isnt much because you only work 20 hrs a week. Really tough work lifting packages 75lbs and more. Bending and twisting constantly and many injuries are a result. Falls are a near death end because of the extremely hard concrete surface"
bad,"If you like driving this is a good job for you, You just need a class b cdl  and hazmat to drive a straight, but they also have cargo van and sprinters,"
bad,Team is overall great but management is horrible if they don’t like you they will make sure you won’t progress at all. Horrible scheduling and they don’t care to much about family life unless it’s thiers
bad,"FedEx is a great company. The opportunities are very high.  You can transfer across the globe if desire. Every Center is different, but over all I had a great experience working for this company."
bad,No benefits of any kind. Company doesn't care about its drivers or Contractors. Company has a weight limit of 150 lbs but doesn't enforce it they will let packages go through over 150lbs and won't give the drivers any help to deliver them. No concern for there safety.
bad,"Great Benefits, Poor Management. I enjoyed the fact that I had benefits to support my family and myself, however, the workplace culture was very discriminatory."
bad,Management does care about its drivers will tell you they do but in the end they do not. Unorganized at times and not very efficient when routing stops.
bad,Had to work as fast as possible to move as many boxes as possible moving very heavy boxes around 2AM to 6AM. made 12.75 to start and got raises often with 0 work experience before coming. Boss was rude.
bad,"The people and managers were amazing people, the experience was great, the only bad thing was I worked 3 hours a day and it was 1 hour from home, I would recommend for people who love close to job site"
bad,"Managment at FedEx freight doesn't appreciate there drivers and don't know how to communicate with employees ,had a lot of issues with another employee,he was harassing and treating me and another employee and brought te attention to managment and Human Resources and never did anything about it"
bad,"Learned customer service skills, how to multitasking, job security, typical day at work is amazing"
bad,"everybody is likable in this company, we help each other and consider each other as a proper member of our family ."
bad,"a lot of prostate milking goes on, managers are lazy and like to show favoritism. men act like its still high school and the try to act tough. the work is very hard back breaking work with no incentive."
bad,"I like my job, as what i do. But,"" there's no Benefits, paid Vacation. I work for a Contractor with a weekly salery, and if you want to take time off, you don't get paid"
bad,"I worked at fedex lax hub for 3 years and just resigned last week. Very fast moving place, good pay but NOT enough hours given. The people in charge, show favoritism, and make it difficult for others. I've seen people fired over time card errors or even tardiness. Fedex is not a easy company to move up in unless you have a lot of seniority. My 3 years obviously wasn't enough seniority! My pay didn't raise but 60cent in my time length. The work can be overwhelming and difficult especially for a girl, like myself."
bad,this was not a fun place to work. the only thing i really enjoyed about this place was some of the people i worked with
bad,This is a steppong stone job. You should only do this job if you have no job and try to get another.
bad,Fedex is a good place to work but it depends on which Fedex you work at. While being at Fedex Ground i learned how to scan the packages at a steady paste.The management is ok but could be better. The coworkers was ok and fun to chat with. My hardest part of my job was peetseason but i made it through. Well having a job their isn't a enjoyable part of the job but i do enjoy making money.
bad,"Bad morale, no leaders, no direction, they harass people and no one is happy there. They don't treat employees well and expect to get new customers. Never work here."
bad,"Don't get in trouble for they will look to replace you rather then working through or fixing issues. The process to appeal for a job is a jock, expect to give a statement and only answer direct questions with no ability to elaborate."
bad,"I worked here for almost a year , WHEN YOU CLOCK IN UNTIL THE TIME YOU CLOCK OUT YOUR WORKING. They will definitely work you and they hate giving breaks you only get a break after 6 hrs. I remember one time my manager didn’t give me a break and I asked her. I worked 8 hrs that day she said she was going to add a 30 min punch out for a break I didn’t take because she would’ve gotten in trouble."
bad,They main concern is if the package gets off and there is no safety concern. DANGEROUS work space. The workers are treated unfairly and the managers answer with a quick remark.
bad,If you don't have back problems or your a younger  wouldnt bother working here. Management treats you like bad. HR are the rudest people ever. Cant call in number does not work.
bad,You get a pretty good amount of pay an hour but you only work 4 and 5 hours a night. sometimes they make you leave before your scheduled time. the only thing good about this job is that it is easy money and a quick hustle.
bad,"They are quick to fire you over anything. Instead of working with you and giving you verbal warnings. They would rather let go of good workers. Only thing good about the company is the benefits and tuition reimbursement, everything else sucks. Fedex has a high turnover rate and they wonder why people don't want to work for them. People getting hurt left to right, it is too dangerous out there. You have to watch your every step out there. You have to be safe out there or you will end up hurt or killed."
bad,Not a place for a family person as they dont seem to help anyone who have family matters after my son was born i tryed my best to leave as this was no place for a family to work management were rude
bad,"As a package handler, the job can be very taxing on the body. If you're looking for a great workout while at work, this is the place. A back brace would be really helpful."
bad,A typical day at work is coming in and doing what you have to do to get the job done. FedEx Smartpost management suck. The managers don't know how to talk to people. They think they can talk to you any kind of way because their above you. Some of my coworkers were nice but you know people have their days. Everything in that warehouse is EASY. Nothing is hard.
bad,Hard labor job where the managers do not support or care about their workers. I enjoyed working with my colleagues because there was a clear understand of what needed to be done to support each other until tasks were were done. Outside of colleagues there was no support from the managers or CEO's of the job.
bad,"Load/unload, sort, scan, move outbound to proper loading docks, team work"
bad,"short hours low pay"
bad,Typical night at work consisted of processing freight thru the Small Package Sort System non-stop until quitting time. The management and co-workers were diverse and wonderful to work with. The most enjoyable part of the job was quitting time and then off to the Buffeteria to play a little cards and eat a little food! The job wasn't hard at all.
bad,I felt the company cared more about numbers than they did their own people and their well-being. It was more about how well you performed in a position that ill suited your strengths and when I asked to be transferred to a position I was familiar and comfortable with I was denied then they suggested I resign
bad,they never knew how to do something never trained us never helped and never there when we need they they would just stand there and watch us work they made me so mad
bad,You work for contractors so they don't pay really well. They don't give you any benefits or vacation time. Working for the contractor is not that great but wouldn't know how it is to work for FedEx the company itself
bad,It’s okay for now not for a long term goal. I’m only doin this so I can apply somewhere else . Fedex is okay but there Are better jobs than this I promise you . All the labor you put in is not worth the little money they pay
bad,We really worked as a team to pull some unbelievable things together.  Long cold night pushing packaging. Learning all types of new machinery. Having to keep a good memory for all the numbers that had to be crammed.
bad,Co workers cool ! Got paid every Friday worked in the warehouse so it’s not much to say it wasn’t hard just packing packages and delivering. Would recommend
bad,"Just quit there a couple of weeks ago due to finding a better job close by and man I would not do this job as the supervisors will work you to death like you're in a plantation and the pay isn't even worth it (Highest pay was my orientation week). Unless you need the work experience, DON'T apply for this job."
bad,"Was hired at one of their job fairs. The jobs most of us applied for were already filled internally, yet this was not disclosed ahead of time. Jobs that were available were misrepresented, I was told completely different days and hours from what it actually was and the work itself involved running assembly lines for Philips and Norelco-not handling packages for FedEx. Hours are 50 a week minimum and during peak season, weekends are mandatory as well. This is one of the most disorganzied companies I've ever seen. 8 microwaves for approximately 75 employees on one shift, no cell phones allowed in building, but no clocks available anywhere even though some jobs require hour by hour record keeping. Training is poor, communication is poor, etc. Wages are poor considering the amount of work and training you need to perform some of the positions."
bad,It was alot of hard work for very low pay. They don't take care of their trucks or equipment. Management blows you off and just don't care. You're better off looking elsewhere.
bad,Worse company to work for especially if you going to work for ground fedex. They will treat you like slave they dont care about there employee. This company is sucks
bad,running your back side off just to deliver a package. they expect you to do more than you are require.. if you like driving on snow and like been over work the day befor christmas  this the job for you
bad,Work long days heavy loads contractor don't give a heck if you are dying all they want is you to get your work done management doesn't care for anything but their numbers
bad,It was a part time job in the mornings. It was cool in the morning went to work at 4:00 am and got off at 11:30 am. Good people to work with and it was inside the warehouse.
bad,10 yrs from work there come to work and did my job I would tell you all the money good the that it boss will not back you up for nothing  so all I can say SO NOT GO HERE FOR A JOB
bad,I would not advise anyone to work at fedex in Corning because of the management. She is not management material and keeps all the worker at each other. Total chaos and stress.
bad,Buenas noches me gusta el ambiente del trabajo asta el momento me párese bien
bad,"I was offered Package Handler position at Dartmouth, NS location. Background check was completed in December 2018. I got a call on Jan.9th or 10th to offer me the position which I accepted. Orientation was scheduled on Jan 21st. The problem is when I reached for the orientation at that time I was told that position is filled like really? They called me and offered me the position and on the orientation day they are telling me that they hired more than required. Schedule for the job was suppose to be 3am-8.30 am. I changed my whole sleep schedule. I even declined another for this one.  Very bad experience."
bad,I had a bad experience working for fedex in hagerstown maryland due to poor maagement and superiors who didnt feel it was necessary to do any physical work for the good of the team.
bad,working in the warehouse is a lot but moving package and equipment then if you hurt yourself they just don't care about you the manager are not good manager at all and then there is not female manger
bad,I'm not sure what the other FedEx departments are like but Custom Critical is awful. Talk about lack of organization and foolish decision making. Not to mention getting loads is cut throat. If you want a constant headache and micromanagement then this is the place for you.
bad,"Iniative toward work,profit,production,purpose,"
bad,"Working in a newer and more lit building than before, coming into Fedex was nice. However, after maintaining the job for a short period i had to leave for personal reasons."
bad,Work was very hard and fast paced. The hardest part was working outside no matter the weather type. Manager was never around as needed. Work team was lazy and nun cooperative.
bad,"Not to much of a bad place but they are willing to fire on the spot for any reason whatsoever due to the fact that they claim that workers within the first 3 months (vendor) are easily replaced and are ""a dime a dozen"". until you get through the 3 months a drug testing, they barely acknowledge your hard work or any skills you my posses."
bad,"The owner of the route that i was on was not a good person to work for.  He had a personal assistant who also drove a route.  A lot of things were fabricated by them against me which led to me losing my job.  When i showed up the next week to get my paycheck, he didn't want to give it to me."
bad,Na fedex eu aprendi todo o processo de uma transportadora desde a chegada do produto ate a entrega do mesmo.
bad,"The manager is too bossy, and does not give a space to employees who are task what they are with, always on their back which makes me nervous, management expect you to know every aspect as it relates to their job."
bad,This was one of the worst jobs i had heavy labor emptying trucks moving heavy mail from one part of a building to another terreble bosses who pick out they favorites and gave everybody else a hard time.
bad,Hard fast paced warehouse environment.  Supervisors and management do not care about the employee they only care about the trucks getting loaded.  They talk to you any kind of way with no signs of respect.   The Warehouse can get upward to 120 degrees in the summer with little circulation or ventilation.
bad,no help or encouragement towards the team.  i needed money so i had to suck it up and continue working if i wanted my paycheck.  i was tired and done with the place.
bad,"The pay you receive and the amount of hours you get per day does not equal out. The work conditions are difficult, but that's expected of a warehouse job. But for the hours to already be short and then have those hours cut is unacceptable."
bad,If you love working out then this is the job for you. Very fast paced work with little to no air conditioning. Not very friendly work environment. On the plus side the hours were short
bad,Day to day I was responsible to loading and unloading of the air buses on the terminal with merchandise as well as live cargo. I was able to have a wide range of experiences that were memorable as well as knowledgeable.
bad,Não tenho o que reclamar sobre a empresa. Os lides são pessoas supe qualificado para sua fução.
bad,this was the worst job i ever had. you have to call a line to see if you have to work and you have to be part time forever before they even consider hiring you full time.
bad,I did not like working here. I was not a pleasant work place at all. I didn't not like the people or the management. Very rude and unprofressonal. Need better training.
bad,Muito ruim a liderança tem que rever muita coisa poderia quando não tiver nada pra fazer ajudar no horário alternativo
bad,"Work you hard with very low weekly hours...very physical job. "
bad,FedEx Custom Critical was horrible. Everything from purchasing fuel to the lack of freight. It was just bad. I didn't really like it from the beginning.
bad,"Supporting all levels of management, and handling all situations that arise while handling freight. Management is disrespectful, and rude, but most co-workers are cool. I made good friends here. Most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers."
bad,Establishing new customers and keep the old customers happy.Making sure the load is booked and unloaded at the times that they were to be scheduled. The company was very fast base and I had to come up with my own business to broker.
bad,Great job to moslt likely stand on your feet little opossum we stretch before we start most likely it's not a long day nice hours flexible friendly atmosphere
bad,"It is extremely hot and exhausting,and the managers work you like a robot,when in fact we are humans who tire. They also dont give you breaks when they feel you dont need them. I would work 7-8 hours in the blazing heat with no break."
bad,"They do workplace mobbing there, the senior workers actually hate the new and if you say one wrong thing or question anything that is not proper, even if humbly, they will cry to management an frame/set you up somehow that you are bad and job mob you by intentionally provoke you to make trouble for you on purpose, snitch constantly and actually do devil worshiping tactics. Not a Christian environment at all."
bad,"You work long hours, get NO break. Billion dollar Corp and they can't provide climate control. Minimal training, don't ever, ever sit down or complain about ANYTING. No. clocks anywheren in bldg. Just an awful experience They gotta be breaking labor laws by making you work for so long without any kind of break"
bad,Working conditions are terrible and i do not miss working there.  Pays well but not many remain working there for long periods of time.
bad,Very Messy Management. Good Workers. Workers need to be more acknowledge more. Supervisors need to lighten up on there employers. Feels like a slave environment.
bad,"No team work, left to find for ones self, horrible bosses and no benifites. I have nothing more to say about a company that doe not pay alot but trys to drain one of all life force."
bad,This job taught me how to work hard. I learned a lot about management in this position. I loved the pay and my schedule.  My coworkers were friendly.
bad,"While I love my customers in this job, the management on site in Jamestown left a lot to be desired for interpersonnel relation skills."
bad,worst company i ever worked for. so unorganized and unprepared. makesyou wake up early to complain to you about everything and you are over worked and under payed
bad,It was fine working for this company.  During the busy season it was good because we got more hours.  I quit because I relocated
bad,I worked the graveyard shift where I learned to properly load and unload semi trailer trucks. The co-workers were decent and management was sub par at best. The hardest part of the job was waking up and having energy by the end of the week and my favorite part was overtime and getting paid weekly.
bad,Working for a company that I was able to advance in was great for me. I also gain an exceptional amount of experience.
bad,"Cheat you on all loads,you never know when your goin home. I would always sit for days on in waitin on a loads. They never tell you how much you make on a load."
bad,Terrible working conditions. Management Was never there to help its workers.
bad,A typical day at this job was tiring all the time with little amount of hours with a lot of work that needs to be done in little time. Didn't learn a lot there already knew how to load trucks and how to sort didn't product on making sure that they were going in there right destination. Management was everywhere some were nice people and some seem to favor more than others. Co-workers the same some friendly and some were rude. The hardest part was loading and keeping the belt clear and stacking the boxes right for they wont come crashing down. There wasn't enjoyable part of this job it was just not for me.
bad,"Loaded boxes non-stop, no breaks, very hard work, not fun, management was OK but could tell they did not care about their employees."
bad,"I loved FedEx Ground, it was very fast paced. My coworkers made it a very fun experience."
bad,didnt really learn much. my contractor is uneducated about what hes doing and is carless about his employess
bad,Fed Ex Freight to many rules like working in communist shop get in trouble for leaving keys in ignition sent home for 3 days without pay. Boss is lazy and shows up late everyday and then tells you how you broke a rule which there are many.
bad,If you don't sleep with management you will not get promoted
bad,The most enjoyable part of your work is interacting with the customers. The managers give you total control to satisfy the customers 100 percent.
bad,Other than your hours getting cut. management is ok and coworker were ok . hard part about the job is when it bagged up.. and u don't get no help..
bad,The job is not hard just the weather when it's cold it really gets cold on the ramp. The manager didn't really care about you getting sick.
bad,"A typical day at FedEx is you never know who you are going to meet that day, I have meet so many people working for this company, I have benefited in such a way.  I have had the privilege of traveling for free or with a very small surcharge to fly anywhere in the world.  FedEx believes in promoting within the company. I work with some awesome people a wide variety of diversity in the company.  The hardest part of my job is changing routes not seeing the same customers, I enjoy working with the public. The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting celebrities and having the clearance to go behind stage sometimes during concerts, meetings."
bad,"this company was ok to work for when i started, but as time went on i realized that the management was horribly unorganized. i had been compared to some guy who worked there 5 years before i came along and told daily that i wasn't good enough by my boss."
bad,"Test team manager responsible for regression testing who Managed test design scenarios based on user requirements. Worked to plan, organize, present data with supporting analysis and meet deadlines.  Ability to conduct and record systems technical reviews, surveys, and test results. Worked with UNIX CVS Configuration management tool that facilitated test preparations, maintenance of configuration status accounting, and Software version control."
bad,"I hated this job, I work for FedEx SmartPost for two years, and the job sucks, especially since they don’t give pay raise, and finally when they do, you get a quarter, while everyone else get 50 cents.  Matter of fact, I work for this FedEx SmartPost on Green Road, and the management sucks too"
bad,Management will not give promotions to anyone who excels at the job of being a package handler. This promotes laziness among the employees and makes working for this company completely miserable. Working for this company was a complete waste of 6 years of my life.
bad,"Delivered to all of downtown Macon businesses, learned every street and building number by memory"
bad,My co-workers are very nice and friendly.  It's really for students without any responsibility.
bad,"Typical days here were simple and easy. I organized big and small packages on pallets for shipping. My manager was real understanding and helpful, my co-workers were very open and we worked great together. The most enjoyable parts was when all packages were ready for delivery."
bad,"The management were very competitive and rude, but co workers were nice and social for the most part. The hardest part of the job was dealing with competive managers to meet their dead line so the management wouldn't be held responsible. Doing other peoples work as well as your own made it a bit challenging but nothing that couldnt be resolved in a timely fashion."
bad,"It's a great job for if you're looking for job security and health care. However, there are not a lot of options for me as an IT major to move up into the company."
bad,Management had favoritism and I only worked a few hours a week. Horrible training and management just didn't care.
bad,it was part time. we would scan packages and load them in the proper truck. i didn't learn much from this job. the manager was a rude person and my co-workers would agree. the hardest part of the job would be getting a lot of packages all at once. the most enjoyable part of the job would be going home for the day
bad,"Terrible working environment; company wants to save money, understandable, but having one person doing the work that should be for two people in an already dangerous environment is not a good way to run a business."
bad,Don't really have employees best interest when employee is on LOA and ready to return to work.
bad,Productive and fun workplace that require you to do a lot of heavy lifting.
bad,"customer service learned a lot on the computers, helping the customers. management was pretty good. coworkers were good to work with"
bad,Not a great place to work. Very physically demanding. Safety wasn't the best.
bad,Not enough hours had to work over night and the pay was not so great also.
bad,"I tried three times to call the number they gave me for call-ins. I got no answer so i left a message. My manager never got the message and counted it against me. Because of the hours i was working it was dark, and i got into an accident and ran into a pole that blended in with the ground. If i got a package in my truck that was not supposed to be there, they made me THROW it out of the truck regardless of whether it had a ""fragile"" stamp on it, just to save time. I will never in my life work their, nor use their services again."
bad,Not enough hours in a week. Too much dock work. Start time was not early enough. Need better dispatch. Will wait up to a year to get a consistent run.
bad,They have a lot going in fedex could be more support with works but they don’t help as much as they should and if your injured they still will put you in a truck to work.
bad,It was a good job the managers were great and the work was a good workout but the trucks would be super hot and the boxes would be 100 pounds plus and it would just get hard harder as the day progressed.
bad,Anybody looking to work at FedEx just have a positive mind...the job was great it was the people I guess when u manage some some folks feel it's okay to disrespect other people when it's not
bad,They dont really treat like you should be. Some of the managers dont know what they are doing. I have worked with some great people . Most enjoyable part is going home.
bad,"Stress full job that does not have to be. Running around delivering packages meeting ""time deadlines."" If packages are not on time they make it seem like you committed a crime."
bad,working at fedex was one of the worst jobs  ive worked at. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone. management was horrible and the environment wasn't that good good.
bad,A typical work day at fedex is hard manual labor for some of us for other people its not so challenging. I would say the management is ok that not really a problem. The work place is not safe because the wearhouse is so outdated its kind of dangerous the way that we have to do things. The hardest part of the job is loading the trucks because the equipment is so outdated it makes harder then it has to be.
bad,Fedex is a great company to work for. Very nice people and great Co Workers and the most things about the job i dont like is that the phone will ring non stop
bad,"Sorting packages and placing them on sorting machines that transfers the goods to loading docks."
bad,"Was a great company until you realize that when it comes down to you or the manager getting in trouble for their screw up,  you get terminated. I had 5 great managers that would of put their jobs on the line for me, and 3 of the worst laziest p.o.s ones."
bad,A typical day at work following guidelines and procedures.
bad,The hardest thing for me to do at Fedex Express was deal with the weather change by working outside
bad,Good hard worker fun place unloading and loading truck lots of bending and standing kind gets warm quickly from moving all time very fast paste every truck has to be unloaded before work ends
bad,fed ex is not for everyone and it was not for me i was a package handler it was to much.TO physical the managers are very pushy you cant talk to other employees all they want you to do is stack boxes all day.
bad,"Just expect to come home tired, dirty, and sweaty....people there are nice"
bad,"It's a very difficult job, I must admit. Speaking from my own experience, I was even allergic to the job. If you are an energetic person with excellent health then FedEx may just be the job for you."
bad,Working for the assembly line helped me as a person understand different type of products. This also helped me understand people nation through their silence. There was no phones could be into the work area.
bad,"Part time but you have great benefits, great coworkers, a place to eat and relax like in the warehouse. A great place to work!"
bad,"If your looking for 40 plus hours a week, FedEx isn't the place for you to work. But they do have great benefits and education benefits."
bad,"Avoid if your a decent person !! I started working here back in 2012 at this time it was owned by a differant person and managed well,  ( hence the extra star!)  wasnt the safest of environments but men were treated fairly and was an easy going job, unfortuntely there were some bad worms there that had zero respect. When the new management took over unfortuntely these bad worms had been there a while and got advantage and say , luckily sonce i have been in a role where i can see how to mover everything else and talk down completely  to anybody that was not “one of them” if you tried to speak to a a manager about this there was a “deal with it” approach. There was a an almost non exsisting hr and most definately undesirable people who i doubt had background checks properly that were working there, i left three three years ago but very highly doubt it has changed enough to be a nice working environment. Luckily i now manage myself and the experience here has positively contributed to my new role."
bad,"NO benefits delivering packages above the FedEx approval weight of 150lbs, late dispatches, lazy loaders, lack of concern for driver safety, overload of packages on certain routes"
bad,Overload of packages delivery in a small van with 100 stops of package delivery and got paid by how many packages was delivered . The manager was ok but the contract was bad.
bad,The faster you work the earlier you get home there's no time to be wasting also stay off your phone 1 phone ticket and you're done back to the unemployment line for you
bad,"have to stack everything tight."
bad,"The environment is very dirty. Jobs including but not limited to heavy lifting, was promised up to 70 lbs but when you get on the floor there is no limit. The weight are heavier up to 300 lbs or more."
bad,"No job benefits, limited to no life depending on the route you attain, no teamwork. Organization is none existent. No paid days off, no form of any job security it's basically a day to day job as a ground employee. I have heard Express is a much better option"
bad,"Too much for too little, training is terrible, managers that have not been trained. Stressful environment being on production to produce without proper training. Work all major holidays but Christmas and New Years, not family friendly at all. Only good thing is the benefit,"
bad,"management lacked ability to manage employees. would rather overwork employee, work environment was not sanitary. Managers refused to listen to employees about work related issues."
bad,This job is a quick on the go demanding job.You have to be in shape to do this job an be ready to take on any mistakes that show up on route at everyday.If you are in shape an not ready to take on all the extras demands that come  with this job don.T apply.
bad,Here the job is fast pace and they don't want to hear know excuses but thy will see where you work best at by moving you around to see the positive in how you work.
bad,People drive very dangerously through the warehouse. Fast and irresponsiblly trying to meet their ridiculously high quotas. The warehouse is also very hot.
bad,This was just a seasonal job for me so i dont know much about it. But i seen in the handbook you gef paid time off after a while and more benefits if you stay longer
bad,i do not like to talk bad about any thing if i can help it. but the over all   exp was not that good what so ever. The hr were not good nor consent what so ever. An the way they treat some people over other was bad. pls it was not an easy job in any manner. i will never say to any one to go there. less they love to bust there butt an have odd hr..
bad,Same as with Tri-State.  Reading the trucking trade magazines I found that 70% of drivers change companies every year.  I guess that explains it all.  I would not recommend this type of work to anyone who has a home life.
bad,While working for the company things were fine but once I got on with a contractor things were horrible.My contractor left me broken down for 5 hours two separate times
bad,very hot . use of fan is usually not the route they want to go. hard work and a lot of sweat. dress comfortable but not in a bad manner. remember its still a work place
bad,This company is like an out of control freight train. None of the employees I worked with liked the company. the managers thought they owned the company. Was not easy to move up other than courier or handler plenty of job openings but you can't get any other job no matter how much education you have.
bad,A typical day in fedex was loading or unloading trucks in a very fast pace. I would be inside a trailer and loading or unloading packages with the managers yelling to go faster. It was a very harsh environment.
bad,"I worked at FedEx Ground in Medley, Fl for almost 4 years. The two years there were great, reliable managers and great people to work with. Unfortunately everything that seemed so perfect came to a terrible ending. Good Managers began getting fired and good managers also left to go to other locations. FedEx Ground in Medley is  all about what are you welling to do for that 40 cent raise. I seen it personally how managers disrespect employees and show so much favoritism towards certain employees depending on their ethic background. Would I recommend this job to someone?Of course because there benefits are great. As far as pay goes GOOD LUCK."
bad,long hours and strenuous work  for low pay. The management was just horrible and the working conditions were despicable..
bad,"Management only care for the job being done, safety is throne out the window,"
bad,The job was ridiculous and worked you like dogs. The hours were ok but it was a very hard job.
bad,I was working harder than the males it was a okay job for the moment
bad,My time with fed ex was very short but i learn how to be quick with decisions and how to organize things on the job
bad,Management does not look out for their employees that are for the company.  The pay is unfair and there is no room for advancement.   Favoritism is very high
bad,Working with the employees and knowing how to confide in people with a great heart. But we are very private out there as in personal life. Service is my # 1 goal in life
bad,"Fedex gave me experience in warehousing, loading, unloading and sorting but they were also unfair in many ways. The drivers and contracters have more reapect from the company and they are not their employees. Some of the managers take authority too far and use that power againt you. They have no loyalty to their employees"
bad,Job was easy as long as you don’t mind reloading your truck every morning because the loaders didn’t care and just throw your packages in there. No benefits with this job what so ever. 6 day work weeks starting a week before thanksgiving till the first of the year. Loved my customers that’s why I stayed so long no other reason.
bad,I love the physical part of the job great exercise and the challenges weather traffic etc. The money with no benefits didnt match the job. I love the driving and being independent. I learned alot and met good people. I would love to drive again as long as the pay benefits match the job and chance of advancement
bad,"Fedex is a slaver place not good to work the management team take advantage of the worker,what not hand book is not in the real world at Fedex they hire you to do lift 70 pounds but expect you to lift 120,160,200, and load the trucks"
bad,You work 12 to 14hrs a day...some times longer...lifting 75 to 150lb pkgs. Very little help. Peak season is 6 days work week. No overtime...no benefits...no ins...no retirement...no job advancement...and raises are hard pressed. You are paid a salary per day...not per hour...or per mile...or per stop and not per pkg....flat rate per day. You take breaks as you want...no specific break times...but each break makes your day longer. Its just a job.
bad,Fedex ground makes it so the contractors are barley making it so they can’t afford to pay a good wage or benefits. We need better heath insurance but they can’t afford any at all.
bad,"It's very much a mans job delivering for FedEx!"
bad,"I did not work for Fed Ex , I was a contractor for Fed Ex . I did not feel comfortable working there . Management was hard on contractors . I wanted my own business , it was not ."
bad,"If life outside of work does not concern you and you like working for a communist culture this is it. Pay is low. Benefits are non-existent, Hours are incredibly long. Complaints are met with hostility. Great news is you get to spend a lot of time by yourself. Also OSHA is a joke to FedEx."
bad,"The days varied, some short some long days, but regardless rain, snow , heat  or wind you had to show up and do your job . Ppl want and need there mail!"
bad,If you're looking for a quick buck with little guidance and overnight hours then you're in the right place. Management is awful and only seem to care about your rate.
bad,"Job duties performed every day:"
bad,"would NOT recommend this to anyone with kids, mortgage and car payments. I MAYBE would recommend to a college kid with little to no responsibilities and doesn't mind dealing with the headache for a small-average paycheck."
bad,They only give me a minimum of 3-4 hours for five days.The environment is very fast paced and stressful. You can get hurt easily if you don pay attention.
bad,"They did not pay well for the work you do."
bad,Too competitive to make a living. Long hours. Outrageous hours. No paid time off. Management not truthful. Customer service does not help out. Account manager is not helpful.
bad,"I could go into multiple scenarios as to why this company sucks donkey nuts, but suffice it to say it does. They love to use rules and policies to bash employees with and after awhile its better to find another job with a better and more constructive atmosphere. I'll never recommend Fed Ex to work for but if you insist on going to work for them, by all means find out for yourself as to the reasons why.  Some people might find Fed Ex to be a good company to work for but my experience was not a good one."
bad,"Fedex's business decisions hopefully will not catch on in the business arena. "
bad,The hours are long with no room for work life balance.  The typical day was 10-12hours.  There was a lot of overtime but it was forced with no room for saying no
bad,"They start off ok but then they stab u in the back,you have to be in there little gang to move up and get away with breaking rules and safety.not by cup of tea"
bad,Fedex takes advantage of you dosen’t care what you have going on they are first priority . Management sucks and will get rid of you on a dime no reason at all . You will always be in the wrong
bad,"The company I work with, sub contracts with Fed Ex. The company does not have health or dental benefits. It does not have retirement or 401K. "
bad,"As a contracted driver for FedEx, I regularly worked 10 plus hours per day to complete my full route.  Due to inadequate sorting and loading by actual FedEx employees, I regularly started late.  The requirement to deliver every package sorted to my route became overly stressful because of the late dispatch caused by poor sorting/loading.  Although safety was preached by everyone, it seemed to be pushed to the back burner when the overall requirements of delivering everything trumped the safety aspects of the job.  Management did not care that we were required to drive an hour from our terminal to our routes in addition to the required 9 to 11 hours of delivery time required to complete the route.  Management also regularly relied on rumor and accusations when it came to dealing with some of the ISP personnel.  Management regularly lied to make it look like something was being done to make things better."
bad,"was no hours, and bus is stop running there, you could be sick,  my experernce never forget. met some coworker.all loud talk to like you a child. no respect, head than favor poeple"
bad,"I liked the job. That's why I got the proper license to drive and deliver. I enjoyed the first few weeks, however the attitude issues at this place was horrible. I had a family issue and my supervisor had the nerve to tell me ""your family act like you don't havea job, and the issue isn't that important."" Stuff happens and sometimes you just have to leave. They don't care about you, they just care about you dropping off the packages so they don't have to drive. The pay sucked. No benefits whatsoever. And if you want a personal life forget about it, because the hours here are long and drains the energy right out of you. For $80 to $100 a day you load your own truck, drive for long hours, get treated horrible, and repeat. If you want a job like this go to UPS. Know your worth."
bad,"from the time you clock on to the time you leave, its a horrible $# it show. boxes will come down the belt end on end even after holiday peak just to get workers out of there. drivers will be frustrated that their trucks arnt loaded correctly and you'll not know the quatity of boxs because the reports are never correct."
bad,"management wouldn't work with me on a schedule with my family, cold dirty work space, no room to move up in the company, too many people that are looking to get people in trouble just for fun."
bad,"Staff who already works there is rude, get you to do work that has nothing to do with what you were hired for. Long hours but can only take one break."
bad,non stable working hours always cut during the day sort. acquired less than 20 working per week constantly. pay didn't match the work we had to do in my opinion
bad,I have been at fedex almost a year I have yet to be offered any benefits.  I was switched from one manager to another without a choice.  I go in at six in the morning and do not leave until eight nine oclock at night.  The pay is horrible for the hours I work
bad,"need more help on the floor . Need more hours . need better "
bad,"So many things to remember, cut throat. Calls come in from left to right without a pause. About 150 call within 8 hours. You get 2 15 min breaks and a 30 min break. I wouldn't make it a career."
bad,Fedex uses contractors so they do not have to pay employees. It also saves them as they do not have to pay for benefits or overtime. They have no concern for your health either. Asking all drivers with no assistance to routinely deliver packages without help of 150lbs and even more.
bad,The management for Fed Ex is really poor. A typical day at Fed Ex is normal and chill until the belts start running. Managers are rude and disrespectful
bad,This job is not a job you would want to work at as far as permanent.  This is a stepping stool and learning space for someone who has high aspirations.  This has built character for me and showed me what I do not want to be doing when im older.
bad,Étant sous la responsabilité d'un responsable j'ai l'avantage d'apprendre beaucoup plus
bad,"Did not like round trip travel and 12 + hours on a daily basis. Contractor I worked with made false promises! Had no prior management experience although she said she did,."
bad,"Culturally challenging, heavily embeded cliques.  Many great people and the overall mission is dynamic and interesting."
bad,"I worked the shift of 11 pm-2:30 am. I asked numerous times for more hours. Nope. Got me behind on all my bills. I got a full time job with very close to pay I had at FedEx. There are NO perks with company, can't get health insurance til after working 1,000 hours. No holiday pay after a year."
bad,Poor management. Exhausting task at times. Harsh and dangerous work environment. barely worked 2-3 hours. the only positive about this position was the pay when available.
bad,I would stock aisles and prepare products for customers to take off shelves and buy.  I would be in charge of 2 to 3 aisles a night by myself.
bad,Load/ unload Packages on/ off trucks.  Management micro manages all subordinates even belittle coworkers in the group huddles before the sort begins.  Co-workers were great.  Hardest part of the job was showing up. Did not enjoy any part of the job.
bad,"I was responsible for removing small packages from conveyor belt and placing them on the appropriate skid for the delivery trucks to be loaded properly.  Must also comply with all safety standards and use proper loading, unloading and hand to surface methods.  Must also scan in all small packages to be sent to the correct home delivery truck."
bad,"This is a budget cutting method of delivering packages undercutting UPS. The way they do this is by selling territories to contractors who hire who they want, they pay what they want and no benefits or retirement. Expect to work 50-60 hrs per week. This is a job to get you by until you can find another."
bad,"scanning package and loading "
bad,"Worst job I ever had ,no benefit s ,no holiday pay , or insurance offered . Salary based , deliver until ur done . Anyone looking to make some money driving for FedEx ground as delivery driver its a joke don't recommend it"
bad,this is very unnessary it unbearable and the guy I work for is cheap
bad,Treated like a number. no chance for advancement. No insurance and everything falls on the drivers. Its contracted out so no advancement opportunities and many contractors are slum contractors because of the low pay they get. DO NOT WORK HERE!!!
bad,Low wages and on call you'll be lucky to work 4 hours. I would say it's okay if you can support your family but if not I'd not work here.
bad,Fed ex was an ok place to work. It had different enviorments to work.
bad,"All I can say about this company is, very very poor professionalism from some fellow co-workers and management staff. The maintenance schedules were never followed on company trucks due to fleet owner/manager didnt want to spend money on rentals or parts at all. There was never a typical day at this job, always different and always changing daily and on the hour. Only thing I enjoyed was meeting clients and getting gifts on holidays from the clients."
bad,this was the worst job to ever have if you have a family. because you are out driving for 11-13hrs a day. i will stop there.
bad,"This is a great job for someone with a residual income. Retired folks wanting to see the U.S, this is for you."
bad,long hours with no help. no communication withing company. no insurance benefits or retirement.
bad,Poor management at the site I worked. The job site and temp service has no idea what the other is doing. Employees are always lost. Great training and really enjoyed learning how to load and unload trucks.
bad,"i had to pickup packages and have them back to the station by a specific time.  I had to make sure every package was processed correctly, and that I had a copy of every air bill. My money had to be correct.  I used a hand held computer to type in all of the customer's information and which service they wanted to use to ship the package.  I drove a big Gruman truck.  I learned alot but didn't have the support of management and somtimes my co-workers.  The hardest part of the job was the route because they didn't give you enough time.  The most enjoyable was working independently and the customers."
bad,"Get yo work about 8am load and organize truck. Drive out to route make deliveries and then do pick ups get back to hub about 6pm everyday. It is a hard company to work for because you work for a contractor who owns the routes and they work you hard and provide nothing for you . No sick days, No holidays, No insurance , pay was not that great for the type of work we did."
bad,"Very unorganized warehouse, everyone was confused on what their position was, everyday was a different job. Co-workers were very nice."
bad,"Meeting everyday around 5pm. Trucks pull in and we start the unload process. Move the boxes to another truck an load them. Management was very well informed and gave great directions! Co-workers were team player, and hard working. Hardest part of the job is when there would be call outs and be stuck on an unload by yourself. Lunch time, when everybody was able to interact with each other and have fun!"
bad,"Limited growth potential. Advancement possible but minimal pay increase. Most likely to hire management from outside of the company. 3% Raise each year, and small kick backs on monthly sales. No longer offers yearly bonuses."
bad,the work is good. wake up around 3 am to work. leave around 10 -11 am is the short time frame of work that i don't like.
bad,I love working at Fedex. They have a great Mission statement which says I will make every feded experince Outstanding.We work together as a tight unit with safety and quickness in mind. We are a diverse work work group with age and experince differences. Everyone brings greatness to the work force. We are fedex.
bad,"A job I grew to love as a second job,for more than a year. However, we got a new abusive supervisor who poisoned the atmosphere... during my second year there. When the Tek Systems job presented itself to me, I was glad to leave."
bad,Fedex is a good place to meet new people and new customers when doing a route. But there's really no time for lunch. Always in a hurry. Alot of hours for very little pay. Sometimes the packages are more important than the driver/employee. There's really no freedom of speech. Opinions aren't really taken into consideration.
bad,"upper management only cares about the botton line, not about the employee."
bad,No guarantee on Hours. Schedules are different every week. Hours are capped at 17.5 weekly. FedEx is good for someone looking for p/t work.
bad,"Fedex Ground (235 Norfolk) is bad because you already have to wake up between 2:30 and 3:30 am, but you must deal with the extra anti-perks. They push you to unload truck within 45 mins, of which trucks are like people in that they are not the same which is difficult for the average person who unloads to do. They threaten your job constantly if you don't unload FAST forcing the scanners and sorters to follow suit. This makes the biggest difference when you consider that the pay and hours are both terrible in comparison to the work they request. Management fouls by not allotting peoples hours properly from regular hours to vacation time. It took me a month and a half to receive 3 days worth of vacation time because my manager didn't input them into a computer, of which I needed another manager to do. It is completely a means of only supplementary income, you will work hard, fast, and most likely not enjoy it at all. The turnover at this facility is horrible, as many people quit, and they also fire a few people."
bad,"high time senior employees feel empowered to bully and intimidate new hires in a small satellite station with minimal managerial supervision, creating a toxic environment"
bad,"Si vous aimez travailler de nuit oui par contre l'équipe et deja au complet si vous venez c'est comme un cheveux sur la soupe."
bad,"Training they dont care if you fall down says thats how you learn instead of showing the right way. Confidentialiaty is out the window with this company as far as personal issues , understaff and sometimes other team members feel the need to think they are more superior than you or the team lead that need to milcro manage or some get to constantly come in late with no repercussions"
bad,FedEx treats you like a number or chess piece.  I experience poor communication from management and futher inconsideration when I needed leave for a sick family member.
bad,"Poco apoyo al personal de outsourcing "
bad,"Have monopolized some of their OPCOs - External customer is not taken into consideration unless worldwide revenue stream within FDX"
bad,They weren’t meeting any quotas and passing the blame around to anyone that would take it. The higher ups feel threatened when people start moving up and fire good workers just based on rumors and lies without any actually proof or evidence.
bad,I was excited to work here but as time went on I saw that things were not right with management . I worked with a woman who waited 15 years to be employed full time .
bad,"My day is very busy, fast-paced. Meeting the day to day workload, by the end of my shift. Being safe at always times. The work culture is very good. The hardest part of the job, is sometimes it's understaffed, so you maybe moved around."
bad,"I worked at both FedEx and Amazon. Amazon was paradise in comparison to FedEx. Amazon had air conditioning, proper equipment, clean facility, great compensation, space for employees to actually relax."
bad,"FedEx says one thing but does another. For instance, one has a Bachelors Degree and Masters Degree. I'm making 14.64 an hour. Part Tine. FedEx has people working for them with no degrees and they are in management."
bad,Forklift driver. Pulling product from MOD and following Blueprint on the layout of the trailer. A lot of mandatory work and the 12 hour night shifts are demanding. I was promised an opportunity to be on first after the first month but supervisor has since told me it is not a possibility due to the turn over rate.
bad,Petty management in total denial. The place is closing and management are just hiding the fact. Work demands are high for very few breaks and terrible wages. Prospects are zero.
bad,"Not the company I originally signed up for in 2001. The original call center reps are slowly being replaced with outsourced vendor reps from outside the U.S. who do not receive the same training as the original reps did, yet we are held accountable for everything, including fixing what the outsourced vendors do wrong."
bad,"Different contractors will pay their drivers different rates, but $120 to $150 per day is standard.  It's not hard to deliver packages to the address your manifest says, especially since a lot of drivers are using software on their phones to show where there delivery stops are.  Your typical day will start at the terminal where your truck may be mostly loaded for you.  Most often though, it will not be properly loaded.  It will either not be completely loaded, packages will be in the wrong section of the truck, or the packages will not be on the manifest.  When you find packages that are not on the manifest, you may have already passed that area and will have to go back.  You will almost always leave the terminal after 8AM.  The later you leave the more congested traffic usually gets where you'll be delivering.  Your manifest and scanner will show you have somewhere around 90 to 120 delivery stops for the day, but you'll find up to 10 percent more.  If you are lucky, you will not have any late pickups nor will you be required to help any other drivers.  You could be finished and back to the terminal by 3PM, but a lot of drivers are out until 6PM or later.  Most drivers don't take breaks of any kind, to include a lunch.  Bring snacks and drinks and be prepared to work in cold, wet weather or scorching, humid heat.  Most trucks have dollies, but to save time you'll probably carry most everything, unless there are too many boxes.  You'll have your chance to prove you can lift and carry packages up to 150 pounds.  You'll deliver to some people so much, you'll know their name and"
bad,"FedEx ground is very set in its ways. It is not the companies overall view, but for those who have been at a location for a very long time, the idea of change is not one that they are willing to accept."
bad,"Your back ,your pride, your spirit will diminish as the work week of Tuesday through Saturday takes a toll. You hate waking up in the morning?  Try that on top of an aching back,.   Mind you.  It's barely Tuesday.."
bad,"Overall the company may be a good company to work with but my experience there wasn’t good because of who i worked for.  My biggest issue was that my manager said things but didn’t follow thru with things such as pay, available hours, paid time off etc."
bad,The supervisors don’t care for their employees all they care about is the packages being delivered. Example if there’s a really snow storm they’ll still want you to come to work no matter your circumstances
bad,The work environment was very unstable and inconsistent lack of flexibility and driver safety was not high on the list.   Lack of communication from the manager to drivers was very limited and left one feeling very insecure of all  parts of the job.
bad,"start at 6 am sharp, if your even one minute late they make a huge deal about it. after you swipe your card to clock in you load your own truck which was hard with my bad back. some packages weighed over a hundred pounds and it took them a couple months for them to give me a dolly cart. management was harsh. I worked for power investments through fedex. they laid me off right after Christmas when I was promised a full time permanent position there."
bad,Worked in the Matrix full time/Part time moving freight onto conveyor belts to be shipped properly to there final destination. Also assisted loading aircraft.
bad,"VERY stressful , lazy co-workers who got away with putting off their work on other people , managment turned a blind eye to the lazy and pushed the hard workers ever harder. Manager had no clue how to do the job, ALWAYS told we wernt good enough,fast enough, we did our jobs wrong no mater what we did. If it made sence to do the job one way , management would go another. favoritism is a big problem !!!! Rules and directives changed daily , weekly , monthly. Start times changed daily , it was nessary to check the schedule every evening before you left for fear of being late the next day ."
bad,"FedEx has a great deal of bullies.  There are very tight cliques of people who were born and grew up together in Memphis.  They also claim diversity but give preference to minorities.  Some groups are awesome, some groups are not, I may have just worked in a poorly managed group.  I also found that the raises for non-management individuals were poor compared to management.  They seemed to be between .5% and 2.5%.  It really didn't matter how hard you worked.  One year they actually cut our pay by 5%.  Their benefits are okay but I found that my new job's benefits are incredibly better.  They have a poor pension if you are a newer employee as well."
bad,"They will work you incredibly hard for low pay and no benefits. No breaks, no help from management if you are struggling with your workload, unrealistic expectations all around."
bad,"If your looking for a job where there is no set start or stop time, where managers and higher ups continuously lie to their employees, overwork you regularly for not a lot of compensation. This is the job for you. Theres a reason they're not a union job and UPS is. If your looking for a package company to work for, I would recommend UPS. They have a union to protect their employees from overworked situations that FedEx thrives on. I've never worked for UPS."
bad,"Packaging Handling is a great job. FedEx does well but the management is poor. Sometimes they expect you to go over your limit in working when you cant. putting the boxes ain't bad and the break ain't bad. One downside, going to work early in the morning (4am)"
bad,FedEx makes their workers feel like they are just a number. It is hard to move up in the company and if you do not know someone it is impossible. The hours were crazy and unrealistic.
bad,"I asked my hours in the interview. I was told times and how much I would be working the dock, the hiring manager knows nothing about the actual hours or he miss lead me on purpose to get me to work their. I resigned they flipped out because I asked to transfer to a different location."
bad,No one knew what was going on. Nor did any shift managers communicate with other shift managers or leads. I can never keep a full staff of employees while I was the lead there
bad,Stressful workplace with no eating allowed even if you have a medical issue. I basically had a lot of problems and they told me to resign or I'd get fired.
bad,"You don't choose which department you want to work in and if you're cage, you will never leave at 5. It's stressful and not team oriented. They pay a good part of your health insurance."
bad,This job was horrible for a female! The boxes are heavy asl! And you have to move really Fast. I don’t recommend this job to a crackhead. People steal and short breaks!
bad,I did not like working for FedEx.. It is too much work and too much stress.. I had a conflict with a co worker and I'm the victim and I'm the one who gets in trouble..
bad,Work life was very stressful. Hard work was not rewarded. Full time and career advancement were not part of the culture. Management did not support employees which caused conflict and resentment
bad,"Help driver deliver all package on a timely matter."
bad,Not alot of room for advancement. Difficult work environment. Excessive abuse of authority. Management underqualified and lack of education festered a hostile work environment. Excessive favoritism given to people for extra hours. I would not recommend this place to anyone looking for a harmonious place to work.
bad,Decent job to have.  Diverse employees.  Management can be a little better.  More hours would be a plus as well. There are many slow days too. Really hot sometimes.
bad,The atmosphere in this place became toxic.  When are are dealing with a customer who is so demanding and then upper management does not back the employees but defends all the long hours and weekends that are required it makes for a poor environment.
bad,For full-time employees it is long hours with little or no family time. Most positions are evenings or nights. Part-time is all over the place with little chance to advance.
bad,"I worked the night shift at FedEx, in my time there I constantly proved myself as an employee, the problem with that is that there management is practically careless. If you need extra cash, go for it. Other than that I wouldn't apply."
bad,"I dont have anything nice to say so i rather not speak on the company at all. But this website requires it. i go to work, do my job and leave they lied to us the whole time we worked there, i never got no type of benefits or nothing so when my foot was broken they just put me on a leave of absence. we only received 3 to 4 hours of work a day so they slaved us."
bad,A typical day at work involved loading a cargo van full of boxes with no mistakes. I learned how to work hard. Management had to know your work ethic otherwise you were completely expendable. Workplace culture was cordial but lifeless. The hardest part was dealing with over site and heavy loads.
bad,forklift driving while loading and unloading freight scan on and off trucks also clean the docks when their is no available work in the workplace. this job is in favor of the supervisors be careful.
bad,This was a hard place to work. Everyday was a challenge. the pay was not good they were a lot of favoritism i do noyt thingk that i would want to work for this company agin.
bad,"The facility is always understaffed, management doesn't seem to care, equipment is old, broken, or missing. Management is always giving us less time to work our shift trying to push us to work faster and faster with no incentive to do so. We just end up with smaller and smaller pay checks.  I personally have to do the job of two people because they will not hire anyone else."
bad,This job is physically demanding and has vey little benefits. They work you hard for a short amount of time so they don't have to pay you benefits. The managers are nice but this job in all is a bad job. This work is marginal work and the managers know this so you are not treated like an employee but like a number where they can just replace you for another person.
bad,"Job is good but manager are not good. I just to load, unload, scanning etc. Its have most of them part time and some have fulltime. In fedex some are rute"
bad,"It's just a job, they play favoritism, some select few get special privaliges while others get nothing, I do a vigorous assortment of jobs, sorting, scanning, unloading, verifying addresses."
bad,"Foi otimo, queria ter ficado mais,o serviço foi temporario,mais foi bom"
bad,"As a Home Delivery Driver, begin your day at 6:30-7:30 AM at the Hub to scan your packages and load your truck. Typical day included 130-160 items which took anywhere from 1.5-2.5 hours to scan and load into truck. My route was approximately one hour away from the hub. Most boxes are between 5-30 pounds but occasionally 100 to as much as 200 lbs. Heavy packages typically had ""team lift"" stickers placed which was ignored by management. Drive through lunch to save time. "
bad,Incompetent and inexperienced supply chain management. Extremely long shifts for exempt personnel. Business strategies and procedures changed daily resulting in unstructured operations. Formal training for new hires is nonexistent. Employees are set up to fail when hired.
bad,"terrible they slave you w/o any benefits, underpaid, overworked , management seems to be concerned with only the packages. Not the workers life nor health...Just Plain ol' Terrible."
bad,"A lot of friendly people to work with , everyone is working hard most of the time , managers are kind of rude at times but I'm sure management has changed by now"
bad,"Good place to work part-time, but long term is difficult, management is poor with poor unsafe working polices. Managers, co-workers all smoke outside of warehouse and chew and spit inside warehouse"
bad,The management down to the hiring department are so uneducated and seem like they don't know what in the world they are doing sometimes. They ask you to apply and then make you attend a sort observation making you think you will be hired but in reality they have you waiting for weeks and weeks. Stay away from this company and don't waste your time applying for this company. Save your self the stress and the time you will sacrifice trying to work for them. They mostly hire friends and people they all ready know.
bad,Poorly ran terminal. All employees safety is overlooked daily. I learned to get the job done regardless of obstacles in the way.
bad,Worked 14 years last three years  cut down hours to 13  hours per week  no good mangament this company does not have no union or hr people .
bad,"Working hard for little pay"
bad,"customer interactions"
bad,"100% contracted so you will work for a fedex contractor, not directly for fedex. This means no sick time, vacation, insurance or benefits of any kind. It also means your getting salary and if you miss a day your not getting paid. Expect to work 11-12 hours a day! And if your not your boss might add more stops to your route to ensure that you do. Work week is Tuesday thru Saturday. You have to scan and load your truck in the morning which takes forever if the people on the line don't have all your deliveries on your pallet. If you want to work for fedex, you need to go to either ground or express, they pay hourly and have benefits. Seriously take my review into consideration if you have a decent job now and are looking for a better paycheck, look elsewhere."
bad,"I work for FedEx Ground, yet I really work for contractor that owns a route. Not many people realize that FedEx Ground and Home delivery are contracted out. So that mean no benefits at all for delivery drivers. Average work day consist of 80-100 stops per day. Over 200+ boxes to deliver each day. No lunch breaks, if you do find time for it your one of the rare lucky ones. Get to the terminal at 7, don't get dispatched until 9, then depending on your day you get back around 7pm."
bad,"Empresa voltada a quantidade e qualidade,mas ainda tem que aprender muito para se tornar um bom lugar para se trabalhar."
bad,"Driving the mountain route from Angels Camp to Bear Valley. During my employment  I learned that management was only book smart and didn't have any knowledge of the real facts out on the road. Since this was fast paced environment  my co-workers and I worked together to help each other, great team work! We were often overloaded and under staffed. The hardest part of the job was hundreds of deliveries up steep hills and driveways, sometime in snow 3 feet deep. Eventually  I got to know my customer personally and they became more like family to me, they would often meet me for package, which was very helpful in severe weather."
bad,Run run run all day long. Horrible place to work.. Compensation is not enough.. Company is extremely un-organized.
bad,Loaded trucks after scanning each item. Earlier I unloaded and scanned items to be delivered to residents in smaller vans.
bad,"Prospection téléphonique"
bad,"I enjoyed working at Fedex, but they were not always fair to their employees.  I was one of the most dependable workers, always on time, etc."
bad,I believe fedex is an ok job but just not at this building. they are not as properly ran as they are supposed to be. Managers are sexually harassing people and making them quit because its uncomfortable to have to go to your work place where you try to just go everyday to be harassed. then they talk to you any kind of way and I believe some of the managers are racists
bad,Typical day starts off learning what there is about being a seasonal driver and learning to drive the Fed Ex way. After a week of training and gaining your route you might be assigned by yourself or with a partner. You need to learn your route on your own and not depend on the route schedule they proved for you. Once all your deliveries are done for the day you return to base with all paper work signed and handed in for the end of the day
bad,"If FedEx had better management I would have stayed but there was always employees who were horse playing at work."
bad,Fedex always updated the sysems and requested extra hours. But never gave pay raises.  I enjoyed assisting customers with their problems
bad,Too much work for less money. Learn how to loaded and unloaded truck.The hardest part of the job is working crazy hours. The most enjoyable part of the job is people.
bad,this company is not a people company they do not value their employees. a typical  day includes  working a sort  and building containers for the  outbound flight.management is not be best my co-workers were okay. the  hardest part of my job is co-workers who dont pull there weight on the job.  the most enjoyable part of the job  is getting paid and   going  home
bad,Company was better place to work for as Kinko they were family oriented and appreciated their employees.  
bad,"A typical night would include pulling boxes from chute. Then loading them in a ""tetris"" like manner into multiple trailers."
bad,- Bad hours
bad,"even though you could make decent money there, the managers( or at least the one I worked under) only cared about numbers rather than the employees. And by numbers I mean the number of boxes you load a night. As far as your personal safety, you are on your own."
bad,My typical day at work was loading 4oo boxes and hour and if your load coach is bad then the whole team is bad. One thing i did learn is teamwork thats all you need to suceed in this buisness
bad,Horrible hours with decent pay (if you’re 18 years old lmao) imagine starting work at 12am or 3am and getting off when everything is done. You never know your full schedule. One day could be a 5 hour shift and the next could be a 15.
bad,"The job started out ok while I was there in peak season, shortly right after the holidays they wouldn't let us work over 40 hours even though we was full time."
bad,If you work at Fed Ex Ground it like working at a sweatshop. They want you to get 16 boxes a minute. If you dont meet there quota they will write you up.
bad,I work to keep me from thinking about the negative aspect out of life. Working at Fedex keeps me focus and able to maintain my own pace. Its tough on movement because i have to make sure i don't hurt myself.
bad,Your at the mercy of others and whom is the favorite to Linehaul and or your contractor. my contractor made us go 3weeks without heat in the winter time. Has no concern of your health. I am asthmatic and when my codriver would take off my contractor would drive with me. He would smoke regardless and on a regular basis even after pointing it out more times then I care to count.. contractors lie about the job or your pay.
bad,Good benefits but salary is not competitive and no work life balance. There is no room for advancement within the company unless you want to move out of state.
bad,"you have job security, no real chance for advancement, time is not  taken into consideration, employees are not taken care of which causes high turnover and low morale"
bad,"After years of being told there would be a career path to higher paying positions, there are still no new positions or a defined career path. HR is nonexistent for our team. Benefits have decreased in quality over the last couple of years. We have not received a performance review in two years, and the annual raises have not been based on any performance over the last two years either. As of now, you will receive the same raise in your OpCo as someone who doesn't complete any work or someone that calls in once a week. Many people currently employed here are looking elsewhere for jobs."
bad,"I was very excited about working at FedEx when I first applied, I knew the pay was great, I liked the idea of third shift, it helped me maintain a (mostly) healthy sleep schedule, it allowed me to have days to do whatever, and I knew it would be a really good workout. I was also excited for the benefits. But when the Home Delivery warehouse changed senior managers, things went downhill. She made a lot of ridiculous changes and treated everyone underneath her like machines."
bad,Not enough hours to make a living. No advancement unless you fit into a certain click. No work life balance you have to call in every day to see what hours you work. Uneducated managers or a joke and inexperienced.
bad,"-Must arrive 30 mins before sort for pointless meetings"
bad,Honestly everyone was tired the work was difficult and management was ambivalent. Not sure I would recommend to others unless they really need the money.
bad,"no benefits, paid by day so no overtime. some days less than minimum wage. all while FedEx has record profits... should be ashamed to offer a job at all.  UPS is 1000% better to working staff"
bad,The company as a whole may be expanding but they do not transfer that money to their employees.  It takes a long time to promote even though you work within the company and you have to quit and rehire to get even just a little bit of a bump in pay.
bad,FedEx Express is a good company when following the purple promise. Unfortunately this particular station is the worst I have ever seen. Management only caters to the veterans that have been there for a long time. The trucks are filthy dirty with no upkeep. The equipment that you use continuously fails while you're on road trying to do your job and then management blames you. Management  continuously  will push you harder and harder  until you basically get yourself into an accident. Do yourself a favor and stay far away from this company
bad,"Favoritism, don't respect people who work hard. Management has their favorite people. No career grow if you are not friends with some one. No team work, all African American buys gust driving......and doing easy job."
bad,Hard work  for low pay. Very hot only 2 hours  to 4 hours a day 4 days  a week never get 24 hours it's good for you if you have  a first job not for a career.
bad,Management seems like they dont care. Did two different interviews and and cattle calls and they treat everyone like cards in a deck and only show favoritism towards their friends and colleagues. I showed improvement and hunger for advancement and there was no recognition or reward for such work. Seeing others doing half the work and getting sent home first or being rewarded doesn't appeal to me. Not to mention early onset arthritis from lifting unusual packages and tires.
bad,starts off by loaders not doing a proper job butting boxes where they dont go having to reorganize the truck. management sucks. culture is good. most enjoyable part is coming home
bad,"Poor management. Good for college students. You'll be sore. Its okay overall for part time but I believe there's always something better, make this your last option"
bad,Worst job i've ever had in my life.  I'm proud of the fact i was able to work there for a year.  They are very cheap including hiring enough staff to complete their daily goals.  No breaks of any kinda allowed in a shift ranging anywhere from 3-9 hours depending on the volume that morning.  During the peak season (2-3 months per year) you can easily get 45+ hours a week but when its not peak season you will get about 25 hours working 6 days/week.  Not much room for advancement but it is possible albeit a grueling process.
bad,"FedEx is apparently so phobic about illegal drugs networks that they never send you to the same town twice. Just another example of drug laws screwing up the country, itself just another example of dysfunctional government in USA. But other than that, great job to save up for Christmas or something."
bad,"The hours are poor for the wages paid. No benefits, retirement, health care, 401k. The manager would only come in late in the morning almost at the end of loading."
bad,I am full time without full time benefits.  I work about 25 hours a week and the manager cuts my hours to even less if they see someone can handle the van line by their self.  The work is very hard and the packages are heavy and bulky.  They expect you to load three vans in 4 hours and load them without error.  We are talking about 600 packages on average.  The majority of people usually don't last more than 2 years and get hurt or have aches and pains because of the repetitive nature of lifting packages.
bad,"i was hired at fedex freight for fulltime work, some times i would only work 5-6 hours a day, then get sent home. there health insurance was terrible,fedex has a very stricked  saftey policy if you got hurt or forget to close a trailer door they would write you up and give you a warning letter, the dispatchers were not nice people to deal with, always uptite about something, this was a very stricked company to work for"
bad,"I started working here in June 2018. Everything was fine during the Summer. Fall/Winter came around and my hours started to diminish due to the FACT that the Truck Drivers KIDS were getting hired and started TAKING HOURS AWAY FROM PART-TIME and SOME full-time employees. This Fedex hires INTERNALLY. ALSO THERE WAS NO SET SCHEDULE compared to when I first got hired. I got moved to the ON-CALL LIST (REMIND YOU, HARD WORKER) I was JUDGED as a ""try-hard"" a few months into the job and the management is terrible. They bring you in, if you're not a favorite, they diminish your hours (3 hour shifts, 2 days a week) to try to get you to quit your job. They don't really care about their employees (ESPECIALLY PART-TIME EMPLOYEES) They only want you to work when they NEED you (Example - When an employee who they consider is a good worker is not available to work on a certain day) ALSO THIS IS NOT A DIVERSE COMPANY (Madison, Alabama Location) You will see more Caucasian's than any other race (HUGE PROBLEM) I can count on ONE HAND, how many minorities work at this location! I also experienced co-workers writing ""MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN"" with their fingers on the back of a 18-wheeler trailer (CLEARLY RACISTS) and management does nothing about it, they actually agree due to them being quiet about it. I wouldn't recommend working at this location (MADISON, AL) UNLESS your are ready to deal with LOW-IQ truck drivers who make jokes on a daily and in some cases, harass you when they feel it is okay to do so. Peers started to quit a few weeks or months after noticing issues within this warehouse."
bad,"Stay away from hupec logistics in Beltsville,MD it may also say Washington DC because this is where the routes are located pay is terrible last contractor sold to these two people went from making a decent $1200 a week to $500-$600 a week for all the physical work you do and as high demanding it is this is not a fair wage"
bad,"Base pay isn't bad, but there are no benefits or paid holidays, communication is abysmal and you don't get paid unless you are making deliveries, so when they don't have trucks loaded on time or other issues you are not making any money."
bad,"5 days a week, 6a.m. til late @ night(or early in the morning), job was too tedious. Majority of delivery people were caucasian & African-American. The hardest part of the job were, when your route is scattered, during winter & rainy season, rude customers, or if a customer pointed a gun @ you, there were more. The most enjoyable part of the job was during autumn, or fall season, where you can see trees changing its color(leaves), especially if you were driving on country side, or top of mountains. I averaged more than 300 miles per day."
bad,"Horrible, the scores you have to make are nearly impossible. You sound like a robot, sounding scriptive. Rather than actually helping the customer on a basic task; they want you to jump through all these hoops"
bad,"My typical day. I started work at 1:00 am til 6:00 am I have to go straight to the floor (docks 125 doors) and pick up all debris that clutters the floor. Skids, medal poles, wood, cardboard, plastic, Etc. While dodging 20 to 30 forklifts at the same time. And quite a few drivers were always horse playing. (dangerous). it was very stressful because it was like no one cared. and there were cages on the floor for the drivers to store their medal poles, but ever since they noticed me working there, they just slung them all over the place. (the cardboard pillows also). OH! one 10 minute break, and no lunch, in those five hours of work, for being a part-timer."
bad,La empresa te apoya con becas para empleados para seguir tus estudios y mejorar como persona
bad,"The contractors are great to work for, it is the Hub management that is the problem. They have no idea what it's like to actually deliver packages there for they ask drivers to do the unthinkable. Everyone there is overstressed is the expectations are way too high."
bad,"(Fed Ex) will work you and work you, and when your age, and your cost, as an employee, it’s too much, they will let you go in in a second, and not think anything of it  All of the federal laws, and state laws, etc. are all on their side. Everything is heavily favored on the side of this company. They run it like a symphony and In the end, it doesn’t matter what your color, race, or sexual orientation, they will let you go in a heartbeat. If you could find any other place to work, do it!"
bad,this job has no way to advance or real promotional opportunities the management is lacking and there is no team work or help to be had you are expected to know things they don't tell you
bad,"I enjoy driving and working outdoors , was a great job in that aspect. No benifits , no set pay raises , upper management was only looking out for himself. Whenever there was a complaint vs a driver the driver was always at fault."
bad,When I worked here few years ago in 2015 the management was really bad. Lots of micromanaging. Not any type of flexibility with work schedule. Health benefits.
bad,"There are many people at Fedex with the title of management, but yet none of them manage anything really. Employees skip out on work and are rarely punished. Lazy employees are never disciplined. An employee in particular that called off two to three times a week and even no call, no showed for a week straight, just got fired after 5 and a half months. I wish I could say I was joking.  If you work hard, you are just expected to pick up the slack of others and do it with a smile on your face. Constantly shorthanded on people, company claims that they are hiring new people, but I haven't seen a new employee in about 3 weeks now. Frequently, I have been taking on the responsibility of a two people, managers just stand by and watch me struggle and only send help when total disaster occurs. As long as the assembly line belt keeps moving, this company doesn't care. Company boasts about advancement in the company, but yet a couple of the managers and a large portion of drivers were hired from the outside. Overall, for the amount of work you do, the pay is almost an insult. In a 3 hour 40 minute shift, I took a little over 15,000 steps (which comes out to 7.25 miles), plus lifted hundreds of packages (some of which weigh up to 160 lbs). After taxes get taken out, I receive a measly 35 dollars for that shift. The wear and tear this puts on your body is definitely not worth the pay at all."
bad,"This a great company to work for if you don't really wanna work hard & you like to with lazy annoying people. I'm a hard worker, I like to get in get it done then I'm ready to go home. The problem is when they notice how hard you work, they TRY to work you harder. They lazy ones they let get away with murder and actually send them home early. so when I speak up them I'm labeled as I guess ""A COMPLAINER"". Who cares, I refused to be treated unfairly."
bad,"Wouldn't recommend working there as a manager if you have a family, because you will never see them. They work you to death and could care less about your personal life."
bad,"The hiring process was a little long. The office staff is good. The problems start when you leave the classroom and head out to the floor. Lots of people act like they rather not be there and tons of gossip about who does what a certain way.  It is based on seniority so as a new part-time employee expect your hours to be cut even shorter than your 5hr day. Especially during the end of the year which is ""slow time."" Not sure why they cut part time employee hours then give the full timers mandatory over time almost everyday to make up for it (which they dont want because they've already done 10hrs). Plus you have to wait at least 6 months before being eligible for a full time position. It can take longer because there are also people waiting ahead of you. The job itself is not hard. You sit and drive most the day with no one on your back. Just have common sense with the forklift and tough skin to deal with the attitude of everyone. Some of it is from rushing around trying to get the job done after being there all day or because everyone load/unload a truck a different way. Honestly if you have a family to feed you'll need something else on the side if you decide to stick around to bid for full time (its not guaranteed). This is the perfect job for someone young with not too much bills and live with their parents.It would be great to grow into a company with that salary and full time hours. The pay is good for part time hours but not enough if you have a family to take care of and things to do financially."
bad,"this is a set up that resembles  THE GOOD OLE BOY culture. The Viking boys don.t like anyone else, especially if they know more than them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
bad,"My Home Delivery Contractor was much nicer than all the others, he was the sole person in New England invited to the world FedEx conference, he helped me to get a better paying job with FedEx Ground."
bad,As a delivery driver you are not paid enough for the amount of time you spend during the day delivering packages. Drivers are paid per day and not by the hour so the drivers get screwed if they have a lot of stops!
bad,"Management is horrible, they are running a once fine company into the ground with their lack of knowledge, lack of vision, and poor management skills.  HIRE LEADERS WHO KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING !"
bad,"Horrible direct management ! No support from the manager. "
bad,"Policy not enforced, lots of actions that could be considered racial.  Male dominated leadership team. Hood ol boy values. Talk a good game, continued to fail on delivery."
bad,"It was the same thing day in day out, load boxes on to trucks.  Making sure the correct boxes were loaded on the correct trucks through their tracking system.  Hardest part of the job was the over sized packages.  The most enjoyable was the other package handlers."
bad,"handling packages, learned that being a deliver driver for fedex is not as easy as I thought. managed all delivery trucks to leave on time. workplace culture is men and women. Hardest part of the job is when the main delivery truck is running late everyone is stressed out. Most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people"
bad,I would say get hired on directly with FedEx Express or Office. Everything else is operated by contractors. Not all of them are unprepared their are some who have it together. Other than that it's just to get them rich while the drivers break their back for minimum wage. The amount of work just doesn't add up to the pay.
bad,"Not your average paced work environment. Atmosphere of an actual prison, where women and men divide and conquer one another. You would have insane deadlines to meet."
bad,At the start of the day there is always a presort meeting.  They let you know how much packages we have for the shift and also the safety meeting for the week.  The managers and the higher ups are always butting heads with each other causing confusion for the workers.  The higher ups don`t care about the safety of the workers but instead they rather increase the production rate.  The higher ups are always walking around and are yelling at the managers to make the workers work faster even though they don`t know what they are doing.  Also the bosses don`t give out information to the workers anymore they are usually left in the dark the whole shift.  If your good in one position most likely the bosses wont let you grow in the company and you will be stuck doing the same thing.  The hardest part of the job is just trying to keep your sanity there.  The best part of the job is knowing the other workers are always there to help you keep your sanity.
bad,"Fed Ex is not a cheery, easy-going place. Sure I only worked three hours a day, but those three hours are very hard. By the end of day one, you are expected to be able to load 100 packages an hour. By the end of the week, you are expected to load 400 packages an hour; 400! This job is like a fast moving freight train that speeds up everyday and you are the person trying to keep up by running beside it. In short, this job is not for the weak."
bad,Managers play favoritism. Hours were bad. Some managers are super nice and others are terrible.Don't really care about their employees like they say they do.
bad,"Fedex is extremely stressful but the pay is well and youll always have your min. "
bad,"Typical day answering the telephone and obtaining information for US Customs clearance and other government agencies for import in the US.  "
bad,Upper-level Managers don't know what they're doing and each warehouse struggles daily to meet their required numbers. On top of that they hire wayyy too many people and you don't get any hours.
bad,the job was a waste of time commuting 45 mins back and forth just to work an hour or two each night. then being yelled at for following the same guides you were instructed to use during training videos.
bad,Title says it all..no benefits poor pay poor management . You wear fed ex logo but dont get any benefits as other fed ex departments
bad,Temporary placement where I met some good people.unfortunately many of the employees lacked basic work skills but they tried their best at times.
bad,Na Fedex eu trabalhava com medicamento e outras coisa viajava muito fazia que me mandava o faser
bad,"I am the spouse of a FedEx Ground driver.  12 hour days, no breaks, can barely eat lunch.  Subcontractor offers no benefits, no paid time off, doesn’t care about employees or their families."
bad,"Got to learn a lot about the logistics industry."
bad,Did not like working with a bunch of kids with no work ethic.  Great benefits just not enough pay for the amount of work you put in.
bad,"Work 4 hours a day,"
bad,"Fedex wants you to only do what the tell you. there is not a specific time you go to work and u never no when your coming home. The pay is great but if you always working whats the point. The part time people have all the same rules as the full time guys ie tarries missed days, and dont get benefits ie disability,vacation part time guys get none of that. if you dont have a family and can deal with the high school drama you can make good money."
bad,Lots of favoritism at Fedex with no chance of promotion. Managers showed no appreciation. A normal day was push push push and hurry up and go home.
bad,"Mgmt treats the employees horrible at the Honolulu station. Morale is low, everyone grumbles, it's depressing. Work somewhere else."
bad,"drivers work for contractors not for fedex.  the warehouse managers can be too worried about their numbers and not very helpful in getting the drivers on the road. this creates a backlog in trying to get on the road in the mourning. very frustrating to the drivers when they are trying to start their day. the contractors then feel they have their hands tied, this adds to the long day of driving and deliveries."
bad,ok work place wake up early work 4 hours go home problem management is always in to big of a rush do not take the opinions of other workers to efficiently work without having problems
bad,"This job it's ok. The hard part is not getting breaks. Then when you clock in you have to answer yes to the question ""did u took your break the previous day?"".. I hit no before by mistake and to talk to the manager. And the hrs aren't consistent."
bad,Always busy with packages never had a slow day. I worked there overnight I was still attending school so the job left me with a little money in my pocket. I enjoyed the three drivers I worked with make sure every package was loaded to there trucks. Felt the management didn't have proper people skills. Far as moving up in the company it was based on who you knew wasn't a fair system at all. I went to work did what was asked of me and left I wasn't very personal there.
bad,"This job works you just enough to get about 200 dollars a week, but if you get hurt, they threaten to let you go before trying to make sure you are okay."
bad,"This company wants your life to revolve around them, forget your health, your personal life, and your family. Typical day starts at or around 6:00 a.m. and the earliest you will get off is 4:30 p.m., this would be considered a good day. Besides that, your first 1-1.5 hours of the day is spent going through your truck and straightening it up because the loaders were not taught properly on how to load a truck. It does no good talking to FedEx about this issue, words from a member of management ""It won't matter if you say anything about the load or the loader. Being that the loaders are part time, as long as they show up and do something, that's all we care about."". On top of that, this job takes a good toll on the body, and there are no benefits, or retirement."
bad,"No work/life balance. Long days and ""split-shifts"" to retain full-time status. 15 hour day, but you get paid for 9. Low pay compared to competition. Upper mgt. does not fully understand what is happening at station level. Goals and responsibilities are unrealistic, structure inhuman and excessive. Limited room for growth."
bad,"I worked at FedEx Ground for two years, and have never had a job that I felt worse about doing. The actual work itself wasn't a problem, but the hours for the job were very undesirable (4:30-8:30am Tue-Sat), and the management really didn't care at all about their employees. Things were very badly organized with no response to employee feedback, and employees were generally treated very poorly. I personally find FedEx Ground to be a very unethical organization."
bad,"Each and every day is more or less the same. The only thing that really changes day to day is the total volume of incoming packages to sort. Management tends to rely on favoritism to decide who moves up at each hub. Management is unforgiving of things that may be out of your control. Sick? Get written up. In a car accident? Get written up. Unable to clock out for a break? Get written up AND threats of termination. Going to school? Unless you're a favorite of the management team, good luck getting them to fully work with you to find a balance between work and school. You're given part-time hours, but expected to have full-time availability. When ever something wrong happens, management automatically assumes it was your fault regardless any factors that may indicate otherwise. Management also dislikes if you don't perform your duties exactly as told, even if it improves your efficiency and productivity. Forget any thoughts that you might be able to think for yourself; do only as you're told."
bad,Long hours with no help. Over 234 package a day. No benefits nor insurance. The most I enjoyed about working at Fed Ex was meeting new people and become friends
bad,"I begin my day at about 7 am each day. I load up my truck and do a D.O.T. inspection before beginning my daily route at about 8:30 am. I drive around delivering packages to customers until my load is complete. Off times vary depending on the load, i can finish anywhere from 3 pm or as late as 8 pm.. I have learned how to complete task in a timely manner, with accuracy and speed yet still driving safe.  When working for FedEx you don't actually work for FedEx.  FedEx employees contractors, who then in turn hire drivers.  Each contractor is different when it come to their pay and other aspects of management.  Most contractors do not offer any type of benefits or opportunities for advancement, or pay raises.  The hardest part of the job would be learning the areas in which you deliver.  i enjoy being in a truck by myself, getting my job done."
bad,"A typical day consist of a lot of high traffic, stressful environment mentally and physically, issues with gaining equipment to do the job well and poor management, a lot of favoritism that goes on and you never know what you're gonna be doing the next day or week. very low hours are gained. co-workers are fun but you're mostly by yourself when on the road. the hardest part of the job is time and loading, the most enjoyable part of the job is the vacation time received. what I've learned, is how to drive a big truck without a rare mirror, and i learned how to sort packages and stack boxes neatly in a timely manner. i also learned how to operate a power pad."
bad,"Working at FedEx lifting and loading heavy packages each and every night, even when its snowing, cutting hands and being sore each and every night as well as doing all of this in a rapid pace."
bad,I come to work and sort packages to their correct destinations for about 3 hours. after that I help with shipping for about 2 hours. I go to a quick 30 minutes and then come back for the remaining 3 hours and sort packages. I am well trained around the other areas of the building. I feel management is well aware of my intelligence of where the through-put needs to be with production along with my work ethics. I try to make my job as easy as possible.
bad,"Billing over 450+ invoices per person, self auditing, entering information for drivers, tracking shipments for customers. Management was very poor in the office in the evenings. The Supervisor would pit employees against each other, start rumors, and talk behind the employees backs within earshot of that employee and others."
bad,"Loading trucks, managers dont check on you, hours were very short, I didnt like having to use scanners for every package"
bad,job for college student. There hours shifts. no learning involved. Management push for numbers toget bonus cheaks. no life having to work 3 sorts a day spending 12 hours to work 8 or 9. fellow workers.
bad,"I currently work as a courier swing driver. As a driver we are all underpaid across the organization. We load our own trucks every morning, sort through all freight on our trucks once loaded. Also we input senseless codes for every task performed during the morning sort. Finally we proceed on road to make all service committments safely. There are employees with several years of service making a very similar hourly rate to a new hire. Failed efforts to adjust the payscale. The corporation doesn't respect the drivers. No incentives in place to motivate employees in their work efforts. Then they insult you with a bravo zulu award which is worthless. The business model for the organization is to cut overtime and minimize hours to 35 a week. If you take a weeks vacation you only get 35 hours pay even if you work a dedicated route accumulating 40 hours plus a week. They strongly promote the ""hire from within process"" during the interview but fail to share w/you that each Fedex is different and has different guidelines. You can't just transfer or transition to any Fedex even with a degree and you meet the requirements. ""Hire from within"" ""People Service Profit"". I don't think so."
bad,i did not like this job. i feel this job was a waste of time.the jobs overworks you and yoou only make enough money to get back to work.
bad,"FedEx is a very poorly managed company.  The management team can change up the schedule at any time and you can be moved from route to route without any training what so ever.  The on time requirements are not manageable and when you request help, it never comes.  Upper management is no better.  There is no back up for the employees.  The rate of packages to employees to deliver does not compute.  More employees needs to be on the ground, with two couriers per vehicle."
bad,"work shift starts at 5am on a Monday, due to the fact i walk to work and this takes about 45 minutes, I am up at 3.30am to ensure I am there at the correct time or earlier.  I am currently seconded in to the position of operations supervisor, so on a monday morning, i ensure collections for our drivers are printed using our focus system, that they are all able to deliver premium deliveries on time and ensuring they leave the depot with adaquate time.  I deal with costings of any extra work drivers do, i.e same day runs to other depots.  I answer phone calls and emails in a prompt and proffessional manor, and ensure our staff do this also.  I deal with simple quries to a redelivery of a parcel to items being located at the wrong depot and making sure items are upgraded if there has been any problems."
bad,It was hard very difficult to work and adjust my life balance to working all night. It was very physical to lift all those package that could sometime weight around 100 pounds
bad,Fedex Ground works through contractors than franchise the Fedex Ground name. Contractors provide no benefits or dedicated pay raises. Somewhat of a toxic work enviroment enabled by poor policy enforcement.
bad,"Its all about the contractor, since there is no real paper trail and your paid with personal bank checks, there is no way to show how much you are really getting paid, the only person that knows is the contractor, and in my case they decided to cut my pay a LOT over a few  months time, im talking from 650 a week.. to 150."
bad,"the managers didnt have an organized system of how they were going to do things... The hours of work sucked, expecially for the pay and the work that we had to do..."
bad,We would load trucks for delivery.  I would say that I learned how to become an effective packer.
bad,Not knowing if you are going to work one hour or be sent back home.being yell at and having to work unsafe.The job are not hard it is just the magnitude of being or rather feeling like you have no choice but to work in amanner in which is very unsafe.
bad,Do not spend a lot of time at terminal just pick up and drop off trailers
bad,"The weather is a determining factor of the work conditions, terrible place to work during the summer it is 2x the heat outside inside the building and trailers.Management isn't all that great and pay is equal to the work required."
bad,just a boring job. Not a challenging job. Great if you want to make some extra money though.
bad,"Parcel Assistant,loading packages to pallets for shipping"
bad,No opportunities for growth. No Job security. Co-workers are the hardest part of the job.
bad,Fedex wasnt a union job and i didnt like the way they did things there but they do teach you how to work hard and a fast pace for the work world
bad,Easy Job friendly place to work at with the exception of management.
bad,"Current short haul tractor trailer driver earning almost EXACTLY the same money as when I was hired 26 years ago, and I am 3 job catagories higher. Dwindling hours lately due to economy, Management cares very little about employees and always wants more more more. Day work for truckers starts at 3 am !"
bad,Home delivery is a subcontracted portion of fedex. Production based pay long hours with more work then you can handle if your full time. You have to break all laws on the road to get done at a decent time. If your not making delliveries your not making money. I enjoyed the job when i first started pay got better but you can never advance. Trucks are broke down more then not. You had to take time out of your day to go get tire put on or a oil change done when that should be your managers job. I dont know if the other parts of fedex delivering is the same. I can only speaks for my contractor.
bad,Seems like there are a ton of ways to get fired and no way to get ahead. You start off being part-time and usually stay there. The only thing remotely close to a promotion is going from part-time to full-time which only means working a double shift. After the winter peak work becomes scarce so hopefully 10hrs a week is enough for you.
bad,8 hours of demanding hard labor with one break was a Typical day.
bad,"I would sort and scan packages and boxes all night for their proper destination. This was one of the fastest pace environment i had ever worked in. You only work 4-6 hrs per night, but feels like 8-9 when you are punching out."
bad,"As a seasonal home delivery driver,you are sent to remote locations in the wintertime,in an ill equipped van for the road conditions. The pay is terrible and work hours are early morning to whenever you are done delivering packages. Stay away!"
bad,As a package handler it's job and as a Driver you own your own route or work for a contractor.
bad,A typical day consist of delivering anywhere from 10 to 12 hours a day.
bad,"I was promised advacement, promised new positions because I had a MBA, a law degree and a college degree. I was promised that during my ""interview"", if you can call it an interview. I was more like a gush session by the manager telling me how easy it would be to move up within the company because I had so much schooling behind me."
bad,"FedEx demands alot of your time and energy, which is why I would not recomend working there if you have a family. FedEx doesn't really seem to care about it's employees' well being or safety; but reather that the job gets done even if you have to drive in a whiteout blizzard."
bad,while working there i was told that i would be making good money and since then i have not. i and many others have been lie to day after day about pay and hours.
bad,They expect u 2 do more than ur job title an pay the same for everything u did. I was able 2 do everything in the building except management becuz i never held tha position but new ppl were gettin paid the same rate as me after bein wit the company 3+ yrs
bad,Great benefits and made some really great friends.  Company has a lot of growing to do in the market to compete with top level companies such as Amazon and UPS.  Worked a lot of long hours very stressful due to lack of resources and the high demand. Hard to get people to break bad habits and they absolutely hate change. Hardest part of job lack of support from upper management and HR. Most enjoyable part was executing company goals. Glad I made the decision to leave for better. Great learning experience overall.
bad,"the crew of people there are nice but the work there is kind of difficult. you will be ask to do a heavy truck with tires, grills and heavy products by yourself. Even some women were on a truck by themselves and had to lift heavy objects.  You get only 45 min. to do a truck."
bad,"i was perfectly fine working there loading until i got hurt after that i was constantly harassed and always being threatened, money was good but the people there did not treat you well in the slightest."
bad,"I am on temporary suspension unruly from that company.I am facing a legal issue that I haven't been convicted for & they have me on temporary suspension because of it, which is illegal !"
bad,FedEx Freight has its overall reality of individual needs. there is a Huge lack of Employees making everyone's jobs more Difficult. there's not much room for advancement. Benefits are Normal not the best.
bad,I had some good and bad experience there some people are friendly but some have there group that they are parcel to they help and try to keep their group together please don’t get hurt there because the only light duty they have is sitting you out doors in the weather no matter whether it’s cold or hot whether you hurt they just want you there
bad,"Could not care less about their employees Poorly managed Fedex trade networks is a sinking ship . Extremely under staffed , highly disorganized . Very low morale"
bad,Work for a contractor instead of fedex so no benefits.  Fedex management of the terminal is lackluster at best.  Most managers stand around and do nothing while the workers kill themselves to get trucks loaded which is typical in large companies.
bad,"We were sub-contracted out and the guy who owned my route was horrible. Treated his people unfairly, made his employees drive outdated, faulty equipment and just was an overall horrible person to drive for."
bad,"very fast paced job. if you can type fast and pick up on a few systems you can easily clear freight. the downside is you spend all day sitting, barely have time to eat or go to bathroom and you have people screaming to get the shipment cleared."
bad,"Listed are some key words regarding employment with FedEx:"
bad,"At first the job was fun, the management I had in my area was great and pay was much better then the job I had came from, along with getting a check weekly instead of bi-weekly was something new for me. Everything was fine until things started to change around and when I specific upper manager left the hub for something else. Leading to un-organization, More work then the staff could handle, with new hires immediately quitting after first week if not first day. A lot of favoritism, hard to move up in promotion unless you kiss up to someone in upper management or been there for a LONG time."
bad,Going to work for FedEx Ground I thought would be more organized. Fed ex name is very well known so I thought you would get all the benefits and perks that goes along with FedEx. But you don’t. No benefits no paid time off vacation after one year. This job burns you out.
bad,Some managers that have been there many years get away with treating staff like garbage. Unable to properly treat people they just bully and intimidate.
bad,"FedEx is a corporation. If express is doing bad the whole stock does bad and that effects your bonus. Last year we were guaranteed 7500 for the size of our hub and our bonus is typically 5k for managers. We got none. They continue to keep paper on employees so if they need to ""trim the fat"" they just choose who they dont like (politics) and have a paper trail. You dont have to be notified when verbal get put in your file"
bad,"If you're ok with being extremely hot or cold. It'd a temp job or something like that. It's a young persons game. After you hit 30 you're body will feel it, and you will slow down. And look for a new job"
bad,It was an okay job. It could be better. Every day tasks become difficult as staffing was low and my colleagues did not enjoy or find fulfillment at the work place.
bad,"Terrible Company"
bad,"had the worst contractor,he feed a bunch of lies painted a pretty picture then did everything opposite. his delivery vehicles are unsafe and shouldn't even be on the road.very bad ownership and very poorly run. with a good contractor I'm sure it would've been awesome."
bad,"They claim to be customer service  focused, but only if it’s convenient for them. The workload is unrealistic with the time allotted In a day. Training is just a word that is lacking in a lot of ways. Barely giving you the basic information to somewhat do the job, and then expects you have knowledge of someone who has years of experience with all the systems that are used. Systems going down daily and intermittently which impacts your workflow even further. If your truly an individual that believes in great customer service, this is not the place to work."
bad,I started out enthusiastically looking forward to working at FedEx.  After 3 months I was bewildered at the lack of direction from Management.  They seemed to re-invent the work assignments every day and at time changed direction mid stream.  For a large organization that spans the globe I was not impressed.  Maybe other work locations are better managed than the one I was assigned to.
bad,"I am tired of trying to compete for loads. Tired of my pay being held for 3+ weeks because their computer system is always ""going down"". Am not being reimbursed enough for gas and tolls. Am also tired of being told that I can not get a load because someone else has not had a load for a longer period of time than myself; even though I was the first to accept that load."
bad,"The Conley location is supposed to be the motherbird for all the service centers in Atlanta. Total opposite. Company is ran by blue collar employees that lack leadership. Managers are egotistic, arrogant, cocky, and could care less about their subordinates beneath them. Supervisors here are a joke. You’ve been warned. Don’t fall in this sunken place. It’s not worth it."
bad,"Load and unload trucks, scan packages. Unrealistic goals. Not enough hours. Learned safety procedures, safe working. Some packages very heavy.  Good exercise."
bad,Worst place to work at. They do not care about your health and do not properly train you at this facility. They are people who like to play favorites.
bad,"All work no love. Favortism, Nepotism,  Dirty work environments. Security is rude and racist. And they don't like the middle class trying to make an extra buck. So they punish you if you ack like you're not looking for a career."
bad,They are stuck in the 1980's. They want you to be loyal to the company. Even though it takes about 15 years to get full time. No one can make a living at Fedex working part-time. I haven't met anyone who has gotten full time at Fedex within 10 years. I don't know how people will stick around and wait for full time.
bad,"I wanted to work for this company so badly and now that I am here, I am beyond disappointed. Very unorganized. I've worked here 4 months now and still don't have a badge. A lot of work for very little money. This is not a family oriented company. Their focus is caring for the customers which is what keeps the company moving. But geez, if you have a dozen sick employees, who cares for them? They give you sick time but you are penalized for using them. 10-12 hr days. Mandatory Saturday. My manager in particular does not hold everyone accountable for their own accounts. Its just a HUGE disappointment. I am actively looking for other employment. I REALLY wanted to be a part of such an elite brand....but boy was I wrong..."
bad,"FedEx home delivery is the worst part of FedEx, the actual money makers are FedEx Ground & Express. Also im contracted through the wrong person because things should be a lot different."
bad,"Management doest care about you or trying to help you get hours. They say they do but really they just blow you off, and also the absolute worse dispatchers you could imagine."
bad,handling of packages in a fast paced environment to service the customer in a timely manner. safe driving handling of delicate packages from fragile to toxic and hazardous materials at times.
bad,There is a systemic culture problem at the FedEx world Hub in Memphis. Employees are not promoted or given raises based on their job performance. Promotions are based on a combination of seniority and an individuals personal relationship with management. More than 60% of the people promoted into leadership roles do not have sufficient qualities and skills for the job. This fosters dishonesty and manipulation while sabotaging team productivity and fairness.
bad,"I spent two years there and yeah the money is cool and all, but you will never go anywhere unless you're okay with waiting for 54 years to be any type of promoted. They will use whomever they can to do the work they don't want to do, some cool guys in there but for the most part everyone is miserable with their lives working on that dock. After a year you'll be making 19.76 as of right now, but the money isn't even worth it. Winters are very harsh if you aren't used to the elements, but if you can get passed all the bs, and just want to make a good check, this is the place for you."
bad,"Hard job, with zero benefits. Haven’t received a raise in3 years. I work at fed ex ground. So You don’t actually work for fed ex you work for a contractor"
bad,Would not recommend this job to anyone with a medical condition. This job is extremely physically demanding and during the summer its even more demanding.
bad,"The company has a great structure, only on the backs of the contract workers....It's unorganized, unprofessional, too many of them in positions of power...But they will cater to us.....I just couldn't handle them in charge....."
bad,A lot of childish employees who are disrespectful and rude along with management that only cared for his favorites. The work itself wasn’t nowhere near hard unless you made it or others didn’t cooperate with getting the operation moving.
bad,So hard to advanced if you don't have open availability. Salary does not match with cost per living. Culture is always changing. Nothing is consistent. You will be told something and then it changes within months. Not enjoyable.
bad,"The turnover rate, even through temporary applicants was dismal. The company was always short staffed which led to terrible working conditions. The supervisors were slow to help and the manager stayed in their office. You have to be dead to get an excused absence. I was in a car accident and got an unexcused absence even with a doctor and hospital note. During the holiday season, you were forced to work 7-8 hours with no breaks."
bad,"few hours of work every day, not good administration, you have to learn on your own how to operate your equipment. the only good is work as a team do the job ."
bad,"The managers are just awful at the Tonawanda location, as are a lot of the CPA account administrators. You are reviewed every day as an import coordinator and it is difficult to dispute any negative reviews that you receive from QA. Government regulations can really trip you up and slow your processing time, which does effect your monthly review ratings with a manager on efficiency and effectiveness numbers, so that's a bummer."
bad,"A empresa não possui estrutura de software para análises, as mudanças propostas não são aceitas."
bad,"Company has to regards for their employees their communication with their employees is low, they will tell you a time to report in, change the time and not let you know until you get their, The trainning needs to be better for managers,."
bad,You would normally start work arounf 4:ooam. Once you get there you would get your equipment if needed and go to your station. Once in your station your manager will give you a safety quote and you will begin your morning. Fedex grounf has a really poor managment team. The managment team are a great group of people but they lack in organization.
bad,Typical day at work fast paced and I get to meet a lot of new different people everyday. The hardest part of the job is during Christmas time. I enjoy being outdoors and interaction with people.
bad,"A lot of people would like to have you believe that working for FTN/FedEx is so prestigious and it's such a great job but it really depends on WHO you know not what you know or your work ethic. Which I can understand to an extent, but that isn't fair for everyone. So it's not a lot of room for growth unless you know the right people. That has been my experience at least. Most of the jobs in the office are quite tedious and repetitive so if you're fine with routine then maybe you'll like it. If you're looking for a challenge this isn't the place to go. But if you're looking for stability go for it."
bad,Slow past work the management was acceptable basic work nothing too much was ask for pellet jacking.. machine work packing and handing management was very helpful
bad,There is no socializing. They do not want you to have  any type of conversation with co-workers. Not a friendly environment. It could be just the managers and not the branches.
bad,"it was temporary job and it very stressful crazy shifts.  I would recommend any of my friends to work there . my supervisor she was crazy asf, overall it was bad experience."
bad,I was super excited when I first started this job a few years ago.  I worked really hard and thought I was doing great but management always finds some way or something nit picky to make sure you don't get a decent raise.  There is rampant favoritism among almost all working groups and those favorites are the ones that will get the high ratings.  This company does not care at all about family or health issues either.  If a close family member dies they will quote rules at you instead of having sympathy for you.  I have watched as the team I work for has pretty much disappeared because of the micromanaging of the manager.  The job for me has pretty much become unbearable even with good pay and benefits there comes a time when you have to figure out if it is worth your happiness and mental health.  The most enjoyable part of the job for me is when it is time to leave or when I have vacation.  The only plus side I have gotten from this experience is that I have now had office training and I have a certification but that is about it.
bad,"Empresa com política ótima de trabalho, paga seus funcionários em dia. Mas na filial onde trabalhei meus superiores eram extremamente despreparados. Empresa que somente promove se você estiver estudando e quem não tem condição de pagar uma faculdade morre na função que entrou. Não existe carga horária de trabalho conforme no contrato, você trabalha finais de semana, feriados e depois do horário."
bad,Management was poor and often went into work and got sent home because there was too many people to work what had to be done. Some volunteered to leave while others were hand picked when they still had to cut people to leave. It wasn't always the same people picked but it was often there wasn't enough work to be spread between everyone there.
bad,"Poorly managed, no paid time off, no benefits, no vacation time. The hardest part of my job is being able to get out of the building at a reasonable time."
bad,I worked for federal express ground. It was not a family type job because I worked long hours sometimes 12 hours in a day on average 10 and close to 50 a week. It was stressful and very very physical with lots of repetitive lifting. I never received any benefits through them either and has to leave.
bad,While working at Fedex in my opinion the managers could be better hands on with the over load of packages. The over all company could respond better with work compensation claims.
bad,Unrealistic expectations. Lack of benefits.  Zero incentives. No communication.  Poor equipment.  No career advancement. Hazardous equipment. No bonus  offered.
bad,to make sure the drivers routs or set right and that there our no issues they might be having and send them on there way and then get my self to go with my stops.
bad,Poor quality of family time. Offered no benefits. Constantly over the road with very few days off. Four hour commute to work there and back. Poor communication between employees and management.
bad,"No room for advancement despite hardest effort given. Scheduled shift was great. Handful of good hard working employees. Management ""listens"" and does nothing to help resolve issues."
bad,This was a great company and paid well. The hours aren't good because you have to work a split shift if you want full time hours. The health benefits are excellent . The opportunity for advancement isn't very good and the security people are horrible. They fired me for a mechanical mistake. Not my mistake.
bad,"Empresa Rapidao Cometa foi comprada pela empresa FedEx recentimente"
bad,"Working at this place is not for everyone. You must be willing to sacrifice your overall health and dignity. Managers sit in a tower where you cant see them but they definitely can see you. If you make a mistake you will be called into the tower to be ridiculed by two or more ""managers"". Absolutely not a place I would allow my children to work unfortunately."
bad,Everyone should be treated equal since we are all working under the same company. I actuallly think every employee should a bonus every month. And on holidays should receive time and half.
bad,Worked has pick and packer at fedex bedford  for 6 month and the job is not bad but the manager is a complete idiot who as no clue how to manage a team
bad,"If you are into the label then its not a bad place to work. The was ok but not enough for the labor. Its get old after a while, but its a start when hard to find a job."
bad,"This is a good job for someone fresh out of High School or who does not have a family. There are a lot of corporate politics, but with much needed time & patience, it is possible to advance. High stressful environment, nobody really trains you, no hours."
bad,"I have no idea how I was able to endure the 5 months I worked there. I prefer to be moving around than to sit around so this job was perfect for me. So I thought.. "
bad,"Too many people that have no idea what makes the company run making too many rules that look good on paper but make daily operations impossible. ALWAYS looking over your shoulder wondering if your going to be fired for breaking some rule. Always being threatened, everyday, with your job, regardless of how competent you are. Managerial favoritism runs rampant. supervisory incompetence is on exhibit everyday. dock supervisors don't stay long so usually have ones with less than 6 months dock worker experience before made supervisor. good pay and benefits if you can hold on to them"
bad,They only have one recruiter that they want to use and they lie to you and tell you that you will be doing full cycle recruiting. They are always over budget and they have their favorites. Job environment is very cut throat. Manager allows people to say what they want to say. Very unprofessional. No organization. Best part was overtime and being able to leave and handle personal issues. Worse part was no professionalism and organization. Things changed constantly week to week.
bad,"Decent wage scale; poor on safety unless you speak up; rapid weight loss if you work hard (and you will); advancement not likely unless you can hold your liquor @ Randolph's; yellow Dr. Pepper's and other mess no one in their right mind would leave for someone else to work around; occasional bennies for unloaders from independent contractors born with sense; sympathies go to the good people stuck there, they have those, too."
bad,The problem is not the work but the management. They don't know how to talk to people with respect. Treat you like a slave even if you are a great worker.
bad,"High production, you have to be efficient/ strong to perform this position.  If you can work here you can work anywhere, great job experience."
bad,"Fedex is base on fast paste and consistency, I learned about strength efficiency and certainty. Management team makes effort  to build up their factory to help better the work involvement; Diversity today in the work environment is good it brings challenges. The hardest part  is the physical work, the enjoyable part was meeting and learning your co-workers."
bad,"Parcels get thrown about and broke sometimes opened if it was sweets they were eaten broken parcels were just tossed in the corner if a van driver couldn't be bothered dropping a parcel off they'd hide it in the warehouse or rip the address sticker off..I worked there for 5 1/2 years..Treat the drivers bad give them rubbish lorrys rubbish overtime rate,Fill you full of false promises don't give a dam about the warehouse workers either it's all about lining managements pockets at the end off the day.."
bad,"A typical day at FedEx starts with the loads not being ready. City drivers are expected to help with everything from loading trucks, to helping with logistics including using their personal phones without compensation. Management tends to seek out those for leadership positions that do not question things. Qualified personnel are often over looked if they are outspoken."
bad,"FedEx was a transition job for me.  Although I was only a part time worker, i do not feel I was compensated enough for the work i provided."
bad,"I learned that FedEx looks good on a resume because it is a growing company that has a very recognizable name but that the managers are more worried about hitting quotas for diversity than they are about actually developing their employees. After stepping up from a package handler, pay raises don't happen. Package Handlers start off with a higher salary than other positions when being a package handler is the entry level."
bad,"as it says in the review summary. they don't know what is going on if a employee calls out with in the management team, They consistently cuts hours back, they don't work with their couriers"
bad,"Communicate with co workers, assistance other with their packages and prepare to delivery your  daily package on a timely fashion."
bad,"It was a great place to work eight years ago, but has change a lot. They really don't care about the employees and customer like they once did."
bad,"Its a job"
bad,"I decided to change career directions so I quit my job and then shortly after went to work as a home delivery driver until I could establish more of a long-term plan & direction.  I started as a seasonal driver for a contractor (not directly for fed-ex) and was then offered a full-time position with the same contractor for doing a good job (fed-ex ground/ home delivery drivers work for contractors)."
bad,i work in the warehouse and its very hot and kind of hard. They dont give out more than 13 hrs a week and dont really work with your schedule if you have work or school to go to early in the morning.
bad,This was a fun place to work in the past as a counier and this was in the DC area. This is night and day when moving back to the south.
bad,"being a package handler at fedex is not bad keeps moving at all times. But the hours are not stable, one week ill get my 40 hours and the rest of the month ill be lucky to clear 30. the job best suites college kids."
bad,"Terrible leadership, too much favoritism,  otherwise you get dumped on.  But of you kiss butt things might get better. Most employees are pretty cool, but you have they kiss butts scamming the crusty position. So be  carefull of the clicks..if you're a woman and want to get a head make sure you bat your eyes things will open up for you."
bad,"Entrar a laborar a las 9am , llegar 8:20 am hacer limpieza en la sucursal y a las 9am en punto alzar la cortina parta recibir a los clientes . ya mas de 5 clientes esperando y atender a todos como se debe ."
bad,"The days were long, but I learned how to plan a route. Management was ok. not much contact with others. The job was hard but it was good steady employment."
bad,"Poorly paid, so you can't really afford the expensive benefits they provide. Each water jug is 43 lbs each. You will deliver more than 100-150 of these daily. Up stairs, hills, steps or whatever with 100 lbs added to your own weight. Hands will hurt continuously, back and legs will take a beating. Not worth the low pay they provide. Tap water, filtered, then bottled and delivered for $4-$8 per bottle. You are also required to sell products that are extremely overpriced while driving around in a 30k lb truck that you must get your own heavyweight endorsement for."
bad,some managers are willing to help you advance in the company other are scared if you do a good job that you will take their place and they will do everything they can to make you mesirable and quit
bad,"The job is not bad is you have the right management, but it doesn't have any benefits and no real security cause they get rid of you at any time without any consequences."
bad,"Work/Life balance is nonexistent when working 2nd or 3rd shift."
bad,Most of the management team treat you with little respect. The work is very stressful each and everyday.
bad,"the best part in fed ex ground was leaving the building, and then down hill from there. Most of the time you are running to get the job done. mistake start to fall in miss p/u time window and not getting all deliveries done in a timely matter...."
bad,I was the night time inbound supervisor and was responsible for 118 doors with trucks to load or unload. Along with 20 dock workers and trailer drivers i usually worked 12 plus hours per day
bad,"The managers had no communication skills, lack of concern for the packages and vehicles, and completely consumed in their bonuses."
bad,Would not do again. No pay raises. No consistency. No organization.
bad,Managers need to reevaluate their operational strategies and pay their supervisors for the hard work they do.
bad,"hard working out going loves to work with others self motivate, follow through well with directions"
bad,"a typical day on the job is me running the control desk ,handing out, orders making sure all orders in deparment go out and on time,as well as picking, shipping and packing basiclly I'm the lead without the pay. when something gose wrong i fix the problem."
bad,"Poor training... You are better off working or staying at UPS... The pay is no difference compare to UPS... You only work 3 hour with no break compare to UPS 4- 5 hour, and if you done good work maybe up 8 hours..."
bad,"print digital file to color printers"
bad,"I worked as a package handler and it is a very demanding job, it requires you to constantly lift packages weighing at least 75-100 lbs."
bad,"low pay, watched like a hawk all day, very low hours, even full time employees would not get their full 36 hours, slavedrivers"
bad,"My day starts with me labeling and putting all of the boxes in order inside the truck before I load the big packages inside the truck and then I begin driving."
bad,"No benefits, No vacation pay, No 401k. Co-workers are good people, but I think this work environment is only good for those without children or unless your children are young adults."
bad,manual labor. unloading and loading packages onto a trailer. Very hot .Managers have no respect for their employees. Willing to fired you at the drop of a hat.
bad,"training in fort worth is horrible....very much a ""sink or swim "" mentality. there is no training progression monitored and the management is horrible. they hide behind their red shirts and walk around with attitudes. they expect you to know the every day routine and will not show you or teach you, they only tell you. I dont know  what or why we do the things we do and I feel this falls on poor training and management. you manage your job description but you should lead people. there is no accountability for arrogant senior employees that run over part time or newer employees. I have not been asked how im doing or if im even getting the material, all i know is that if not to par on my bills per hour, people get sent home. i hope this fixes or at least sends a message to corporate. The pattern that this represents does not show a strong future for this company."
bad,"A typical day would be you show up at four in the morning, work your butt off moving packages, and if the supervisors like you, they'll send you home at eight when the work is done. If not, then they send you home at six, leading to a two hour work day. Five days a week. Any chance for advancement depends entirely on how much you are friends with the supervisors and managers. If you are invited to join them for drinking and basketball, or if you're an attractive female, then you're gold. Once you start getting benefits, though, expect your prospects of getting good hours to dwindle."
bad,"a lot of travelling."
bad,A typical work day was good working with other co-workers. Good hours.
bad,"Upper management gave themselves up to an 80% raise but told us, profit was not where it needed to be to afford giving us a raise.  Then the next year the raise was 2% but by the time you calculated the rise in healthcare costs, we had actually lost a substantial amount of money."
bad,Hard work with little to no cooperation from coworkers. I learn that communication is key from all areas of operation. Management communication is slow. My coworkers do no have a good work ethic.  The hardest part of my job is getting my coworkers to work together. The most enjoyable part of my job is going home.
bad,"Once a great company is now just another job, no employee loyalty, treatment of employees is borderline nursery school. Moral is super low and they micro manage to the highest level."
bad,it was nice days and  good days the people where friendly and the enviroment was open.
bad,This was not a bad place to work part-time. I am no longer there because management REFUSED to manage the availability of the workers who were able to remain after the average morning schedule.  
bad,"FedEx acquired my former employer, Watkins Motor Lines, whom I thought was the best trucking company to work for. Watkins treated their people very fairly and with respect. FedEx on the other hand were deleting positions that were desperately needed in order to ""streamline"" their operation and ""weed out"" former Watkins managers. I was one of them. I know this sounds very negative, but my responsibilities increased as far as requirements and time on the job while my pay was decreased and advancement next to impossible......they eventually deleted my position as well."
bad,"Lots of packages come into various trailers, scan the trailer your in, then scan packages into trailer and build steady sturdy walls. Its like getting paid to workout basically. packages come fast and you got to scan and load faster."
bad,"I have been there for three years. It fits in with my school schedule so I have decided to stick it out until graduation. Management is poor in terms of decision making, but they are great people nonetheless. "
bad,Expected to give and give to company.  When push comes to shove you will have no backing by your supervisor or manager if a mistake is made!
bad,delivery driver was a great paying job however the managament had no idea what they were doing and would do anything to cover their own backs.
bad,Sorting my truck daily to assure my route was as productive as possible for the best time management.
bad,"I liked working here, but I wish I was able to land a full time owner operater position and obtain a full time route"
bad,"I worked at Fedex Ground in Lewisberry for 2 and a half years, was a terrible place to work, but it was my first job, so it was all i was used to, good for getting into physical shape but it starts taking its toll after a while, Management yell at their employee's over loud speakers all the time, you double the rate they ask and they still push you to work more, they don't push those who aren't making the rates. They do not encourage safety, for example i had a 150 lb package, and i can handle it by myself no problem, but i asked my manager for help and he said ""naa you can handle it."" They say safety is number one priority, but they don't mean it, as they say, Move the work, and do it safely, but notice which one comes first."
bad,"Work was there, so I was able to get hours, things could have been better in all."
bad,"This company was good for a while. Always fast paced days went by fast. However, when management is looked at it was a hostile work environment full of favortism."
bad,Typical day at work was an up & down type of day
bad,"Lack career development and strategic direction, very reacctive to market changes and trends."
bad,16- 18 hour days and MDROs are less intelligent than the dockworkers.
bad,Unload trucks by hand 1100 packages an hour
bad,"This has been the best and worst place to work. The hours are long (12-13 hours a day) with no overtime, the work is busy, but you will get a great workout everyday. Great group of co-workers make the job a little better. You get no benefits such as medical/dental, no job security at all."
bad,Fair and honest work ethics. Knowlegable employer and management.
bad,Very toxic Management with a harsh work-life balance. Anti-union mentality. This created no room for improvement or empowerment of employees or their ideas.
bad,Company takes care of the customer but at the sake of the employee They pretend to care for their people but spend most of the mgmt time reprimanding.
bad,It was ok I  just got tired of running from job and pay was low. I also got tired of lifting heavy furniture. Men didn’t tell really want to help if needed
bad,"Some get a 4 hour shift "
bad,When I first started at FedEx it use to be a great outlet for me. It was very physical so I didn't have to go to the gym. A few of the managers really cared
bad,This place does not treat all warkers the same. Smalls do not get the credit they need since we did not get much help. You try to talk to managers and they just give you more work
bad,I didn’t like the setting at all. It was very discouraging to come to work. You were often treated as just a number to get the job done which is why I wasn’t very fond of coming to work.
bad,"You are limited to 20 to 24 hours per week so the company doesn't have to pay you health insurance. That doesn't change even when you are promoted."
bad,I was fired by fed ex because I would not break traffic laws they got mad and another driver broke the law and almost hit me and I said something to him about it and they fired him for being reckless and fired me because they know I won’t break laws delivering fed ex does not practice what they preach I was fired because I did not kiss butt but they don’t train you on it in orientation
bad,"Hard labor; minimum wage should be $17. They want you to almost kill yourself just to hit an goal so area and sort managers can get a bonus. You tell some of them certain jobs you can’t do because you need help. They tell you , you can do it by yourself!"
bad,If you value free time this is not a good place to work as they will force you to go full time or you will be written up for the smallest things you do
bad,Their subcontractors are a joke they don’t offer insurance they don’t pay for medical term and on top of that when you go get your CDL for one of them and come back to work for two weeks and then you get laid off
bad,I did not like starting work at 3 a.m.  When i was hired I was promised eight hours per day.  In reality I was only getting between four to five hours per day.
bad,"Is a very stressfull place to work, started off not to bad at the start of working there but over the years it got worst as they demand more and more of you."
bad,Working at Fedex can have it's ups and downs however it takes alot of patience to deal with  managers and keeping up with the load rate also heavy Boxes
bad,This is very hard work.  In the summer it's very hot.  In the winter it's very cold.  When it rains you get very wet!!  All management cares about is deliveries and absolutely NO AUTO ACCIDENTS!!
bad,"This company has changed over the years. There is no money to be made unless you are a contractor and, if you’re not white, you’re not going to be a contractor. Plus, there is no distinction or pride as a driver for this company anymore that it’s preferable to use other shipping channels until this company pays better wages to its employees and affiliates."
bad,Is a good job but no coordination don’t have have time to go out there’s no overtime it is a flat paid they don’t consider you they just want you to work
bad,"Preloading (putting packages on trucks or carts for the truck drivers) is more interesting to me than unloading (taking inbound packages off the trucks), but can be frustrating when the packages are thrown down from the other half of the line and when the Android-based scanner decides not to work.  It is difficult to set and keep a sleep schedule that works for the 3:30-8:00a shift.  A significant part of orientation was how to survive a workplace shooter, even before general safety or how to load and unload packages.  The hardest part of the job is by far the schedule.  Some of the packages are extra-heavy as well.  The best part of the job is the satisfaction of getting the packages to the truckers so they can deliver them to the people (or pets, in the case of boxes from Chewy.com) that they are being sent to."
bad,To much pressure to get job done and they really dont care about employees.they play the favoritism game alot and have shown to be racist towards minorities
bad,"FedEx makes you feel like you should be grateful to have a job. The culture is the job should come first above all else. Executive and management positions do not demonstrate the ""Purple Promise"" and the bottom line is always drawn in the sand. Just depends on which side you are on."
bad,"You start each morning loading your truck, unpaid since you are paid on a per stop basis.  After spending a couple hours loading and waiting for sorting to be done you leave.  A typical day you work 10-12 hours for either a fixed rate of pay (if your stop count doesn't meet minimum requirements) or you are paid a fixed rate for each delivery made.  No health or wealth benefits, 1 week paid time off after 1 year of service."
bad,"During the holiday season, you can work as much as your heart desires. But outside of that, you’ll be lucky to pull 25-30 hours a week. The workload is taxing on your body after a while, especially when you’re repetitively picking up and moving heavy packages. Wouldn’t recommend especially if you’re looking for a solid work life balance."
bad,"No overtime paid even tough you work more than 50 hours a week. Fedex should rethink the contract with the contractors. They dont give any advantages to employees. No medical insurrance, no overtime, no sick days"
bad,"Id be texted the day before what time to come in. Hours were inconsistent, and so was management. I was not properly trained on some things from my team lead and had to be trained by other coworkers. I also felt like the pay was far too low for the amount of labor i was doing. The warehouse was small and not properly ventilated."
bad,Typical day started by getting checked in by the security guards to allow the employees on the docking area. Then when i get to my assigned area we start by scanning boxes an placing them in a truck trailer.
bad,".... if you know someone already employed with the company, or who can put in a good word for you, then you could be ok. But, if you go in there on your own and expect to be treated fairly, it probably won’t happen."
bad,A typical day at work for me involves a lot of loading and unloading reprinting label help move damaged or lost packages.The hardest part of the job is doingwork for others easiest part
bad,"If you work harder then everyone you will be used abused and thrown to the side when you are too exhausted to work hard anymore. Mentally stressful as you watch the lazy people get to leave early and goof off, while you have to work hard or you get threatened to get fired. If you ask question when you are told to do questionable stuff, you are told you are ""creating a hostile work environment"". Management  is a joke."
bad,"The company don’t care about their employees. They have a “purple promise week” and Warehouse appreciation month but do nothing for the employees, you could get lucky and have one manager try to pull something together out of their own pocket, but the other managers don’t want to help. It’s sad. The younger employees don’t work hard and the older employees work too hard. There is no balance."
bad,"No one held accountable, unqualified managers. Only hire one ethnicity at the location I was at. It's all about the numbers. It you are of the other ethnicity you will be harassed, bullied and not treated like others. SAD!"
bad,"I absolutely love my job bur the environment makes it not worth the struggle. The only way it seems that you can move up in the company is if you get super close to the higher up managers (no matter how many recommendations, good reviews, or good skills you display) They teach who the choose no matter how much you show/explain that you would like to learn more. Everything that your manager does get over looked if they have built a relationship witht the DM so it really make it seem like there is nowhere to turn for help. The managers deligate task to who they "" trust"".. and you can be a person who they push off most of their load too but then they will come back and explain that you are not ready for any promotions.The company really pushes a no retaliation policy but i have seen retaliation and been through it while working here."
bad,"This company overall can be good (pay and benefits) however I felt it was a dead end. Management did not provide any training and professional development to  encourage advancement within the company. Management does not invest the time and mentorship that the employees deserve. Employees are often spoken down to, over-worked, unappreciated, and made to feel invaluable. This is a large company and you are basically a number on a badge. I worked for the company for 8 years, safe driving record, no incidents, always met SRT times, never written up, great attendance record, and yet was treated like a piece of dirt and sweep out the shop. This could have been an isolated situation with my particular management, but be aware that he may have learned this behavior from others and the likelihood that there are others like him at other locations is probable."
bad,"I worked for FedEx for almost 3 years, and was NEVER given the opportunity to move up within the company. Worked overtime, weekends, holidays--nothing. Twice they chose employees who had only been there for 2/3 months; another time I wasn't even given an interview."
bad,"You're not properly compensated for the amount of work that you'll be doing. All over time is mandatory! It doesn't matter how hard you work, it's about who you know or are related to. Managers and other employees get away with bullying and harassment of any kind. HR is there for the managers! It's sad... I liked it the first 2 years that I was there but I spent the next year or so looking for another job. I got 2 promotions with small raises but never any leadership roles. My advice would be to leave the company after 2 or 3 years if you're not promoted to a leadership role... If that's what you want. I stayed until I found a better paying job which was hard to do in Memphis... I already have a leadership role after a year."
bad,"Major problems and issues i had with this job, it was part time so i would literally work 2.5/3 hour shifts. I would be told through text by my manager 30 minutes to an hour before he wants me to come in. The amount of effort and work others put in other than most others dont get recognized or addressed."
bad,"I worked for almost 1 year and the management only care about production. Work was slow, only managed about 32 hours on a good week. No where near enough smarts to live off of."
bad,"I worked for fedex freight"
bad,"If you intended to apply, or are interested in working at FedEx, I suggest coming to work and doing your job, and your job only. The more you do, the more they expect from you (like most places). While at the same time zero expectations from coworkers. Don’t be hellbent on moving up, unless you know someone, even then you’re chances aren’t that great. They cycle through management and staff like crazy, always hiring. They put a lot of strain on employees, over working them causing injuries and people to get sick. The stressful environment causes people to leave FedEx after a short period of time. Managers come and go, some more knowledgeable than others. Very few people get fired, and very few put in a 2 week notice, most just walk out and never come back. Great heath care options, at a decent rate (if it’s just you) but you do not qualify until you’ve reached 1000 hours. Part time, it could take up to a year and sometimes longer, depending how much you do there. If you plan on insuring your spouse or children your take home will be minimum."
bad,"A typical day at work consist of different aspects of the job depending on your job title. The management in the facility is kind of lacking in the compassion department, but the employees are relatively good people when they are not seeking to move up at the expense of others. The work is easy but the people can sometimes make it hard."
bad,"This was my fourth job...at 46 years old. I never felt so unhappy, unwanted, and indespensible. I required mental health  services from this position.  I look at the men and women making $11 dollars an hour walking in pain and being pushed to do more. The staff comes after the mission.  Hurt or not,  you are expected to perform at 100%. I pray for those still there because they have to be."
bad,"Annotated shipping orders to department of loading location and time of arrival of transportation. "
bad,"Road Driver (Current Employee) –  Las Vegas, NV – April 16, 2019"
bad,FedEx was very dreading and draining. The work environment was not very comfortable and there was a lot of arguing on the daily. I just wouldn't recommend the job to anyone.
bad,"I never worked more than 5 hours a day. Hours varied from 3-7am or 4-8am. A few times I only worked an hour and got sent home. You work 6 days a week. Good job for a student, but definitely not one to make a living off of. If you don't live in the area it's not worth it to travel. You get no breaks."
bad,"I worked here for 8 years and since mike ducker and others that have been running operations for decades all leaving.Fedex will loose ground due to amazon. If they don’t like you they target you and treat you poorly.The employees make outlandish sometimes racist comments all day and they use profanity continuously.Pay is good but the culture and atmosphere has gone down.If management thinks you Will surpass them they will try to block you in anyway for advancement.Freight is constantly being damaged,our terminal is a mess.They hire uneducated people off the street to run operations and they are destroying the company."
bad,It was okay. CEO decided to move all jobs to HQ in Memphis which was a shock to everyone. They are avoiding paying severance and calling it a layoff but it effective is.
bad,"Things have gotten worse, management has poor communication. Also the lack of responsibility between the managers and the loaders, items that are misloaded are considered to be our fault."
bad,Job overall was a good bit with the exception of inconsistent  work hours and pay. The least enjoyable part of the job was pay but best was the physica
bad,a typical day was loading your vehicle with packages. An average day was 140 stops to residential and business establishments. A lot of long hours as all packages have to be delivered for that day.
bad,I start by unloading several trucks with packages as heavy as me. I then proceed to move over to the side where those packages come down where I then load them into the trucks as well.
bad,It was a fairly easy job my position was loading and picking it had a lot of fun and friendly people there who were easy to get along with plus it gives you great benefits
bad,I would haver to load my truck everyday to start my day and deliver packages to customers homes on a daily basis.I would start early in the morning and would work to late in the evening.
bad,"Not a great place to work. Management treat sub-contractors badly, basically just an employee with no rights. Hardly any chance of a holiday, no help when busy, no sick pay, no pension. Only talk to you when they need something. No work comes in, then you don’t get paid"
bad,The work that is needed to be done at FedEx is not necessarily stressful. The management of a day to day positon can be in how one delver information or what one expect out of the company for the employees.
bad,Working only 4 hours a day did not cover any expenses I had. There was no full time available and no overtime available either. I would not recommend being a material handler at fedex of you are looking for a career.
bad,I had to load my own truck no help at all this was a slary based contract job started my day loading my own truck I had no help delivering my pacages if I had a lot oh well I had to deal with it
bad,"The company was fine to work for but at the time I was looking for"
bad,Seriously don't work at this soul crushing idiot factory. You wake up too early to get too little pay you better off looking some where else. trust me
bad,My experience at this job was terrible. Most of the managers did not know what they were doing. They were always hiring new people because every body was quiting there job. A lot of the workers were lazy. Besides they it was a good workout and a lot of the employees were nice enough to help me.
bad,"Worked for 5 years at the sgf center consistently treated poorly, poor management, lack of care for employees safety and well being, they don't make people take responsibility for there actions and poor work ethic."
bad,"The most physical work I’ve ever done. Over and beyond what the contract called for. And hours, you have to find on your own. Which I did. The night sort is the most extreme and physically demanding. It’s a revolving door when it comes to keeping really good people."
bad,They tell you to pack as many boxes in the truck as possible. Then when you pack more boxes then other people and the truck sits there longer because you doing a good job they get mad.
bad,"U get a good break sometimes ,discount on phone bill and people that work well and a timely pace good training help eachother with no problem get off on time"
bad,For what FedEx paid I feel like it was too low. This job is very back breaking. And you’re always being pushed around if you’re doing a good job. Good money but definitely deserve more.
bad,package handler term members are not team players they will get u fussed out by the surpervisor and head boss for something they told you to do and its a shame
bad,It was okay place to work Pitstop very late night shifts if you need to work there then you can do so if you are late night person and don't have family more than anything I would recommend not going there because it's very physical and they pound on you pound on you pound on you to get it done so unless you are a for real go-getter that's going to sweat and work for hardly any money and that's place for
bad,This was just a temporary job for Christmas money. It was my first job right out of high school. The place was kind of smelly and I wasn't there long enough to receive any benefits
bad,I think fed ex was unfair to me I was on time everyday and a hard worker. I was asked to leave the because I use the phone on my break to call my children.
bad,"It's a decent enough place if you need a job soon, but a career it is not. Management tends to be friendly but incompetent which leads to many stressful and baffling situations. I wanted to make a career there, but the lack of applicable positions made that impossible. They promised us full time hours by installing a second shift, yet I usually only work 29-30 hours at most. Overall, really dissapointed."
bad,"If you can do 200 stops in 8 hours, go for it.  New scanners have no GPS capabilities. Have to use your own phone. Get written up on every little detail. FedEx doesn't think contractors are employees. But, you have to follow every details and rules they say. Not worth the B.S..  If you want a delivery job. Go to Amazon."
bad,it was kinda hard building them walls but after a couple weeks i got the hang of it the only thing is i got less hour because over staffing at least 2 times a week
bad,Was I having her the job was pretty good working my manager was okay the work was good my work was good around other people the job was pretty easy I work it for 11 years but the work was real good Memphis hub
bad,Would not work there again or suggest it to anyone over 30 years of age.  Learned that I didn't want to do this again.  The people there were the only enjoyable part of the job.
bad,fast-paced environment to go beyond drop off packages is not a job for somebody that likes to  Drive  You have to drive everywhere you got a find parking in this ticket you got to make sure that you don’t get into car accidents
bad,"Truck is load/unload very busy, my arm get injurie only a month, few ppl deaf work together, sign language,work hard for hour without break time only for part time."
bad,"Fed Ex was a very upbeat place to work. Friendly environment. Very energetic environment. The workplace culture was diverse and fair. the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting many people at different locations, getting a daily workout lifting and transporting, and providing great customer service. Management was fair and very helpful."
bad,"I though at the time FEDEX would be a great place to work but time that proved otherwise. The managers only cared for their incentives and push the couriers to make their drop-off and pick-up's on time usually pushing the a high amount of packages to be dropped off. There was also no incentives for the drivers to make their quota, but you warning letter was waiting for you if you didn't make your 95% on package deliveries. Threats of getting letters and write-ups were very common in the work place as well as lack of supporting their employees."
bad,"A typical day at FedEx I would go in wait until my manager would tell me what to do then I would have to unload over 1,000 boxes in a certain time period."
bad,"its a good place to be at but i waork for a contractor so its not the best . but then again this was when i was 3 years ago, im not sure how the contractors are doing things now"
bad,"I would not recommend working fro Fedex home delivery, ground or custom critical as a contractor.  Your time, and or monetary contribution is not valued."
bad,My biggest complaint about FedEx was during peak season your load doubled or tripled with little or no help and they expected you to deliver in any kind of weather.  When running country roads with ice and snow with no cell phones reception was to dangerous.
bad,Worked part-time for 5 years and interviewed at least 2 to 3 times a year and was never offered an opportunity to grow or an opportunity to come on full-time
bad,its hot they need air condition   its a good work environment  its a fast pace witch I love. and  I like working  around people. I am a good worker employees are thrill too work at fed ex
bad,"Go in and start immediately in large hot trucks, not much air flow but was able to get the job done. Lots of heavy boxes but was good for exercise and stating healthy."
bad,"the contractor that i worked for did not care for his employees health,safety,vehicles were all in poor shape,had no benefits,no retirement,no advancement"
bad,"This job will constantly talk about how job advancement is up to you to apply for higher positions, and that is true, but the base level employees will be told to beat their quotas by inhuman amounts every shift, some managers and upper management are fantastic, but most ask for the impossible and don't give the means, the time or the possibility to fulfill them, then ask knowingly why you haven't met them. It is near to impossible to call in sick as you will need your manager's personal phone number to call which they are often hesitant to give, and there are no listed numbers to call online. There are no official breaks, and as such if you take a break you are looked down on or asked why your quota went down for a period of time. The hours can range from 2 to past 9 if you are lucky / unlucky as this job will leave you breathless after 4 hours. Would not work here again."
bad,"I feel that management did not view you as an individual.  They judge you based on others opinions of you, if you were an employed for another FedEx contractor."
bad,enough is never enough.  underpaid and overworked as a manager. they claim to be people first but don't expect managers to treat the people well.  always want more more more.
bad,its on ok job for beginers but does not pay very well... due to the fact that it is salary based they take advantage of the hours and u will be working around 12 hrs a day .
bad,"I ran a contracted route for Fed-Ex many years ago, and it was exactly like I expected to be. I enjoyed the freedom of owning my own business, with the help of the company."
bad,Best job ava. at that moment and bills needed to be paid.I wouldn't recommend it if you had any specific goals in life.If I was a younger man when I started working there it would of still been a stepping stone until I found something a lot better.
bad,"My typical ""day"", is at night. I work a night shift, since this facility I am at operates mainly at night hours. I show up, get my time card, write my time and punch in, then head off to the area I am assigned to. At this job i have learned to sort cargo according to bar code scans and URSA shipping codes. I also learned how to stack and pack cargo in such a way as to maximize use of tight spaces in designated time frames. Management is ever presence there sometime helping in tasks other time supervising and checking in with employees as to how they are handling the night's load. In terms of workplace culture, things are alright. Since the facility is divided up as it is there, most are simply on the move getting to the next area to aid others in shorting and packing cargo. The hardest part of the job is the sheer amount of physical labor needed to get through the night and the fact that to are working at night and won't finish sometimes well into the morning. The most enjoyable part of the job however, is ironically the work out to get doing said physical labor."
bad,"what can i say this warehouse is run with management that has never did hands on work, they are hired as managers, they do good pep rallys but have no clue what a working man goes through on a daily basis"
bad,"Fedex  is a high occupation with moving and lifting, you must be mentally and also physically incline to stay  employed. Fedex is a great part time job"
bad,It was okay and was grateful for having a job. I learned how to lead as well as follow. I enjoyed learning how to teach others how to load trucks professionally and the job made it's money.
bad,"Because of poor management and the expectation that I knew more that I actually knew, the job was made more difficult.  Sometimes when additional help was necessary, the manager would not help nor provide additional assistance."
bad,Terrible place. Management does not give you the tools to succed. You have to do that on your own or have the other drivers help you So if you want a job were you have to learn on your own here it is
bad,"Military-style management structure.  If you like being told what to do and want to be penalized for challenging the status quo or thinking outside the box then this is the place for you.  No objectives 6 months into year - makes it difficult to know what being held accountable for, let alone what supposed to be working on.  Lack of accountability.  Unqualified management put in positions of authority - bullying and autocratic management style supported.  Employee survey feedback ignored - big joke.  No strategic planning leads to fire drill reaction from managers when work and deadlines presented.  Looking to move on."
bad,Overworked no benefits all right pay it's contracted different boses every contractor offers something different no 401 k management can careless about your day... drive in some of the worst weather every
bad,People stole my lunch and my bus pass. Management did nothing. No lockers No security for anything but car keys. Temporary job mostly. People will get you fired if they can.
bad,"A typical day at work with FedEx was very stressful. I learned how to be patient and respectful. My manager knew how to treat his employees and always put his drivers first. The hardest part of the job was having to load your own truck without any help, and deliver the packages. On some days I had to load and organize more than 200 packages by myself. And the packages were well over the weight limit. The most enjoyable part of the job were the people. My co-workers were very easy to work with and knew the meaning of teamwork."
bad,"its a good job if you are willing to to give most of your day up. great benefits, fast environment. as a started job is great from kids who decide not to attend college."
bad,"I felt like I was stuck in a corner and forgot about. My first manager trained everyone on the line for management except myself due to the fact that I followed company procedure when dealing with a co-worker that tried to harass me. The coworker was a friend of the manager. I repeatedly asked several managers to find a new place for me within the factory but I was ignored. There was a high volume of favoritism and when new managers were brought in, that favoritism was passed to the next ones. Not a company I recommend for anyone."
bad,"Very stressful work experience, had to work mandatory overtime in December then once January came your hours were cut or you were laid off. Mangement not very good"
bad,fed ex was a pretty good place to work but it was really cold in the winter an really hot in summer. It was a very dirty do to all of the forklift on the floor
bad,It was a agency that worked for fedex. Under staffed and over worked long days and nights. Alot of stress and manager was no help when asked for help.
bad,A typical day at work is very busy and working at a very fast pace. I have learned how to handle packages pack them and wrap. MAnagement  is far I haven't had any problems there yet. The hardest part of the job is labeling the packages. The most enjoyable part of the job is stacking the packages.
bad,"the job was was ok for the most part. only exception was management was not all was the best at times."
bad,Fedex literally sapped the life out of me while i worked there.  Lack of advancement and they would make you work past your scheduled 8 hours because the managers were awful at scheduling
bad,You'll learn to work as a team and take initiative when others don't. hours vary so be prepared to basically be on call. have enough food ready and stay hydrated.
bad,didnt like the work culture or ethics at that facility really wasnt encouraged or discouraged to move up the ladder new personnel ever few days wondered why i was their to begin with
bad,Co workers would not show up to morning shift to work. When they wouldn't show up it made the work load harder. They didn't work as a team. Truck drivers would come in with an attitude.
bad,"Technically I didn't work directly for Fed Ex. I worked for a contract company that worked for Fed Ex. The company I worked for was absolutely horrible and they eventually got fired from Fed Ex for doing illegal stuff. Having said that, while I worked there, I did get a chance to talk to people that worked directly for Fed Ex. They said it was a great place to work with all sorts of great benefits and great pay. I've since then tried to get on with them with no luck."
bad,A typical day of work is coming in blindsided on what you are going to do. There always something that happens that keeps you from finishing your route on time. Management had poor communication and never made decisions that made sense. Everyday people came stressed because they never knew what was going to happen. Never could plan time with family because never knew when you were going to be done or if it was a holiday you knew you were going to be working.
bad,no room for advancement not enough hours.   the work is great and straight forward but cannot advance in the position without education background. great company
bad,Good worker in a fast paced work environment.heavy lifting required at times and sometimes you had no assistance. Often had to work in either warm or cold conditions
bad,"Fun environment to work in, was busy most of the day. Management is horrible and extremely unprofessional. Pay was garbage and no room for advancement."
bad,"Management was horrible. Pay was not competitive with other delivery companies. Work environment was hostile. If you wasn't a ""chosen"" one you got the short end of the stick."
bad,this was a very fast past job with a lot of heavy packages that I had to move and place into trucks so that they could go to different locations. I never got 40 hours
bad,"investigating deviations for problems that may have occurred on a shipment - whether temperature excursion, damaged freight or improper procedures performed - especially when other carriers are involved"
bad,Fedex provide good work environment and employee support in regards to operational requirements.   They also organized sports events and recreational  bonding events.
bad,nothing to say the people that runs it is so unprofessional trucks broke down all the time the checks bounces. bad work place stuff always coming down late you never get out on time.
bad,"Not enough hours and no benefits. No room for advancement. A nice environment to work at. Face paced and always busy. Management willing to help you and there is plenty of overtime during the holiday season, Everyone is nice and friendly. The department is really really hot in the spring and summer months. The location is only convenient if you have a car."
bad,You begin by loading your truck according to the freight.  After the loading is complete.  You drive to your route and begin to deliver packages.  Always looking for an opportunity to open new accounts.
bad,"the work load isn,t bad but the manager at the time thought he was God.  If you did things your way you were wrong if you did things his way you were still wrong."
bad,"Pays well but it is a lot of difficult maneuvers in tight areas and a ton of lifting, pulling, pushing, and climbing. Management is terrible and it seems most people who work here are not happy which makes the environment unpleasant."
bad,fedex is a very hard labor workplace. They will work you until you cant possible work anymore. They have such high expectations and cruel work environments. They barely allow you any good breaks and restroom opportunities. The management there have no respect for employees.
bad,Atypical workday is harsh and unprofessional. No one tot train new employees or no real training program. It is always hot or really cold inside of the facility depending on the season.
bad,"Just like any other job. Fedex has its pros and cons. The hardest part part of the job in my opinion is waking up at 2:30 Monday through Friday. The most enjoyable part of working at FedEx freight I'm my personal opinion is that even though we work part time hours, we get get paid decent per hour."
bad,Management has since changed.  My original manager was fabulous to work for and today I am still in contact with.  I was moved to a different team because of my skills and they needed assistance fixing the team.  It was not the team that needed assistance it was the removal of the manger.  They would not move me back to my original manager so I left.
bad,The company had limited management opportunities for advancement or change opportunities to change roles. Leadership was not there to assist in daily desk routine either.
bad,"Fedex was my first job, as a first job i did not think it was a very good company to work for due to the amount of work you do for the pay and the hours were inconsistent."
bad,Really enjoyed this company will refer friends to work through them. The hours were perfect looking forward to working through them in the future. They are really good to them r employees.
bad,"If you are a college student that needs a job that works with your school schedule, Fedex Ground is a good place to go. They will work with your school schedule in any way possible. The management was not the best, most of the time they acted like they did not know what to do. Hardest part was having to deal with lazy co-workers. Most enjoyable was the easy days where we could have some fun on the job."
bad,"always cutting hours, terrible work times"
bad,great easy job  works with all type of people.. climatr control   . not much danger is this field .. i like this job Alot.  remind me such of family and getting paid !
bad,"The work is fast paced which makes time fly which I liked. You will be pushed to your limit physically which can be a good work out if you like that sorta thing. Shifts are typically 3-4 hours but can be up to 8 hours with NO breaks.  I've seen people sit in the bathroom for 10 mins just to get away. Management is subpar with no real management or people skills. They see the volume of packages and labor hours available and are under pressure to have good numbers.  People are sent home early to get them off the clock while the hard workers finish what the lazy ones did not. Pretty much the harder you work the harder they will work you. "
bad,FedEx isa good job for anyone that wants a dead end job. I deal with a contractor. There are no benefits or hourly pay. It is a very stressful job from running a route to lifting heavy packages.
bad,I work there for a year and 3 months and never got to spend time with my family because at FedEx the harder you work the more work you get and this has happen multiple times
bad,"immense. Cold, cavernous. Silent, despite thousands of people quietly picking items, or standing along the conveyors quietly packing or box-taping, nothing noisy but the occasional whir of a passing forklift. ."
bad,"This place makes you think it will be good because of the pay and the first week of training isn't bad but then, after that they exploit you with work that isn't worth the pay. Would not recommend working here. Very injury prone work place."
bad,"Fast pace work place that prepared me to move at efficient speed and store boxes up to 120 inches combined length and girth, up to 50 inches long, and weighing up to 80 pounds neatly."
bad,this is a fast pace company so you really have to be on top of your toes but this makes the day go a lot faster I mean the work is always move with makes the day go by faster
bad,"When working for Fed Ex you have to be safe and watch for others. Management will not do that. Keep to yourself, Easy to be blackballed & not know it, If you are a yes man/woman and do things by the book you may have a chanch to move up. If one manager does not like you then all managers do not like you. They say they do but they really don't."
bad,"Intense labor, with little reward, or respect. Performance is ignored, your output is never good enough, you're not working hard enough. Personally heard management say ""You should plan your family emergencies better next time."", to a fellow employee. Had management mock an injury I had sustained. Non-loading jobs were not nearly as bad, as loading though."
bad,Lots of turnover because the facility is poorly managed.  Managers are very hard to work with and don't care about the well being of their employees.  Pay rate is okay.
bad,"Mostly very very hot. Cannot work well in very hot environment and they didn't want you to take breaks. Good "
bad,they only care about themselves and women men will be vulgar and walk all over you. apply at your own risk. I had men hit on me knowing i was in a relationship. I also had one threatened me and say he would cause physical harm to me
bad,Felt More like A Plantation. The Sort Mgr Needs To Be Replaced. The Managers Under Him Are Great But This Guy is something else. the turnover rate is high because of his management.
bad,"Hard work but short hours. You have to learn as you go with little to no help or training. People keep to them selves and let new people sink or swim. The hardest part of the job is the constant lifting, if your not in shape this is not the job for you. The best part is the short hours or if you like to keep to your self and get a small work out then this is the job for you."
bad,Spent 12 years of my professional life there and left with nothing but stress and regret. Was in a solid place and the corporation found a way to filter out single van owners.
bad,"Many times throughout the customer service experience there were customers whom would call in to cause problems. Either knowingly or unknowingly. Many times the customer was completely in the wrong yet we had to break policy to keep them ""satisfied"""
bad,"Too much favoritism across the board.  Policies not enforced across the board.  Breeds an environment of  harassment.  Would not recommend to a friend.  Several upsides and great people to work with, but upper management is not well informed nor do they have industry knowledge."
bad,"Safety mashalling and directing planes"
bad,"Beware, courier position is not what you expect. It's more like Package Handler! Poor management and very difficult hours! Stay Away! With 5 or so supervisors you will be confused from the get go!"
bad,That job has no respect or concern for employee safety and needs. Management is lazy and irresponsible! Not a good work environment worked to death with small pay. Company does not have the employed needed for the jobs to be completed and work the qualified til they quite
bad,"FedEx contracts out the deliveries, which is essentially their way of ensuring they don't have to pay benefits of any sort. They still try to micromanage the contractors, but some of the contractors will stand up for themselves."
bad,"Even if you ask for full time hours, you don't get them.  You may only work up to 2 hours a day which doesn't pay the bills.  FedEx could use some improvement in that area.  If you use this company as a second job then you should be fine but if you use this job to pay your bills, IT WON'T!"
bad,"Back Breaking work"
bad,not a good place to work.people dont work togeather erverone is out for them self worked for con-way for eighteen years much better place to work Fedex has let there equipment run down not safe to drive most of there equipment on the high ways.
bad,Depending on which location and the type of co-workers you have will determine the level of success as well as the path you take in your career. The typical workday is very easy and low stress. The only time it may get a little stressful is during the holiday's but once you get used to that its a piece of cake.
bad,great for part time work ready now for full time position not enough hours and not enough pay to compensate for it good benefits
bad,Fast paced Warehouse Job. Not much cooling in Summer time. But you had amazing co-workers and are pretty laid back on dress code.
bad,"its and ok job to have as part time. after a year you qualify for benefits. this is not a job to take of a household, but is great for extra cash. depending on what you're looking for"
bad,The opportunities to move into higher levels are in view of delivery personnel. If you like the outdoors perfect situation for young and energetic
bad,Unloading everyday with bad management but good and hard working co workers nothing is hard and i really don't enjoy it.
bad,Ensure that customers packages get to the right place. Sorting and moving packages and freight. Using scanning technology to allow customers to track packages. Loading & unloading large trucks.
bad,It was a fast pace job in a warehouse . It wasn't the type of work i could get use to. Also the climate of the warehouse depends on the weather outside.
bad,"the pay per hour was always very good, but aside from peak season it was astoundingly difficult to get even 30 hours. and job advancement was very difficult, seeing that they keep such a small full-time staff."
bad,The work was just too much work for the pay. didn't really find light duty as I was pregnant. no air hot conditions. hours dropped and picked up often. didn't offer maternity pay leave
bad,The only thing good about fedex is the benefits and thats all. the people that work their are rude and uncaring to anythimg outside of their own personal goal.
bad,was there  over 30 years  work/lifebalance poor.benifits good. i have had good managers and very bad ones  38  in all  16 either terminated or had to step down bad ones. when management wants you out they do everything they can to get rid of the older employees.
bad,"I loved working for FedEx freight upholding the Purple Promise, making every FedEx experience outstanding. However, management is very poor at FedEx leading a turnover rate that is unreal. Its sad to see a supervisor quite every month. People just don't stay long and something that should be fixed."
bad,this job requires a great amount of speed. i learned how to work in a very fast pace. workers help out as needed. breaks were short and not enough hours to work. this job was only seasonal for me.
bad,FedEx is provides great benefits to employees. the pay depends on how many hours you put in each week. Good if you need extra income and already have another job
bad,"I worked two Shifts early and afternoon."
bad,"had to unload trucks. how to unload trucks that have several p.o. on them. manangment was ok, and the hardest thing was having to do 2 or more trucks a day."
bad,"Co-workers were the greatest assets in a very high paced environment, worked closely with sales to accomplish the tasks at hand.  The most enjoyable part of the job was dealing well with customers and ensuring their needs were always met, I learned many useful skills that I can transcend into a new work environment with minimal effort and am very easy to deal with and will always go the extra mile to ensure not just my co-workers are looked after but also any customers.  The hardest part of the job was working 12 hour days and never having time for breaks to make sure the job got accomplished, being short staffed was a continued effort so I had to take on many roles."
bad,"Don't apply is you are over 45,  interviews given just to make you feel like an applicant, rejection notes usually arrive home before you return from interview, not a very friendly welcoming atmosphere for the applicant looking to return to the work force...don't bother"
bad,i appreciate fedex office for giveing me the opportunity to join their time but the inconsistency and disconsideration for employees was very much unexpected
bad,Usually you wake up early to sort some boxes but the people are pretty cool. I wouldn't recommend staying long at a job like this.
bad,"Only work here is you need money the wages are not worth it. The people are cool but the work is very very fast paced. Also, you gotta be an early bird because you start really early."
bad,"FedEx Ground is fast paced sometimes a little to fast, at times you haven't learned one accept of the job and the manegement wants you to learn something else."
bad,"This job is strenuous on your body and taxing to the soul. You do not work many hours but you don't want to after the day is over. There's no breaks between shifts, the shift change itself is the break. If you have any back problems, knee problems, carpal tunnel or do not take the weather well, do not bother with this job."
bad,A good company to work for unless you are not coming back of Medical Leave. You always has a new manager to report too. the hardest part of the job was to deal with the drivers
bad,"Daily work routine was you or one guy in a hot or cold Trailer. Depending on the weather. Loading never ending boxes until a loud alarm rings. Management is just there to see if your loading the trailer correctly. The job itself is a difficult job loading and unloading trailers."
bad,"This job worked me to my limits, just because i was young they threw all the work on me, and i had little to no help. I would not recommend this job to anyone unless you really need the money."
bad,"the hardest part of the job was stacking the boxes and wrapping them to go out, also if u don't like standing on your feet for long periods of times the job will be long "
bad,the company i worked for was very umprofessional and had no real knowledge of workers and what needed to be done. everyone needed  direction
bad,Co-workers are easy to get along with and makes work go by a little faster. Sometimes things are not communicated thoroughly but I catch on pretty quick. The most enjoyable part of the job is being around my workers and making the best out of it.
bad,"w skali od 1 do 10 to 3. Pewne zachowania ludzi w tej firmie są niedopuszczalne m.in.publiczna krytyka pracownika wśród innych. Zarobki są ""dobre"" dla osoby studiującej. Niestety za 1700 zł człowiek nie jest w stanie być samodzielny życiowo."
bad,enough hours and a lot of nonsense withing the company. It was not very pleasant lots of racial and shading situations at the work place and lack of communication with the employees.
bad,Management is only worried about management and their bottom line. The job advancement is predicated on who you know not what you know. Daily job duties a repetitious. Co-works are nice some are not as with any work place. Hardest part of the job excepting the pay they will low ball you and give you bear minimum even if you have degree.
bad,"The hardest part about the job was being on my feet, i enjoyed working. We had to take food orders during the game and bring food back out when it was ready."
bad,working at fedex was okay. the shifts were very short but very busy. holiday season was very taxing and exhausting but fun.
bad,working in ruff conditions no team at all everyone is for themselves they disappove of anything no kind of pat on your back
bad,"Start work 4 in the morning unloading freight trucks. Once all trucks are unloaded, you are then relocated to the sorting area and sort each package to its destination. Once that is done you clock out."
bad,"Good place to work, OK benefits. People were very nice to work with, didn't have any problems. I didn't see much room for advancement and needed something that would bring in more money so I went back into the telecommunications industry."
bad,"The work environment can be very hectic. Overall, I learned how to properly wrap and send off packages. The management team should've been better organized but my co workers were normally very helpful. The hardest part of the job was the working conditions. The most enjoyable part was being able to have a short shift considering how hard the job was."
bad,I worked from 5:30-9:30 with a very fast paced work environment in which was very strenuous on the body. Employees are really nothing but a number and their turn over rate was very high.
bad,"management its not excellent,there number one weakness is management, coworkers need more training, hardest part of the job Is dealing with supervisors.."
bad,"As soon as you clock in you are put into a truck that you are loading with boxes and you keep loading until the truck is full, then put into another truck. You are pretty much doing that until you clock out. I learned that I can do a lot more in life then load a truck with boxes all day. The management only came around when there was a problem or if  you wanted to pick up another shift. My co workers were different every other week, most people did not stay as a package handler very long. The hardest part of the job was getting the trucks loaded and stacked properly while you have hundreds of boxes coming down the shoot at once. Honestly the most enjoyable part of the job is when I was able to go home."
bad,"As a third shift position, the day starts approximately at around 4AM (or around 2AM during the peak season) and ends around 7AM or later depending on when trucks arrive (or around 8AM or later during the peak season). You never get used to the schedule because it is early and doesn't always start at the same time. It is five days a week, but during peak season it is six days a week. In the summer it is very hot, and in the winter it is okay as long as the heaters are on."
bad,this company has below average earnings and equipment because they give all the work contractors who can't see past a dollar.
bad,I already gave a review on fedex. I was a good experience. no including the weather conditions I had to work in.
bad,"As a Home Delivery driver, we are contract employees, not direct FedEx employees therefore, we are not offered benefits in any way. No medical, dental, life insurance, 401k, etc.. You will and do get hurt on the job, mostly bumps and bruises but an occasional twisted knee/ankle/back, pulled muscles, dog bites and various other small injuries. You are not paid for holidays but most contractors do offer paid vacations. A typical day starts between 4:30am and 6am, scanning all packages for your route, loading the truck and preparing the route paperwork. This usually requires about 2-3 hours each morning in the terminal without pay. If a trailer is late, that time can extend to 4-5 hours. Then, depending on the location of the route, upwards of a 1 hour drive to the route. Time on the route varies due to mileage but a typical delivery day ranges from 6 to 9 hours of driving. Management is decent but not all of them have driver experience so they don't always have a decent idea of what goes on outside the building. Most of the warehouse employees are hard-working people, easy to get along with but the upper level, non-management personnel seem to have a misunderstanding of their authority levels. Co-workers are good people and help make the mornings bearable. Some of them do not seem to have the same enthusiasm to complete the job as others. Some of the hardest parts of the job are not having a set start/finish time, dealing with traffic, inclement weather, etc.. What I do find most enjoyable is the aspect of working at your own pace and working on your own."
bad,"fun nice coworkers, not enough hours, good pay, gets rewarded for your hardwork"
bad,"It was ok,nothing serious more hours needed. would be nice for time."
bad,"Very Busy non-stop a lot of trucks to load, Co-workers are not so friendly. more of a get in do your assignment and get out type job"
bad,Too many hours. Load up your deliveries and deliver them. The hardest part of the job is trying to located address.
bad,"Day begins early morning at the terminal (location where the packages are delivered too) where I begin to scan my packages and begin to load my truck. I load my truck based on a certain sequence number and all in order. Once all my packages are on my truck, I have a manager close my scanner and I leave the terminal and I begin my route. "
bad,"My day at work is handling over 3,000 packages a night fast paced loading and unloading trucks. Keeping track of them with my scanner big and small heavy and lite,I learned that this was not the job for me they will not let me get over 4 hours a day. The good is i learned strategy to get things done right and fast. Management is not so good here but they are working on it they don't know how to talk to people they talk to us like we are dogs, and the hardest part of this job is not getting the hours i need to make it in life.The good about this job is getting to learn and meet new people."
bad,the work was hard but the hourly pay was pretty good at $12.00 dollars an hour. the only thing i wish they would work on is giving the workers more hours
bad,"P/T Employment , typical work day, separating and scanning each package into Hub. Work well and interact with Managers  and co-workers. The hardest part of day is processing a large quanity of items in a short amount of time and the enjoyable part completing the job.,"
bad,"	Responsible for courteous"
bad,I really do not have much to say about this company. Good people to work with whole I was there.
bad,"I liked this job for the simple fact that I did not have to sit still (ADHD), and that it was fast-paced so I had to get done by my deadline time.  Everything was going great, until I got terminated and no one even told me why.  I tried to call to find out, but they never answered or returned my calls.  I even tried to go in to talk to someone, but they would not let me. They said only employers were allowed in there.  So, to this day, I still have no idea why I was even terminated and I find that disrespectful and rude."
bad,"More on physical type or kind of job to work in. Management are more focus on safety of the employees and the parcels working in the warehouse sort area. And there is no such hardest part of the job for me as I enjoy working specially waking up very early (2am) in the morning, Monday to Friday, start working on earlier time are a very good practice and challenge in my part as I am an early bird type of person."
bad,FedEx is a great company with a great working motto ran by sexist and immature people. HR is not dependable/reliable because they are the friends of the managers who get reported.... so your hard earned money may be useful when its time for a lawyer.
bad,"A typical day at work is you have to clock in"
bad,"As a college student, this job has to have been the most hellish experience I have ever had. I do like physical labour, but the hours are soul crushing. An average day's work entails arriving at 3:00AM SHARP and sorting packages half-awake for the next 4.5-5 hours until the sort is complete."
bad,They are pretty good with working around your schedule and they are friendly people and a good enviornment.
bad,Very busy always something to do. Customers are ever present and needing help.
bad,"Good company to work for"
bad,"management was not motivating and encouraging."
bad,A typical day here was okay people where not as friendly and HR where not great that's why i left this job.
bad,"go to my work area and just get down to work."
bad,you exercise out of working here.  depending the route you can be out there for 10-11 hours a day
bad,Do not accept a job with the Eastern Region of security. Poor management. treat workers poorly.
bad,A lot of hardwork with little pay. my first paycheck was $20!!!
bad,Very fast paced the pay was average at the time worked with some really great people.
bad,Not a job for any one who is use to a corporate environment. I don't have much to say.
bad,very fast paced work. hard on your back. great place to work if you want to lose a bunch of weight
bad,"There is no exact clock in time due to the various times the trailers get from surrounding terminals with boxes. The pre load has been poor over the years to due lack of training for loaders as well as poor system structure. Small improvements have altered some of the loading processes but nothing has changed. The upper management hassles the ISP (Independent Service Providers) with paper work for miss scans on packages and other issues that are minuscule in the grand scheme of things at FedEx. The pick up windows are hard to get to in the afternoon due to the late dispatch time from the terminal due to poor unload processes. The most enjoyable time of the day is when returning to the terminal and hanging out with the check out guys because drivers are able to vent and discuss issues that had occurred during the day. Its completely independent on the road and patients is the key due to the monotony from the customers with the same jargon daily. I've completely learned how to become interpersonal with anyone as well has create incredible patients,"
bad,"Consistent lifting,unloading,and loading. I enjoyed the type of people I worked with.It was a pretty hectic job to deal with. I learned how to really get better with working on my own and being productive."
bad,very very busy company to work for they just want to drain you till you die
bad,jobs ok but the labor is hard and the hours suck big time. Its a good starter job for people that don't want to work a full time shift.
bad,it was a fast pace hard work type of job with a lot of lifting. I really didn't enjoy the hours I had because it was an early morning shift at 3 a.m.
bad,"long days ,hard work, an ok astomshdere, ok co-workers. heavy heavy lifting"
bad,Time consuming environment. A place where you can stay in shape while working..
bad,A typical day at Fedex Ground working the evening shift (Outbound) is tough work.  I load trailers with boxes of all sizes and weights.  It is Monday through Friday and usually a 4 to 5 hour shift which feels much longer.  I knew all this going in so I am not complaining but just stating facts.  They are scrict about payroll and simply want the job done.  Benefits don't come until after 1000 hours which would be around a year.  The best part about the job is the people that you get to know.
bad,You will be worked hard and you can't keep coming back and leaving. I do not see any advancement for minorities moving up or advancing into corporate in Memphis. I have faxed HR my resume and no response for having my bachelors. You can easily be hurt out there in the hub. You will get many hours during the holidays and then after and throughout year you will have few hours to get by. This is good for a person with a main job and this as a second.
bad,Forklift operator loading and unload freight trucks to be shipped cross country
bad,From start to finish your on the move squatting and lifting indeed its very tiresome but its a great work out 
bad,This job is very demanding and hard work. The job conducts you to do large volumes of loading and unloading...
bad,It was a good first job but not nothing for a career and that stage.
bad,working at fed-ex it's very fast pace. you work basically reflect off other people work because you're working on an assembly line. there may be times where co-workers converse with each other to make the day go by faster but for the most part we're focusing on our work. The most hardest part of the job is when the assembly line stops and everything is piled up. When it finally starts back up everything is stacked up really high and everything becomes more intense.
bad,When there was ever an problem I would half to tell the police
bad,I have worked for the company for more than 15 years. each year has been more rewarding than the previous year.
bad,"A typical day at FedEx would start off with a team meeting including managers, employees, and every so often people from the Human Resources Department. I was on what was called vanlines so my team and I (three people) would be assigned two vanlines and we strived to complete the work by 9pm. We had to unload trucks, scan packages, write door numbers on packages all as a team. I had to swak packages. This means if a package was not on file, I had to maunally key in into the system. My managers were really laid back and let me do my job. If I had a problem, they would assist me. The hardest part of my job was the manual labor. It begins to wear and tear on the body. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting the job done. My co-workers were hard working and it was a very diverse environment that I enjoyed being apart of."
bad,"FedEx has employees that are great to work with and for, but the occupation in general does not provide much room for advancement."
bad,management
bad,a typical day at work: Fast Pace
bad,A tipical day at work is handling corporate accounts objective to retain or gain the business assisting and advising customers on best practices for int'l shipping
bad,"Great seasonal part time job. Not really many benifits, but good for extra money around the holidays."
bad,"Shift is from 4 am-7:30 am, and the job requires a great amount of physical work. I'm a vision scanner, which is where I scan the barcode on each package that comes down the conveyor belt. Some package however do not come with the barcode label straight up so you must lift the package to find it. The packages that come down the belt can be up to 160 lbs.The hours of the shift I would say are the hardest part."
bad,this was just a part time job so the pay wasn't all that great but overall it was a nice place to work
bad,It was a layed back environment. Could have been better. The pay is higher than the normal teller in Mempphis. The most enjoyable part is jeans on Friday.
bad,"If you are willing, physically fit, and when I say fit you really gotta be fit, would to earn a few extra dollars, than this is a good place to work. Work is part-time five days a week, average 20-25 hrs/week. Shifts starts from 4pm-8:30pm on most days and I think there is a morning shift as well but I'm not sure. Really physically demanding if you work as an unloader which is probably your best bet if your a new person there. They will show you proper techniques to life heavy boxes, sometimes these packages weighed over 100 lbs and you better have the strength to pick it up and throw it on the conveyer. Yah you should ask a buddy to help but most of us guys didn't. If you weigh 200lbs you probably weigh 100 after a year work there if you don't eat right. Very physical, very tiring, not for the faint of heart."
bad,"As a retail sales associate, the title itself is a bit misleading, because you are required to have a fundamental understanding of everything that goes on inside the store. You need to know how the copy machines work and figure out how to troubleshoot them. Answer the phones and answer varied amount of questions, take orders and process them. Know how to use the shipping computers for FedEx. And these are only just an example and that amount of skills you need to possess while at the job."
bad,this is a very physical job with a lot of repetition there is no need for a gym membership while working for this company
bad,It's a decent part time job. Just be prepared to work hard. Promotions are extremely rare to come by.
bad,The hardest part of the job is lifting or relocating 70-100lb packages.
bad,The company is a good company to work for unfortunately personal views on race and appearance play a big part in determining your level of advancement.
bad,"Great money and benefits as long as you can survive the first 20 years! Seniority is EVERYTHING!! New hires get the leftovers and do more dock work than actual truck driving. SO until you've outlasted the senior drivers you get cut often and work hourly on the dock. My last week with FedEx was on labor day week, I got 8 hours holiday pay and 2.5  hours on the dock. That was after being there a year and a half!!"
bad,"The work wasnt too hard to do, but management was not good at communicating, showed favoritism, and wasn't all around fair in what they expected out of each employee."
bad,I was alway questioned about my job and alway Harassed about my profession.  No trusting. Giving not enough time to do my work and do a good job. Realize if you go to work for FedEx you will not be supported by your upper management and watch your back the whole time
bad,Ok I have been working as a loader/Sorter for about a month. Not much training and get to work atmosphere. During peak season you work around 8 hours without a break. No help unless you are backed up and packages or falling down or jamming up conveyor belt. Management is laidback and nice only good point.
bad,"Shift could change quite frequently"
bad,The job is very physically demanding and very fast paced.  The work is easy but you are pushed to be done yesterday on a task you started today.  For the hours worked versus pay it is not very rewarding.
bad,"Basically you are on your feet scanning packages in a ware house..its cold in the winter and hot in summer filling a truck to go out is a back breaker there are  many different station they can move you at any time "
bad,Wages have been slow to increase over the past 10 years. A courier used to top out in just a few years. Mid range employees are taking 20+ years to top out. Promises about pay increases are not being kept and management is inexperienced causing a chaotic work atmosphere
bad,It is a lot of different personalities working together and sometimes it can be frustrating but it is a job. There have been many people that have come and gone but if you just do the job and come into work everything else will be fine
bad,"I loved my manager and team while working at FedEx Logistics. However, the job and the pay was NOT equivalent to the impact my role was to the company.  I did not feel apart of the team or that the ""Purple Promise"" applied to me in my role."
bad,Not what you know...who you know atmosphere.  A lot of micromanage  managers. Some opcos hard promote administrative  staff. Benefites are great.  Pay is good.
bad,Difficult to balance life and work. Safety conditions are pretty bad and workers are pushed way too hard. Improvements need to be made in order to keep workers safe and improve the flow of work.
bad,i felt they preached about safety but when it came down to safety issues they were very sub par on takin care of the problem. safety was always stated as main concern but speed and profit was first priority and everyone saw it.
bad,"Overall it was not bad experience. But up management need training  and how to deal with worker."
bad,"No room for growth. Hard work. No air and no break. Someone actually died from over exhaustion. The pay rate is very low, for the amount of work needed to be done"
bad,"No work life balance once you go full time. They talk about not going over hours in meetings but it flys out the window when you hit the dock. Most days are 12-13 hour shifts WITHOUT break, or they'll tell you to work through you're break and they'll manually put a break in for you in the time clock."
bad,"No union, all they care about is pick up and deliveries,  even if you lose a leg and an arm in the process,  loss your arm, dont care ,deliver the package"
bad,"Right when the belts turn on, you have to be ready to move fast. Because certain packages need to be on certain trucks and while you're putting them on the trucks regardless if they're heavy or light. You got a whole bunch more coming down at once! You have to pay attention to tags too because sometimes when moving so fast, you don't really see the full number all the time, or you have to the move the boc all around till you see it."
bad,There is no 40hr guarantee so if you are on the extra board it is hit and miss on if you work.  If on the bottom portion of the extra board it's near impossible to know what days or how many days you will work.
bad,"If you want to drive a $70K pickup truck, live in a big house, own 3 Harley's and work like a slave to make all your payments...then this is the place to do it. Be careful what you wish for tho. It's amazing how my many many bosses can lie to me and keep a straight face...daily. I never trusted these people and banked all my big fat paychecks. Seniority means nothing here. Truck engine shuts off at 2 minutes (like at a traffic light lol). All automatic transmissions (they're awesome to back up with all day long!). Cameras, radar, lane departure alarms all recording ""events""...like fire hydrants and guardrails and overpasses. 14 deliveries a day all smashed up (lot's of ""satisfied"" customers!) and don't miss those early pickups...ding ding. What time do you get done? LMAO, don't make any plans...ever. I've had a class A CDL for 29 years and used to love driving truck until FedEx Freight. I sold my soul, my health and my happiness to them 11 years ago...but unlike my co workers, I didn't spend the money. Don't say I didn't warn you, it doesn't matter what it pays anymore for me."
bad,"The stores are entirely dependent on your manager as the company culture is instilled everywhere its just a matter of how much it is followed. The stores are very individual from one another so you can easily get totally different experiences from going to and from different stores."
bad,"Working at FedEx was not a good experience. The hours are not consistent, a typical day as a package handler is four hours.  The management is sub-par."
bad,"Horrible office - poor management - classless morons work here - don’t waste your time"
bad,"My building had good management. However the culture of the company was to treat employees like cattle. They didn't care how many hours you had to work as long as you got the job done. Average was 12 hours a day."
bad,"At first it’s cool cause they’ll give you the easy route or start you off easy. After that forget about it, always get home late and tired. No chance at any type of moving up in the company. Everything is always your fault even when it’s out of your control."
bad,"Between management and safety problems, working at FedEx Ground is horrible. So much drama and managers do nothing. Consistent demands for one employee to do the job of 3+. Pay might be decent but there are no hours outside of peak season"
bad,Managers were more worried about how often and how long I went to the rest room than helping employees or customers.  Fedex.com website is a joke.  Can't believe I stayed 10 years at the Uniontown Freight call center.  Worst job I ever had.  Yearly bonus averaged about $ 250 before taxes. Has pension but 401k is average. Health insurance is good
bad,"working around good people if your a people person. the work is very heavy, but if your young you can do it all day. if you can get to a manager position your ok"
bad,"Thus job required to always be on time, have good communication skills, team work as well as getting along with everyone. Physically demanding was a must and some cases could get very tired."
bad,work environment is extremly stressful and fast. employees are often overloaded with work and starting early isn't an option because the previous shifts lack of finishing in a timley manner.
bad,"calls come in back to back "
bad,"Management played favorites and only gave credit to people they liked, if they didn't like you they make sure you wanted to quit by giving you hardly any hours."
bad,"make you work until your route is complete.  could be 7 hours, could be 12 hours.  no overtime.  pay is basically a daily salary no matter what they tell you.  only advancement you can get is if you go from a home route to a business route."
bad,"work load isn't bad, just a lot of pushing boxes on broken or non-movable rollers in order to get boxes on the treadmill to be sorted. It's a busy job during the busy season and people usually get their full hours but when its dead you can be cut as early as 2 hours of work. management does very little to improve work ethic or workload, just expects you to be a machine that doesn't get tired. Every truck and the warehouse are very dirty, you can leave the place with the inside of your nose covered in black dust."
bad,"Don't get injured at FedEx because they won't care. They don't take care of the employees when working in the hub. On top of that, you may be full time but you barely get 30 hours a week. "
bad,"My work experience at FedEx was very easy-going as well as productive this was a job that was only temporary through a hiring agency,but overall an acceptable job"
bad,"Very long days, with pickups being usually in the evening,  if you have a late pickup then you are supposed to be there at that pickup during the pickup window.  The load of your truck depends on how long you will work for the day you are done when your truck is empty and the pickups complete.  No real time for family during the week."
bad,"management does not care about you, they only care about getting work done; also when you suggest ideas to make things easier and faster, management does not care"
bad,hot and sweaty.i learned that i can work harder than most men. managers are ok.the hardest part is staying positive. the most enjoyable thing is that i get a free work out.
bad,It was a great experience to learn how couriers work an work with those people at fedex made alot of friends an alot of people through working there ..
bad,they would cut people early just to avoid giving lunches and they were bad at telling how many were needed for the days work. the worst part was that another temp agency came in and their workers would take hours from the original workers that were promised full time
bad,"FedEx corporate and the other branches are fine to my knowledge.  This one was a horrendous place.  The work was easy, and that was fine, but the managers were too lazy or never around whenever assistance was needed.  "
bad,"It's a fast-paced career, very detail oriented which I happen to like and strive at.   It's slowly been declining due to leadership skills and allowing other hourly employees to ""be the boss""."
bad,A typical day would be fast and hard. I would unload about 4 to 5 trucks every time I would go in. I learned to work at your own pace and to stay with some water.
bad,"If you're front-line, salary leadership just say goodbye to your family.  If you like working 100+ hrs/week without breaks, while getting paid for 50, Not being allowed to take vacation, and constant negativity, then this is the job for you.  If you like your family, or anything other than working for what amounts to half of minimum wage, look elsewhere."
bad,"Some people can move up within this company but hard for others."
bad,"Poor management, favoritism, long hours, mandatory OT every week, policies change monthly, NO communication, denied time off."
bad,"Very long work hours. "
bad,"FedEx was the worst company I have ever worked at, and I would never go back under any circumstances. The management was unprofessional, inappropriate and ridiculous. No one at FedEx has any idea what they are doing, especially the managers and ones in charge. It is complete chaos every single day and you get punished for the managers' negligence."
bad,Fedex refuses to give you hours thus there is no way people can depend on this company to pay their life expenses and bills just working at FedEx. And working part time there was no set schedule you would drive there from 20 miles away to work for 2hrs? No thank you.
bad,I just wished the job would have lasted longer I liked what I did I could have seen myself working full time there . I think the pay could have been better.
bad,"I did a lot of work for little pay, It is a good job as a part time gig, or if you just get out of High school. You get the experience with all of the computer programs."
bad,"this job has med pay, Good benefits, but lack of good management and trying to get a promotion is by a very slow bid system that doesn't work. if your looking for small change in your pocket this is the place for you if not look elsewhere"
bad,"Poor management overshadows any positive feedback on Fedex Office. We have lost five employees in my short 7 months of employment at my buxy location.  Managing multiple UPS Stores in my previous job, I am capable of working in a fast paced environment. Fedex is definitely fast paced and always have you on your toes."
bad,FedEx was a great place to work for many years driving self pride into the work place. Recently FedEx lost what made it a great company to work for and became strictly about the stock holders and bottom line creating an environment from its employees that shifted from a prideful work group that gave everything to success to a group of people who perform out of fear causing a major shift in the caliber of employees and managers.
bad,"Unless you get assigned to the air conditioned SPSS building, you will work and sweat a lot. It's a great job considering you're getting paid to exercise."
bad,"A day at fedex ground for me is typically loading boxes at an expected rate of 340 packages per hour, keeping my work space clean and safe as well. what i have learned at fedex is to never give up and push my self so that the job i am doing is done correctly."
bad,"Worked for a contractor not directly for FedEx!!! Come in and load your own truck, wait to get paperwork for the day then start route. Learned that even a decent fun job can be ruined by atrocious management who talk to people like they are the scum of the earth which is strange since without that ""scum"" they would go under FAST. You get a daily pep talk about everything you supposedly did wrong the day before which I suppose is to motivate you to go out and make them money somehow. Hardest part would be motivating yourself to go in so you could freeze in the winter and burn in the summer for 14hrs then be told you did nothing right the next morning. You are paid the same if you work 3hrs or the 14hrs NO overtime whatsoever, not even at regular hourly pay. Best part was FINALLY going home if you could even remember where you lived at that point."
bad,"Not what it seems in the interview the sell you a dream, summertime hours get cut dramatically. You bare expected to do and learn alot with not enough pay."
bad,"Working at FedEx is fast paced and the company does pay towards the top of the LTL companies. There is always a phone to be answered, freight to put on a truck, a pickup to be made, or a bill to be entered. "
bad,"you show up at the terminal, load the truck yourself, then drive to the city where your route is to deliver everything yo can on the truck. non delivered packages are very frowned upon and fedex blames drivers for bad address and closed businesses"
bad,I work as a Courier Driver for 2 years and basically I make sure the customers get their package on time. I'm a team player and we always help each other.
bad,"FedEx ground is all contractor,  you will get paid ""per day"". You will not get overtime, you will not be paid for working late. You can expect your route to be changed to make your hours longer, and you do not get paid for the extra time you have to put in past the day rate. My experience was through one contractor who had a high turnover rate. See for yourself."
bad,"Health insurance was cheap and the schedule was stable."
bad,Will take your route right from under you without notice. They are very unorganized for being a larger company. I would recommended working here unless your willing to have your job taken from you without notice
bad,"A Typical day at work at FTN involves prioritizing emails upon unlocking the computer, answering pending inquiries, resolving billing issues or transportation issues. Once complete, time to start the daily reports. "
bad,"Fedex Office, is a good company to work for if your going to school and planning for bigger and better things. If you are ambitious and motivated to achieve greatness, do not stay here, do not get complacent, go to school get your degrees and move on to better things. Pay is around 11-12/hr, raises are tiny and take forever, you wont even notice them. Management sucks, most of them."
bad,Company is not diverse at all in terms of becoming an independent contractor. The company is not big on rewarding its harder working employees.
bad,No communication. You will end up waiting for hours before anyone tells you the schedule has changed without pay and come in on days that they decided to close without telling you. Evening shifts don't usually last more than an hour or two far from the 30 to 40 hours they claimed.
bad,Management are linked together..father hires son then they promote there own family within type of environment.   There is no union so they will terminate you for no reason.
bad,"I was an overnight security officer at the Irvine warehouse and the place was so big and scary like a horror movie but it was ok "
bad,If you want to make money its a great job. If you want a life outside of work its not possible. Horrible work atmosphere. The actual job is easy but the behind the scenes stuff in the station is brutal.
bad,A company that talks about team work and cohesion but in reality is only concerned with their bottom line. Mid level managers are micro managed with a set up to fail syndrome.
bad,The management team was inconsistent.  Co-workers seemed unhappy.  Ok for a part-time temporary job.  Atmosphere brings you down.
bad,"ok place to work....could be way better, to many lazy people not enough hard workers, management is terrible only a few are good and respectful"
bad,"Anxiety and stress everywhere, everyday. No couriers seem happy. Station management is unprofessional and demeaning. Your performance is never good enough. No concern from mgt about work/life balance. Corp and mgt handled my disability incorrectly/not at all. You get wrote up in some way for every single little mistake or oversight. Every time you turn around... ""sign this""... ""acknowledge this OLCC"". Mgt acts like they never make mistakes and when they do, somehow it's the couriers fault. Paychecks arent all that great considering the BS you have to deal with. "
bad,This is a decent part-time job. You work hard for every penny they give you. Management isn't ideal. Provide decent benefit.
bad,"Great for people getting through school working part time. Management is terrible, and would not recommend Edwardsville Ks, Freight to anyone work wise. Supervisors have no life outside of work."
bad,Fedex you are not guarantee 4 hours a day. the only time you see some good money is during Nov & Dec. After that your money get cut and your hours but if you need a job they will hire you fast.
bad,Good team work environment. No work life balance once in management. Great benefits with a lot of potential to own company stock.
bad,"While the actual pay for being a package handler was decent, and the medical benefits were great, it did not make up for the hostile, disrespectful way management treated workers. Favoritism was a constant issues, being talked down too, and lack of empathy from management made most workers, including myself, have no respect for the management team. While I did have decent manages from time to time. There were far more bad ones that good. These managers would expect workers to break rules, position themselves into dangerous situations, and put down incorrect information in order to make the management team look good. Everything from the how the schedule was created to how the managers expected couriers to run their route was fixed to make the station look better than it actually was. If the station I worked at ever had an actual audit where everything was inspected with a fine tooth comb, it would have been obvious that the ""books were cooked."""
bad,"Low pay, Low payroll budget.  Good benefits.  It is a corporate job so being overworked and underpaid is the standard."
bad,"The pay is way too low for how physically demanding the job is. Management took it easy on their friends and pushed others as hard as they could. If you try to apply everything to teach you in training they get on to you about speed. Speed is the ONLY thing that matters. You can throw boxes, stand on boxes, do whatever as long as you do it quickly. They say you get benefits and vacation but you have to put in 1,100 hours of work before you can (which takes over a year working less than 3 hours a day)"
bad,"The work life balance in this job is non existent. They don't care if you have a family during the holidays or any special circumstances.  Six weeks prior to a new holiday there is always a meeting where you are informed every year that your hours will be increased and you will work a mandatory 6 days with absolutely no days off.  There is no respect for the employees.   That being said, I think it does depend on the hub that you work in.  I currently work in an area with the highest turn over rate of any other hub.  I'm sure if I worked in a smaller area the job would be a lot more enjoyable."
bad,Don't ask your manager or corporate to do anything out of their ordinary because they can't handle anything. Thankless place to work with quite a few bad apples. Glad to be gone.
bad,the management at this job was terrible. they did not have a care in this world for their employees. They treated you as if these were slavery days. I would not recommend this job to anyone.
bad,"the most important thing i liked about this company was the pay,benefits,over time,but management wasnt fair they treated and spoke to you rudely"
bad,High-Speed work environment. Self Paced. We worked by ourselves for the majority of the night. Rare supervision on the dock area.
bad,Long physical on the move day for the start to the end. No support. Only do it if you have to. The most enjoyable part is meeting and greeting your customers everyday.
bad,"They are only concerned about the numbers not the people getting the packages to the customers. "
bad,"You work on game days, clean bathrooms and stands. my co-workers were nice we all get together and work as a team.The management was bad and was always getting the pay messed up many people started to quit. Also you would work more hours the you get payed for, But the most enjoyable part of the job is you get to watch the football games while working."
bad,"the job is ok very little room for advancement, if you would like to go further in your carrier this is not the job for u."
bad,the most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues who are fantasic and learning about new things and emerging sustainable technologies.i learned time management skills i've learned my stranghts and my weakness as well as stamina
bad,"How many people realize your FedEx Ground driver is not an actual FedEx employee? Most customers I come across on a daily basis don't know this. "
bad,I learned alot how to work with a large group of people and as well as being alone in the area. I have learned that this job is a busness and people come and go. I have some of the most loyal co-workers you can find and management can use improvements. The hardest part of the job is getting help when needed.
bad,Good coworkers to work with; good location and easy to get to; no room for growth
bad,"a typical day at work was always good I learned to scan boxes,stack them,load the belly,stop a jam,an when your done lock the truck down..My co-workers where good people I was young an they where a lot older but mad me feel welcome the hardest part of my job was when I first started but after the first week it was good I like ware house work they look up to you and that's a good feeling I enjoy going to help other when they need me"
bad,"A typical day at FedEx starts out with extreme heat and lack of airflow. After that you go in your trailer and load or unload, depending on where you work. at that point, you are alone most of the day. Just stacking boxes to make perfect walls, at a quick pace. I've learned at FedEx that you have to move quickly and to not let your emotions get the best of you, just keep pushing through the day. Some managers, are really into their work. Some really care. Others, just want you to make them look better. Most co-workers, look for different jobs. Others try and move up, in order to make more money. Or they stay there just because its familiar to them."
bad,I was to load 18 wheeler trucks packed with merchandise. It was an individualistic environment. The hardest part was taking care of your body enough to endure the strenuous work everyday. I did not find this job enjoyable. I learned hard work and determination from this job.
bad,Hard work not recomanded for teenangers dusty hot no air conditioning bad hours back breaker
bad,"FedEx eliminates their responsibilties by selling routes to independents. But requirements set by FedEx really don't allow much independence at all. "
bad,I work for a contractor for FedEx Ground and its a good physical job with a lot of freedom. Some days you work very hard and other days you may not. It is up and down depending on the volume of packages you get for any given day.  You don't have any direct contact with FedEx management since you don't work for FedEx although you follow there rules and regulations.
bad,A typical day consisted of moving boxes. The hardest part about the job was picking up very heavy boxes
bad,"The hardest part of working here is the management. They do not care for you as one would think they should. They always point out what you've done wrong instead of trying to help you understand. They skip out on raises if you're not dealing with customers, especially if you're a handler. The co-workers are the most enjoyable part of working here. The benefits provided are great as well, with medical and 401K being the most beneficial."
bad,i'm thanks full for the opportunity when i just get to this country and be my own boss learn about this city and people of different cultures but the company is suppoused  to cover the back to the contractors by the beginning especially before sing the contract
bad,Quick fast-paced work.  Scanning and puzzling in where to place packages into a truck.
bad,"pick what shift you want"
bad,"empresa boa de trabalhar, aprendi muitas coisas a que mais gostei foi conferir cargas. A direção e a gerencia pra mim são todos ignorantes e desulmildes que impõem uma gestão difícil de entender, nada pra mim era difícil,apenas um desafio a mais, a parte mais agradável era terminar o serviço e ver que não teve nenhum erro."
bad,"I enjoyed working with a great group of motivated men. We ensure the customers packages were received without damage. Our work environment was outside on a loading dock. In the winter many times we were short staffed due to storms however, most of us made it anyway. I can not say that we were treated fairly and with respect by management and there was no appreciation. This did not deter me from completing and exceeding my tasks load. The hardest part of the job is working outside in frigid temperatures and keeping up with the demanding pace."
bad,FedEx is a the perfect warehouse job for someone who doesn't have any experience.
bad,"I have had the opportunity to become a professional driver for FedEx. Each day my responsibilities include understanding my route, having good customer relations, and performing any clerical duties required for shipments to pass FAA regulations."
bad,after 3 years never missing work i walk in on a monday and was told give me your keys and badge we dont need you your laid offf.6months later the person who did this is fired for legal reasons.
bad,"Typicial day includes loading 2-3 doors at once, usually one and a half trailers per shift."
bad,Required to work overtime with no additional pay. Management is hard to please. Training is poor.
bad,As an exempt employee we had very long work days/weeks. There was always something to do or something that would come up late in the day that needed attention immediately. Compensation was excellent although not as rewarding due to no work/life balance and lack of appreciation from management. Enjoyed some of my co-workers and many of my business partners. Felt good about performance when the station was successful. Lets just say it was a challenge everyday!
bad,If you have plenty of time to wait for a full time opportunity its a great place to work. if you don't mind not having 2 consecutive days off in a row with management changing your schedule whenever they feel the need its the place for you.  
bad,"I worked as a package handler for a short time, but I was able to quickly move up from learning to loading three trucks. It was a lot of hard physical labor because you will be running up and down a conveyor belt picking up packages that can weigh anywhere between 2 lbs to more than 100 lbs, and trust me when I say the size of the heavier ones will fool you. After you get the packages you have to look at the address and put them in numerical order by street names.  Now I know that doesn't sound too hard but toss in the fact that you are doing this for more than one truck, between the hours of 1 am and 6 am, and each driver will want their truck ordered in a different way (example is even numbers on one side and odd on the other, all numbers together and certain streets here or there, by alphabetical order, or any combination that you can think of) and you can see that  the job starts getting a little more challenging. This job demands a lot out of you and while it is not as hard as being a Navy Seal or a Doctor, it will present challenges of its own. Some of the people there have changed since I last worked there but they will present a problem in their own way. "
bad,A typical day at FedEx is short and you have no breaks. The hours consisted of 3am-7am every morning  Tuesday thru Saturday. Being at FedEx i learned how to work in a fast paced environment and how how to operate machines. The hardest part of the job was lifting the heavy boxes by yourself from time to time. What i enjoyed most was the fact that we got paid every week. The managers there was very nice and very helpful.
bad,"this job require alot of hustle...you had to deal with irate customers, poor managers, and traffic everyday. their policies are impossible to follow and management only cared about their big bonuses at the cost of thier workers health."
bad,"Formerly watkins trucking (in my area) and was bought out by FedEx and used as the long lane/economy line for FedEx Freight. Basically you always get hand me down equipment and even management from FedEx freight. Worked 10-15hour days six days a week most the time as a part time employee... When National merged with Freight they cut everyone down to under 30 hours a week, no benefits. So it was aways work to exhaustion or starve."
bad,diversity is broad self passed meet your quota and it is a great job if you can be a very productive worker
bad,"start off with a sort meeting then immidiatly to work very fast paced job on average unloaded 4-5 trucks within the 3 hour period.Co-workers seemed friendly, hardest part of the job was constantly moving and bending over to pick up and move packages.The most enjoyable part of the job was probably the fact that you get a free workout while working."
bad,This place was the best job I ever had when it was FedEx Kinkos. Then Kinkos retired and FedEx took over and it became the worst job I ever had.
bad,For hours put in versus compensation which is per load pay is very low
bad,- Evening hours
bad,Depending what you want to work at and put up with.Watch out for managment and your friends.Big turn over's
bad,FedEx Office has a huge network of stores and shipping hubs. In my time there I learned a lot about the printing and shipping industries. They provided a great place to work and learn while I was attending college.
bad,"Worn-out trucks with bad engines, transmissions and brakes. Working in all weather conditions: on slick and muddy roads, in freezing rain and fog."
bad,"Fedex is deathly afraid of the union. Due to that fear, the Alert line and ER (employee relations) are the lifelines for hourly. Anonymous when you call so you as a manager are guilty no matter what. Fleet maintenance Managers on the ground level make everyone higher that them look good but they do nothing for you. CL District manager especially. "
bad,I was looking for full time work they were only looking for part time the work is hard and it does not match the pay its a good company if a few changes were made.
bad,Work processes and procedures need to be updated. To many key strokes are unnecessary. Too many meetings and huddles. Tasks need to be better defined.
bad,"Parlo per l'esperienza maturata in 5 anni di lavoro come ex dipendente diretto e non tramite cooperative...."
bad,"FedEx  ground is a good company to work for if you just look at the benefits, but everything else is pretty bad. The Warehouse is hot with no A/C while the truck is hotter that your working in. The workload is extensive on the loading side. The hours are short because you would hurt yourself if you work any longer than they require."
bad,"I really didn't enjoy my time at FedEx, it was one of those situations where I did it for the money. But as a loyal companion to the company I showed up to work everyday on time and was ready for whatever challenges that needed to be achieved"
bad,"There's alot that I don't like about this job to be honest. Some of the management, I question the job literally works you harder than said, and you don't know what you are in for untill they put you in said place."
bad,"Its a job that not everyone can do, it was very demanding on the body, and being in a warehouse like that made you face the elements of the weather. And most of the time used for vacation was to heal your body"
bad,"Work hours are inconsistent. One day you can finish early and the other you can finish late. The trucks are old and need a lot of maintenance. No heating, old tires, no backup camera, etc."
bad,"No comment. But I'm going to take the high road, how ever fed ex gave me an opportunity for employment. I really had a lovely experience at first. But when they wanted to relocate to Maryland, that's w"
bad,"It was great from the beginning until they cut everyone's hours horribly. I have bills and kids to support. Other than that the work is ok, but very demanding."
bad,"lost of time with family and stressful workload and days."
bad,"Management plans nothing from day to day. The driver is always at fault, never the contractor or FedEx. The contractors seem to only fix vehicle safety problems when there is a state inspection or vehicle inspection."
bad,Worked the life out of you for small weekly pay. But the benefits were excellent. Able to work ahead shift which mean over times pay. Able to come in on off days. Paid for time off. Over 20 hrs of sick days. Never going back
bad,"Working for Fed ex ground is not a career.You work for an independent contract long days salaried based no health insurance average 50 to 60 hours per week carting heavy boxes that say 2 man lift over 100 pounds and they expect you to bring it upstairs to customers.So do the math if youare making 40000.00 per year you are really working for 14 to 16 dollars per hour no benefits and back breaking work for drivers which could lead to fatigue,health issues,physical body damage to yourself.It's a make money by the stop company rather than an employee safe driving job"
bad,I am looking for better opportunities. It seems impossible to move up within the company but I still apply just to see what happens.Management is horrible
bad,Good pay and benefits for the area. The company philosophy is great if you get a department head / supervisor that actually walks what the company preaches. Many people could not wait to get out of the department due to poor treatment by management.
bad,N/AA. Nothing to express at the moment. There were many instances  where the focus was on me as an individual outside of work more so inside the company as a team player. My numbers were high and my work ethics were phenomenal and that should have mattered most.
bad,"I arrive early to work to insure I ,the information needed to make the day go smoothly.  I process the information and provide a plan to cover the days work load.  Continue to make adjustments as the day goes on as circumstances change."
bad,"Management favoritism is a thing here, advancing is very hard, they promise you all these advancements and put your hopes high so you do not realize you will be in the same position for years to come before having the chance to move up the ladder. If you are cool with the managers you will do fine, but if the managers don't like you, you're screwed"
bad,"a typical day is normal just steady moving"
bad,I wouldn't really reccomend working at this company. They give you appropriate pay but I don't think it's covering how much you actually work. There are a few benefits.
bad,"They give you gatorade but over all it is a the do give gift for good attendance, good work preformance, for loading the trailers correctly it's an art to loading those trailer correct."
bad,"there's no recognition for the good workers, more and more is expected.  the good workers are taken for granted and poor workers continue and take up space that could be for others to promote and grow."
bad,"It was a right we they had work for if not you was sent home you may make your hours "
bad,FedEx has taught me time and meeting deadlines are very important. Also lead me to be more of a independent worker. FedEx has also allowed me to meet some amazing people over the years.
bad,The job would have been good if not for poor management. Also its not a job you would want if you wanted to advance in life. Fast paced and pretty stressful at times.
bad,"The managers are great but you work through a contractor for any route job, no air conditioner in trucks and it gets hot. have to be able to lift up to 150lbs."
bad,It's like working for the government. No accountability for anyone. Impossible to fire people. It will take a major complaint to show up on television for anyone to take action
bad,"Typical day at work was pretty tough for the most part and fast pace.  I've learned that the most important part of the company is the customer, really important to get the cargos on a plane under a certain time ad move with a sense of urgency.  Management is very sufficient and always on point. Hardest part of the job is unloading/loading aircrafts in bad weather.  When rain, sleet, or snow occurs, it really slows the process all the way down as far as getting freight on and off the plane.  The most enjoyable part of the job having a successful night  every night at work."
bad,"The definition of living to work was entitled with this job. Punch in for 545 am, worked until 10-1030 on non peak time (November to New years day) then from 1-930 at night. Clocking in over 14 hours a day. During Peak time, 16 hour shifts straight mon-fri. Then mandatory weekend shifts. Great pay, but no time to spend it from working so much. Then management was shady. Working behind the scenes to fire people, then deny them their unemployment when it was the companies fault. Wouldn't go back for a job at all."
bad,Package handling is just work all day. It's pretty straight forward. Should be a temp job. Warehouse conditions. 3-4 hour periods of knocking loading and unloading trucks.
bad,"Enjoyed working at fast pace, and with others. Work environments were difficult at times, and lack of team work was a concern. Very small pay increases"
bad,Not enough hours and the manager are nasty talk to u any type of way they work u like a slave they need more hours and good supervisor and pay more they need set hours and days
bad,They promise you a lot of hours and stability just to get you working there for peak season then claim to not have enough work for you therefore laying you off
bad,"Long days, long nights, all the work is contracted thru independent contractors so the time that you work is up to you and how you conduct the business with that person that is in charge of you"
bad,"face paced environment, of sorting and  heavy lifting of boxed packages that are stored in loading trucks for truck drivers deliveries"
bad,"I worked with fedEx for a good amount of years and I regretted every last one. Poor management, always wanting you to do 3 man job, and brown nosing galore!"
bad,"Only thing really good about this job is the pay and hours. But management is awful and supervision min just as bad. Job advancements are job seniority so its not by who is the best fit but by how has more years in the company. And the supervisors are very rude, inexperienced and lazy. They expect everything to perfection but don't give you time or supplies to do so. So if you are looking just to make some spare money then I maybe would consider this job if it is in desperate situations but I would rather take pay cut just to work some where more friendly and have a better management group"
bad,People I worked with were great. Had accident due to vehicle malfunction they did not really investigate. They don't care they just fire you for 3 years. Care nothing about the welfare of their employees.
bad,FedEx UK is a small domestic network that is primarily a conduit for FedEx's more premium international freight. The team are okay and have to work together to get the job done. The technology there is still quite backward and the lack thereof means that drivers/ managers have to work harder to make up for this.
bad,Working at FedEx was an experience. The job in its self was not difficult it gave me challenges to better myself. I have learned patience and focus. The management was absolutely horrible.
bad,Worked there with my sister in a really stressful and exhausting work environment. It wasn't really for me so I quit but my sister enjoyed her job there. But after she got sick they fired her which we all thought was really messed up. Don't recommend if you like job security.
bad,The job was pretty good it was a summer job for me but the managers there minus one and luckily i worked under him where unwilling to listen to employee comments or safety concerns. Only good thing was that the hours were in the evening so you could do something with friends or family throughout the day then head into work later in the day
bad,"Fed Ex Ground is a good company overall. They have good ethics most of the time and are balanced in what kind of work they give. my experience with fed ex lately has not been the best. The ground i work at is severely understaffed, so the typical amount of work takes 10x longer and your doing 3x the amount of work you should be doing. ive hurt myself multiple times because of the amount of work done and the amount of time it is expected of me to be done. ive had multiple instances where my back is just killing me after a sort and it  aches for the next week. Managers are usually caring and understanding with issues brought up at the workplace. CO-workers are friendly and easy to get along with."
bad,"We come in , go to our assigned door and load the freight coming down the conveyer belts . stack evenly and stable. but the most enjoyable part of the job is the people you meet along the way ."
bad,There are challenging and rewarding aspects of the job and then there are the times when it's easy to feel unappreciated. Commitment to the work is the expectation.
bad,worked for 18 years got hurt on job. Job had good work life balance for me. Can be taxing on the body. Good to be outside working. Management can be a challenge.
bad,Company has gone from a $15 Billion company to now a $60 Billion company in only 17 years.  This has put a stranglehold on all departments especially customer service.  As sales reps we are being inundated with emails and telephone calls daily to help our customers with administrative work that should be handled by the CS team.  The left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing.
bad,"it was a good job, but it was poor management and no job security. was told they was going to call me back for a perminent position and they never did, i was one of the best workers there and didnt get the full time job."
bad,I been working there for past few months now and managers there dont care about you or if you get hurt they will ignore you as if nothing has happened
bad,"FedEx Services were once productive and enriching until SOX 404."
bad,It was fun when I first started but now I don't see it the same. It is very hard to move up they promote as if moving up in the company is very easy and just work hard and you will get there??? I have been working there for a year and 2 months I have applied for just a simple office administrative position for almost 6 months not once have I had an interview or a call back and yet I have the experience that fits the requirements its like they want to keep me in that warehouse forever. they play favorites on who they want to move up or for employee of the month but yet what job doesn't do that? All I know is that they need to change their ways.
bad,"The job consist of short hours."
bad,"Worked for this company for several months and never really had a problem. I worked my butt off at this place, came in every morning around 6am or 7am and worked up until around 9:30 to 10 on the unloading shift. Worked this awhile until management decided to force all handlers to come work the night shift and day shift (split-shift work). The split-shift raised some red flags; but, worked through the days I did work both day and night.. It's only when management started changing your start times and days on the schedule(sometimes the schedule would say to work both day and night some days and only work the day shift without the night shift) without giving  you any notice. This happened twice to me and they never admitted the unauthorized changes, I reported this to the manager and nothing was done about it. Would have stayed and possibly worked for this company a long time...possibly a career elsewhere in the company if management did right. They lost a hard-working employee on account of the unprofessional attitudes these people had. Stay away from this company."
bad,"Having many years experience as a delivery driver before starting at FedEx I expected it to be an easy transition, but it was not. It was a company that took the most simple tasks and turned them into a nightmare of procedures and red tape. One of the hardest parts of the job and for which people were fired over was the most basic of chores, clocking in and timekeeping. The procedure was taken to soaring heights of idiocy. The station manager was by far the biggest problem with working there and was ultimately the reason for my departure, as he was for so many people before me. There is not enough room here to describe what was like to work for him. The employees, on the other hand, are some of the finest people I have ever known. The job itself was fairly enjoyable and I had many good times and memories, but would not recommend to anyone that I liked to seek a job there."
bad,"FedEx Freight - Everett  ,  is the most fickle place ever . "
bad,Fedex freight is a good job fast paced i had good experiences and bad experiences to sum it all up it's  no job security they hire then fire. Fedex is desperately in need of a union the management don't care about the drivers they don't educate you on certain things then want to write you up on every little thing or terminate drivers. Not a good place for retirement their policies and rules too strict. Like i said they hire then fire so don't waist your time if i would have knew before applied i would never have worked for them its a waist of time its better jobs out there that treat there drivers better oh yea they dont like to take care of their equipment either so don't do it to yourself stay away from fedex.
bad,"Unloading packages onto conveyor to destinations. Loading trucks with packages. Management was unorganized with operations. Unproductive work flow. Instead of assisting and helping, there were many forceful words and gestures involved. Hardest part of the day in early morning unloading and loading. Did not appreciate picking up trash everyday when out of work. Waiting outside in 40 degree weather for almost an hour everyday prior opening front door for employees to enter. Sent home early when promised 10+ hours per day."
bad,I unloaded and loaded trucks. Weighing from one pound to hundreds. It was really fast pace just took effect on the body after awhile.
bad,"Great educational and health benefits if you are a student with no family (I.e. Husband/Wife or children). A typical day at work would include a ten minute work group meeting that would detail what you will be seeing on the sort and of what is expected. Also you will receive safety gear (Ear plugs and gloves) then you will stretch and head to the sort where you will scan , load, and sort packages."
bad,"Always moving around either loading or unloading."
bad,"Typical day at work would be coming in and first thing would be to go through my emails and see if there was any changes to any shipments that I might be working on for a customer. I than would be making my calls to the airline every day to make sure the flights are coming in on time and if there were any delays to find out what was causing them and to get them corrected asap. I would notify my customers about any issues by calling them or sending out emails.I would cut checks to the airline if they required one. I would set up the transfer for the freight to come back to our warehouse and get a quote for delivery from several truckers. I would confirm setup and quote and get all paper work ready."
bad,They promote people that don't have experience nor skillset for the required position and hold back the people that are more than qualified to fill those positions. The managers lack people skills and leadership skills. They expect the package handlers to train people while the trainers do nothing.
bad,"This company is very biased. More men are hired for higher management positions, there are some very unprofessional personel which makes it hard to work."
bad,"regular,debido a que aprendí cosas que se podrían aplicar en otras empresas."
bad,working for fedex is good experience but the hours are very little. coworkers are awesome and very positive but management is not really there.
bad,watched over the crowd to ensure safety enjoyed seeing the games and the players hated working in the cold it was alot of people to watch so you had to make sure they were safe
bad,A long walk in the cold for a Short 2.5-3.5hr. Shift. The hardest part of the job was UnLoading trucks and the best part of the Job was when it was over.
bad,"Fui contratado exatamente na integração entre a Fedex e a Rapidão Cometa. Na época a Fedex possuía cerca de 250 funcionários no Brasil e adquiriu o controle acionário da Rapidão Cometa com 12.000 funcionários."
bad,A Typical day at work will be working part time at a fast pace to In bound scan packages and to unload and load trucks.It could be a lot better if the communication skills where there .
bad,"	Planned trip logistics and obtained necessary documents to transport goods"
bad,"Loaded and Unloaded Trucks, Scanning and Bagging packages, Maneuvering Hazardous Packages, and Cleaning my surroundings."
bad,Deliver packages to warehouse hours are really good but be sure it is subcontractor work you are doing. You are not working for FedEx.
bad,"Loading and unloading trialers, hard work. Learned 10 key, load a trialer the right way, management was good and co-workers, everything was hard about this job."
bad,"Assist in all type airframe and powerplant repairs through dispatch of Technical Specialist, Developed a Technical Services department bring the dispatch reliability of a fleet of B727-200 aircraft from 65% to 98%. "
bad,The job was a good working job but overall they expanded the regular pay period all the time
bad,"Good money, but high stress. Also, very long hours with little support team and management."
bad,"Learned Program Management"
bad,Hard work. Fair pay. But not well managed. Always short staffed. Very high turnover and staff burn out.
bad,I enjoyed the job however its a very physical job. I like challenges so it wasn't hard to me. Some things I couldn't lift but their was always people around to help.
bad,"Loading and unloading trailers in a timely manner. Lifting packages up to 75lbs, working with a partner or alone."
bad,A typical day of work consisted of four hours of wrapping pallets followed by another four hours of loading trucks. I learned how to efficiently load a truck. Management was agreeable. Co-workers seemed unmotivated. The hardest part of the job was the time of the shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was that the constant physical labor was like a workout.
bad,"Working here was back breaking work sometimes.  Hours were inconsistent and the management play favorites.  This meant you could work 20+ hours one week, but work under 15 the next.  Managers were allowed to yell at you and get in your face when you had an off day.  If management didn't like you, sometimes they set you up to fail.  During the holidays when there was a lot of work, they would hire more people, and then after the holidays fire people.  You could be fired at any point for having an off day.  Sometimes you would not get a break to eat between shifts.  Hours cut to keep you under part-time hours.  You would have to work on some mandatory days if weather or holidays shifted the work load.  Management moves ""favorites"" into higher paying and easier jobs first before hard working people."
bad,Have to stay on your toes in keeping the many processes and policies running.
bad,Walgreens was alright to work for. my manager was very helping with anything that ineeded. I did not like the customers very much. some were rude and careless.
bad,"Management I felt was poor.  Not a lot of support/help from management.  FedEx does have good benefits for students.  Full time work is not happening, let a lone more than 15 hours a week if you work 6 days a week throughout the summer."
bad,scanning packages and loading them inside trailers at a very fast pace.
bad,"A typical day at work is hook the trailers, drive to destiny and drop them into the terminal."
bad,learned how to package and label the boxes and shipped them out
bad,co worker was helpful training lacked fully at times to new workers. break was sort and hours and days longer than told. sometime aint have work for you and told to go home early.
bad,"I worked for FEDEX Freight for 4 years. It changed right before my eyes, They ( FEDEX) is more about the brand the treating the customers and employees well."
bad,"Constant repetition of loading and unloading packages, acquired the knowledge of working with others in a team environment, management was okay, they didn't really care about their employees. The hardest part of the job was the weather factors inside the building, but the most enjoyable part was working with my fellow co-workers."
bad,"did not like the job, i was told by my trainer to snort cocaine in order to enhance my work performance."
bad,"You will get a great workout through out the day, especially when they start hiring lazy folks. The hardest part of your job is when you have folks working there that has 2 jobs. They seem to keep them to me. They be late usually and have excuses not to work. I enjoyed my job at first until my supervisor wife had twins and he had to leave. Then my hours got cut back and my checks were 80.00 a week. When my hours got cut and stayed cut for months i almost beg my boss to let me go."
bad,"The company struggles to properly reward for good work. The location I was in tended to be a jumping ground for employees as long as they were willing to leave the store. Internally it was a dead end. Overly stressful, under scheduled while over worked. The staff was generally cool to be around and I still hang with a few."
bad,"Very intense fast pace environment, they work you really hard for little compensation."
bad,"If you want to be at a job were u get overworked,  if your not in the click per say, and are there just to do your job..this is not the place for you. If you dont kiss butt or take up for yourself then Fed Ex is not the place for you. The environment sucks, management sucks and they dont care about you.You are a number to them. You never get any days off and you will come out sore everyday                                         "
bad,This job is extremely fast paced and physically demanding. Most of the drivers are rude and only concerned for themselves. Not the type of job you build camaraderie at.
bad,FedEx will work you until they don't need you anymore. In FedEx everyone can be replaced and will be.  They have no loyalty to employees anymore.  The company has changed in the 19 years I worked at FedEx.
bad,"I loved working at this place until I started having problems with the supervisiors and managers. They truly don't care if you want to be at work or not, they just want to boss you around."
bad,"It's a job but you have too many people who are young and don't want to work and too busy leaving more work on the next person. Speaking only for myself, I like working there but like in any company you have to worry about what you have to accomplish and get it done to the best of your own personal way."
bad,"N/a unfriendly unsupportive uncaring and clickish ..................,.................. All about the manager and his bonus and yearly trip. Taking away from the regular people in order to get the big collect on the big Corp deals"
bad,"At FedEx you will be expected to keep up with the rate of the conveyor belts, and work the whole 4 hour shift from start to finish with little to no breaks."
bad,"Working at FedEx Freight was a bad experience. The pay was competitive, but in two years working there I never got the opportunity to get off of the night shift. The workplace at my location had a very ""good enough"" mindset that set the tone for lackluster work ethic in the employees."
bad,"job was simple, but only got maybe 20 hours a week. managers were all over on consistency and quality. some were great, some were very lazy and didn't care."
bad,"This job was very stressful, as people constantly butt heads creating a very toxic environment. Because of this, also created a lot more of unnecessary work for the same pay."
bad,The work was awesome until they send people home early and you get backed up and have to deal with angry drivers cause your 4 trucks turn into 8 trucks to load. Everyday coming In at different times always backing us up everyday. Scanners always breaking making you more backed up. I had managers call me every Monday at 230 in the morning asking when I was coming in I was scheduled tues-sat. I would not recommend FedEx to anyone.
bad,"The workplace harassment and inefficiency could be dealt with more than not at all if the managerial hierarchy were qualified and ready to deal with the issues that arise in a a physically demanding, and time-sensitive workplace."
bad,People are Great. Management and getting promoted is horrible. All of the very hard workers will stay package handlers because they can never hire enough people or get enough hard workers. So if you love to work hard and never get rewarded this is the company for you!
bad,"I will not work for those people again. Had to move fast lifting boxes up to 100 lbs and you could not take a break when you have to use the restroom you’ll have to let someone know when your leaving, after you get done your shift you can’t just leave the building even if you did clock out . They gave me a hard stressful work environment."
bad,"This job was decent, however it is the first job I left without a two weeks notice. The team leads aren't ever on the same page. One will tell you one thing and then another will tell you something else. "
bad,"Empresa ainda é pequena no Brasil e a gestão muito fraca, isso torna os funcionários desmotivados."
bad,job was good but company didn't trust me enough.thats im no longer with the company.i done all the hours and some even working weekends.didnt get the praise I was due
bad,Management is among the worst I have ever seen. They are way too young to be managing. They just have no sense of what their doing. They need a lot more training. When they dont like you for whatever reason they dont hide it. It's more like a prison.
bad,"Up too early 4am. hard strenuous lifting. not enough workers, they don't show up for work, and do bare minimum. Management is poor. you don't work enough hours therefore pay is terrible especially for the hard work you do."
bad,"It feels like you work 40 hours but in reality you do around 20. Work is pretty intense depending the area you work in. You must be very quick, because the workload pace is impossible to keep up with."
bad,"You don’t get more than 5 hours a day working there. It’s not worth your time. I needed more hours. The supervisors aren’t that friendly, the trainer I had was good. And that’s the only good thing. You would go thru security and they would use their security devices, as you left. And you had to take your shoes off to be inspected"
bad,You never get rewarded for the work you do. You dont get to work within a team . Managing a set of individuals is what you find as opposed to managing a team
bad,"I worked at other FedEx locations that weren't so bad, but FedEx Freight in San Antonio was absolutely horrible! It's almost a year since I quit and I still sometimes have nightmares about that place! Supervisors and dispatchers there are openly hostile to dock workers and drivers. It was the most bizarre work environment I've ever been in! Supervisors really go to extra lengths to let you know that you're just a cockroach to them, and they really enjoy stepping on you. They roll their eyes at employees, scream at them, speak condescendingly, tell employees to load HazMat in dangerous and illegal ways to meet deadlines, putting the driver and the public at risk. They don't let employees report injuries because it will ruin their chance to have a safety bbq. But when something goes wrong it's all on the employee. And if you complain about it, you'll be walking around with a bullseye on your back! In every daily work group meeting one of the supervisors would proclaim to everyone ""If you don't want this job... than you don't have to work here!"" Eventually I realized what brilliant advise that was. So I threw away my 8 years with the company. When I quit it felt like I was finally released from prison."
bad,"My experience may be isolated to this particular location. Work/life balance was promised, but I am on the job from 12 noon-midnight five to six days a week. "
bad,"Too many issues to name. To upper management, even if you only think of employees as labor, they’re still human beings with lives and families just like you. Take care of your people and your service will improve"
bad,"I work at customer service and I try to do my best to show my enthusiasm and to be as helpful as I can be, but sometimes the customers that I receive are aggressive. I can understand that they're angry because they had an issue with their package, but it's not the representative's fault! They do the best they can to fulfill your needs and some processes take time, but some customers seem to not care about that. Remember that the people behind the phones are humans too :("
bad,"There is a power struggle in the top tiers of management within this company. Because of that, the employees beneath them are often tasked to work but given no credit for the work done."
bad,"It was fun to just hop in and work and leave, but the amount paid, and hours available was not worth the work in my opinion. Not to mention the poor atmosphere and how unprofessional the higher ups can be at times."
bad,When you hire in and they tell you that your more than employee  your a part of family and let you go when your dad dies doesnt make you feel like family
bad,"FedEx is an ok company , honestly just depends where you land the first station i worked for was great, people were great, management was fair, gave people the chance to learn and advance , i had to move to where im at now and its the complete opposite , management doesnt care or value employees , not so willing to take the time teach new things and train up in comers such as myself the ways to management,"
bad,others employees help each other like a team work nights 4 hours hardest wok unload heavy box tv tires  i learned how move the belt working with other employees
bad,The management wasn't the best . They were very lazy . They didn't fulfill their position. I wish the work was also divided evenly . I wish they change their way's.
bad,"Job security, but very stressful."
bad,The terminal is a very fun place to work on most days.  The drivers all get along well sharing war stories with one another during down time. As with any job there are good and bad days.
bad,Awesome place to works if the entirety of senior management were replaced.  Senior management changes policy and tasking manically. Often times you are directing to accomplish a task only to be later scolded for completing the task because priorities had changed but never been communicated to you.
bad,"Productive and a good workplace on a dock. I learned how to move freight on a forklift, build decks, and recoup freight. Management has an open door policy so they are easy to get along with and everyone helps each other out at work. The hardest part of my job is the workload sometimes and the easiest part of the job is loading freight."
bad,"OK, could be better, no benefits, or sick pay, no paid vacation, however, great opportunity for someone who wants to work. hourly salary depends on how organized you are ."
bad,My typical day at work consist of the same routine each day. Although I do a different job each day I feel that I am in a rut. I learned how to work with different types of people and personalities. Management is always changing and will not take employees thoughts into consideration. The hardest part of my job is dealing with my coworkers.
bad,i was liked by a lout of the perares nice in varment some friendly people all walks of life worked unloaded like thay wonted me to just i wish it was full time with overtime
bad,I spent three years at FedEx and was given a chance to move up very early in my career but was not promoted after that due to the fear that I was going to quit to pursue a better opportunity.
bad,"You have to work hard."
bad,I was wrongfully fired due to absences from medical issues. I had a doctors note to go with the days missed.. as well notified my manager. The managers here are terrible.
bad,"The job allows you to determine your start time each day but, the amount of work each day is unknown upon arrival. From time to time management can be uncoordinated causing difficulty for the driver and unknown variables throughout your day, which may mean longer days. This can bee difficult when you are expected to stay on the clock until all deliveries have been completed. Though difficult I have always been able to adapt to the circumstances."
bad,"The Job sucked, The pay sucked, worthless bosses. I would not recommend this job to anyone unless you hate them or want them to hate their life as well."
bad,"Definitely learned a lot on topics about fda,fcc,fwl,dod on how customs requires certain information."
bad,"I worked for this company for a year and a half. I had a workplace injury requiring surgery and six weeks off.  During my fourth week off I received a letter of termination for failing to come in on a day off and the day of my surgery. They don't care much about their employees, only about production."
bad,it was a great experience. coworkers where great everyones friendly. some managers where good some weren't. while you on the road its a lonely day.they pay weekly and good benefits.
bad,I started out working on the push off slide in the mega hub for a year. Then I became a checker for a year. After that I became a tub driver for four years. then went to offload/loading for a year and a half.
bad,"Describing this job is hard since every employee is expected to do so much on every shift. The benefits are amazing and rewarding after working there for 1000 hours. There's no air conditioning or heating so be prepared to freeze in the winter and sweat in the summer. There's no breaks unless you are working 2 shifts, then you'd get a break in between the two. I don't recommend this job to anyone looking for a job filled with happy and enthusiastic workers."
bad,"The part-time dockworker job is great when your like 18-25 then it's time to step up and make some real cash. FedEx Freight is decent if you make cash on the side as well, I would usually go in like 4am-9am and be done all day, do whatever I wanted all day and making close to 20 bucks an hour, but the dock gets old youll eventually need a second job if you want anything nice. You'll see new people walk in and become supervisors and theyll be asking you questions that you would think they would know but of course these college kids don't know a thing about a dock, and they take what they brainwash you into believing you can become, there is no advancement unless you KNOW SOMEBODY or get a CDL  and it's like pulling wisdom teeth out to get on the driving program so great luck, and the drivers on bottom only work a few days if theyre lucky so they are wasting time anyways waiting on old people that cant retire because of Obama. So your best bet is to just join the local Hall amd Get Yourself  A PENSION and go make 20+some an hour and go get some real cash. Don't waste your time trying to get a career here at FedEx Freight, unless You Know Somebody because that's the only way inside the circle, partner."
bad,"it was not a good experience , would not recommend anybody to work there . FedEx has bad management., they say they will fix things but never does."
bad,They don't give you enough hours to support your family. It takes to long for health benefits to kick in. Back breaking work. Little pay
bad,"During my time here I saw a company that preached teamwork and leadership and at first thought they stood by what they said. However, as time went on, true colors started to show that everyone was only out for themselves, stunting team growth for personal gains and sacrificed innocents to cover their own mistakes. Leadership was a big part of the picture here, but when it came time to lead, the only knowledge I ever saw from anyone was book knowledge from reading leadership books......but none of what was read was practiced. A lot of lies and deception, twisting of words, and upper level people who are supposed to help teach the business and help the company grow kept any and all good focus on themselves and blamed the closest person for anything that could, would, and did go wrong. Instead of using those examples to show how to make the right calls in whatever the situation was, all they did was ""point and blame"" getting mad that they had to go ""fix"" the situation without teaching others how to avoid or fix whatever happened. So many sincere and great leaders I've sen go through that place and quit because of everyone else around them. I got tired of seeing such poor management around me that I couldn't continue to work with this company. I absolutely LOVED the job itself, and did well at it, but I eventually grew to despise everyone else in management around me that I could not take it anymore. 2 Star rating is the optimist in me hoping the company will get better... Hardly deserves one star to be honest."
bad,"During my job experience at FedEx i learned how to work with others as a team , i also learned that working as a team got the job done faster than if i were to work alone. The other co-workers were very helpful when they would finish their assignment before time and others struggled to get done before the scheduled end time. the hardest part of my job was risking my health to work, another hard part was when i injured myself on the job and they denied me of workers comp. i enjoyed helping others and working as a team, i also enjoyed getting to know other people at work because it led to me getting to know them better outside of work."
bad,"Compensation and benefits are good.The problem is that most managers treat managerial employees like tools and a lot of favoritism.In short their policies are ""Non managerial employees' opinions do not matter and we don't care""...thus the reason why Operation Managers and sort managers are always understaff because they don't take care of their entry level staff."
bad,Boring work with differing hours. Poor fellow employees with a lot of inept foreigners. Hot conditions in the summer. Can move up fairly quickly if a good employee and young
bad,"Typical day: Fast paced "
bad,"Ensure customer receives great customer service."
bad,"O meu dia de trabalho era muito bom, não tinha problemas com ninguem muito pelo contrario ajudava aos outros. Aprendi muito nesses dois anos de empresa. Não tenho muito pra fala sobre direção e gerencia, mais  na minha opnião os funcionarios poderia ganhar um pouco mais de reconhecimento, durante os dois anos que eu estive la nunca se quer fui reconhecia em subir de cargo por exemplo. Sobre meu colegas de trabalho não tenho o que reclamar pois mesmo depois de não estar mais la, tenho contado com todos, a parte mais dificil na minha opnião era ver que eu estava ali a dois anos e nunca subi de cargo, e tinha pessoas que chegavam novas, e não fazian nem se quer tres meses e ja estavam em cargos novos, acho que essa era a parte mais dificil, pois não era reconhecida, a mais agradavel era que eu gostava do que eu fazia, porem desanimei pelas condicoes."
bad,Continually over worked.  Pay increases are poor and spotty at best.
bad,"Typically in Texas, the hub is either freezing (in winter, have to wear multiple layers of clothing, coats, gloves and hood, scarf or hat.) In summer, sweat drips off of you.. even when barely clothed in  t-shirt and shorts..only a few months out of the year are you comfortable, temperature wise.. inside the warehouse.  Your day is like a serious work out.  Mostly lifting, sorting, moving, pulling.   Getting the attention of your supervisor.. is almost impossible, because during the 4hr sort,  the loud conveyor belts are humming.. and they have an radios with ear-buds that they are required to listen to for trailer movement, other managers, and belt and location problems. "
bad,"When one manager says one thing and the other manager says or does the exact opposite it is hard to work in that environment. Their planning and organization is terrible and it makes the employees suffer. Only enjoyed the actual job, did not enjoy the over complexity and overall experience with the management staff was ridiculous."
bad,"A typical day at FedEx was waking up anywhere from 2 am to 4 am. After clocking in it would be a non-stop day of lifting anywhere from 2 lbs to 300+ lbs with assistance."
bad,"FedEx is a carrier like no other. A super competitive, fast paced environment which I truly enjoyed. I had great relationships with my contractors and warehouse associates. The knowledge and experience I gained from my time at FedEx, I still use today in my current management role. A great learning experience."
bad,"Alto nível de aprendizado, muito companheirismo e clima organizacional bom."
bad,This is a fast paced working environment. Individuals must possess the ability to fluctuate with job changes and needs.
bad,Im not sure if I could describe my experience at FedEx. Was just not the Job for me.
bad,A typical day at fed ex was not easy i'm talking hard labor and making nickle and dimes for it. I believe i was in school still while working so i wasn't looking for a lot but still i learned how to work hard at a young age and it didn't help that i didn't stay there too long but it was a fun experience met some cool people.
bad,"Working at Fed Ex Smart Post, wasn't always an easy task. I started off through their temp agency which was called Resource. After completing my 550 hrs, I was hired in to the Fed Ex company. I was hired in for seasonal work which included line sorting, packaging, and unloading. The hardest part of my job was keeping my co- workers on the same page daily. The most enjoyable part of the job was reaching goals ahead of scheduled time. My co-workers were all great individuals, which made my day great as well. I was recently let go due to the seasonal position and now Im currently looking for new employment."
bad,"A typical day at work was fast pace, moving very swiftly, working safely with others.  I learnd how to use a RF gun, how to work well with a team, and work safely. The management was tough on the team on a lot of situations but never told us when we did a good job. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my team members."
bad,"Trying to maintain a constant work speed, so the customer can recieve their packages on time."
bad,Every route is individually contractor owned.  You never know what kind of person you will be working for
bad,A typical day at work was loading tractor trailers with packages for the duration of the shift.
bad,"Load boxes into trailers, constant, repetitive physical labor."
bad,i worked many hours for little pay i loved the job. never complained
bad,"A typical work day here can be stressful. Load van for route that morning,deliver packages in a safe and timely manor.The management can be a little hard to get along with.Most of my co-workers were easy going and would help you out if needed. The hardest part of this job was learning the routes so you could get done in a timely manor. The most enjoyable part of this job was you were on your own."
bad,fast pace not stop work for a solid hour a day. it took big toll on your body due to the stressful environment.
bad,Not happy at having worked at the Hub.
bad,"Not very good managers,ha"
bad,"The hardest part of this Job is not going, The most enjoyable part of the job is the workout. I enjoy the typical work day of loading and unloading trucks. Supervisors are very well accommodating and helpful in the work atmosphere."
bad,pm runnning repair
bad,"Working at FedEx Hub with the duration of 5 years is okay. But I feel that the job at hand used to be fun, but now it has been more stricter than before. The benefits were great, and today it is somewhat great due to some of the cut backs. For advancing your career with management, its great to be involved but I would not recommend managing inside the hub because of the inconsistent senior managers and maybe directors. But overall about the company, its good to start of when coming out of high school or looking for a second job, but not as easy to grow within the company."
bad,alot aof work in such a short time to do it.nothing in-particular. co-workers was awsome poeple to work with.
bad,"Everyday at work me and my partner had to get the trucks unloaded in 30 minutes,i also vision scanned at the same time, I learned how to vision scan each box in a certain amount of time."
bad,Truck Driver drop empty trailers and pickup full trailersn driver
bad,Work style is quite different from my earlier experience
bad,"Working for FedEx was a learning experience, not the ideal place for advancement however. FedEx is a fast pace environment, very hard work, you have to be Ford built tough to handle the daily dealings of FedEx. I ran the Small Package Induction, I started in the primary induction worked my way up to time keeper, and then promoted to Team Lead. My team and I lead the division in Smalls Inductions for the first time under my leadership. The average out put was 3500-4000 units I put out 5000 or better."
bad,"I would scan packages, remove them from a conveyer belt, place them in vans according to the drivers delivery schedule. I would load anywhere from 250-600 packages a night"
bad,long hours to work and standing hours. great place for students and want to earn extra cash.
bad,"Driving Double Trailer truck in bad weather was extremely dangerous. Vehicle training was much ""too short"".  Benefits were good and salary was fair. Some vehicles were old and not in good condition."
bad,FedEx package handler is a good job for someone who is going to school or not looking to work that much. It's a couple of hours and the work is bearable. Not too hard but I dont recommend this job for people who are looking to work 40 hours a week. This is more of a second job. And the people who I work with are great.
bad,"This job is not fun. Plain and simple. Your back hurts, and there is hardly any people interaction. Sure, you get a work out in and there is no uniform, but it's not a place I want to be."
bad,Don’t do it. Pay is not good. No benefits . No raise in over a year . Working till late hours . No benefits like I said . The managers are nice but other than that this is just a job shouldn’t be a permanent one eithe
bad,The job is definitely physically demanding! You spend most of your time trying to shuffle packages onto rollers and a conveyor belt. Some of these packages are over 70 lbs. You have 2 layers of flooring in the trucks to empty out within a certain amount of time. The pay is definitely not worth the back breaking work you have to do! I was disappointed considering FedEx is a worldwide company.  You don't get any benefits until you've been there a year. Just for the time of day that you work you should be paid decent. The work is from 3 a.m. to supposedly 8 a.m.  Sometimes you get sent home after 2 1/2 hours because they're trying to give everyone opportunity for hours. You get $0.25 raise after 30 days then another $0.25 after 3 months!
bad,This is a very challenging job but if you do not mind working hard or even enjoy it it is a idea place to advance your career. The benefits are excellent.
bad,"Lavoro piacevole e stimolante e Manager davvero un' ottima persona.. la nota negativa è stato l' aver avuto a che fare con una persona totalmente maleducata arrogante capace solo di arruffianarsi chi sta in alto e trattare con sufficienza chi sta al suo livello arrivando a dire ""tu sei un peso qui per noi (come se avesse parlato miss perfezione) dimostrando di essere (forse) capace nel lavoro essere una nullità sul piano umanopiano umano"
bad,Fedex was considered home to me for many years. I had to overcome all the negativity that made it a bad place to be and dwell on the positive things and people. While doing that I inspired fellow workers encouraged them to overcome the obstacles that they faced on and off the job. Me helping them helped me and encouraged me to try to make a difference. But I learned that the change has to come from the people on top first and then it can trickle down the company.
bad,From beginning to end I had a very bad experience with management how they treated me how they talk to me and it led me being fired because the disrespect from management that was a very awful experience I had working with the Fed Ex not that I will not go back I would love to work for FedEx again.
bad,The fedex office used to do a lot more to help new drivers and contractors.  Know they seem to do the least to help new drivers . Turn over is high . If you get in with the right contractor you are set . If you get in with the wrong disorganized contractor.  I'll pray for you . Try and get a route that you know the area well and you can make a lot off money if you can hustle.  Ask different drivers?????
bad,"Used to be a good place to work once upon a time. Management is  a joke and continue making changes that not only are affecting the company negatively, but also bringing down the morale of employees heavily. "
bad,"Typical day includes clocking in and meeting with the group in your area. Afterward the managers choose which trailers you'll unload/load as fast as you can. Managers will make exceptions for some but not everyone. People often get hurt and are sent home. Compensation for missed days for major injuries is given but is 1/3 of your salary. Work schedules can change weekly and depending on the flow of the day, management can choose to keep you later than you wish to finish the workload. Expect daily sweaty workouts."
bad,I would not recommend working for FedEx. It is a poor environment.. lack of professionals and is basically a one sided business. I never felt appreciated their.. disrespectful management and employees out to get you and only care about themselves..in any circumstances they were never there to fight for you only if you where in their clique group.. salary was not up to par.. trying to get another job within was pretty much impossible unless you were in a specific group.. they would hire people within the department that had a lower pay or grade as you. I would never tell anyone to work for FedEx! It's stressful and you will definitely get anxiety and depression...guaranteed! I've known many people that have come and gone due to this reason.. oh and forget about being sick or your family being sick they will write you up for that even though they say family comes first! They will not fight for you.. you pretty much have to watch your own back. Management are out for themselves and could care less about their employees.. all they do is gossip and run their mouths about people there! They are never working and always socializing to fit in. I would never recommend working for FedEx! They are a complete joke and they are a lie!
bad,"Been working more than a decade at FedEx, my salary is so low I cannot even pay my own rent. Every time we ask for a raise they always have an excuse, last raise I was given was a slap on the face. If you know somebody like a VP you will get in easy and will get paid good but if you don't know anyone don't even bother cause you wont even get an interview."
bad,I worked the third shift at FedEx so I was starting at 10pm and not getting out until around 4am. We were not allowed to have phones anywhere in the complex. I handled packages from a conveyer belt and stacked them in a truck. Which got very tiring after doing it for hours. At least once or twice a night there would be so many packages coming down that it was overwhelming. This job was very physically demanding.
bad,"Supervisors are stressed out about numbers that they get upset and send you home if (you aren't pulling your weight ) was trained for only fork lift, other things like the clamp and barrel attachment was figure out from other employees.  Just an over all toxic environment for me."
bad,"They make the people that actually come their to work ,work harder all while the people that dont have the same objective do nothing. They allow bullying, and they dont always pay you all the hours you've worked per week!"
bad,i would not recommend FEDEX unless you live alone in a single apartment. FEDEX does not provide enough hours for their part time associates. the hardest part of working at FEDEX is waking up early in the the morning just to do 3 to 4 hours of hard labor.
bad,All i really did was load trucks. I was used to UPS's system so it was hard to adjust to fed ex's system. It just didn't feel right for me. To each their own.
bad,"There was a lot of favoritism at this job, which caused me to be fired, other than that this would be great company to work for. I loved the area I worked in, I was able to meet a lot of celebrities, also a lot of influencers in the world. The money was great, but the hours not so much. Lots of time taken away from family during holiday season."
bad,"From what i have personally seen and went through working for a contractor your job isn't secure because of favoritism and cutthroat mentality, try your luck and find the right contractor."
bad,"com essa empresa você aprender a trabalhar, um caminho para experiencia."
bad,It’s a place of work you go in do the job and go home good benefits  easy to move up into higher position when they open They pay is OK but you can always use more
bad,Pay is primarily determined by tenure and not job performance. There is little incentive to improve processes at your job.  Promotions are mainly determined by seniority and not job performance.
bad,Back staff is great. Customer service is awful. You are a customer service rep the majority of the time.  Turn over is extremely high. Training is great!  But the culture is awful. You never have a clean plate ever.
bad,"The boxes would be way to heavy to lift, sometimes they were heavier than me and it would be hard to unload trucks by myself . barely any team work. Some days were harder than others"
bad,"Management is great within this department."
bad,Not too fond of how the manager trained and explained the daily routine of a work day. They didn't explain that a certain way of doing things could lead to being fired and that in my book is not a professional way to run a business.
bad,Was a great place to work a long time ago and than they changed. The managers got soft on poor employees and expect the good ones to do more work. You can get into trouble just by being assertive.
bad,The managers above need to treat the employees better knowing they short handed on unloading and loading side. Give raises to people that actually show up.
bad,Loved working for fed ex.  Enjoyed the job a lot and delivery driving is something I'm very great at and enjoy working with the public.  Every day is a different challenge. Which I enjoy.
bad,"unprofessional management team, workplace that demands extreme physical condition, dirty and hazardous work environment from employees and management alike. would never work there again"
bad,"This was a great place to work up until management changes , they are very rude and harassing, when I went to HR about it nothing happened. Putting all that aside, I love the job but can no longer work in a unprofessional company and toxic work environment."
bad,"The pay is ok but I think they are very disorganized and have poor management. The hardest part of the job is the strain that it puts n my body, lifting heavy packages at a fast pace, breaking fingernails, and constantly getting bruises on my body."
bad,"You come to work when it is time too start, and work until it is done. You get familiar with how the whole package handling operation works. Every person is vital to FedEx. Knowledgeable and helpful are most of the people you see at FedEx. Its just a physical job, once your past that the day is always enjoyable."
bad,"Took Care of the Children"
bad,Great company to work for...Upper management needs work in the Texas region. I would recommend for the Texas region Get an outside party to resolve all employee complaints. Things that are of serious matter seems to never leaves  the region so nothing never gets a fair hearing. all people in power are all apart of the problems.
bad,"I have nothing bad to say in terms of pay or benefits those are great. However, if you are competent and work hard, you wont succeed here. Seems like the hardest most competent people are the ones who continously get thrown under the bus while the lazy thrive in this company. No incentive to work hard as opportunity for advancement is very minimal."
bad,A typical day you handle boxes and sort them onto the belts and then load them in can to be sent off to another facility. I get along well with my co-workers working as a team member helps everything to flow easily.
bad,"It's a job, but they need to pay more for what they are making you to do. Its a fast pace company and you can't miss too many days at work."
bad,"I would come in at 4 am and try to repair these trucks that are rundown an worn out with no parts on hand. The few newer trucks we do have we have no equipment to diagnose or repair them with and on top of that we don't get any training we have to figure it out as we go along. "
bad,"A typical day at work included getting the package scanner, scanning, lifting and loading heavy boxes. We built walls of boxes inside the trucks so that the boxes would not collapse on me. "
bad,"Hard work, ability to move up with time. Management doesn't care about you. Work is non-stop. Not much to enjoy here but receiving your check. $1500 tuition reimbursement is a plus for students. Only can receive once per calendar year."
bad,A typical nite at work is pretty much fast pace.I get along and work well with my manager and co-workers.
bad,"Manager of my own business I sold. Suppose to have been a partnership with FedEx, but it wasn't."
bad,FedEx is great for kids graduating from high school. It teaches you responsiblity
bad,"Typical day:"
bad,this is not a job you would want to do long term as it take a toll on your body repetitive motion in tight space suck as the belly of an airplane I still I have back and knee pains you work outside in the rain or in 100 degree weather or in 0 degree weather there is not much opportunity to move up so you might be part time for 10 years only good thing about this job was I met some good people
bad,"working at FedEx I would enter into the warehouse, go through security, clock in, get assigned a job by the managers and go to work. I learned alot about how to use a fork lift and how to scan boxes in at FedEx. My co-workers were very helping when I first started working by showing me how to operate certain equipment. The hardest part of the job was the late hours that I had to work and the easiest part of the job was picking up my paycheck. "
bad,The money isn't bad if it's a part time job but don't ever stay there longer than you need to because they do not care about their employees.
bad,"Employees are very much like kleenex at FedEx. You will be used, aggressively, and then thrown away."
bad,Loading and unloading trucks. enjoyed the time i havd with the company.
bad,hard work and heavy lifting is a typical day at work. management is encouraging and hard working
bad,"The customers are wonderful. The staffing is moderate to wonderful. But the management does not particularly care for the welfare of their staff. I have worked at several different FedEx Office locations, under many different managers, and this always remains the same. Corporate even fired five managers in 2011 and replaced them, but it continues to be an issue. Until you can get proper management, the company simply cannot thrive. I have seen many great coworkers, with potential leave this company from under appreciation combined with low salary."
bad,Only worked about 15 hours a week as a seasonal employee.didnt enjoy because I only work for 1 month.
bad,"i did enjoy my employment there ,that was untill new management and you were no longer a person but a number."
bad,"Work was typically the same everyday, not really much to think about. Co-workers were cool to work with didn't really have problem with anyone. The hardest part of the job is the summertime since there is no a/c."
bad,Stay in shape n keep positive attitude and work as a team n try to make Friends with your co-workers and try to come every day on work do not miss any days and stay productive
bad,Cuando estás hay ya todo cambia no te dan uniformes y mucho menos el apoyo en la empresa
bad,i thank here with fed Ex is that it is a very fast moving company to work for it is also very competitive within the work thats required on a daily basics which can somtimes make it more rewarding also there is a chance to get promoted if you want to move up peg to another position within the company which all employees can benefit from this within the company policy which always changes all the time within reason.
bad,"not my favorite place . men are annoying but easy job. warehouse gets hot sometimes, always drink water. managers don’t care only when it’s backed up ."
bad,"I worked for Fedex Freight on Shawson dr for a little over 2 years. There is a reason why this location has a huge turn over, that it self speaks volumes. "
bad,Fedex can be very physically demanding as you are on your feet the whole day and are expected to keep a constant flow as you work. If you can honestly do well in the job it can be very rewarding.
bad,If they get better managers the company would be ok. They need people that's not going to come to work with their at home problems. Managers that care about their employes and that understand that they are people just like them. Managers thats not going to put you down or treat you like you are a robot.
bad,I would not recommend anyone to work at fedEx who is trying to live off of just that one job. The pay is well below average and the work is very fast paced and stressful.
bad,"Personally its not so much the job as much as the people working here. I feel so much tension every time I look at the clock as my shift approaches. My supervisor cares more about his high school friends, then building a solid team work environment. The company itself is solid and the jobs are straight forward, the management and even the HR department needs work."
bad,"If you want to work 2-3 hours per day for part time, and if you're lucky to get full time, then 4-6 hours a day, 5-6 days a week, then this the job for you. Great for a college student. Not so great for someone who has a family to take care of. The favoritism runs rampant. Good luck ever trying to advance with the company. You're better off getting your CDL and driving for FedEx, they'll treat you better."
bad,it was a okay company to work for. The environment that you work in is sometimes hot or cold. They can trained their managers better for the workers to have better work skills.
bad,I worked for a contractor and not for FEDEX the company itself.Very disorganized and always changing things with no to low communication and lack of cohesiveness
bad,a little stressful at times due to demands on cleaning and creating a germ free environment and communicating with management and supervisors daily to check in
bad,"This is a good company for learning purposes, but I do not feel hiring practices are fair and are based on race as I am sure at any other company. The pay for women is not great."
bad,"When hired, they made it seem like a completely different job than what it was. Once you are working on the floor mangers will ask you to do countless more tasks they they “don’t have time for” on top of everything you are already doing. When working weekends you are alone and when an issue comes up it’s almost impossible to fix without calling someone off duty."
bad,"The issue I had with this company is that it's not always a guarantee you will work the hours they tell you. It was times where I went to work to find out it wasn't enough work, leaving me working only working 1-3 hours at times."
bad,"Fast paced and hostile environment. Overworked and extreme expectations of loading, stacking,sorting and scanned reloading of pallets and packages. Absolutely zero incentives and zero offering of benefits of any kind. Misleading information to worker's from management that benefits will be obtained if a 70 day probation period is completed, this is a lie and there is no room for growth or positive incentive to achieve any stainable career advancement. The line is fastpaced heavy"
bad,Very fast paced steadily job. Not much English speaking coworkers. Management was ok but not willing to help when problems arose.  No where to lock belongings.
bad,"No communication from dispatch "
bad,"Pay is very low for what you have to deal with on a day to day basis with events that go on there. Also there is somewhat a bit of favoritism shown towards the more ""attractive"" females as far as what location they can work at."
bad,"Like what I did, but very poor unfair management and pay needs to be better.   Need to change management.  They fired a lot people wrongfully definitely if anything brought attention to the wrongly proceeded by upper management"
bad,Good pay.  No job security.  Start times are either midnights or early evenings no matter how long you've been there.  Pay maxes out after 3 years so everyone makes the exact same from no matter how long you've been there.
bad,"Part-time gives you no benefits to the job you are doing. You are shown a few videos, but other than that no real training. You are thrown straight in and basically told to sink or swim. Very understaffed as you can have one person scanning and loading two or more trailers at the same."
bad,Listening to my manager give us our numbers for the day and then assign us to our trucks. My manager will give me more flow than others because of how long I have been there. Then expect me to help teach new employees even though I'm not a trainer. The hardest part of my job is doing the jobs of multiple people. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people I work with make the job a little less stressful.
bad,This job was kinda short lived for me but it was a fairly good environment the staff was cool and trucks were top of the line but the job was too fast paced for my liking i averaged 50= hrs a week driving a class A truck making local deliveries manual transmission tractor
bad,This job it's actually a good job its a place of business. So theres not much extra stuff to do there. The days there was long and boring bt it go pass smooth when we kan listen to music n our head phones
bad,"great company, I loved the people I worked with. I was busy "
bad,"There’s no training or education plan and the other workers, who are quite good at their jobs and cool guys as well, are way too busy to actually train anyone. Also a loud and unprofessional atmosphere. Certainly not business like."
bad,FedEx was a great job ! A little challenging but was a great job ! I loved working there and the pay was great ! FedEx is a great place to spend your time
bad,Ok place to work. Work as a team. Everybody got along. Very busy place. The belt was always going with lots of packages. A lot of heavy packages. The  trucks were always full. But it was only part time which wasn't good.
bad,Unless you work a full time job don’t not expect Fedex to be enough to pay your bills. I’ve been employed there 3 years and I’m still part time. Not worth it
bad,"The job is demanding and fast paced. If you're great at your job, you'll be susceptible to being tossed around assisting others while still having to complete your workload. The compensation you receive from this job doesn't equate to the services rendered."
bad,All Drivers are Contract Employees so no benefits are provided.  Management had changed while I was there and the new site manager left a lot to be desired.
bad,FedEx Ground is a fast paced company with a lot of opportunity for growth. A typical day ranged from customer service to station level reporting to HR duties. Management team is difficult to deal with and do not work together on anything. This is the most difficult part of the job. Most enjoyable part of the job is customer satisfaction.
bad,"it an okay job, it just it too dirty and no professional work space."
bad,"You will spend your 4 hour work day sweating. You will not stop moving. You not receive breaks and will be brow beaten if seen standing around even if your work is currently completed. If you finish your work you are then required to go help other people finish their work so there is no reward whatsoever for going the extra mile and working harder. In fact you will be doing 2 or 3 jobs for a single jobs pay if your willing to work more than the bare minimum which most people have ended up doing because nobody wants to be there. "
bad,The managers' inefficiency showed through the lack of organization and the inability to problem solve easy-to-fix issues in the warehouse. This lead to my resignation
bad,"Hard work ahead. Difficult labor job unless you are under really good management or at a location where all the equipment works. Only positive benefit is that they hire quickly and you can get unlimited hours during peak season. Outside of that, not worth it ."
bad,I came in as a package handler and that was more or less the quote I was given. If you are in shape then you might be fine but even then you are working in hot trucks during the summer and lifting packages in excess of 50 pounds. You can ask for a team lift but 90% of the time you either don't get one or can't get one. I suggest you bring a water bottle and clothes you don't mind destroying.
bad,"I was a part of a new route and constantly had to ask to have stops taken off in order to perform the job, once a manager was gone you had to talk to other managers daily to get the same amount of routes taken. no managers talked to one another and was a daily struggle to get them on the same page."
bad,"It was suppose to be a 4 hr part time shift and the last week I worked it I was getting 1.5 to 2 hrs a shift.  I think the managers had poor training skills.  Kept on wanting me to get my packages per hour increased, but kept on moving me to several different trucks during that shift.  I would finally get the mess cleaned up so I could improve my performance and they would move me to a different truck which was also in a mess."
bad,"consegna e ritiro merci o corrispondenza"
bad,"En especifico, trabajar en Fedex HUB, no fue buena experiencia ya que carecen de valores esenciales tales como la ética profesional, la honestidad ya que no son congruentes en sus acciones vs sus palabras, los gerentes nocturnos no conocen de ética laboral ni mucho menos de la profesional además de que por sus actos o acciones pues estos hace un conflicto de intereses grande."
bad,"Loading and unloading trucks, scanning and sorting packages. Some packages are over 70lbs so you can easily hurt your back. You have to be really careful inside the trucks because packages can fall on your head and you can fall into the lower level of the truck."
bad,"Its a well structured environment, with great managers. A typical day at work is providing production and daily need of inbound sales."
bad,it was always a lot of going on being a package handler. working there would be tiring because you are constantly moving from different areas lifting things until your shift is over.
bad,"For me, the best part about working here is that I have more control over my career path. The company generously encourages and pays for training. I get to explore different kinds of tools that will pave the way for new career opportunities."
bad,more work than pay and ran through independent contractors. Management was difficult due to the inability to communicate and resolve employee/employer relations. may have been better through another contractor.
bad,The demand was high and the pay not so good. It was a nice stepping stone though. I was glad to move on but was able to apply previous skills to enhance the experience.
bad,"Working at FedEx was nice as far as pay goes. The conditions you work under are usually hot so you have to make sure that you are very hydrated. Other than that, FedEx was an easy job."
bad,Did not work for Federal Express it was Fed Ex ground. I was an independent contractor. Did not get paid enough for the amount of work and stress that I had to deal with.
bad,work you to death for little pay. Management is unprofessional and has their favorites. Have to jump into other people's suites to pick up their slack.
bad,"typical day is filled with sorting, packages by zip codes to right trailer from moving conveyors. these packages have to be inspected for defects as they move along the conveyor systems."
bad,Not the best job overall as far as hours go and communication is poor but pay is decent. Employers hardly listen to concerns of employees and seems they're always quick to reprimand before recognize an achievement but they make an effort. Overall its an alright temporary job but not full time/life long career
bad,"The hours are really inconsistent.  Some weeks you can work upwards of 40 hours plus over time, while other weeks you can only get about 15 hours in.  The staff is always changing as people come and go frequently."
bad,Not for me at all only recommended to college students who needs extra cash. not enough to pay bills and maintain a stable income. Part time shifts but not enough if you are having full time problems.
bad,"My experience with Fedex was good in that the work is easy and the people are mostly nice. There is a lot of drama with the employees and little respect shown to the management. Most of the staff does not speak english. the hours are very very little  averaging less than 20 hours a week, as well as sending people home early due to the little work."
bad,Individuals  seemed to come in at times whenever pleased or not at all...Also on days that individuals were called off due to weather or other reason. Managers fail to contact employees letting them no that there was no work needed for that day
bad,Very little pay. Very busy during holidays. Decent work environment with good people. Hours are stable and reliable. Boss was a nice guy and so were co-workers.
bad,Very routine type of office. Contract position and was supposed to be hired permanently but procedures changed. Small office of like 13 people. Very welcoming.
bad,"My days were typically about 10 hours long (from when i arrived at the terminal to when i punched out to go home)"
bad,very unprofessional stuff was every where on the factory floor  but overall the pay and the hours were excellent. my first day was like a walking through a maze I had to find everything out for myself
bad,This company it is not that bad but I am looking for  job stability .the reason that I can't find this bucaues  there are to many laws in the country against us foreigners
bad,"loading trucks, learned how to keep a steady and fast pace, management was hard on you. co-workers were competitive. hardest part was having to work in either a very cold eviroment or very hot. their was nothing enjoyable about this job."
bad,come in put scanner and printer on go back to my section get a briefing go to my truck my unloader unloads and I scan packages then I take the small boxes put into cart and take them to destination
bad,"picking and packing. knowledge of all different types of labels, and processing orders and send orders out. Working with all different types of people some friendly and some not. Great management"
bad,"Risk averse and change averse corporate culture. The food was good, the management was bad. Verdant minds, rich with ideas, stymied by the oppression of fearful management. I liked the parking the best. Not recommended to anyone except the reader."
bad,"Fed Ex is less than satisfactory in a number of areas; pay rate, work atmosphere, management, job security/advancement. the hardest part of my job was maintaining a steady pace of 420 packages per hour and 1200 packages per shift on a daily basis."
bad,"ok place to work, enjoy working there."
bad,"The typical day at work was extremely demanding. The work day consisted of fast moving, heaving lifting, and the ability to stay alert of your surroundings. The management on my side was great. Managers were supportive and encouraging. The hardest part of this job was the fast-pace environment and keeping up with the flow. there was not an enjoyable part for me at this job."
bad,"FedEx does not deal with or want to deal with any of the fleet owners to make them keep their trucks in proper and safe working condition.  Drivers spend more time out than at home with family it usually runs 5 weeks out 3 days home."
bad,":A typical day at work was hard, you had to be physically and mentally strong."
bad,"learned how to deal with the employees and work even when they where in the wrong, the most hard part of the job was being the bigger person and learning patients. the most enjoyable was satisfying the customer making them happy"
bad,"I was told I'd be eased into the part-time package handler job, but of course wasn't due to lack of oversight. My confidence was broken almost immediately."
bad,The overall job was very stressful. Training wasn't that great had to learn a lot on my own. Management seem to not care and didn't listen.
bad,"FedEx is nothing short of brutal. You are subjected to extreme temperatures, filthy working conditions, tyrannical management and dangerous working conditions. There is little flexibility in hours and personal issues are not tolerated. The pay is good and the benefits are great, but I have seen Marines cry under the pressure of the job. Unless you are unbreakable, don't bother."
bad,"I caution anyone applying to FedEx Express after being successful at a previous job, the only work experience which they deem relevant is experience gained at FedEx itself.  Training consisted of a series of videos and online programs, without the benefit of a live instructor."
bad,"very boring job doing the same thing everyday in the same spot pretty much,making sure the boxes are not damaged before stocking,very heavy lifting ,taking boxes off a rail into an 18-wheeler."
bad,"I found my time at FedEx Hard work and quite repetitive, i enjoy doing different things so i can wider my range of skills and improve them."
bad,"Loading heavy material and items into the trailer; also, while maintaining the belt speed."
bad,"Typical day is lifting numerous packages, and working together with other coworkers in order to deliver packages on time and ensure correct location."
bad,"Good work colleagues."
bad,Decent employer:  Wage and work conditions were Good to Fair.  The equipment and uniforms were Excellent.  There is also a lot of room for internal growth within the company. I would recommend this employer to job seekers.
bad,"Work was usually fast paced without any breaks. You had very good benefits with $11 - $12 of pay and the hours were good. Management at times was inconsiderate and unprofessional. They WILL work you like a slave and expect you to unload (or load up) each and every truck, full of packages, at the rate of a high speed conveyor belt. Generally the work place is not clean and very dirty. Air Fans filled with dust constantly blow (unhealthy), but you can always have them off if you can stand sweating for 4 hours. This job is not for the faint of heart. But, if manual labor is your ""thing"" then you will be fine."
bad,The typical day working at fedex was very tiring. It wasn't any teamwork. The management was lowdown didn't offer any help to me and a fellow co-worker. I had to deal with a lot of hard work by myself without any help. I did enjoy the money I was getting paid.
bad,"Management cool, not as much efficient. Have to deal with some workers doing as they please, while the manager does not do anything about it. Other than that, hard work, decent pay. They are good at deceiving, but if can deal with that. Good company"
bad,My co-workers where absolutely awesome it was just some of the managers that where not nice. I mean I drove along way for that job to get treated like dirt it really isn`t worth it. The hardest part of the job was lifting those heavy packages without any help and doing it at a speed of 350 I just couldn`t beat it.
bad,"Late nights, early mornings. Poor navigation software. Distant management."
bad,"CDL driver for carrier via interstate. Requires one to be detailed oriented, meticulous with completing paper work and compliant with all DOT regulations governing safe operation of a commercial vehicle."
bad,All work bad hours weekly pay!!!! management is ok hardest part is nothing
bad,The job works you hard with little pay or chance for advancement.
bad,It was eight hours of work put into four hours of work time. The hourly pay was great but the amount of hours worked a day was horrible
bad,"no real training, no access to employee policy and procedures manual...."
bad,"A day at FedEx is usually hectic. I use to load, unload, and work the I.C. belt. When I loaded or unloaded I handled about 2,000-3,0000 packages a night. Management was good. My co-workers varied. Some were nice some not so nice. The hardest part was the heavy packages. The most enjoyable part was working the I.C. belt."
bad,"•	Move freight, stock, or other materials to and from storage or production areas, loading docks, delivery vehicles, ships, or containers, by hand or using trucks, tractors, or other equipment"
bad,"The company provides a great product for customers. But, overall the environment is unsafe, with lack of open door policy."
bad,If you are willing to work hard they promote with good work ethic
bad,"Enjoyed working for FedEx.  Great benefits, coworkers and management."
bad,Fast paced but conflicted with other job. Battled elements of weather
bad,You have to be able to deal with the different climate.  It is cold in the winter and hot during the summer.  It is a faced paced environment so it is ok as far as the pace.  You have to be willing to work and work hard.
bad,Mindless job.  Literally didn't think about anything just did manual labor.
bad,"Learned to work independent during majority of shift."
bad,There was no mapquest back then!  That was most challenging part of the job!
bad,"un organized , and really lacked a lot, supervisors  were a lil off  and not reallly on there on jobs let alone worry bout specific sections"
bad,"Part Time Job- Shift commences at 4:00am. You have the Unload briefing and the Safety briefing,these typically last until approximately 4:45 am if you are a van loader you take this time to set up your scanner. If unloading the Semi trailers, you take this time to stretch and warm up. The last package ( depending on the season) is unloaded approximately 7:00 am."
bad,The hardest part of the job was the weather conditions of working outside. Very little equal opportunities
bad,"at orientation they say you will 25 hours a week and benefts and tuition reimburment, however you will get 25 hours week Maybe in december tuition reimbursment is only if you get all a's and benefits are if you are full time or not. the managers cut hours to save their bonus and it is rare to advance without a degree"
bad,Sadly this is one of those places where it's about who you know. If you are in the inner circle you get the hours. If you are not you will be bullied and literally be afraid you will lose your job. Poor Management
bad,"Solid company but alot of micro-management."
bad,"While your uniform says Fed Ex Groud, you work for individual route owners who do not provide benefits or health insurance options. Overtime is not paid and saturdays are now being required or I would lose my job."
bad,"FedEx was a fine job. The work was pretty easy and I enjoyed my co-workers. I got a nice lunch break and the benefits are good."
bad,not the the friendliest surroundings needs getting used to little boring
bad,they said they cared about the quality of the employees but when one was in pain they brushed it off like it was nothing
bad,be careful at all time know what type of packages coming in the building
bad,"Not a rewarding position, employees not treated with respect. Benefits are great."
bad,On a typical day I completed projects that were either taken by myself or by other co-workers. Each project had a due date and time. I learned a great deal about the copying and printing industry and also about Graphic Design. The management team always seems to be unorganized. My co-workers either wanted to work together or separate into smaller groups. The hardest part of the job dealing with the customers and also some co-workers.
bad,"Lifting packages from 0 - 150 lb. a package. "
bad,I've only worked there for a week before they decided that they didn't want me around anymore. They didn't even give me a chance to get adjusted to the work. 
bad,You have to work long hours and there is a lot of work to be done.
bad,does not follow their own philosophy of PSP (people service profit)
bad,My experience at Fedex was rough. It was really tough and I found myself exytremely exhausted at the end of each day. The pay was good but it wasnt enough to deal with the stress i was putting on my body.
bad,large company focused on making money for the higher positions at the expense of the hourly employee 
bad,"Workplace was unorganized, constantly running out of supplies and having the customers wait for supplies. "
bad,whatever truck is scheduled to ship out on a certain time is the truck you do first.Managing a place like fedex takes responsibility and you have to make sure you are 100% accurate about what's going on.You have be at constant moving pace between all the hours you work.Getting off is probably the only thing I enjoyed cause it was bascially the only break i had.
bad,Extremely long working hours - no balance between work and family life.
bad,"Load and unoad trucks, scan packages to proper destinations. Great people. Not enough hours and low wages."
bad,it was an alright job. they expected you to do way more than what you supposed to do. nothing was ever enough for the supervisors.
bad,"billing customers,handling queries and capturing"
bad,"Very very hard work, no breaks really you go the whole shift sweating and working very intensely. Bad part is you only get 10-12hrs a WEEK."
bad,A typical day was insane for a city driver. The company thinks you are a piece of equipment that never breaks down and they own you. When you walk in the door you don't know if you are working 8 hours or 14 hours and you have no control over it. The world there revolves around stats and they are as phony as a $3 bill. Your boss is evaluated daily so that pressure gets sent down to you.
bad,"Was responsible for sorting mail by zip codes and packing them into the correct zip code bin for distribution, load the mail sorting belt and programmed the best speed for the feeding machine according to mail size and weight."
bad,Move mail to trucks for delivery and the management were great and very helpful. The hardest part of the job were sometimes the weight of boxes.
bad,I've learned how to perfect my multitasking skills as well as engage customers and find solutions to their problems.
bad,Part time is only about 3 hrs per night and the pay is not that great.
bad,Very hard job with lots of driving and heavy lifting. Saftey meetings at least 3 times a week. vehicle inspections.
bad,It’s a good first job to learn from the bottom up but not a solid career. You can move up through the company with hard work and dedication. If you are willing to put in the work you can learn a lot. But then you are used a lot.
bad,They dont care how much sweat you put in the job nor if you get injured I was injured and they never care....manager is horrible they expect you to do it perfect like be the fastest person and they dont care the amount of sweat if you ain't by a limit they talk bad
bad,Fed ex was really fat paced where things or lines would get unorganized quickly. Maybe due to lack of employment and the right people at the right locations.
bad,"I have only worked at FedEx freight for a few weeks but I'm stressed out. The job is very fast paced with a lot to do in a very short amount of time. Not to mention the computer documentation that you have to fill out every time you open and close a tailor which slows you down. My FedEx is small with two freight handlers and and one supervisor. But there in lays the problem, the supervisor and my co-worker are hot headed and are always clashing with each other. And supervisor likes to yell at people, I guess he thinks that if he yells more people will take him seriously. I was barely trained how to do the job and how to use the forklift, the person who was supposed to train me was a flake and barely showed up to train me. And even when he did show up he fairly trained me. And then they expect you to work fast even though you were barely trained. And some people display very unsafe practices with their fork lift.   "
bad,I wouldn’t recommend anyone to work at Fedex they over work you and they don’t pay you like you should be paid. Full time at Fedex does not mean anything at all
bad,"My job is to come in and scan freight up to 1500 to 2000 each day and load them in a can that will be move to a plane, or a truck. From time to time I would have to unload the can to load them in a truck if all the freight doesn't make it to the airplane."
bad,de 0 a 100 dou 40. Empresa muito boa mas a supervisão não valoriza o funcionario.
bad,"make sure you practice safe lifting techniques everyday or els your back is going to absolutely fried. I know its impossible to bend over and pick up every box the correct way, but trust me your back will thank you.  My area managers were either really supportive or really useless. They either help you and encourage you to do better, or they walk away and make you do a ton of extra work. Upper management sets unrealistic goals for the area managers and the stress just trickles down to the package handlers forcing them to either meet the demand or get sent away."
bad,"Busy, No day is ever the same, Great place to get your foot in the door,  and learn warehouse culture! Alot of room for advancement to learn, Good place to exceed!"
bad,FedEx does not discriminate against any applicants or employees. The work enivornment is open to all their employees interests and lifestyles. FedEx provides themselves on this.
bad,"Super productive, always something to be done, very physical, but not enough to live off you will definitely have to work a second gig while you're doing  unless you become a driver. On most sorts that takes a year to do."
bad,I started working with fedex 2months back & I found there is no growth of employee in this company & no hike in salary in future years. The benefits given by company is totally useless for their employees & sometime the senior staff is not co-operative they keep troubling the employee who is on the pickup or even in the station. This company extravagant their money on useless thing but can't hike the salaries of the employee.
bad,I believe FedEx is a great franchise to pursue a career. The environment is very fast pace and productive and the co-wrkers make you feel like family.
bad,"An overall good company. But the leadership is not intact. I was entitled to do team leads jobs, but was treated unfairly. I trained several successful people to make sure the job was done accurate and efficient with the integrity of what Fed Ex wants in a person."
bad,a typical day at FedEx is BUSY. Especially the beginning and end of the week. I learned to move fast and complete my task on a time matter. my co workers are great workers and even better team players.
bad,"to handel packages ,management was good and co-oprative,my co-workers were good , kind helpful , to pick up havey packages."
bad,"Fed Ex is a comfortable place for certain people, however the management there does need some work."
bad,The work while not hard was very rushed and the management was all over the place. Almost daily you will succumb to verbal abuse and you will not be happy with the money you make. The only benefit is the co workers who make it bearable and the free breakfast once in a while for complying with safety regulations.
bad,"I clock in at 2am, as soon as I punch the clock I am handed paperwork to begin unloading a trailer(s). I hop on my forklift and go to work. I've learned the in's and out's of the shipping industry. Management at this particular place seems a bit unfair and uncaring at times. My co-workers are a very diverse group. I get along with most everyone quite well, but there are a few that are always in a bad mood, or looking to get anyone in trouble for any reason. The hardest part of the job are the hours. Working nights adds stress to your body, not only physically, but mentally as well. It is hard to maintain a normal lifestyle working at night. (especially if you are also a full time student like me). The most enjoyable part about my job is that its easy to do. Yes hard physical labor is involved, but there are no overly complicated steps to do. It is a pretty easy to understand, straight forward job."
bad,A typical day is fast-paced. Moving packages with a team in a timely manner. The best part of the job could be that it's a workout.
bad,"Material Handler"
bad,they did not like to work while they was on the job especially the managers
bad,loved doing physical and easy to learn work. the only problem was management did not seem to care about my health and well being sometimes. he kept rushing me instead of letting me learn and adapt at my own pace. he demanded more than what the job required
bad,"Fast paced , nice people, nice work, excellent pay and safety first"
bad,I really like the job. I stayed busy an enjoyed everyday i went to work. my co-workers was very nice an out going. It was said when the business closed down.
bad,"Everyday was a new day with the same goal and mission, Making every experience a FedEx expererience."
bad,The company doesn't do a very good job of having a work/life balance for 3rd shifters. You will work 12 hour days 5 days a week without a lunch break. You cannot hire your own people. That is delegated to HR.
bad,learned a lot very quickly and enjoyed what I did and was good at what I did. Loved going in and gettting started without being told but didn't enjoy lazy co-workers because would end up having to help them do their work.
bad,A day at fedex is loading about 10 pallets on each side of the belt with two or more people carrying boxes ranged from 50 to 100 pounds and stacking neatly on the correct pallet.
bad,I did not enjoy working here. A box actually fell and I hired my ankle and the manager refused to send me home or document the injury and made me continue working. It’s still healing from a fracture after 2 months.
bad,It was alright they don’t care about you’re well being when I tried to call off for back pain they wasn’t trying to hear what was wrong with me more so if I’m using they insurance or not
bad,"Working here was an ok job for extra money or a 2nd job. During the time I worked there, I dont think work issues were properly resolved. There was a lot of discord, gossip, & rudeness among employees. Much of the time there wasn't extra help available doing tasks that required extra help. Work conditions are poor... no air during summer & no heat during winter, which can be quite uunbearable"
bad,The work was great! But not enough of it. It is very hard work but I enjoyed it. Couldnt make enough money to really pay for any bills and it is definitely a tiring job so it's not easy to go to another job to compensate pay.
bad,"Too many drivers not enough work!"
bad,"My typical day of work was long and hard."
bad,typical work day is getting all your packages scanned do a PRE trip on your truck checking lights and tires load up up your truck get all the necessary paper work then begin your route
bad,"It is grunt work. I recommend it as part-time work while you go to school or supplemental to another job. It is crazy hours, sometimes you start work at 11:45-12:00 AM and get out around 5-5:30. Work in all types of weather, correspondence courses, and you work in other departments until classes open for tug drivers."
bad,Makin sure all packages are assigned by its locstion. An also verify the location of the package. Makin sure it gets there on time. Very fast paste environment. Lots of body movement an lifting at all times.
bad,I worked the night shift at FedEx and I had to stand on the line all-day until my shift is over. It would be very hot some days and some days it feel very good. I learn my ids on the box and learn to put them on the right belt. My manager was ok but he always showed favoritism.
bad,"Ability to work in a fast-paced environment"
bad,"Loading, and unloading trailers making sure they go to the right place is all I really did. I learned that labor jobs like that are not really for me, the pay should be more in my eyes. Most of my co-workers were foreigners so it was kind of hard to make a connection with them. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the climate. The heat was sweltering sometimes making it hard to work. I worked with my older brother so that was the only up side to the job"
bad,"A typical day at work is Unpredictable depending on the freight received, I've learned how to do better work for the customer. Management is O.k. really depends on the person. The co-workers are nice. The hardest part of the job is managing your time which there is very little of."
bad,A typical day would to clock in left boxes or scan. I learned to be very fast. Management is young and energetic. Co-workers can be fun sometimes if you work with a lot of young people but sometimes you hate going to work. The hardest part is standing up all day and constant work. Its hard labor. Most enjoyable part is getting paid every friday. HEYYYYY!! but still its not a career job unless you plan on becoming a manager.
bad,When I got to work we had to go through security and clock in. After we clocked in we immediately started loading boxes into trailers. I learned how to load to trailer truck with boxes. My co-workers we OK people. The hardest part of the job was loading the boxes and scanning the boxes. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting water.
bad,The environment of the workplace was demeaning. It made me feel as if I was going to be stuck there forever. The employees were very moody and my job description didn’t match what I was actually doing.
bad,"My time at FedEx was well spent. Not only did I advance many of my professional traits that will serve me well in my future endeavors, but I learned how to be a leader inside and outside of the workplace."
bad,"you will work hard and its the same temperature as outside Winter/summer. If that's ok with you then cool but, its your back that will truly suffer from constant bending over for hours at a time."
bad,This company is fed ex incorporated it is contracted out and they pay you less money than the average fed ex employee and also you get no benefits. And you have to pick up packages that very heavy in weight
bad,Once you start work it can become overwhelming. Especially if you aren't use to those type of working conditions which is another reason why i decided to quit
bad,My thoughts about Fedex is that they are a great company to work for. You work with great people but it also comes with high demands and goals that must be meet everyday. I made my goals everyday and somedays I exceed my goals.
bad,Fedex is has a great benefits package. But Im leaving for a better opportunity and I want to go back to school.
bad,"I am going on three months at the Fedex Office Print Production Center in Kent, I must say this the the absolute most depressing job I've ever worked."
bad,I really enjoy working here but is an extremely fast paste environment almost unrealistic they want everyone work faster then the human body can but over all is a great company.
bad,Nice place to work I have good benefits to offer but not enough hours.Everybody work as a team. We Believe and the purple promises. Being a work at fedex u have to be on time...
bad,"Super fast work and dangerous but with a team"
bad,Got know what you doing. Know different between hot and cold truck scan package . upload trucks grateful pay paid train no unform u get Free stuff like a cup
bad,A typical work day at Fedex was always exhausting. I really don't have good things to say about this job so I'll keep it short. Management was horrible and treated there employers very unfair. Employers dreaded coming to work and everybody always complained about something. The energy at my workplace was always negative.
bad,Working at FedEx helps you get in shape if you ask me because we was lifting up to 75lbs every other 10mins putting the boxes in a cart behind or beside you.
bad,A typical work day you clock in loosing up and go to your station and start your work day off with at least 5-6 hours of straight work with no breaks. The growth in the company is horrible and the pay is horrible.
bad,"M/S. NAEL & BIN HARMAL HYDROEXPORT EST., AL AIN & ABU(Store Assit.&Driver)"
bad,"Working there is very team-oriented. However, the culture develops from the coworkers at FedEx is not team-oriented. Some will help, however lots of workers will leave you alone to suffer and do things alone."
bad,It is an okay workplace. The benefits are pretty good and the people that your are working with are usually in a decent mood to keep the work that you are doing fun.
bad,"Great management"
bad,"Im only 20 years old trying to pay bills and other living expenses. Getting paid 12.00+ an hour is a blessing, considering my age and the well known company. Only problem i have is having to drive 30minutes twice a day EVERYDAY only to work two hours in the morning and at nights (split shift). My $200 paycheck was basic only enough for gas and car insurance. I dont mind the hard work and labor, its just that im not recieving enough in return for what i put in."
bad,"Very few hours. You can go in to work and they send you home after 2 hours, with only 2 hours pay. There are lots of days they call and say don't come there is no work."
bad,"Short hours and not enough pay, boss was nice but as a company not good to workers need higher pay to live and survive on felt like a slave, other than that all was well."
bad,Heavy lifting and being on your feet a full 4-5 hours depending on what department you work in. It's hot in the summer time and cold in the winter. Benefits are great for just part time work and you can advance.
bad,Working at Fed Ex it was terrible I had to stay late for extra hours and my feet kept getting swollen. I really didn't like the way things was. It was hot where I was.
bad,A typical day at fed ex started at 4:30 am where i would either unload an 18 wheeler or load a fed ex delievery truck management was extra productive willing to help and find a way for you to feel comfortable with what you're doing its all about teamwork cause you have a time frame that has to be met everyday too bad my asthma will not allow me to work in that environment...
good,"You’ll have no life, work environment toxic . Over work you and then let you go when they don’t need you no more. Pretty much not worth it. I didn’t like the experience."
good,Worked for 5 yrs before asking for bonus gave me 10 cent raise  never called out unless needed expected to come in on days off to help out. Asking for help was by favorite or  lied to lol Fedex it’s self is good but contractor gave u nothing in return for running there company
good,"Job can be stressful depending on management. Training is fine, may take longer for others. Production is high for inexperienced works but manageable for new ones."
good,"Not an ideal place to work, but it was a job working as the Material Handler, just a fancy name for the entry-level position. Grunt work was more like it."
good,"They do work you. But, they seem they don't want to help you to improve you and the management just yells at you. Sadly they don't want you on the shift every long maybe 2-3 hours"
good,"Fedex has only one concern..""The delivery of the packages"" and nothing else takes precedence, not family, holidays or personal delima and there is little to no room for advancement!!!!!  Pay by the day not by the hour and no benefits makes the job of delivery driver a very unfriendly environment for family minded people.!!"
good,left because of poor management.  I was the only tech .  I performed an inspection of the entire conveyor system and repaired what needed attention.
good,Overall the experience has been great and I honestly love the job however I need something more long term.
good,"We start at 10.30pm on average. The manager is not always there. We unload about 3 planes, break for awhile, and 2 departing cargo planes. We end at about 3-4am."
good,"Shipping & Receiving, fast paced, and a great way to get exercise"
good,A great job for a person that is in school or in between jobs.  Just a fun place to work.
good,I made sure everthing was sent off with the right codes to the right city
good,"Day starts at 5:30, load van, get paperwork, drive to first destination ( this takes between 2-2 1/2 hrs. deliver to mostly residential and some businesses. day ends after last delivery, then commute home. most people have 45 minute or more commute home. usually done between 5 and 6 at night. great co-workers, not so great management."
good,"fast paced, very busy work enviornment. requires alot of standing, bending, and walking. always something to do."
good,Little pay for hard work. Lack of hours weekely hardly got over 15 hours a week.
good,Throw them away! Just throw them all away. The interview was super easy because they don’t care about your skills or what you bring to the table they just want you to move boxes. They don’t care about your personal life or family time. They over work you and have the NERVE to be stingy about the pay. I will never go back there again...
good,I love working there but the manager was not Nices to me I came the work on time and did I my job well you cant ask them any the talk nasty to you I was cold no one told me you need to wear a coat it was hard getting in the place they wanted you to be on the floor a decent run e but from the time you come in you have to go to all these places to get this and that you didn't have any one to ask were you are to go so you got to your station late
good,"La empresa buena, sueldos muy castigados, pero lo peor es la mafia que existe en los gerentes de operación, pésimos todos ellos MUGA"
good,Since I worked for a contractor I was on call and I could not come into work as often as I needed to. Some weeks it would feel like I didn’t even have a job so it’s best to jobs like this when the company is in peak season.
good,"Not all managers are bad managers just a few it’s face paced , messy, hot, no lunch breaks, get written up for having a medical emergency, get written up for being a min late or not stretching"
good,"A typical evening at work would be, punch in, do your errand and go to your area, and work then go home or go to lunch. What I learned as a package handler means working as a package handler you have to do, any and all jobs from loading and unloading trucks, to watching the belts all the way to smalls, and out the door. Your nothing unless your management or upper. It is extremely hot and extremely cold with no air or heat, also there is dirty conditions, and don't care about the employees, and work your butt off mostly. Everything is hard, except for walking out the door at the end of the job. None is enjoyable."
good,"Normal basics is okay some days or better than other , the managers really don't help or care about anything they play favoritism but there crew is very nice and helpful especially their trainees"
good,Work can be demanding early morning shift some workers slow its a big rush to load trucks can be hot in summer months cold in winter months ok for a part time job flexible shifts so u have choices with hours
good,I was a delivery driver. the new contractor didnt know what he was doing. You need to have a contractor who will stand up for you. The pay was good . No benefits
good,It's a good job temporary but you will bust your butt. It's very physical and demanding. You have to be on point to make your manger happ. He is your god lol
good,They expect you to just automatically know all of the rules without ever having explained them all to you clearly due to the rush to train and send new drivers on their own onto routes.
good,At the oak park location there is no organization. They over work all the hard working people and never send help when it's needed. It's just a very stressful place to work at!
good,Only was started out with part-time work just graduated from college and in need of job with full benefits. The job required you to go in early morning shift which I didn't mind at all but the benefits was not there.
good,this place was very crazy and very unorganized! managers were not on the same page at all. very bad work ethic in this place. no team work was really displayed at all.
good,My job was to Load and unload trucks with mail. Its very easy to pick up and a super fast pace. But the place wasn't supportive in management and your job is always on the line.
good,I love my actual job meeting new people or seeing my favorite stops on a daily basis. Love seeing the countyside Monday thru Friday..not may people can say their office is like mine.
good,"Fast pace work enviroment"
good,"Home-delivery/Ground are contractor owned routes. Which creates a bad dynamic between employer and employee. Pay is decent but not great considering how long they will keep you out. 12-14 hour days with no concern for personal life. no room for error, no job security, one mistake and you are fired."
good,"I like the work as a ""smalls"" associate.  The work is fast paced, lots of noise so time to sit around and gossip which is good.  The people I work with are for the most part really great, always a few sour apples.  Management is pretty much out of the picture unless there is a problem.  The hardest part of the job is never knowing if there is going to be enough work or if you are going to be sent home.  The best part is getting through the rush of work that usually comes the last two hours of the shift."
good,"the management staff did not"
good,good job but not worth it if you have a family to go home to at night
good,"This is a contractor position, so benefits and advancement is no available."
good,i deliver over 100 stops a day and havent called off once in almost 4 years and i still cant get a raise
good,Fed ex was pretty good operated 24ft commercial truck for 6 years i worked for a contractor who had terrible business management who cause his contact to be terminated and me loosing a job
good,Excessively overworked even after being injured on the job.
good,3 to 5 hours of work everyday. I learned how to work ina hostile environment . Management could have been much better. Co workers were fair . The hardest part of the job was the labor. The most enjoyable part was the end of the day.
good,"Where do I start. I worked on a salary pay, which was good. But I worked on a route that kept me out for up to 15 hours a day, hounded by the boss for doing an almost impossible route. Route was known not to have anybody stay on it. Worked in a truck that wasn't legal. No benefits, almost was never home. Was fired due to shady / made up reasons since I have never seen or signed off to any paperwork."

Route was known not to have anybody stay on it. Worked in a truck that wasn't legal. No benefits, almost was never home."
good,The job was OK. But it was through contractors. No advancement or benefits.
good,Go to work and sometimes not get 2 hours due to trucks not coming in on time. Long way to travel for no hours. Co-workers were alright.
good,more full time postions and managment needs to stop talking down on workers
good,"When I first started at this job, everyone worked together to achieve what was expected of us.  Team playing was great.  Now that the facility is closing in April, no one really cares and is worried about our future with Fedex."
good,"This company was an amazing company to work for 20 years ago.  Now it’s all about the Shareholders.  Women are paid substantially less than their male counterparts and family time is much less.  The company always comes first.  The customers are the best part of the job. Discrimination is prevalent and never addressed.  Think hard about wanting to work here, especially if you are a female."
good,The only real benefit I received working at FedEx as a package handler was an extreme amount of exercise on a regular basis. I lost 115 pounds on the back of the truck.
good,"My truck was loaded every morning with all my packages."
good,once your at the job you would organize your truck. You would organize by putting your packages from first to last stop. once you were done loading your truck you would go to your route. the hardest thing about the job is that your doing a lot of heavy lifting.
good,"on a typical day, the manager is always in a bad mood."
good,This job sucks. they expect you to have no life just work all the time. And be worked to death so dont work for FedEx Ground. You dont get benefits or insurance cause you work for a contractor not FedEx.
good,It is a work place that can use some upgrade. Where they put the money in to the workers and the work environment instead of upper management pockets.
good,not a bad place to work if your ok with no paid vacations or holidays or raises. job is very demanding on the drivers who deliever. bosses don't take care of there employees with any type of benefits at all just a check every week that is not enough to get insurance.
good,"Simply Put, The wrong leadership team was in place while being an employee here.They also played favorites with the younger women that were employed there"
good,"This work can be ""Work/life balance can be challenging at times,""Long hours, last minute changes to schedule"" Sometimes operations could be more efficient."
good,"Overall a great place to work. it has decent pay and great benefits, and if you have a good boss then you may like it. Unfortunately it a has a very poor work life balance"
good,Management all need fired and replaced. Management will treat you unfairly and not care if you or your property is threatened. Highly disappointed and will be looking for a different job.
good,A typical day at work involved loading and unloading of trucks without the use of equipment. Fast paced sorting and heavy lifting. Hours were typically overnight.
good,The employees are culturally insensitive and sexually inappropriate and management does not address these behaviors which is why work place violence is so prevalent in this company.
good,Manager's are completely lost when it comes to understanding the needs of current employee's. There are times where managers lack compassion and corporate seem to be disconnected.
good,Wouldn't recommend this position to anyone. Contactors are slow to handle responsibilities concerning work vehicles and employees. Extreme physical labor.
good,I have been employed with FedEx Trade Networks for 11 years and while I love my job the environment in which i work is not a pleasant place as the favoritism is overwhelming
good,"I was typically one of the first drivers at the terminal, and I ran a route of 120-150 stops per day. My immediate supervisor never had any complaints nor disputes on my route. The management lacks training. A typical day at work was enjoying interacting with all my customers. The hardest part of the job was loading into the vehicle and waiting for the rest of the freight to come in. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with all my regular customers."
good,"Conferia a carga, bipava os volumes e liberava os caminhões, montava-mos lote para entrega no dia seguinte. Meu melhor aprendizado foi a o trabalho em grupo e a união que existia entre nois. Meu grupo de trabalha era muito bom, o que eu não possa falar da liderança que não tinha nenhum perfil de comando, se tratando do gerente que não tinha nenhuma experiencia para o cargo. Gerente e Encarregado não tinham nenhum perfil para a função era a parte mais difícil do trabalho. A melhor parte era a união do pião que todos nos eramos e desdobrava-mos para concluir o trabalho da melhor maneira possível, existia uma combrança entre nois de evitar erros e mesmo assim não eramos reconhecidos."
good,the hours where not even worth coming in for we where lucky to get 12 hours a week management was very un organized and gave little to no trsining before throwing you into the job
good,"Unloading volume of boxes from trailer"
good,20 to 25 outbound calls a day. No room for advancement unless you will move. Departments do not work well together and do not keep you informed. Insurance benefits self funded and not very good.
good,"Very family and friend orientated.  All employees are friends or a least friendly to one another.  Managers aren't the best, but the employees are pretty much self - sufficient."
good,"The workplace is not made for younger folks, typically most employees are in their upper 40s.  nobody talks to one another, everyone body was to themselves.  Pay sucked, no room for growth - there were people 6 years + in the same position."
good,They do not respect personal boundaries and the fact that you may have other comittments. What you sign up for is not what is deleivered. The management is all over the place and no one is on the same page. Managers feel as if they can talk to people however they feel and make it known that they can fire you at any moment. Even if you are moving slow because you are tired and need a drink of water.
good,Terminal manager is great person to work for.  He works as hard as his employees under him; never orders or demands people to do things.  Treats his employees fair.
good,"Over the time i have been with FedEx,I have learnt that good things come to those who wait."
good,After half of my line got fired things were ugly and we had boxes everywhere and no help I wanted to quit but needed the money.
good,Fedex is a good company. The contractor i work for is not very good to work for. A typical work day is 10-12 hrs and you don't get paid overtime. The co-workers were good but the management is terrible. The hardest part of my day is getting done only to have someone call saying they need help. The most enjoyable part of my day is when I got in my vehicle to go home.
good,"When asked for full-time hours, they cut hours. The pay is not enough for the multiple positions being held by one person. Also, the reputation is negative due to poor customer service. It leaves some employees having to work much harder to make the customers happy after management has made them angry."
good,"This was a great job. "
good,"i enjoyed my time at FEDEXand i have learned a lot from the staff, i enjoyed working with the staff and most of all i loved helping the customers that came to our store, i enjoyed that i could make there shopping experience a great one  *******************************************************************************************************************"
good,"Ambiente dinâmico, com forte pressão, sendo assim obtive muita experiência e cresci no ambiente, pois é na pressão que aprendemos a testar nossa capacidade de liderar e solucionar os problemas."
good,"Unload packages from semi trailers on to conveyor line, Learned how to sweat and get dirt in my eyes.  Coworkers were cool to get along with and manager was cool as well.  Hardest part was getting up at 2am and driving back while falling asleep behind the wheel at 7 in the morning.  Most enjoyable was the workout.  IT is labor intensive and i lost lots of weight."
good,load trucks and drive the route delivering packages to homes and bussinesses
good,Working for this company as a student is great they have fabolous benifits and loans. The only thing i didnt like you cannot work full time.
good,"Busy, no set hours. Consitant work load. Management was ok."
good,"ALots of hard work"
good,"check in driver pickup/deliver receipts, mostly data entry and answering phones.  management is not that great. co-workers are lazy.  nothing hard about the job, pretty simple work."
good,It was a part of ongoing education developing a whole new aproach about how to deal with the customer/ or with the public.
good,"lobor time tasking job.....weather conditions apply ...gas n toll"
good,It starts at about 7am and usually does not end until 6pm.  Very people oriented.  I love meeting new people and I love the people that I work for.   
good,"It is your business working with FedEx Ground or Home Delivery. You own your truck and route, takes money to get in. You pay for gas, maintenance, taxes. $70K a year is really $35K a year when you pay for expenses."
good,negative place to work... didn't work everyday. no lunch periods.. low pay. worked overtime with little pay no breaks. the team was bad.
good,"they pay well. if you work the dock, dont expect many hours. they favor the drivers. also, there are NO insurance benefits for dockworkers. when Fed-Ex bought out our company, they took away the insurance, monthly incentive program, etc."
good,great for pt work treated ok conditions vary in all weather no room for advancement which is unfortunate
good,my time with fed ex was short.. it was a good opportunity for me but overall i would prefer a more promising job
good,A typical day at fedex consisted of scanning in packages and loading your truck with anywhere from one hundred to three hundred stops per day. Then went out to deliver packages to commercial and residential locations. Enjoyed the job because it was fast paced and I was always moving to do something.
good,i love workinf for fedex but my boss at the time made it very difficult for me to remain at that location
good,"I think the major thing is If i was starting out of college this culture would work better for me , but i feel like where i have grown in my skills even just as an employee is beyond this stage."
good,"basically you work for a contractor with no benefits you work hard for no money you do excellent job but they still lay you off.Basically its job if you need some money,some people are rude to you and customers that you deliver to.You ride around in a rental truck either budget or penske which makes you look unprofessional."
good,"Uma empresa que não tem plano de carreira,a única coisa boa são os benefícios,ambiente de muito estresse"
good,Work is physical. Pay is okay however you do work for an independent contractor who in most cases does not offer any benefits. Few holidays off with no pay.
good,"Pretty easy job, stay focused,and work hard it'll soon pay off. Theirs not much room for you to advance to with the company. Things are always changing within the company especially if you work for a contractor."
good,"This all pertaining to fedex ground:"
good,U S Fedex is great place but in Australia it’s just another company full of wanna be managers. Some of the coordinators were bullying and most of them he Ausis are all lazy. They just do as less as possible and talk about others only.
good,Managment is a joke you get over worked and the managent does not appreciate anyones hard work very few managers know what they are doing there would not reccomend working here really hard work for very little pay i have been here almost a year and my back is already starting to give out
good,"I feel as though they should put more on the table for their employees, more pay for what they have us doing, teach us and have us build for other job opportunities in the company of fedex"
good,FedEx does not pay well when it comes to Yard switchers. Management is emotional and work the employees hard. It is basically high school in this warehouse.
good,You work either Monday through Friday or Tuesday through Saturday.   Hours are very inconsistent. You drive for independent contractors not fedex so benefits vary same with the way you are paid it's either salary or hourly either way it's not enough money for how many hours worked.
good,Bad place to work management only help drivers and hours are terrible no life hard to socialize and no chance on moving up in the wharehouse only thing good is the wharehouse team
good,"surprisingly very cut throat...you had to be part of the gang if you wanted to go any hire up in the company, or just be able to do your job efficiently..."
good,"Manager scared me by ripping a Gaylord in half.  I had no training and was instructed by another employee. Violence in the work place I thought was wrong. FedEx never did anything to my knowledge. I had to quit, this manager isn't good for this position."
good,"Management constantly was changing routes without notifying employees before hand. Took 13 weeks to set up direct deposit, it was difficult to get uniform items as well. Packages were seldom done being sorted at 7, the time they are supposed to be done."
good,"I enjoyed driving and serving my customers ,never had a bad day, just a lot of challenging days. I liked my co-workers,which created pleasant work enviroment."
good,"Fun work places, but bad management. No benefits, no insurance, no paid vacation, income not good, but still fun ppl to be around, everyone get along with the co-workes but in terms of benefits there isn't any, you can't manage your priorities with the income, and that definitely need to change."
good,"Would be a great place to work, but the supervisors are only out to move up in their position, and don't care who they hurt in the process. You can be an excellent employee, come to work on time and in bad weather but  if for example they don't like your looks, then you are gone.  They never pay unemployment!"
good,"Working in this type of industry, you have to be able to keep up and do the work.  Sometimes it's hard but if your trained correctly, then each day gets easier."
good,good job as a driver good exercise good costumer service and also greeting and good pay with a great vacation on holidays also good supervisors with a good attitude
good,"was hired through temp agency on the 2nd shift maintenance team at EG1 when it was Genco, was moved to EG3 building. good co-workers & management. Not enough electrical & troubleshooting experience for them to keep me, But was a great job that I loved & miss.  After being put in other bldg by myself it was hard to get help on the 2nd shift and it was looked down upon if I needed it."
good,"Busy loading trucks "
good,"No benefits. Long hours. Management less than desirable. Pay is not equal to the amount of work. Home delivery and Ground is together now, you have more miles, more deliveries and pickups and no more money."
good,In this job I was a handler and promised a promotion by a manager that not only didnt keep his word but wasnt at the job half the time. This job is not to be taken lightly it is alot of work in a small period of time.
good,I loved doing this work but the pay check realy stinks. If you worked there 2 weeks or 2 years you get paid the same. No raises no benifits. You have nothing to advance too!
good,When you are driving for Fedex you are working for a privet contractor.  Has a driver you have no outlet.  There is no room for advancement. The only goal is to one day become a contractor your self.
good,working at fedex home is for sure steady work not a bad job not really anything hard about it meet a lot of awesome people just not enough money and no insurance or benefits
good,"This company seems to disregard contractor relations and poorly manages the pre-load operations."
good,"I worked for FedEx Smart Post for 5 years. It left a sour taste in my mouth. I do have to thank FedEx Smart Post, they put a really bad beat down on me.  I experienced racial slurs and jokes of bad taste from upper management. The cream of the crop. They held no moral values whatsoever . Thanks to my bad experience at Fed Ex Smart Post I went back to college. I know have Bachelor's degree. While employed there I was passed up on many promotions. I broke records and produced figures upper management along with their engineers only dreamed about. Time after time........ I will leave it at that."
good,"It really depends on what subcontractor you work for.  Some are better than others."
good,"Very physical labor, and if you don't like being told what to do by 20 year olds- this is not the job for you. A handful of the managers were pretty nice, but there are a few with sticks up their bums. If you need a job fast, this is where to go- but hours aren't dependable even if you're fulltime unless it's peak season.Co-workers were really cool, I enjoyed most of them. The hardest part of the job would have to be the lifting ( these boxes go 100+ lbs) and moving FAST, the boxes usually don't stop so be prepared to be overwhelmed with work at times. I enjoyed the paid time off the most, other than that the job was freezing/super hot so you're usually uncomfortable."
good,I have been working at Food/Customer service positions since I worked at Fed Ex. Fed Ex was a military ENVIRONMENT! Please find me a better job at a better location!
good,"Deliver packages throughout the day in rain, sleet, or snow. I liked I kind of had my own hours. Start when I want the faster you worked the earlier you were off, most days 3:30pm. Hardest part was the weather conditions, to hot or snow still had to work. Most co-workers are easy to get along with and talk to for help."
good,Typical Day/Night At FedEx Was Too Come In Around 2:30Am Start Separate The Packages And Sorter Them Too There Lane And Load Them Too a Specific Truck In A Really Fast Paced Speed And Have Them Loaded By 8:30 When The Drivers Start There Delivery Routes.
good,"Needed more one on one interactions with their employees, Needed more benefits and incentives for the employees. When I was initially hired I was told I was hired for a different position with different hours. I work only part time, and many things were not happening that I was told would be."
good,"every night is the same too much work not enough time or employees. "
good,Love my job but working for the same pay no matter if its 50 or 70 hours and having no family time is just not working out. For the job that I do and the pace at which I do it safely in I would expect to be working less hours instead of more
good,This job is very demanding and physical. It has long hours and its alot of heavy lifting and running to deliver packages. the pay is ok but there is no over time and no benefits
good,"Moving and sorting boxes of all types and sizes and weight, yet the pay does not compensate for that type of labor, and one has to work an entire year to produce qualifying hours to receive the health benefits and little higher pay. Promotions are very hard to come by, no recognition for individual effort in professional conduct, timely and punctual show ups and loyalty."
good,Managers were not trained to be a manager that takes advise from employees on the phones. I would not work for FEDEX Customer Service again.
good,"I am an energetic, ambitious individual, who always strives to achieve the highest standard possible, at any given task."
good,FedEx was the hardest job I have had. FedEx give great pay but the work is xtreme.
good,the type of people who were there had positive attitudes but to me the staff/managers  were raciest
good,Not something you can retire off of. No benifits or retirement. Great working enviroment.
good,"Drove, on an average, over 400 miles a day (regardless of weather conditions)."
good,"Senior Manager and some of the Office Staff made it uncomfortable to come in each day not knowing what the mood would be."
good,"Chaos with frequent changes made with changing priorities almost hourly."
good,I enjoyed driving and getting involved with customers. I worked at my own pace.
good,I get a thrill out of driving and meeting customers. Loading/unloading trucks is ok.
good,"The best thing about working for Fedex was the driving time. I was alone in my cab and was the boss on the road. Once I exited the truck and made my way into a facility, it all changed. Co-workers and management were almost all the time miserable. And that's mainly because Fedex did not care very much about its employees, especially their drivers. Yes the pay was good, but policies made going to work hard for all employees. Constant changes in their policies and lots of cut backs were just annoying. I got a CDL to drive trucks, and my first choice to work was Fedex. Once I got in it was great! I looked forward to go to work everyday. Then came corporate changes. That started a downward spiral. After 7+ years of working the overnight hours, driving 400+ miles a day, I called it quits. But I did not resign because of my job duties. I loved driving on the road. It's the reason why I got a CDL. The decision was made due to working overnight hours. From day 1 at Fedex all I did was come in at around 8pm, and worked all the way to about 8am (sometimes 10am) the next day. That took a toll on me and my family. But constant policy changes and major cutbacks played a big role in helping me decide to resign."
good,they have forgotten the reason they are in business their customers
good,Challenging work experience but easy work. Bad management. Being there 3 years with no advancement because management had their picks and chooses.
good,I learned how to sort packages to the right destination. The hardest part was not being recognized for my hard work and how much of a team player I was.
good,"I enjoyed going to work, even though it was graveyard shift, but I wasn't rewarded opportunity wise for my performance. Some places it's who you know not what you know. Management didn't respect their open door policy for improvement suggestions. What I enjoyed most was the visual recognition for my outstanding performance."
good,"Load truck ,Pre Trip on truck,check your maninifest for stops average (100) per day"
good,typical day is 10 hours plus....starts with loading the truck for the day...then delivering the packages to the route
good,doesnt care about employees at all. very strict and wants to cut employees when possible.
good,Worked with really nice people.
good,"very poor no benefits,and they dont offer any thing fun/or good for doing your job 100 percent"
good,Boa. Porém não temos qualidade de vida e trabalho sobre constante ameaças de demissão.
good,"Depends on the contractor you work for, the type of route you get, if they offer benefits and how much they're willing to pay you. Peak season can be difficult."
good,Job is for young person in college or young people just starting to work in a job. Not alot of hours and pay sucks crazy hour at weird times management works the dog 5h!t out of you
good,"Empresa  muito boa para trabalhar porem a gestão deixa a desejar, cumpre com suas obrigações em dia bons benefícios  etc"
good,"I love doing the job duties; but this is a production job and you are required to reach your file per hour or constantly be threatened with being terminated. The Manager and Team Leaders can not be trusted. They undermine their employees and laugh at their failures. None of them are leadership material. The pay is fair for the job, benefits are excellent, time off could be better. Same routine everyday!"
good,It's a back breaking kind of job. have to be ready for anything. expect the unexpected. Sometime customers are really rude and makes you reevaluate why you do work as a driver.
good,Fed Ex is run by sub contractors so the benefit packages are slim. Was only there helping out for the Christmas season. Not a bad job to have around the holidays.
good,"Not really worth it if you want to be a driver. They are all privately owned contractors. Everybody's out for themselves. If you need a job in a pinch they are always hiring. If you can go somewhere else, go."
good,"Aprendi muito sobre logística, pessoas e gestão nesta empresa."
good,"While working there for 7 months, I was exposed to dangerous business practices,  spoofer promised on amount of hours provided, and very little opportunity for advancement. The company is very unorganized, and supervisory staff does not speak to one another one promise"
good,"During the year it's not too bad, season which starts right after November it gets really hectic and busy there's a lot of packages that we work well as a team management isn't really that well and the vehicles are really well maintained we do inspect them daily we check them to make sure they're okay sometimes it takes a while for management to assess some of the problems it is what it is I guess, the pay is nice but there's no benefits oh, you're subcontracted so you're not even an employee of FedEx you work for a contractor"
good,"Quality of company employment depends on role fulfilled. Most business decisions are far-sighted, though not every department reflects this ethos. "
good,"One or two mess ups per week is understandable but to have package handlers constantly misloading packages every day gets to be tiring. The company themselves (I was contracted), loaded an extra day onto the route drivers starting in 2019 without asking a soul. Many people walked when they saw how little FedEx cared about them or their personal lives. I stayed for as long as I could but something seems fishy with the company as of late... like they are losing money and forcing drivers to take amounts of deliveries that could potentially put a mark on you in DOT hours in a given week. OSHA regulations are also often overlooked at the terminals because of high demand of parcel moving in any given day. people would often trip, slip, or fall because FedEx would unload several trailers and there literally wouldn't be enough space to walk on the walkways by the conveyor belt. The actual company also had a bad habit of loading broken items on my truck without inspection, leading me to take the blame if they could spin it that way."
good,Not a career just a stepping stone until u find a career. No safety committee. U fend for yourself. Hard work long hours no benefits no Wk life balance exhausted ok money
good,Hard to get a full time position; Have to work with slow and lazy workers; Turn over rate is terrible; Some managers are clueless about their jobs; Some managers say they want to help you grow and move up in the company but they really are looking out for themselves - will not help you move up in the company if you are a good employee; Some employees do not engage in good hygiene practices
good,Every morning you'd come in and begin to load the truck with packages. Then we would have a meeting about everything wrong we've done on the road the previous day.
good,Be prepared to work extremely early in the mourning & Learn your truck as fast as possible. It's also somewhat physically demanding. If you cant move fast while loading your truck ( with some packages being considerably heavy) while catching packages for the people next to you then it's probably not your thing.
good,"Poor quality work environment, not willing to train for advancement, poor management, didn't learn much, poor workplace culture, poor pay, but did have good benefits."
good,"It is a very easy job but management does take advantage of package handlers. Between cancelling shifts entirely the day of to sending people home voluntarily and leaving the floor understaffed, its very frustrating. The wrong people get promoted and the people there who are toxic see no reprimands."
good,"enjoyable nothing , people talk to much instead of doing the job , fights happen , managers are bad and want you there always even on your days off, bad hours and pay"
good,It's a good job for people needing to obtain job history and experience. The training is not very good. It is not close to what is really required on the floor.
good,"Improvement in management is definitely needed.  In my judgment, there are no protocols in place should an emergency occur.  It happened to me when I got stuck in the snow.  FedEx does not have any all-wheel drive vehicles."
good,This job is very overwhelming!!! Too much for a women to do. To much moving around and no consistency... managers are hard on workers that are willing to work
good,"answering incoming calls while converting ups customers to start shipping with fedex. customer service is always needed, the hardest part of the job is convincing customers why they should ship with fedex"
good,if you are looking to be stuck at work 24/7 and not have a life outside of work or remember what the sun looks like this would be the ideal job. the compensation is nice if you work the max 12 hour days...
good,It would be a good place to work if they allowed you to work a full day. A lot of the workers are allowed to stand around while some are pushed to do more than their fair share.
good,"It was a part time job, when they didn’t have enough work they would send people home and there was no type of order. Some of the managers were greate"
good,"Checking and picking stock for dispatching."
good,"Had to be very energetic to work here , fast paced job . Very strong if not you will mess your body up , need a lot of sleep , always working . Very noisy"
good,Its consistent enough to for someone coming out of high school or for use as a part-time job. The only reason im still there because it is consistent.
good,"Loved the nature of the job hated how it was managed forced to do more work than in the time available, managers listen but forget what you say when you leave the office, pay is decent but your never home unless your a favorite and get a cushy route and home early everyday. Its unfortunate as I really did love my job..."
good,"Typical day involved loading airplanes with an emphasis on time.  Hourly employees are a joy to work with, however the managers are unprofessional.  Benefits are good but the pay was lacking."
good,It’s ok if you like stress. They don’t really have your back. It’s all about what benefits the company. They really take a lot of control about some decisions away from local management. There is a playbook for every situation and that is what’s followed regardless the situation
good,"Hard to get a head with the competetiveness. My biggest complaint is not realizing the work put in.  Upper management is not supportive, front line management is great."
good,"long day of work with tons of packages to be delivered with only 2 other people on the truck including the driver. hardest part was working with 1 other person, most enjoyable part was walking around learning the area you delivered in."
good,"Não gostei de trabalhar na empresa, porque os gestores não se comunicam com os funcionários; mesmo assim aprendi varias funções, o ambiente e colegas de trabalho nem todos são agradáveis."
good,Workload was not balanced and opportunities were not given based on the original given standards and guidelines.  Management did not follow the appropriate HR standards set by FedEx when promoting or dissolving positions within the department.
good,"The routes at FedEx are owned by contractors. If you get a good contractor, I'm sure it's a great place to work. My contractor never took care of the trucks, so I was driving a Budget truck. My route was out in the country on dirt roads, and Budget trucks don't have 4 wheel drive. When it rains, I was told that I still had to go out in an unsafe truck and the manager would lie about helping and then just leave the packages he was going to take so I'd have to take them the next day. There are certain codes you use for an issue with deliveries, and the contractor gets charged depending on which codes you use. I was told to use incorrect codes just so the contractor didn't have to pay the fees, but that messed up the process that the packages were supposed to go through and caused more problems out on route for me."
good,"Overall the company does seem as focused on its people and treating them well. There is a high focus on numbers and profit and although they say safety is first and people are second while profit is 3rd, it is opposite."
good,Managerial support and development changed from developmental and training to arbitrary and disassociated. I did not feel this change reflected a successful career course or employee driven environment anymore.
good,"Can't live off of this position. It's part time. some days it's work and some days it's a couple of hours. need 40 plus hours at this stage. No one cares, everyone just put in a spot and expected to know the job. I'm older and a rehire. The training is pitiful."
good,Delivering packages was easy. The overall organization and management culture was very cold and distant. I enjoyed the route I ran but back at the terminal it was stressful and disorganized.
good,This is a great job that will hire you in an instant. It is a great job for people who are just trying to get back into working. I will say that the work environment is very dirty and hot with no a/c. The work gets very hard sometimes and the managers will push your body to the limit.
good,Loading my truck anywhere from 120 packages to 140 packages by myself. I learned I'm a hard worker regardless of the jobs I have and don't get treated fairly as I know as I should. The manager was a manager that you tell him something one day and the next day doesn't remember it. Work place culture was fast pace and stressful. Hardest part of the job is dealing with ungrateful customers that don't care about your well being and more about their product. The most enjoyable part was getting my paycheck.
good,"Good place to work, but not enough hours. There's no room for advancement and there are no holiday pay for part timers. This is a great place to work for people looking for supplementary income."
good,It was a very fast paced environment.  When I worked there all the people were very pleasant. They would sometimes have employee cookouts after work. The problem was it was only part time.
good,"They have amazing insurance but if your hurt yeah they pay for it all but if your out to long your fired. Was injured on one of their planes took a week and half of leave with physical therapy, came back and was let go. Your constantly working splits, slept in the parking a lot during  holidays."
good,work load is heavy at times and weather conditions are extreme some times. With texas heat it can at times wish you had an office job but overall it pays the bills.
good,"Fast pace, volume driven. Hiring only temporary for material handling. Not a place I would want long term, but served my need at the time. Nice people to work with."
good,Hi am looking to work for a good company that cares about there employees and respect s hard and dependable s workers FedEx does not ack like there care about me as a employee.
good,I liked getting paid weekly but I worked for Fed Ex Ground. They were contracted companies no benefits no raises and to many stops a day no breaks hard on your body.
good,"Esta empresa comprou a antiga Rapidao Cometa, acredito que não havia introduzido as suas politicas. Pois não percebeu-se a organização e a agilidade esperadas de uma empresa multinacionaldo porte da    FedEx."
good,Will not work with your schedule. If you have children good luck trying to go to any of their school events or get time off for their birthdays--won't happen.
good,"Actual work was very enjoyable. When out making deliveries and meeting new people daily was exciting. Bad part of job was being an independent contractor, which meant no benefits at all, while being treated like an employee."
good,Management depends on your personal contractor. The terminal manager doesn't even know your name. The terminal doesn't have to explain anything to you as far as how late or early you will be on the road making some mornings very frustrating. Hard to plan a solid schedule around because there are to many variables.
good,Management needs improvementWas a pleasant and comfortable interview. Asked questions off their interview sheet and did two basic math knowledge tests. I was asked about previous experience and skills. The job opening was explained along with duties and shift hours very well
good,While I was employed with FedEx there were numerous employees including myself and my wife that had been injured and they did not care sometimes they did not even report the accidents. They managers were very careless within their positions. still have a claim open with them on my injury.
good,"A typical day is being at work for 6:a.m. Tuesday thru Saturday and you have no set time to get off  Its a very strenuous and busy environment,.very long hours. Co-workers are friendly as well as helpful. Tha hardest part of the job is lifting  packages weighing 75 pounds are more  with no help. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing your customers and enjoying maybe a brief conversation with them."
good,Operations ran smoothly. They pay isn't great for the amount of work that needed to be done. Upper management doesn't have an understanding of the operation. High turnover with associates.
good,"O trabalho é bem tranquilo, as vezes que a demanda de trabalho aumenta, mais mesmo assim é bom para trabalhar."
good,"The job is easy enough to become accliamated to. Load the truck, attempt to deliver all the packages, and bring the truck back to the terminal."
good,"productive fast working pace"
good,"fedex was only a part time job"
good,FedEx is a fast pace highly stressful working environment. It takes a very special individual to be able to work in this kind of field as it is unforgiving and accountability is VERY high. Managers for this company are treated like the bottom of the barrel.
good,This company was a little to fast paced for me with my health issues. They gave me a run around when I tried to reapply with a medical certificate stating I could not lift heavy objects.
good,"Like the pace, didn't like the hours, needs to be climate controlled, needs higher pay for work done, has many shift yet doesn't fit a ""family"" life"
good,This was my first time working for a major company as well as a warehouse. There could have been betters days but overall I had an okay start.
good,"•	Load, unload, sort, pick-up and deliver packages"
good,A typical day consists of an area of 20 or more people who are assigned a job which all boils down to around 3 to 5 people who actually do their job. The manager is more hard on the people that do their job than the ones that leave early everyday and don't hit their rates.
good,"it was ok for a short time, then the checks did not clear the bank and more, I am not saying all the FedEx are like that but this Franchise was."
good,The manger didn't have a clue how to deal with employees also he told me I would be getting full time and I was only getting 20 plus hours a week
good,"Honestly I can say FedEx is a great company but contractors ruin it. Never made it to union because there isn't one however, I did enjoy running the streets showing off my impressive speed, strength and the best part of it all customer service. The pay could be better. I can't complain as I was the drivers helper. Now seems to be a fresh job for a teen finishing up at high school and needs to fill their pockets. My co-workers were lazy sadly and management wasn't too helpful in stabilizing my pay to the many hours on a strenuous job."
good,"In the beginning, I really did love my job. It's physical, but not mentally challenging. They stress safety. Management is cold hearted at times. I was terminated wrongfully due to the company always blaming its drivers for virtually everything that can go wrong, while holding everyone else harmless. Get 3 warnings and youre out, regardless of how well you perform. But it did pay well while it lasted. I just wish they had a place in their hearts for the humane part of the job. It's run like a machine, and treats us like machines. Cold, emotionless, policy. If you can deal with that and never being recognized for your contributions, then go for it."
good,"pretrip truck,stretch and flex .load and sort truck,leave and deliver.hardest part is to make all the timed deliveries.i enjoyed being alone and working by myself"
good,"As a rule my responsibility was stimulating and gratifying but compensation was predicated not upon performance but seniority. A typical day involved resolving issues and solving problems. "
good,"A typical day at work usually goes by fast, I learned to organize shipments by size and category . The management was okay, they lack hospitality, my first day at the job no one spoke to me. The co-workers were usually in gray moods because of how much physical energy was taking from the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was loading packages into the trailer."
good,FedEx is not for everyone. It is a very fast paced environment and good for anyone who is not currently qualified to move up to and get experience in management.
good,"All about production numbers to stay ahead of competitors. Not really into what your life is outside of work. Didn't like this job, but it got me experience I need to advance myself in other corporations."
good,"Fed Ex is a great company however i worked for a subcontractor and i would not recommend, I was approached last October for a seasoned job for Christmas. I was informed i would make no less than $120.00 a day and all my days would end by lunch time. At first i rode with a elder driver and they showed me how to do this job, It was very easy nothing difficult. They first few days by myself i was not paid for my full days work and even later i never received a full pay check the contractor always had some reason. My job would start with driving a budget rental truck to crestview every morning to load up my truck then come back to pensacola. When i got back i would start delivering. I did my job the best i could every day and made sure that i did all i could."
good,"While working at FedEx I had noticed that everyone was stressed out on a consistent basis. Tempers were always flaring and everyone was at each others' throats, usually because the management was not very good at setting up arrival times and departure times. Management in general had very little training and skills needed to be in a position of authority. A typical day would start off with a team meeting where w would discuss how many trucks we would have to unload and how many bills we would have to move as well as how we did the night before, then we would start working without stopping until all the freight was moved or our 6 hours was up. The hardest part of the job was the harsh winter but the most enjoyable part was working in the office billing."
good,"Emissão de notas fiscais, liberação de cargas, pagamentos de motoristas. Tratar com diversos sistemas. A gerencia sempre determinada a nos ajudar. Ambiente de trabalho agradável com ótimos companheiros de trabalho. Realizar testes em carros para descobrir se existem falhas. Grande aprendizagem na área de logística e comunicação via e-mail com outras filiais de todo Brasil."
good,I really enjoyed the job for the most part. At times the work is very strenuous due to all of the heavy lifting repeatedly. You have to maintain focus at all times. Mulit tasking is Key in this job. My most enjoyable part is the different routes that I drove. The routes are contract routes so they can come and go at anytime.
good,"good workmates,freindly management,the hardest part of day was when all wagons come in to unload."
good,I highly wouldn't recommend anyone to work here it was a very dangerous experience
good,It was not a good experience but it was a job. Diverse backgrounds
good,Over all the management was the main problem with this workplace. Other than a lack of proper management a daily routine wasn't very difficult to establish and follow through with.
good,"It's can be a hard and long day if you can properly lift heavy package."
good,"Fed Ex was a great company to get into and learn discipline, time management and fine tune my work ethic and customer relation skills. Management structure lacked organization which made problem solving fall more onto the individual employee, in which i relished the opportunity to prove my problem solving skills. The hardest part of the job was the weight threshold and how it increased drastically. The required weight to lift was 175 lbs and became difficult although not impossible for my surgically corrected shoulder. The most enjoyable aspect of the job was the freedom to make decisions and work throughout the day without heavy supervision."
good,"shift starts around 6pm and immediately get hammered with work and never stops until shift is over, learned a lot of office skills and dock work but high turnover rate because of stress, management is lazy and has ""favored employees"", job environment is survival of the fittest, very high responsibility with freight and hazardous material"
good,Sorting packages and loading into containers from 11:00pm till 2;30am in all weather conditions
good,"I consider myself a fairly intelligent and competent individual and no stranger to hard work. But loading some trucks were far more difficult that others. Training was not really all that great and most of the mgmt. had no clue or idea for the most part what they were doing. They did not help out when things were out of control. Boxes would come down the conveyor jammed packed and they would expect you to load 3 trucks with 0 errors. Many of the co-workers were very negative and had really nasty attitudes. The drivers would come in and get angry and curse you out because the way you're taught to load the truck doesn't coincide with how they want their truck loaded. That should never be allowed to happen. They had all of these signs up about intimidation and bullying...what a bunch of hypocrites."
good,"This was a great job for entry level positions"
good,I was able to go to school full time and work full time. This job was a great job. they were willing to work with your schedule outside of work.
good,No room for advancement. You're constantly on the go. Supervisors don't take the blame for anything.
good,"Load packages on my truck."
good,"A empresa  e  razoavel, digo isso porque nao e implementado a cultura Fedex ainda, tudo e  rapidao cometa,  entao existem vários ajustem a serem realizados em todas as áreas."
good,"Though FedEx is a reputable company, It wasn't necessarily the company for me. I have however, learned many useful skills personally, that i can easily utilize not only in my professional life but personal life as well. But, with the pay scale I received in comparison to the long hours I worked, I honestly just could not afford to put the agonizing physical and emotional strain on myself."
good,"Your must keep up a predetermined scan rate.  Learning was not rocket science, management were easy to talk to, co-workers were quiet and to themselves, bending, lifting, nothing enjoyable about the job."
good,good place to work meet alot people very good company to work
good,"•a typical day at work"
good,Not recommended at this time for employment. Company is cutting back in management positions.
good,Hard to move and not a lot of training. Hard to get out of work for anything.
good,"Basically the average driver will do 100-175 deliveries per day,Monday-Friday. That means 200-302 packages on your truck. Remember LOW PAY P.S. MANAGEMENT SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh not to mention if you dont work you dont get paid. YOU ARE AN SUB CONTRACTOR CAN BE LET GO AT ANYTIME"
good,"i would load packages on the right trucks , safely operated a forklift"
good,I have learnt a lot of information reg the products and selling skills but the hardest part is my manager who iam reported to him lastly he was a very cunning and selfish minded fellow he can put of of anybody for his welfare.
good,I started working for this company in Portland OR. I enjoyed this job. I moved up quickly and enjoyed all I did. I transfered to the Flint MI store in 2009. This store has the worst managment I have ever seen. The inconsistancy if how each of the team members are treated is horrible. the upper managment does nothing to correct this either. I lost my job while on maturnity leave. I had a previous child at the location in Washington and had no issues. The company it self I would recomend working for but the not the store in Flint MI.
good,The job is demanding but the work is very easy. Its mainly the shift you pick and it only benefits you if your a college student.
good,"normally very busy days, management is poor, co workers are good honest people"
good,You only average about 10-15 hours a week but it is a nice ob to have if you are in school.
good,Fedex would work you and barely want to pay you. They have all types of hours so no set schedule. This is not the job for you if you are in school.
good,"every day was a good day for me because I was happy to be working. I learned a great deal about people in general and the difference of ways of people, meaning that I was always able cope and to adjust to whatever any situation arose. Management at this particular position was another position to deal with. There was just not enough input into the education of a management individual. I loved my co-workers very much and the hardest part of my position was having to say good-bye without any type of warning. The most enjoyable part of the job was being educated in the classification field and doing a job that brought fulfillment and happiness into my life."
good,"Typical night at work come in have prework, then we get on line and work from 11 until 2:12 or until the lines are shut down. Then for myslef and some other employee we go the load aircraft with freight which takes about 1hour and 30mins depending on the amount of freight and the size of the plane that we load. the hardest part of my job is working on line hard all night trying unload and people are just not working or working slow and talking. Most enjoyable part of my job is going to load the aircraft at flight."
good,A heavy industry facility subject to all weather types. Heavy equipment and loud atmosphere. Low respect for individuals and Low advancement opportunities above certain levels. High rate of nepotism and favoritism.
good,I was a sub contractor driver for Fed Ex ground. It was to make extra money for the holidays.
good,"The company itself is ok I guess, but its definately not a long term career choice if that's what you are looking for. It takes too long to move up and you more than likely have to be bilingual to do it."
good,"Your are not promoted base on your skill set. You have to belong to the right peer group that the ops managers create "
good,Some of the management really needs changed or worked with. Some of the management takes advantage of the power of their responsibility as a manager. It's not a dating site it's your job.
good,"Company offers fair compensation however, some departments treat workers as commodities to be used rather than valued.  When interviewing one must be patient as decision making is very slow."
good,"Hard to say too many good things about working for a contract person to the main company. My experience was better than most but still, it was always going to be temporary for me."
good,A typical day at work is long and lots of driving. Things were always changing day by day so don't expect anything to be the same or easy. Lots of heavy lifting
good,It's a job your experience will vary by where you work. Like any job the people are what make it. Find a few people you click with and get through the sort.
good,Favoritism. Lazy supervisor and everything else is wrong with the FedEx in la. But thats just my experience. give it a shot. And see how you like it..
good,"The harder you work the more you get used. However, this can be good since you are paid hourly. The only problem is the more they use the harder they make it for using your time off."
good,"The Fedex I was working at was expected to make at least 3-4 hours a day at work. While, we’re really making 2-3 hours a days. The management were very nice people they even bought us drinks and food from time to time .The Only thing You might not like about fedex is working in the smalls area. Lastly, what you'll like about fedex besides all the drama that happens everyone get alone."
good,"Management, what a Joke.  Having management tell you how to drive your route or load your truck when they have never been out on a route or loaded a truck for a route. Not being able to get started on route till 9:30 a.m. & having been there since 6 a.m."
good,"If you would like to lose weight and tone up, FedEx is a good place to work. We are actually told that you do not need to pay a gym membership to workout, FedEx pays you."
good,working for fedex is very stressful. to much work not enough pay. hours are ok. the day i work are ok. i love working for fedex but need more money. your work is timed. have to do amount of file each day
good,Mandatory overtime with no notice. Could only get out of it using personal time. Manager are very unprofessional and training discussions are not recorded so it's your managers word against yours when they act inappropriate to the point  of tears.
good,"1st 3 years you are paid very low wages.  After 3yrs they are still paying less than LTL average wages but it is survivable.   No PTO for 1st 6mnths, so don't get sick or you get points. Managers lied about miles to get drivers thru the door."
good,"Virtual work, 10-12 hours weekdays and 5-7 hours on weekend to maintain schedule.  Most enjoyable was flexibility to work virtual, traveling and access to training and assistance if needed."
good,The job need employee evaluations for raises. Better management would be a plus. Shouldn't have to beg for raises. Benefits should be madatory for contractors to provide.
good,Pésimo trao a todos los niveles. El único aprte a tu vida es ser mejor persona y salir de allí para crecee y superarse.
good,Most of Fedex is independently owned so just depends who you work for and how comfortable you are in the city your placed in some offer pto and some offer nothing
good,If you're looking for a part-time job to bring in some extra cash it's okay or if you just in between jobs but it's not something you can make your career. The work is very physically demanding very tiring. It tends to wear out people very quickly very few people stay longer than couple months sometimes just weeks.
good,"Fed ex was a okay place to work at just doesn't fit my needs I need insurance benefits, more benefits period. I also need a higher pay and an opportunity to excel to an ever greater pay from that in which I may start."
good,I did not enjoy their job I just needed somewhere to work at the time. I think the management team could have been better. The co-workers were okay but the manager's we're difficult to work under
good,the management is terrible they dont help very much and they get mad at you if you hurt yourself on the job sometimes they give people dirty looks that they dont like
good,"Working at FedEx is different to say the least. It's hard work with poor management. We are subcontracted not owned by FedEx. That being said, FedEx managers are careless and rude."
good,Typical night at the HUB was 3-4 hours. I would not recommend this job to anyone because it can take a toll on you. Management was unprofessional and did not care.
good,You  are on your own as a delivery driver. The time you are off depends on the driver.  Sometimes there is a lot of work. It's a job that really depends on you once you are delivering packages.
good,"Very fast paced and if you're not in good shape, this job is not for you. Lots of moving very heavy items. Bending, stooping and overall tiring.I injured myself on a weekly basis due to the physical demands of this job."
good,"A typical day would consist of me coming in and loading boxes into a truck for 4-5 hours non-stop and a rate of at least 400 boxes per hour, boxes weighing anywhere from 1 pound to 200 pounds."
good,Same as any over the road trucking job; they require a lot of hours away from home. I didn't work directly for Fed Ex. It was a trucking Company that has a contract with Fed EX=x.
good,i do not like that you work for a contractor and not the actual company with no benefits. your employer does not provide health insurance and will not pay if you are injured on the job
good,"Very quick paced job to work for.  As a fortune 100 company to work for, it was a good job.  II would imagine that through time and your showing on time with a good attitude, you will be able to move forward."
good,"either you get a good or bad contractor and i got a bad one, FedEx isnt like UPS, they use contractors and most of them dont pay enough, they dont give any benifits."
good,"Good place to work if you don't mind the unstable hours. The people there were helpful, optimistic, and always ready to help out when necessary. Good management, no benefits other than paid time off (which counts as sick time as well), and pretty easy to get to."
good,"FedEx is an okay job. You definitely have to work your butt off to get a good paycheck. If your only looking to get some extra money, this is the job for you."
good,This was a part time position and I did not work there for a long period of time so there is no review that would be of interest at this time.  it was a job
good,I have nothing good to say about this places. I had to take on two different shift just to get a paycheck. and management sucks. you would hope everybody come to work or you will be working by yourself.
good,it was ok to work at no communication at all though throughout the warehouse....no supervision at all you could stand around all day and just talk to people if you wanted. made it hard for people who actually worked.
good,"The culture and attitudes seem to never change as package handlers are promoted to management positions. They bring with them to the manger positon the bullying, threating demeanor that they experienced on the floor. Lack of character and integrity is what I experienced at my former facility."
good,I delivered at fedex ground for over seven years and it wasn't the worst job Ive had but it definitely wasn't the best. we worked really long hours and some unsafe situations due to rowdy customers.
good,Fast shift at work; quite fluid situation; one moment individual is on conveyer belt helping keep belt moving smoothly and next moment he is moving boxes to doors and scanning them.  LOUD; not conducive for peoples with autism or Aspergers disorder
good,"Get up at 4 am driver from Warrenton to Durham , scan package ,load truck.stand in for paper work .Start your about 9 am .Drive back to Warrenton where my route began.200 hundred miles or more a day,6 to 7 hours of miles.That Tuesday thru Saturday."
good,"They don’t give you any benifits, nor paid vacations. The management there are very unorganized and sloppy. They don’t take care of they workers at all."
good,was a decent place to work wouldnt see myself there for the rest of my career but got me through college and paid the bills. job varies depending on location and is very different from one location to another.
good,"I like working there, but the only problem is you don't get a lot of hours until peck season but that's only for two months. You don't know what your day will be like."
good,The company has made major changes in the structure of the company over the past couple of years.  This has caused poor service to the customers and drivers.  All of the charges has also caused employees to fell stressed and not valued.  The only thing that was important was numbers.
good,Very high volume and fast paced and physical working environment. Worked on a conveyor belt sorting packages for delivery. The hours were terrible and the pay too low for the work expected.
good,"work all through, quick paced ..Meeting new people. Always willing to assist.We had a good team spirit. good management rapport. We had an open door policy where you can walk  up to the manager and discuss issues . The culture is always work and work."
good,FedEx is a good company to work for. It is a fast pace place to work. People are friendly and will help when you need it. You have to be able to keep up with the pace.
good,The office environment was fun.  Offered very little advancement opportunities for full time employment.  Was not at Fed Ex Freight very long for employment.
good,I world scan packages and unload truck in a timely manner on the daily basis. I enjoyed working as a team with my co-workers. The hardest part of my job was that it is very labor intense work hard on the back.
good,if you have'nt been with fedex for a while i would suggest not to bother. as a driver it is best if you come through the fedex ranks and not be hired off the street as i was
good,"No real motivators, people aren’t “teammates” lots of individuals and selfish individuals. No communication, respect or real professionalism.. no one follows sop’s"
good,"While most staff friendly and learned lots regarding broker industry, the atmosphere was more stressful due to workforce/staff changes for duration working there few years ago: also office politics were going on? There were frequent requests for voluntary overtime help working weekends with workload catchup. Felt sad got let go but luckily staff backed reference for another job.  Otherwise, good place to learn with growth potential: note lots of accurate data entry and tight deadlines!"
good,"You work a lot of overtime, which is okay if you need to earn extra money. However, all overtime is mandatory so planning for weekends is next to impossible. My supervisor was definitely not a ""people"" person which made going to work a chore. The pay was below market value and the most your could get annualy was a measly 3.5 percent. They also ""blackout"" the last 2 weeks of every month plus all holidays, so you have to take your vacation during the first two weeks of the month."
good,"salir de casa a trabajar , organizar mi area de Trabajo emperor a realizar mis funciones diarias con been entusiasmo y buena energia ye que en algunas ocasiones el Trabajo llega hacer pesado"
good,You would clock in and start unloading trucks. Than you would get a half hour lunch during shift change. The second shift I would drive a mini golf cart with a trailer to one side of the build and back to another side of the building. The hardest part of the job was some of the managers.
good,I wont work for another FEDEX I am working here temporarily until I can get into a local jewelry store.  The FEDEX owners are very friendly but several things were unclear with the wages and benefits.
good,"The company is divided into territories and owned by those companies. Therefore there is no room for advancement, lack of work/life balance. In some cases depending on the territory owner you might get one week paid vacation. No benefits which includes health dental as well. You would think that it being a big company they would ensure benefits across the board.  I got $5 a day raise after 6 years with company."
good,"The work is easy but the employees are not to be trusted.  Also, the favoritism is strong within the company.  After working there for 5 years my best advice to you would be to JUST DO YOUR JOB AND AVOID MAKING FRIENDS.  The pay is ok but you only receive a 23 cent yearly raise IF YOU PASS THE YEARLY REVIEW.  Advancement in the company is great and so are the benefits."
good,It is deceiving to say the less  say one thing and do another no set hours to work changing the time to on you very often every week and I have seen some illegal activity on site.
good,Fast paced and no health benefits. Break your back for less than you deserve. No advancement opportunities and the work is subsidized so you are basically a slave for the guy who owns the routes.
good,Sweat your butt off for not so much money. Management can be rude. Work place not that great. Set outrageous goals that are not achievable. Employees do not want to work and show it.
good,The job duties were very self explanatory but the environment was very unstable and dysfunctional. Management was very unprofessional and very unfriendly.
good,"it was ok, but management was very unfair. He showed to much favoritism and not all of us could have a fulltime schedule. The work is not as hard as many people think; in fact. I thought it was very easy."
good,Its a great company to work for if you only want part time hrs. You got personal days each month. And they will pay for additional schooling. Managers were always helpful and friendly.
good,This job is not very labor intensive or hard to learn. I gained a lot of new abilities from this job but at my specific location there was a very poor management. It began to create a poor work environment. Good pay and they do work well with you availability.
good,not enough hours very inconvenient hour shift and management could be nicer could change how to clock in . I like the company but those are thinks that they could fix
good,FedEx is a stressful place to work. The managers don't care much about if your hurt or not but they do have good benefits. I broke my arm while on the clock and I was still fired because I wasn't able to do as much as I was before.
good,"A typical day at work consists of logistics, customer service and time management. Each day can present a new route to learn and the weather can either be your friend or foe. Employees are usually friendly and courteous; Mondays however can cause serious disconcertment. The hardest part of the job is the ambiguity of day to day operations. What's most enjoyable about my job is mobility, the freedom to move around and not stay in one place all day. As far as upward mobility in terms of advancement and compensation goes FedEx is not the ideal choice."
good,Very stressful job situation. Not much training for the job. I worked lots of overtime. Several people left while I was there. I did like the small office environment.
good,"Same review as fedex ground. Management sucks, the coworkers are fun and help each other out. We could never keep a manager for more than a year and they never knew what they were doing."
good,"High expectations with little return on time invested.  Decent pay and benefits.  Hours are strictly regulated if you are hourly, and you live at work when you are salary."
good,"The company could pay more money and better healthcare."
good,"The company has a contract with a temporary agency located in Harrison, NJ so my job is very very temporary. Pay2Staff/FedEx"
good,"Did the best I could did everything they ask and was treated so unfairly, from clearing lines, sort line ,wrapping pallets, fixing pallets , pulling and flag pallets, I wouldn't mind working for fed ex again but not at the facility I was at"
good,this job is very repetitous.  once you are knowledgeable of the system it is very tedious and mindless. the great this is the vacation time.  other places do not offer vacation time. and benefits start day 1.
good,"I miss this job. Weather was the hardest thing about this job. A bit stressful around the holidays, but a great job. My co-workers where great."
good,"Sad to work with couriers who have been with this company for 10,13, 15, 18, years and they still have not reached top pay."
good,they are very demanding at frdex and expect you to unload a package off of the trucks every 5 seconds which can be very difficult and there is no air conditioning. I dont mind hard work and tough jobs but i just didnt care for it bery mich
good,was a great experience to learn about ocean import transportation would have preferred to grow however due to lack of appreciation and discrimination he company wasn't a good fit.
good,"A good workout is a benefit to this job. Heavy lifting is quite common .of the disadvantages, you do not always get off at the time you signed up for."
good,"load truck in the morning, get days manifest listed with all stops for the day, and off on the road to deliver all packages."
good,My job consisted of daily deliveries and pickups.  The people I worked with were friendly and helpful.  The hardest part was the lifting of heavy packages and the other part was being outside.
good,"A good job if you like to be on the road all day and meeting new people. this is a very physically demanding job. YOu will be busy and work overtime all year long, especially holiday periods."
good,"Working for a contractor, I had no benefits, no overtime no paid vacation and or sick days. The job was simple and I had a good guy to work for but I had to find a company with benefits"
good,This company is ok it is very good in the industry. i just cant survive on the part time hours and need a full time job. it would be ok for a starter job.
good,"management is allowing favoritism.  I thought it was a position that I could handle, but due to the managers favoritism it was not to be."
good,"Great culture, looks easy but a very hard job. Must be self motivated and well organized. Leadership has put a choke hold on the future of the company. Refusing to match pay with competition."
good,"No benfits, pretty much out of luck if you need days off.. Good money I guess, nothing to look forward to in the future.. Work for 20 years and hope you saved enough."
good,"i was hired as a part time package handler, was excited about the job, but the excitement did not last long, training was two days of watching a couple movies each day and then doing a pop quiz filling out question and answer papers like your at school for your trainer to see what you learned, then on day 3 i started in the trailer to start work, i got a trainer to show me all the ropes of what i had watched plus a few things i did not learn watching the movies, only for the first 4 days of my job, after that was on my own, i would say you need more then just 4 or 5 days with the trainer to really get the hang of this job. "
good,"Hot, cold and hard."
good,"Enjoyed meeting people when delivering packages. "
good,"Very little incentives, small raises. Tons of mandatory overtime. No opportunities for advancement. Job is very tedious and boring. The workload given is way over the expected quota."
good,"A typical day of work is me standing around scanning packages and putting them on a skid. It isn't a hard job but it isn't the job for me, most of the management are friendly but some are not. I don't associate with co-workers I don't do well with people."
good,Had to find work to do and some nights there were no work. Associates didn't seem to care and some people just walk around. It was very unorganized and time was kept track on paper.
good,it was like being thrown in a pool and you couldn't swim. Very hard work. I was trained but a mental training was needed. just an all around bad experience
good,"Typical call center."
good,"It's a good job if you do not mind working early morning hours, starting around 4am. Most of the time they are very short shifts, so you have the rest of the day off. It can also be physically hard because it is fast paced and includes lifting heavy objects."
good,"My day will began 6:00am every morning and end sometimes 9:30p.m that night. I learn different location's area's and TEAM WORK  with co-worker's . management needed more help there were no organization. My hardest part of the job was safety due to lack of high turn over of manager's. My most enjoyable time was meeting new people and helping them with any problem's ( customer service) also learning new thing's from co-worker's whom been employed with the company over 2+years very helpful , overall loving the job itself."
good,"It was just like any other factory job. "
good,I am looking for a job! That should say enough!  Good work goes unappreciated.  Favortism is rapant. I have been misinformed by management concerning more than one situation.
good,"The day starts off around 6 a.m. and can end at 12 p.m. depending on the work load. Peak season is the most hectic time of year which is from november - Janurary. I learned to navigate the route using maps so well that i knew where the customers lived just by looking at there names. The hardest part of the job would be trying to make all deliveries by 5 p.m. or delivering in the dark on the county roads. the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting the customers especially the appreciative customers that understand that you cannot make all deliveries at the same time everyday that sometimes there packages arrive late into the night because the route does 300+ miles almost everyday, personally i try to make every delivery no matter the time i was out on the road"
good,"when I first started it was pretty cool. I started in the 7 am shift and everyone was pretty cool and helpful didn't really know the managers that well. As time progressed they began to get to comfortable and the supervisors have BAD attitudes which make them think its okay to speak to you any kind of way. they curse at you like youre their child and the approach is  VERY UNEXCEPTABLE. its sad that nothing could be done because the bigger managers defends them. you have no voice nor opinion , I advise you to work stay out the way and leave don't befriend any managers or supervisors because they'll take advantage of that . its a good job but its not worth someone cursing at you , instead of them see you do something wrong n letting you know they'll let you do it and think they have an argument NOOO.  11pm-4 am anything nights try to avoid. I warned you"
good,unload 5 45 foot trailers. learned how to unload and drive a tugger. Management was sloppy. Co-workers some were very hard working and some were very lazy but yet got moved to easier positions that required less work. Hardest part of the job was not only carrying my load but the load that the other coworkers didn't want to do or wanted to leave last because of there lack of workmanship. Also on top of that having my manager yell at me to increase the pace I was working at because of how much he saw me doing only because I refused to let the duties go undone and allow them to pile up on us due to some co-workers refusing to take care of there responsibilities because they were tired. I enjoyed nothing.
good,"As a package handler the hardest part of your job is hydration. Staying hydrated is a big priority, as is the rest of your job. You are expected to stay fast paced and make rate. The co-workers must work together in some trailers to get the job done. Management actually gets in the trailers to do work sometimes. They also help to deal with jams in the shoots. I learned how to keep pace in high paced areas and build sturdy and adequate walls."
good,Everyday I showed up to work early to have time to use the restroom if I need to and to make it to my work area to clock in. The job was a fun job just in a bad environment. Management wasn't helpful at all and could careless about what happened in the warehouse as long as people came to work. The co-workers were pretty cool and they would help every time I asked for it or even without me asking. The hardest part of the job was working with managers who was just rude and negative through out the whole day. None of the managers liked the job so they made it harder for me. I really enjoyed the fast pace and lifting and stacking boxes in the trailer. It was like a workout everyday in there.
good,If you like working 10 to 14 hours a day than this is the job for you. In the terminal at 6 am....wait for packages to come in on trucks...load your vehicle...wait to get paper work....then begin your deliveries...
good,Outside residential painting was interesting but in the winter months not available. I learned a good deal and am grateful for the experience.
good,"Its a nice place to work if you like to get a workout in and get paid to do it. Its a no brainer job, given very little training. Self motivated individuals will excel at this job. Watch out for some favoritism of certain employees, they do not drug test very often as it seem to be the popular thing among employees to go get high after work."
good,"Company is changing every day. Team morale is very low as targets are un-achievable as goals are simply too high and unrealistic."
good,"Worked there about 2 & half years. Went through 2 changes in General Managers. Liked the job my 1st year, they let us have some freedom to work wear you wanted. The Last year or so it was more of a prison-like atmosphere, they said where you will work & who you will work with & no talking. HR started making out mandatory work schedules for peak season. They started writing people up for every little thing. Floor supervisors & Leads went from being your friend and helping you to more like your prison guard. They started running the belts so fast my last year that packages fell off the belts & all over the floor. And we had to pick them all up before we went home."
good,Start with sorting mail and load and unload trucks. Sometimes management is a bit much.
good,just packing or unloading packages from trucks. i learned how to properly handle packages. The people i worked with were very friendly and cooperative. the hardest part was lifting some of the more heavier packages. i enjoyed being able to spend the rest of my day with my family.
good,"good management"
good,"good work hour , management is fair. good people to work for, everyone on same page."
good,Taking more away than ever and expecting more from their employees.
good,lifting carrying unloading making sure the items weren't damaged
good,I load truck and deliver inventory till job is done. Which can be anywhere from 8 hours to 13 hours. No overtime or benefits. Management and Supervisor staff don't really care what you do as long as u finish.
good,It's an ok place to work. Pay is not great for the amount of work and type of work. Benefits pretty much do not exist.
good,"A typical day at work consists of agent/client interaction via phone and email. Training, coaching, and development. Implementing new processes and procedures. "
good,Don't work for Home Delivery! Each contractor pays differently from 1 dollar per stop up and you get paid less when not in peek season. Be careful which contractor you work for! Not everyone is cut out to run his or her own business.
good,"busy, hot, cold, not the nicest people to be around manager slash supervisor wise"
good,"Nepotism is what it is all about at FedEX. The other problem is that anyone with ten years or less gets the ""new"" FedEx, which is not good, i.e. no pension and no chance to ""top out"" on hourly pay ever. Welcome to the working poor. Less than ten years means you are paid the same as any other driver at any other company and the benefits are not better. The health benefits particularly just plain stink. It's a decent job, and managers are fearful of treating anyone unfairly, which means anytime you screw up they pull out a boy scout manual known as the people manual, and they go strictly by that so as to be fair. Good job, but by no means not more than good."
good,"The job was ok, the main thing I didn't like was they didn't have a union.  You work Monday through Friday but the total of hours you will work is under 25 hours. Although I got paid every week and the starting off pay rate was decent the hours wasn't there so its not good for person who has a family and bills to work there. The co workers was nice always worked as a time and helped each other out; but the management was horrible.  They very inconsiderate of their workers feelings."
good,"The company itself is a good one I think, but if you ever work for a contractor make sure you get everything in writing. I was cheated out of so much money because I was lied to. They also don't care about your life or you, and they will over work you."
good,"Early morning to mid afternoon, learned the ins and out of the freight business, the overall management team was great minor rooms for improvement need to be fixed. Co-workers were great a few bad eggs here and there. Hardest thing was lack of advancement and always told there chances for advacement but never giving th chance."
good,"Sales Mangers must be available 24/365. "
good,There are a lot of changes taking place and resources are currently being overworked with minimal support from management.
good,"Good and simple job that I enjoyed doing until I noticed how much management favors certain employees. A typical day at work is 8 hours of standing and sorting, palletizing, unloading, loading, and shipping packages. I learned how to work well in group situations and how to be a team leader. Also learned Fedex Smartposts' shipping process. Was certified through the company how to ride forklift and walkie riders. Management was all around okay. There were certain individuals who showed extreme favoritism and that was indeed upsetting. And management lacked organization most of the time. Then again I can't blame them for that too much. They were just given an assignment and have to carry it out how they are told. That is their job. My co-workers were nice to my face, but talked alot behind my back. The hardest part of my job was not knowing what time it was to properly take my breaks so I could stay positive and energized. They had the clocks in very inconvenient places and we weren't allowed to take our cell phones onto the warehouse floor. The most enjoyable part of my job was that I got a good workout while being paid. I also love the fact that I was able to witness the warehouse process of shipping and receiving. All in all, not a bad job."
good,I learned how to work fast and how to find ways to work faster while being able to give a good performance.
good,The management was very mean. The working enviroment itself was like walking on egg shells because everyone either were being indirectly harassed or the work load didn't reflect the actual workers they had available to complete tasks by their deadline. Mandatory OT seemed to be every single day. Only thing acceptable were the benefits but even those weren't achievable until you'd been there for at least a year.
good,"Good pay for a Hard days work, not truly independent more like a franchise owner, some help running your business from FedEx but very limited. Great drivers Training program."
good,a very fast paced hot warehouse with very little possibility to move up in company
good,Not a Hard job. Can be profitable if you own the route. No much as far as vacation time
good,Loved working for this company until they got bought out by Sears Holdings.  Company went downhill after.
good,"  They advertise an open door policy that is BS. Salary and hourly are definitely separated. Salary sticks together and will lie to build a case against you if you are not there favorites. They play favor ism and will set people up to fail just to write them up."
good,Typical day consist of the hours 10pm-5am . Loading and unloading boxes off and or onto converyor belt onto FedEx trucks.  
good,existen diferencias entre lo pactado y lo laborado sin haber mucha concordancia con ideas o metas que se plantea la empresa.
good,"Arrive at the terminal around seven, assist in the unloading of the bulk trucks and then load your own truck for delivery. I learned how to navigate the cities in the delta regions. Hardest part of the job would be the long hours of driving, constantly stopping and going. The most enjoyable part would be going to cities you've never been to before."
good,"This job is a fun workplace with all the different sorts of co-workers. But unless this is a second job for some extra cash, or a job to get some health benefits this is not a job to make a lot of money. This position does not have good work hours at all they rush you constantly to get done and job is usually done within 2 or 3 hours."
good,"The job is physical,stressfull,and the managers treat you,with minimal respect. You break your back in doing the job in the safest manner, and you end up unemployed after the seasonal rush is over. They lie to you, as far as you becoming permanent,pending on your job performance."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is to work together and learn social relationship with co-workers
good,"Easy to do, just buckle down and do it. Empty the line hauler, sort it out and get it loaded before the driver arrives. Not rocket science."
good,"Unorganize at times.Some supervisors watched as the packages fill up, and didn't help out."
good,Management change has ruined the Windsor Station.
good,"It's a decent company to work for. Good benefits, good connections"
good,So so environment to work in. Minimal opportunity for advancement.
good,liked being out on the road was hard to learn routies but was ok after that dont have a health plan for contractors and didnt pay good
good,Very hard work but I was younger and I could take the hard labor at that time.
good,"Environment was not bad, but there were lack of communication between employees and managemetn."
good,A nice job to have if you like lifting 50 pound boxes through out the day
good,"Too many departments working in a silos, lack of cooperation, contractors are treated like dirt."
good,"FedEx tells that it is a GREAT part-time job and that is a BIG LIE!!!! You will work 2 hours a night, that is all!!! What a waste of time."
good,FedEx gave me a lot of experience working there. I learned at least for different types of jobs while working there and even though the job was temporary it was still nice to gain the experience!
good,"Here its all about the numbers, no home time 14 to 16 hour days."
good,Hardwork but good pay and benefits. Unlimited hours at points but other employees are part of the problems. Some dont put the effort in which means you have to do their work also.
good,"This job takes a lot from you and gives very little back, this job isn't for people looking for a 9 to 5 job. You aren't done until the last stop is attempted"
good,"It's cool I guess for part time but the pay doesn't match up with the work you do. They're top out is $15 in 2yrs, takes a whole year just too start receiving benefits and paid holidays, that's why the turnover rate is so high there!! If they want to keep people they should have people eligible for benefits a whole lot sooner & pay them better for their hard work there"
good,Unsafe and unorganized work environment along with poor management. Numerous injuries and safety violations happen on worksite. Training process is short and orientation is lengthy.
good,"The warehouse does get extremely hot during the summer and you’ll be sorting through packages for the entirety of your shift and we’ll get back up every now and again, but the pay is good and it’s easy to get along with everyone there. Another issue is the lack of hours and your not allowed to bring your phone in the building. It is also virtually impossible to get promoted from a sorter to a manager even if your close with the managers."
good,You start off part time getting as little hours as they can possibly give you.  If you go full time they will work you as much as they can. Constant rotation of managers. Don't work here
good,The work is not hard and the systems are easy to learn.  It is a fast paced job. Everyone seems to work together so that no one is left behind. We all make sure the packages get delivered in a timely manner.
good,"Estresante."
good,work is contracted and everything other than the driver is more important than the driver. Hard to find fill in for you making it hard for you to every request off even in emergency
good,I prefer not to comment at this time. I am currently employed at this company and am looking to find a different position that will allow me to grow and develop my skills and have advancement opportunities.
good,"Worked for an independent contractor and it was challenging. Seemed a bit unorganized and I think that the drivers should have looked more proffesional. The drivers did not care how uniforms looked, not clean or ironed."
good,I have currently been employed 6 months and have received two quarterly pay increases. I work the HUB which is night shift job isn't too overly strenuous and is high energy. I do have personal problems working nights in which I am constantly tired even when sleeping a fair amount of hours and I also have a family which pulls what remaining energy I have. Great work for young dedicated person looking for good pay.
good,Managers are to young and inexperienced . They move people around to  much and dont let them stay in one spot to learn. They have a poor training program.
good,I work at Fedex Ground and the contractors do not appreciate youat all. They take advantage of you and screww you out of raises constantly. I would not work here.
good,Know one cares the truck's not working need a mechanic the managers don't check on u no help no raise no benefits need more money don't get it have the same uniforms I got 3 years ago just sad yes I'm looking for a new job
good,"With great management this could be an awesome opportunity but I haven’t had great management.... if you r a single parent, this isn’t a great option."
good,Pray about it! Management sucks! They do not have people skills. You are constantly being rushed out of the building with more stops that one can handle.
good,"I was a delivery driver. I feel like I took alot of positivity and wisdom with me from this experience, I learned alot and excelled, but didnt enjoy it as much as I had hoped."
good,Empresa de paquetería internacional con amplia cobertura de servicio para diversos envíos de paquetería.
good,"The supervisor is new, allows personal life to get wrapped up in his professional life. Trucks break down, they take your truck away and give it to the bosses brother then you get left running a Uhaul. Too much favoritism,"
good,"It's ok if looking for second job, however lack of direction and supervisors whom seem distracted and lack of focus by constantly moving personal seems to benefit other staff from doing the work."
good,There was no breaks during my shifts and the hours given are very minimum. A lot of heavy duty lifting and other co-workers may be moving at the speed you are.
good,FedEx was not a bad company to work for. They offered great benefits and semi-competitive salaries. The real issues were company culture and home life flexibility. We were expected to work insanely long hours with no compensation. The schedules did not promote a healthy home life.
good,"Pay not to great for the work we do some of the truck do not have a/c . Some people work load is bigger then others . "
good,"Just a friday check guarantee. there is no benefits for working under a contractor here, if making money and taking care of your family is the focus then this is'nt the job."
good,"Listening to the station assistant manager scream at package handlers, operations admins and operations managers over the PA system while never leaving his desk was demoralizing. "
good,"Good place to start right after highschool, very easy job just a lot of work. Work hard enough and there on time everyday they rewards you. Every six months you get a raise and the work is very simple"
good,All around a decent place to work.  The culture has been sucked down in the tubes the last 5 years with focus solely on numbers and not enough on customers/employees.
good,Hard work especially around holidays. Constant changing how we get paid and it seemed to benef it contractors most.  Long hours in hot ir cold temperatures can be hard.  Pay is competitive between vendors and you will be let go if a cheaper driver us hired.
good,I've worked at the cross lanes WV terminal two different times years apart and actually ran the same route both times but for two different managers...far as the overall operation etc it was basically the same with some changes making things somewhat easier etc pay depends on experience your route/area etc now seems as if u kinda top out with most contracters at roughly 700ish weekly...
good,There was no time to stand around. They also didn't give breaks. They never stopped the box's from coming in so you could go to the bathroom or get a drink.
good,"The hours vary and schedules are continuously changed at the last minute which is highly inconvenient to many workers. You get to work clock in and often get sent home after only being there 20mins due to over staffing, and they STILL hire new workers. Ever work area is in completition with each other when in reality we should be working together as a whole to get the job completed on time. "
good,"I loved working for FedEx"
good,"hard part is pick the heavy box, keep push fast to finish and send to truck go to different local or state. it is really challenge. lot of people work different shift."
good,"Too much stress. Too manny stops, too many pick ups. Contractors only think on they slef. After a couple of years your time to get a raise is not valuable bcs they say they cant give more money bcs the route dont pay for more, but u see the work daily going up not down."
good,"The pay is very low for the amount of work being done, we are lifting packages up to 70 pounds everyday. This is not a mentally challenging job but a physically challenging job."
good,"overall i enjoy working at fedex would love a full time position with better pay; in addition, included full benefits would also be enjoyable. workplace culture is ok"
good,"Empresa de grande porte, antiga Rapidão Cometa, em migração para cultura Fedex."
good,"Fedex isn’t for everyone. I loved the hard work, but wish there was more opportunity for growth. The better you are at your job, the likelier you are to get stuck in that role."
good,"Working at fedex is not actually bad.  You're outside getting fresh air and always walking and picking up packages. I averaged 23,000 steps in a day. They just need to get more organized and have better management and actual benefits."
good,It was alright as far as a job goes. I was part time while I was there. One of the things I did not like about the job. It was difficult to move up the latter.
good,I would have to scan boxes that were coming down the line. Put the sticker that printed from the machine onto the box. Load and stack into the truck the way FedEx wanted.
good,"Worked for FedEx for 18 years.  Good pay but not for the area I live in, management is so up and down with favorites the other employees don't matter. Was laid off cuz of baby sitter problem at the end as I am a single father of 2 infant kids. FedEx refused to help out any or even work with employees with family needs. They run but their own rules even if it goes against federal law. They treat you like you are in the mil9and they own you."
good,Good place 2 learn and start on delivery alot of helpping people that i enjoy learning from it was hard when i frist started there but i learned my route fast and ran multiple routes after I was there for over a year got to learn a lot of new places and how to work a scanner  and understand my map and manifest where I was going each day
good,"they do not and will not help with any maintance  cost. they will let u know who u can get discounts for the maintance."
good,! Nepotism runs rapidly within the company . The managers are poorly trained when it c mes to dealing fairly with employees. I would never ever work here again. If someone needs a weekly check it ok . Other than that this company is the pits
good,culture was find. will work to you the bone. want you to work 24hours a day. find new business and make usless calls to meet a call daily quota. but not a bad place to waste you life away.
good,Drivers for ground and home delivery all work for independent contractors that don’t have any health coverage. There’s always work and is a great job for a young kid.
good,"Empresa de grande porte no mercado, com pouca visibilidade de funcionários."
good,"No organization or time management, very fast paced and unsafe. "
good,"The other package handlers I worked with were cool. "
good,if you want to work 12 hour days and get the overtime more power to you. this job is cut throat and learning curve is very short. very fast paced and demanding.
good,Not a bad place to work. Pt dock employees get jerked around on their schedule. Whatever works out best for the supervisor that day. Scheduling changes everyday which makes it hard to plan anything. Not a bad job to supplement income from another job.
good,"Working for the company was always a great experience the people there were  very welcoming , however the workload could become very overwhelming and there weren't any benefits at all and the possibility of getting injured on the job is very high so without paid time off or health benefits its extremely dangerous. Especially when working a 6 day a week shift and in all types of weather"
good,You make a decent wage but the hours are less than ideal. I dont think I got over 20 horus a week the entire time I worked there. Not much room for advancement unless you really take charge.
good,"lots of processes"
good,"Depending on contractor you work for & route it can be a positive or negative experience. VERY physical job with mental stress to make p/u windows if heavy delivery day. Packages can very in weight 5#’s to 200# (desks, mattresss, bookshelves) routes are learned by memory and loaders that FedEx hires are lazy and incompetent."
good,We would deliver 700 boxes a day. The hardest part was that we had to work at a fast pace 24/7 but the management was terrible. The best part was meeting new people while working. We would stack the boxes on a pallet and deliver with the pallet jack.
good,Started when I was 18 left the hub when I was 21 didn't have the opportunity to advance to something else within the hub. Supervisors nor Management recognized employees for working very hard to make sure that their planes left on time. I think the only enjoyable part of the job was the cafeteria.
good,It was a fun place to work I really enjoyed my time there I will probably one day work there again it I'm not working anywhere real soon also it's on a bus route
good,I worked with fedex freight as a operations supervisor for four in a half years. Coming in they made it seem like a good job. After the first 2 month I found out that I made a mistake. There was no training what so ever. Then you would get written up as soon as you make a mistake. No if and or buts about it. Upper management was very secretive with everything did not pass anything down as General knowledge of the company. Also the hours was crazy I would only get paid for working 10 hrs but ended up working 12 hrs daily and the amount of paperwork they pile on you is  ridiculous . You can’t  Efficiently do your job with all the extra paperwork the have you do.
good,The company philosophy that management was expected uphold was people service profit.   As the company evolved over decades the companies philosophy clearly changed to profit profit profit without consideration for the impact to the employees
good,Good times and bad times. Plenty of chances to work during peak season. Working conditions can be extreme if one does not pay attention. Safety is of the utmost importance.
good,FedEx would be a great company if the human resources department and management would come together. The hours are terrible even at full-time. Sometimes I worked less than 2 hours per day.
good,"Your management teams history will reflect how your environment is handled when working with this company, great otherwise. You will rinse and repeat the job process every day, but there will be long hours."
good,"When hired at FedEx, you are taken to your work area and basically thrown into working. Supposedly training, but your working with little or no training. Very hard to get shown what to do, they show you while they are doing it, once then your basically on you own wondering what goes where and where are you suppose to be at. Yes, they need to have a better training process and system in place."
good,"FedEx was not too bad  of a job because it allowed me to pick up all the hours I wanted to. Nevertheless, the management and some team leaders aren't as helpful as I would've liked."
good,supervised/driver trained new drivers on the daily functions of the operations and strategized the daily routes. Drove a P1200 on a route that 85% commercial 15% residential
good,This job is stressful & fast paced. They have high demands for our daily performance. During Christmas you have to work a lot of hours and you cannot enjoy the holidays at all with your family.
good,a great job if you like working on your own and meeting all types of people the hardest part of the job is working in bad weather ie rain snow thunder but you get used to it
good,"Overall, working in the warehouse was fine it was the management that needed to be improved. The warehouse work was easy to perform just lifting and carrying boxes to the machine separator where it was scanned and separated into its designated area."
good,My Managers were some of the worst I have ever worked for. The will not take any input from front line supervisors. Most have a closed door policy. Its just a job.
good,"A typical day is about 20 to 25 thousand packages that has to be scanned and wrapped to be delivered to buyer destination. I've learned to keep a productive steady paced while multi-tasking. I like the people and work place culture because it was all about team work. The hardest part of the job was lifting heavy packages over 50 pounds. I enjoyed staying busy and productive, which in turn I won employee of the month twice."
good,"The typical day at FedEx Ground begins with sorting/loading your truck. It is definitely a wake up call. Then logging in and driving to the route. Fast paced and hectic is an understatement, due to the necessity to finish your 100-140 stops per day, and get your 150 to 280 packages delivered before you begin your scheduled pickups. At that point, one had better prepare one's self for another 75-300 packages in pickup volume. The boxes are heavy and plentiful, and that's before you get to the oversized. The end of the day ranges from tired to bone weary."
good,"They were great people very focused on safety, which is always very good in an industry like Fed-Ex. But the job itself was sub-par as was the pay for the work."
good,I worked for an independent contractor and the best part about it was i didnt have to constantly look over my shoulder in fear of complaints from supervisors. My manager was understanding but I also felt he lacked in other areas that a manager should perfect in training. His communication wasnt always there and when mistakes were made on the companies behalf the drivers were not always compensated. Promises were often broken or forgotten because it seems they tell you anything to make you feel better to not take the complaint further to corporate.
good,You are at any time subject to be a casualty...not necessary of your own making.  I had the knowledge... I just didn't fit into management's agenda. I will continue on silently.... with the grace &dignity that I always have.
good,"good place to work, if only we had management that cared more for the employers and put their foot down where it needs to be placed down, where it needs to be. They need to stop placing so much emphasis on a package and not caring about a person"
good,Quality workplace for someone new to warehouses training available no full-time opportunity. Supervisors need more training on basic warehouse knowledge as well as human relations.
good,"Our company is downsizing, meaning  less employees, with much more work.  No room for advancement.  Very low morale.  I enjoy all the people I work with, I have known most of them for over 10 years."
good,The Fedex hub is a good place to work and the management is great. The Fedex Hub is suitable for all age groups. The work load is a little out of hand thought.
good,The only reason to stay employed at this job is for the benefits. You can advance quickly but you are constantly under a tremendous amount of stress for little pay for the amount of work that you do.
good,"Everything was fine at first, then things got real quick. Will really work you.The pay was decent, but not enough hours. Management is terrible. Don't care about its employees."
good,"Typical day involved failure analysis of production failures and production improvement projects. Most days I'm waiting around for IT to respond to my supervisor's request for development software needed to perform my job, or waiting for IT to do something admin related. Many times, IT would say they performed their duty when there was no record or evidence of them doing so. Purchasing supplies for R&D studies takes weeks, sometimes months, when we could get what we need locally down the road. Everything moves really slowly. "
good,"I learned a lot working both positions with FedEx. With most jobs, some managers are good people and really want to see their employees excel and others are just there for a pay check."
good,"I work with FedEx Freight just under 10 months, first off if your willing to sacrifice your life for work you will be fine. Secondly you will be reminded if you mess up by several parts of management.  There is too many policy and procedure to remember. If you work for a large terminal be prepare to work every shift that you don't want to work. You can go from 1st shift to 3rd shift with in a couple of days. equipment is ok, micromangement is the highest of priorities every single minuet thing you do will be revisited and reviewed and questioned. No matter how fast you are you will not be fast enough for fedex. Remember before you work here you will not be given any chances they will verbal coach, write up, suspend, and terminate you without skipping a beat. I was very uneasy working for this company. I felt like i was going to terminate everyday i went to work."
good,I recommend this job for anyone that is in the midst of changing careers or looking for a new job. This particular job (package handler)  is not intended to be made out to be a career.
good,"they expect 40-60 hours per week, with no overtime or benifits."
good,It's a job that requires a lot of strength both physically and mentally. You have to be strong to carry heavy packages and be on your best costumer service attitude.
good,Great benefits and freedom. Management at my station (MMR)  is good. There is a lot of freedom to do your job independently from others. Overall culture is poor.
good,I didnt receive very many hours and the times were never set. I worked very early mornings and never knew when i was going to get off work. My supervisor was nice and helpful.
good,"FedEx is a great place for young people to begin their careers, fresh out of college.  The company supports many programs which can train and encourage them to grow in the company.  Not so much for experienced administrators who gained most of their experience outside of FedEx.  The culture seems to support only those whose experience comes from within the corporation."
good,"I enjoy the people I work with including management however, it is a large corporation and the corporate side is heartless.  Corporate goes out of their way to find ways to slap a fine on you and your contractor or to have you terminated.  To them you are not a person, you are just a number.  They don't care about you, your family, or your financial hardships.   I don't feel any sense of job security, and moral is pretty low due to excessive fines given to employees for making  honest mistakes."
good,"The fact its busy makes the day go by. In terms of cardio, the job offers that. workers get paid every week. Very fast place environment. opportunity to work full time."
good,"Working at FedEx is not that bad but know that when you work there as a driver you will be working for a contractor, which means you will not be provided with any benefits because you do NOT work for FedEx. You will be doing alit of physical labor and during the holiday season you will be working at least 12 hours."
good,"Although FedEx is a great place for new workers straight out of high school or those transitioning from college, I must say that the management department may need a slight adjustment. They were extremely nice and definitley considerate if there were minor mistakes, however on the whole they might ask for an unrealistic goals to be set from every individual. Striving for the highest is great. Setting unrealistic goals in my opinion is not. I loved having a job and the pay was nice. The most difficult part was being asked to match the work level of someone who had well more than a years experience."
good,The job was hard and the wage didn't meet the amount of we work you do everyday .the work pace is way too fast for most people to keep up and there is a large lack of appreciation
good,"wasn't working as a team, a lot of favoritism working there. the hours wasn't to bad, I worked 2nd shift. the management was terrible. the hardest part of the job was running 12 skids on one bill. the enjoyable part was some of the co workers."
good,"My time at FedEx was mostly positive. I got promoted within a year, as a trainer, but I felt a little boxed in, as I do have a business degree, with 11 years of experience. I felt as it I was being under-utilzed. I expressed my desires to my boss, to no avail. "
good,"A typical day was to come in exercise and then unload containers and put convey them,after that clean the work area,if help was needed on a fedx account we could sign up for more hours and travel to the destination were help was needed."
good,"Morning meetings included stretching, unloading semi trailers to conveyor belts, conveyors carry packages to lines. Lines are loaded into trucks. Each loader is responsible for 1 to 4 trucks and loading appropriate packages into areas determined by management. Most days are non stop, incredibly fast paced, no breaks. Usual day is two and three hours long."
good,"They give good benefits if you ever become a permanent worker, contractors have it really hard they want you to work all kinds of hours no benefits. Requesting days off is really hard."
good,I actually worked for a Contractor for FedEx so the rules and regulations I'm sure we're quite different if I'd been an Actual FedEx Employee.
good,"Overall love the job its self. The work is fast paced but makes the day go by fast. Your on a dedicated area and your responsiblities include loading up your truck in the morning and then delivering them during the day as well as pickups."
good,"Culture is unusual, management is different. Everyone is self serving and they only look out for themselves. They are focused on hiring less experienced folks which is great for new graduates! "
good,"They lack of management to many chiefs not enough Indians to run a multi million dollar business... when they say it has a open door policy, thats a lie... if they get their feeling hurt they fire the person even if he works his butt off to out preform other contractors in the facility.."
good,they have no A/C so you can imagine being inside a warehouse full of forklifts and machinery around you. the people there were nice just after a few hours into work. management was pretty bad except one of the team leads. he was pretty friendly and kind.
good,"Working for a multinational corporation with a very high  employee turnaround, it is hard to feel valued. There is very little in the way of one on one training and support, a very sink or swim environment."
good,A Fedex é uma grande empresa internacional onde eu aprendi tudo lá com grande experiencia tirando alguns fatores referente a gerencia era uma ótima empresa para trabalhar
good,"Best company I ever worked for. Culture at the Indy hub has changed and the environment is very cutthroat. Upper management is rarely available and some are out right incompetent. Teamwork is gone, and this used to be a facility that was the envy of the company. They ran 400 employees short just so they could hit their profit goals, grinding the front line employees to a frassle. Very high turnover rate in front line employees and in management."
good,I would come in at 3:00am then i would be assigned to a specific truck to start on then I would have too unload 900 boxes per hour with one other person and sweat a lot.
good,"The job is easy to do but there are not enough hours and management doesn't work with employees to get more hours. As far as promotion goes, management says its based on seniority but its really about whoever has the closer connection to management. So no matter how great of a worker you are, if you don't have any connections in management you will never be promoted."
good,"Requires lots of physical labor, transport freight, load freight into air crafts, ensure aircraft loaded and departed within give time frame."
good,I worked there for almost twenty years. They don't really appreciate their employees or show any loyalty to them. I would not go back
good,Can work anywhere from unloads trailers to sorting packages to loading two trucks up. Hardest part is everything has to be done in a certain time.
good,They cut hours and there's really no advancement. Its a very demanding workplace to work at. They make you work hard for no advancement
good,In my normal routine I would sort packages on the truck then transfer them into my truck which then gets delivered to local business and residents.  I also help the manager in the office when he needs a hand.
good,"Typical day, lifting & loading packages into a cargo van or truck to deliver on a specific route. Some nice people to work beside. Hard to do in the heat at times."
good,"Very time oriented, Every task was allotted a time frame in which to completed and  every minute had to be accounted for on computer. I found management to be good people. The co-workers were all a good group of people, all striving to make a living, but aware they were doing the same job as UPS couriers and getting paid a lot less. The most difficult part of the job was meeting the time constraints which required me to run from stop to stop. The most enjoyable part of the job was the public contact with deliveries and pick-ups."
good,Overall the job is pleasant. The only part of the job that may be irritating is the time I have to spend at the terminal waiting for my truck to be loaded.
good,"Get to the terminal around 6:00 am to help loader load the truck. Averaging about 115-125 stops per day, delivering anywhere from 200-300+ packages a day. Management was never around so they never see the hard work you do on a daily basis. The hardest part of the job was finding time to eat. Working at FedEx I learned how to effectively manage my time and prioritize my day. I loved meeting new people everyday."
good,The job itself is very physical but easy. The hours fluctuate through out the year so it becomes annoying to ride to work to be sent home after two hours or less. This becomes even more annoying when you expect to be sent home and they decide that they need you.
good,"Its hard job to work..Its nice place to work.."
good,entreprise tres agréable mais les horaires de poste son trop décaler en gros pas de vie
good,"Good place to work, job security is always there, but does not offer benefits, but great great pay, work in all weather conditions"
good,"Worked my way from package handler to a management position. Transferred to Colorado and enjoyed being a courier, delivering packages, talking to customers and having a relationship with them."
good,"Good benefits and pay, horrible management and operations organization. They have good health plans and hours are flexible."
good,"Would come in at 07:30 loaded & scanned truck,& put in stop count order.delivered packages.til usually noon.took my lunch til 3 pm then would do a pickup route.Got back to station between 7-7:30pm & would help where needed ,but usually in haz_mat as I was second most qualified but first one in, until 2030.I was always finished with haz-mat by 2030,this included but was not limited to accountability of paperwork verses product,& D.O.T. required paperwork for Driver.That would conclude my work-day."
good,"good for medical and stock... hard to make a career from it. Co-workers are great and help you out a lot. Being full time doesn't allow you to go to school, they don't really care about school... its all about getting the packages off and some managers just don't even listen, some managers would rather sit at their desk then try to help or communicate with employees."
good,Enjoyable workplace crew gathering at beginning of shift for stretching exercising and safety tips was a good thing to do.Continuous supply of work made the time past quickly which I enjoyed. Wish pay was more for performance of work.
good,This job was a very fast pace job. You had to know where you were going at alll times. It was stressful and you really need to be a much younger person like 21 to 45 to keep up.
good,"a typical day at work is fast paced , work efficiently , and be safe."
good,FedEx Custom Critical will challenge their employees on the day to day basis. There is no chain of command and there is a bit of mismanagement throughout the company. Grey areas in terms of facilitating operations occur on the daily basis. Most of the employees there are great people but due to the reasons stated above there is a high turnover.
good,"The FEDEX workers really don't care about the employees, their only concern is the packages being delivered and the processing time, which puts the people doing the mission at a disadvantage and make them feel unappreciated"
good,"mundane 9-5 schedule, do what your told, ideas for improvement cost to much, AWESOME management, easy to relate co workers, hardest part of the job is the corporate ""red-tape""."
good,its a job that you have to work on their time and hours about 55 hours per week. dont ever get a 30 min. lunch lucky if you get a 10 min break
good,"Managerial skills could be fine tuned. Going by the book isn't always the best way to go about a job (specially a manual labor job). Lead parcel managers try to help workers, but the bureaucracy prevents employes to work in a stress free environment."
good,Pretty laid back simply checking to make sure no one stole anything. The workers can be stubborn but it comes with the job
good,It was hard moving up with this company and once I moved up it was even harder to continue. I worked very long hours and for the most I loved my job and the pay. If I could change one thing it would be hours of operation.
good,"I learned how to work in a face paced work place with minimum breaks available due to the constant work. "
good,"Working for Fed Ex as a seasonal employee was enjoyable driving around in different areas. Work started around 7am and ended whenever all deliveries where finish. There were many occasions for overtime. I learned how to plan my route, pack a box truck according to the route, and to drive a Penske truck. I think the hardest part of the job was driving the extremely narrow streets I came across and not being able to deliver certain packages because they required two people to lift them. There was opportunity to be picked up by a driver as an understudy, but I was not fortunate enough to be place with one driver long enough."
good,"you clock in go to a pre sort meeting and start working within 10 or so minutes, there is no real motivation other than losing your job or being sent home early, management just wants to push out as much freight as possible before you leave almost no job security, and almost no chances of moving up."
good,"I enjoyed working at FedEx Ground, only problem is that there is favoritism there. The pay is great. I was working as a package handler (unloader) was my first job. I had to unload the trailer by myself, while others had help. I only lasted there if anything a week but I really did enjoy working there & I think I could have lasted even longer but I mean like I said there is a lot of favoritism there."
good,Worked with Fedex for a year and after losing business to Conway been working 7 to 30 hour weeks.  FedEx does not lay off employees they cut your hours and transfer you around to different terminals until you quit.  Bottom 3 drivers get flipped back and fourth between days and nightshift.  Great pay terrible management.
good,"The job is hard on families because the only set time is your start time. Most of your coworkers are cooperative and helpful. Management has gotten very young and sometimes their inexperience is difficult to deal with. Benefits are pretty good, but could use some updating.  They offer tuition reimbursement, but It's only about 1/4 of what other large companies offer."
good,Long hours involved.  Regardless of weather you are required to make deliveries. Management is in over their head.  I work for a contractor so I do not receive benefits of any kind.  This is also the reason I have less experienced managers.
good,"cherry picked, scanned, wrapped pallets."
good,"5 years strong and I still believe that the customer satisfaction I deliver is above all the best experience I've had."
good,"I have worked for FedEx Express in Dallas for 6 months. In this time I have learned that I am just a number and I am completely expendable/replaceable. "
good,the company was alright but felt the cared more about package then about driver. contractors work for FedEx and we as drivers work for them
good,"Overall an okay experience. If you work hard, you're guaranteed a job. People who don't pull their weight will be allowed to do so. Long as you come in on time, you're pretty much there forever. "
good,"I enjoyed my job and most of the people I worked with.."
good,"As a delivery driver it was an ""on time' and at times fast pace job."
good,"A typical day here is going into work not knowing if you are going to even get you part time hours you are there for. the management like to not tell you much of anything at the beginning of each day. when hired i was told 25 hours a week and day by day everything changes and i am lucky to even get twenty if that, a week. hard to live on these hours of fluctuation on a daily basis."
good,"Everyday I would empty trucks or take the items that were too big another belt to go straight to the trucks. "
good,Fedex conducts 3-5 hours shifts. Fast pace work environment where you must maintain awareness to avoid injury and damages. Hardest part of the job is when a team member does not want to be a team player.
good,"Working hard in many different areas of the building is a typical day at Fed-Ex ground. Unfortunately, with the movement of employees and high turnover rate, the training is not as efficient as it should be. The co-workers are excellent, but there is not much room to move up in the company."
good,I come in and do my morning paper work. Then i upload my stops on my scanner and load my boxes into my van. I get to my route in a safe and timely matter and deliver to businesses and residences throughout the day until I'm done.
good,Each day I must retain items from slelves and stock them. I have worked long hours but light in pay this was a temperary position.
good,"Very fast pace, love working there, like the contractors, and drivers, learned many things from this job"
good,"- Con el tiempo se ha ido haciendo monótono y generalmente aburrido. "
good,"No breaks as a Fed Ex driver, not even to eat. Your contractor is the one who tells you what to do at all times if you don't get hired directly with the company. The pay is salary based with contractors. Very fast paced. You get up early, and leave as late as 6 or even later if you don't finish delivering your packages. Management is horrible, but I guess the environment is okay. Look for 10-12 hour shifts during the holiday season!"
good,Benefits are pretty good. Opportunities for advancement are somewhat minimal.
good,that department keep run till done from trailer then get other trailer to goal to hit rate of number.
good,"A typical day would be about 4-5 hours and would be constantly spent on your feet and moving. management would show no respect and very hard to get out of the trailers. Tough to work through the weather, snow in winter and heat in summer."
good,"loaded and unloaded package "
good,"You clock in at the time clock. You then proceed to your designated work area for your ""pre-sort"" this is where your managers explain what you have to do that day and what they expect. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the harsh work environment if it is 100 degrees outside it's 20 degrees hotter in the building, in the winter it is freezing cold."
good,I would like a job that I am willing to succeed in and move up the ladder this job wouldn't allow me to do that reason why I left the job
good,A typical day at FedEx is fast. The faster you go the faster you get done. I learned how to scan and load a delivery truck and learned streets in a town I was not familiar with. Hardest part is having to work a lot of hours with no overtime.
good,"Great company to work for, but it's management choices were less the desireable. Pay is lower than expected , and working environment was awful."
good,"A typical work day consists of unloading packages and organizing them in a certain order.  I learned many things such as, time management skills, logistics, customer service, and hard work.  I had good management who were able to effectively lead, and great co-workers.  The hardest part of the job was to effectively unload and place all the packages in a timely fashion.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the rewarding feeling of unloading and properly placing the packages so it was a smooth offload, and all the drivers were out on the road."
good,"Conferência era uma parte agradavél de trabalhar,mas precisava ter mais mudanças em relação a conferência { aparelhos}"
good,"My day usually spent with the loads in hand and to manage the space on the Aircraft. Apart from that a few hours of customer visits, rate quoting, customer experience."
good,"It was a good job"
good,"Great company, worked for fedex for 18 years, it was my life., Hard work, trying to get into something else"
good,"unload and then go home"
good,"A typical day involved getting up at 4:30am, and heading to the distribution warehouse. Loading the truck by hand with everything we were to deliver that day. Then heading out to the specified route. Once there would get the package run it up to the door then run back to the truck and onto the next one. Till lunch time, then do it all again till the truck was empty."
good,Every day you walk into a new day that is yours to control. It can become challenging at times if you do not have processes in place to keep you on track.
good,"I'm able to do multiple things at one time. I like working in a busy environment. I'm creative and idealistic. I can stand for long periods of time. I can lift heavy objects. My typical day of work is warehouse related. I currently work for FedEx Smart Post part time as a parcel assistant. At FedEx Smart Post my job responsibilities are scanning packages, loading and unloading trucks, building pallets, and overall assuring that packages are shipped to the appropriate location. My co-workers are down to earth and easy to get along with. The management system is laid back. I learned how to multi-task at this job, demonstrate people skills, and listen to instructions vividly. The hardest part of my job is the non-stability of hours. I'm currently seeking for a full-time job with a set work schedule. The easiest part of my job is that it i learn things at a fast pace."
good,A typical day at FedEx consist of loading about 1000 boxes.I have maintain a load rate of 300 or higher. I have learn basic logistics and acquired  the techniqe use for proper heavy lifting. I have learn to train new loaders as well.
good,"a typical day was very strenuous and not worth the pay."
good,"I typically work 12-13 hours a day, loading my truck and delivering packages.  I only interact with co-workers in the morning for about 2 hours while scanning packages and loading my truck.  These 2 hours are not paid for.  90% of the days are great to work, this job is very weather dependent as i am exposed to the temperature and elements all day long.  I have the freedom of being outdoors, stopping for coffee or lunch when I want to. Being employed at FedEx home delivery I actually work for a subcontractor.  I receive a Per Diem wage per delivery made.  I don't receive the benefits or advancement opportunities that most employees get to enjoy.  Small mistakes are harped on much more than necessary and hard work and good work ethic often goes unnoticed and unrecognized."
good,Working on a van line at Fed Ex there was competition every work day. Each van line earn points by keeping the van lines clean and making sure no packages were left behind. The hardest part of my job was working in a hot climate. The most enjoyable part was the parties and rewards we earned.
good,"My day started at 6am and would end around 7pm depending on my work load for the day. I would load my truck and deliver to over a 100 different locations from corporations to residential. The hardest part was the physical labor, but I enjoyed the pay the most."
good,not a good place to work. not a good manage team. it is like a cult there where i used to work
good,"Working at FedEx Ground became stressful in my life. I have been harassed, laid off because of pregnancy causing me to lose all my hours I was building for my vacation."
good,"The hardest part of the job was almost everyday when I had to walk into the job we were always short some people and I had to load two and sometimes three trucks up with boxes by myself. I had to move at a fast pace while doing the three loads and since we only worked 5 hours, there was no lunch break only 15 minutes break."
good,"loading and unloading truck for 4hrs straight and no break, most of the tieyou work on your own while manager watch. if need help you will get help."
good,FedEx is a great company to work for and will give you the tools to succeed. I have learned so much from my experience there and will gladly continue to be successful.
good,FedEx was a job where you met many great people. The best part of the job was being out on your own working everyday.
good,Fedex is not for everyone. Management has it picks and chooses and you sometimes don't work your shift because of the work load which resulted in shorter checks.
good,"keeping up with the huge demand of packages needing to be delivered."
good,"it was typical labor work i was dam good at it had to leave do to school, i was about to start school so they let me go. Thank god."
good,"great place just seasonal only"
good,"I enjoyed some of my time working with FedEx. It was a great workout, but the hours were not conducive to a social life."
good,The least thing I liked about it was it wasnt enough hours. One day I only worked one hour. The main thing I liked about the job was it was consistent. You really work for your money there!!
good,Every Tuesday we would pick up a load in Dallas and head to St. Paul MN. we would run till Saturday and then be off 2 days. I learned that most of the driving public has no idea what it takes to handle an 18 wheeler. Management was good to us. The only co-worker I had was my husband we were a team. The hardest part was getting up very early every Tuesday morning. The best part of the job was I got to spend every day with my husband.
good,"wish it would of lasted longer not ful time employment it stinks"
good,"The work that i was doing was not worth the amount of the pay i was getting , Management was horrible"
good,"this is my opinion from personal experience, can vary from person to person."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of unloading multiple 64 foot semi trucks, followed by scanning packages with a TMS scanner, and lastly sorting bigger or heavier packages between two different conveyor belts in different parts of the hub. "
good,Never a dull day. Work is varied and enjoyable. Great place to work to interact with customers. Enjoyed several training opportunities on management skills. 
good,"Unload/load, scan, process packages. 10 key, data entry, dispatch truckers to and from routes, locked out tailors"
good,A typical day at work consists of going out and taking the containers to the plane and checking the plane for any damages. Making sure all equipment at the plane is in working order all the loaders and scissor lifts are in good standing. I learned that you must always be aware of your surroundings and make sure everyone knows there job. Management is moderate when out at the plane there is no direction I know what needs to be done. My co-workers are great we have a strong efficient team that is precise and always does their job correct. The hardest part of the job is working nights. The most enjoyable part of the job is being out on the aircraft and running all the equipment.
good,"Fast-paced, intense work day, with no breaks, and no job security."
good,Good place to learn. You learn how to use various computer programs.
good,-Typical day at work is basically sorting and arranging mail into correct delivery bins.
good,"a typical day at work is face paced and very busy, The hardest part if the job is loading the packages My co-workers are great help the days pass very fast the most enjoyable part of my job is know that i helped some one get their package. what i learned is teamwork dedication and the world of logistics and management is okay depends on the day"
good,FedEx warehouse workers endure a very hectic work schedule. My shift was from 3:30 am to 8:30-9 depending on when we were done. This position was very useful to me in that I learned what hard work was at age 18.
good,"A typical day you get there at 7am. Unload cans full of packages and mail. Learned how to use a power pad. Most managers (your boss) DO NOT have college degrees. Plus, most of them are very young and not many years experience at the company like the drivers that work for them do...Its very weird. I could understand if they had college degrees, but most do not. If you EVER want full-time it WONT happen anytime soon!!! Drivers that I work with have been here since the 1970's and early 1980's. They will NEVER retire so it sort of sucks for this generation to get full time. There are people here 6 plus years and still part time. Good benefits though just no chance to advance unless you stay at FedEx part time until 2035...."
good,Successfully led a team of sales professionals in Southwest Florida; overseeing sales of the entire FedEx portfolio of transportation services. Revenue responsibilities $120 million per year in both primary and secondary level customer accounts.
good,"Typical work day consist of loading/unloading packages on to, and off trailers. I learned how to keep a calm mind and focus when under pressure from an overwhelming work place. Management overseen workers with strict, but fair demands/expectations. The hardest part of the job I'd say was the loading of the truck trailers, its one of the more fast pace jobs within the warehouse. The most enjoyable part of the job was the management walking around to individuals and letting them know they are doing a great job and that their hard work was valued and appreciated."
good,"The job its self is not hard its the pressure that the supervisors put on you to complete the job in a short period of time, which causes freight to get damaged, or things being mis loaded."
good,FedEx is okay job. My experience wasn't the greatest but it was good job. Management is rarely involved. Supervisors do the majority of labor.
good,Was assigned to work minimum of three hours daily but was reduced drasticallly without notice. I learned how stay positive in a fast paced working environment. Management always kept a positive attitude as long as the work was finished under 2.5 hours. The hardest part of the job was waking up 3 a.m. and only working 2.5 hours each shift. The best part of the job was not experienced by myself due to the lack of hours.
good,It worked well with my school schedule. It also is good for a second job.
good,The work is pretty easy and pay is decent. It can be very fast paced and busy. Management can be very strict on scheduling. If you need something flexible probably not a good fit. Plan to work some holidays and at least one weekend day. Lots of customer interaction.
good,"Security that is by definition a joke. Followed by broken equipment and yet a higher demand to get the job completed with the broken equipment. Managers only care about the numbers. People are not allowed restroom breaks until a manager arrives, which they forget about them 80% of the time. Then when the employee uses the restroom or gets water they are scolded like a child and treated unfairly and UNPROFESSIONALLY. The hardest part of the job was attempting to meet company standards while using broken or unusable equipment and getting scolded my management for not completing your job. The co-workers were the best part, and most enjoyable part. Team players and very friendly would work with you to help at all times."
good,"the pay and benefits are great, however, you are going to trade away your life and sanity for it, so, think before you leap"
good,Working here was difficult as it was during their initial takeover of Watkins. Management was unsure of what was going on and promises were made and broken. It was a very unstable environment. Full-time work was not even guaranteed.
good,"Great PT work. flexible, not employee friendly. Supervisors threaten your job when you are not productive or do WHAT they say."
good,Terminal Manager played favorites with a 21 year old female office secretary
good,It's a good place to work my co workers are very respectful but the management need more improvement on. The hardest part of the job is unloading the trailer truck. From time to time the management would sometime have a cook out in the back of the building. That's something I enjoy about that job.
good,"My typical day at work was fast and a little tiring. not alot but quite. I learn how to load and unload packages in a very organized manor and, how to read scan serial numbers on the packages. Alln the co-workers were friendly. The hardest part of job was lifting 100 lbs items. I enjoyed the managers and superviors they were nice."
good,a typical work day was nice once i had left the building.. I delivered pkgs in a timely manner and maintained customer service. The job tteaches you how to deal with people with all different personalities and backgrounds. Management was ok. The co-workers was ok. There was no hard part to the job unless management made it that way. The most enjoyable part of the job was delivering pkgs and making the customers happy.
good,"I work at a fast paced location that averages about $200,00 per month. I have learned how to manage my employees over the years, how to have excellent customer service skills, how to multi-task. The hardest part of the job is when the customer leaves unsatisfied ."
good,A typical day at work was very fast paced. I only had four hours to load up four delivery trucks. What i learned from that is that you have to stay driven in a fast paced environment. Without that drive an individual will fall behind. The management was hard working and determined and wanted their associates to be the same way. My co-workers were a lot of fun. They made work a place to look forward to coming to. The hardest part of my job was just working in fluctuating temperatures. Since we worked in a warehouse with no heat or a/c. In the summer it was sweltering hot and in the winter in was freezing cold. The most enjoyable part of my job was talking to the delivery drivers and going over their delivery schedule with them.
good,FEDEX offers alot of experience in the inventory/warehouse business. FEDEX offer's many opportunity's as far as learning the different structures withing shipping and receiving and how to move freight and satisfy customers in a timely manner./
good,"Prepare trailers. Start to load trailers as packages come down. The people are great to work with. The work is hard, and I enjoy that. The shifts are short. Sometimes too short. I understand this is because of the volume of packages, but it still is hard. This causes some uncertainty with start and end times. It's always different each day."
good,The pay is ok but it is a lot of work they want you to be done at 5 when your last pick up is at 5. If you ask your Boss for help they get mad at start to talk about how you can't do ur job and u always need help
good,When no one is ever enthusiastic or excited to come to work that’s a problem. And that’s from all 3 shifts. Major micro managing in this company. Under appreciated even when company goals are met.
good,"I worked two weeks as a casual package handler over Christmas time."
good,A typical day at work is very stressful due to no clear direction on what is to be done.  Many managers do not provide any positive feedback to individuals who do positive work. The most enjoyable part is that now after working with a new supervisor I see that those on her team are given the positive feedback they have earned.
good,"You have to load your own truck as well as unload. No weight limit on boxes either. As a manager you are responsible for managing multiple routes, payrol, etc"
good,"The overall job of delivering packages is easy once you get trained. The problem is the company ""doesn't have the hours"" to provide training on the routes, so it's trial by fire. Management is totally incompetent, and would contradict themselves by the minute. That is why I left, poor management."
good,They do not care what other job you have or your scheduling for either job. They want you in or they’ll right you out just as fast. Most coworkers are nice and most managers are supportive. If you can handle some tense energys and the fast paces environment then your good. Plus side they have good benefits if you work long enough.
good,"work hard and keep to yourself."
good,It's an okay place to work if you are looking for a place to just get a check. Over the years culture and moral there has declined. They do not follow up on things as they should. They over work staff and do not show any appreciation for a job well job nor show that employees are valued.
good,"It's tough to describe a typical day. Some days it takes longer to get your truck loaded which can make your day longer because you start delivering later. The technology they are using at the Ft Myers terminal is also horrible. I'm talking about the scanning tool they use for every package. Daily problems with those scanners can ruin a whole workday. Also driving from Ft. Myers to Naples daily is exhausting with weekly accidents occurring on the interstate making your day last even longer. I didn't get paid per hour, but if I did, some days I would average less than $10/ hr.   These reasons, along with 0 benefits is why I didn't continue working for Fedex."
good,I liked it but I’m not interested in working at this place anymore I want to try something new and something different. I am looking for a  decent job where I can love it.
good,"The package handler job is a pretty tough gig but it is what it is. If you need work ot been out of work for a while like I was it'll put some money in your pocket. You'll never work more than an 7 hour shift, so no worries about paid lunch or overtime. Typical hours per week is 26-30, per day 4.5-6.5 but as we get closer to the holidays that will pick up. Most people quit right away because they don't realize how demanding it is. Management is fair, they were always helpful and professional with me. Even helped me transfer areas when I was briefly overwhelmed with the work load. The prospects for package handler are kinda bleek. Can really only be promoted to ops manager. The benefits won't kick in until 1000 hours and at 30 hours a week, well. Like I said if you need a job they will give you a shot. Don't take it if you don't think you can hang though, no fair to the people who are putting in the work."
good,"Does not appreciate good employees. Will rush you to complete work but get upset when there's and error from being rushed.You can talk to hr/management about issues you're having but nothing will be done to change it. They want you to stay at work and do overtime whenever they say so but you get in trouble for clocking out 1 minute late on days they don't need OT. Very indecisive. Not understanding of unforeseen issues for part time employees (deaths, sick, car trouble). You will still get wrote up even with notes and proof of things happening. No breaks or time off for part time employees."
good,The schedule is awkward because you really dont have any family time due to there work schedules. job advancements is all based on who you know but the overall experience is good as well as the pay.
good,Need more money n better hiring. Plus ethics are bad And delivery trucks could be upgraded. Chance to advance would be better as well...less non sense.
good,"My manager was worried about being everyone's friend. I sat behind her and if someone called off, she told other employees what was going on in their personal lives. I can only imagine what she said about me when I was in an accident and voluntarily resigned.  The whole Dept was cliques and being the best at the job didn't matter. I worked in PGH, Memphis appreciated the hard work."
good,Wasnt really safe to work there talk about team work big on it in beginning then 3-4 trucks a night alone none of that team work was an actual thing i like to be appreciated for my work ser other people getting appreciate for my work taking credit or people not working as hard getting appreciated really brings you down as a worker
good,"The job is very physically demanding and exhausting. Some managers are kind and understanding, others are very ignorant and overly demanding. Overall a good work team"
good,The job of delivering packages is extremely fast-paced and detail oriented. There is also a bit of customer service involved in the field. Peak time with packages is the most stressful time of the year with this job at Fed-Ex
good,"not a good  place to work"
good,"The people who work at the location I worked at were mostly good workers and mostly Nice People."
good,"No room for advancement unless you are in good with management , it’s all about favoritism there . They don’t do anything by seniority unless it benefits them . If you work there you will be part-time for ever"
good,"About the only way one can typically advance to another position in this company is when somebody else leaves. For some positions, this can be very rarely. So, oftentimes, one is stuck in the same position with little hope of advancement for years and years until a position opens up. Then they better hope they are first in line for it and management likes them enough to let them have it. "
good,You are sub contracted. No benefits and hourly pay will not come out to be that much. You will work 50 hours a week and feel like you didn’t make any money for that time
good,"Most of management does not care about the employees that work there. I think it is just that facility, I felt the tension in there the first week I was in there."
good,"hardest part of the job is to deal with the weather we have no ac or heaters, we work no mater the conditions. you learn to work hard work long, if you want more work there is more work available. i enjoy the freedom to show up to work as early as i want."
good,Working as a contractor is bad you getting up in the Fitz no health insurance no life insurance and you can pay by the day you work until your shift is done or another words into you deliver all your packages
good,"Go in, load packages, go home.  Sometimes shifts ran 4 - 4 1/2 hrs and other times they scaled people out early.  "
good,"You get a consistently good paycheck. The contractors are all different, you usually end up working 6 days a week though. No benefits, I worked there a year and was only granted a weeks vacation with NO pay which technically isnt a vacation. peak season (christmas time) is the WORST. You have to deal with long drive ways, vicious dogs, and stuck up customers. The bright side is that you can take lunch whenever you want, you dont have a boss breathing down your neck all day, and if you learn your route it gets pretty smooth. A typical day at work is you come in sort out your boxes, and load your van, check your van for infrafactures, fill up, and begin deleivring ."
good,"Long hours, high stress, poor work/life balance for managers.  Good benefits and discounts (i.e. hotel, air, rental cars, tuition reimbursement and vacations)."
good,"FedEx is a great company but the way it is being managed is an absolute shame.  Some managers are bullies, have no people skills when speaking with associates, and take out their personal problems on people at work.  When you speak up for yourself, you get assigned complicated tasks and treated like dirt."
good,"Working at Fedex is a very fast paced job where you are evaluated by performance with varying work loads compared to others. The management is required to reach a specific quota per day so some days you may have to work faster or help with other coworkers if needed. The management is a bit disorganized and you may get sent to different sessions depending if you are needed there. A typical day at work involves signing in at a required time, hearing the quota for the day, getting scanners ready, and working with coworkers to achieve the task. The workplace culture strives for safety but coworkers may get frustrated and adversely affect the environment. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting the work done early and having a small break in between. Typically, workers are required to stack packages along a conveyor belt and load them into a truck in a symmetrical fashion. I learned how to be efficient and mange tasks effectively in a given amount of time which is a good skill to have."
good,"great people to work with,great work out and short shifts.i liked working here , just not somewhere icould stay and live of love the rush and workout."
good,A typical day would be loading and closing out trucks for delivery. I have learned that teamwork is always better than working alone. Management didn't help out too much.
good,"Run by females, openly racist coworkers when I worked at the Ensminger Road location. Practically required employees to sell their souls for the profit of Fedex."
good,"FedEx is falling behind the times and management does not know how to catch up. If you work here you better know how to play the politics game. I will admit there is a lot of flexibility on work and life balance but again it is very dependent on what department you work in. I would not recommend this company for young people looking to be innovative and make changes. If you want a stable job with relatively good benefits and no real career advancement this is the place for you,"
good,"its like going to a gym but getting paid. High paced job that requires you to be fast and safe while moving 1,200 per an hour at unload and load will need to be at 400 an hour."
good,It was a poorly managed center. The company itself was a great experience. My coworkers were great people and made the experience last. Management was tough to deal woth
good,"Ok to wo"
good,"I thought it was a great place to work until I was promoted. As a package handler, I loved meeting some of the people who also worked there. Generally every package handler is nice and helpful. I was promoted close to a year ago and the job made me severely depressed afterwards. They switched my hours without asking me or asking if it would conflict with anything in my personal life. I asked to switch back and all I got was ""We'll put you where WE need you."" But what about what I need? Not to mention the Higher Ups don't care about their employees at all, they just want to see numbers. They want high load rates, no missed packages, and perfect cubes, and they scream at anybody who can't do it. Then they expect you to fire somebody for not working fast enough, when they just got yelled at by your boss, who treated them like dog turds."
good,Work was always great and different everyday. I was always walking and working out and very fast paced We did work a lot and six days a week for ten to twelve hours a day.
good,If your just trying to get some extra money go for it. Other than that if you don’t plan on making a career out of it no need to put yourself through this stressful job if you don’t have to.
good,"The job was split shifts and management did not care about you at all, you literally where just a number, they barely knew my name, what a shame. money was decent though."
good,"Did a few months at Fed ex & it was okay at 1st until my back started hurting after 2 weeks of loading trailers my back started hurting , that’s what happens when you don’t use team lift . I hated when they used to pull my off my trailer to help someone than my trailer get backed up like come on bruh I need help stacking my wall of boxes 📦 too "
good,un mal sueldo para lo que desempeña  cada trabajador.
good,freight comes down belt sort freight put away numerically. Check cleared freight list provided by US customs or Fish and Wild Life department put on belt to send it on its way
good,Company itself is great. Good pay and benefits and pretty good raises.  Biggest problem is the management and people not the company. Zero accountability for anybody and can easily be a truck driver here that doesn't even know what the warning symbols in the dash mean and you will have a job for life.
good,"This is a physical job.  require a lot a lifting and pulling, which did give me my exercise for the day.  Very diverse area to work for which is GREAT.  Very physical demanding job"
good,I would work for them again even though I didn’t get any benefits. Helped me lose a lot of weight and get back in shape. I would recommend to friends and family.
good,"Sufrí una mala experiencia estando aquí de ahí mi motivación de salir "
good,"The leadership is different between contractors.  Barrette Inc was one of the worst managed companies that I have worked for.  They did not believe in working together as a team.  They did not provide me or others with the right equipment to do our job.  I had to fix my own truck when broke.  I had to teach myself to be efficient.  If you believe that I am just angry at this company then please by all means go find out for yourself.  They money was good.  No benefits at all.  No paid time off.  No sick days paid.  Very fast pace.  If you are a good self started and like to work Saturdays and six days a week during the holidays, then this job is for you.  During the peak season I worked very hard six days a week.  I had no life."
good,The company is so afraid of lawsuits from employees that management spends most of its time dealing with HR issues.  Too much time being politically correct.
good,I was an OTR driver there and I understand that people pay extra for expedited service but don't call my phone 4-5 times in 3 hours telling me to move when the roads are unsafe to travel on!
good,One to three years max lifespan of a regular driver. Expectations are high and morale is always low. Pay can be good driving for a good contractor but if not expect to be suckered into extra work with no extra compensation.
good,"Too many occasions where management makes the decision to either send you home, or, have you not even come in, so you don't get paid, and you're on your own as far as how you're supposed to survive.  Maybe this is ok for someone who's still living at home, with no real responsibilities."
good,Stressfull working nights and took time away from family activities.Fellow employees looking over your shoulder to see what work you were assigned. too long of a commute 50 miles 1-way
good,Great place but only problem was that job security is lack of and the management was not up to par to where as tho they would train you well enough to make sure job is done right
good,If it wasn't for the outstanding benefits that are offered I honestly would not still be employed at Fed Ex Smart post.  The management staff is very lazy an unprofessional.just plain awful.
good,"The working culture amongst the employees is good but the management style was very reactive."
good,"A typical day at FedEx is fast pace. I learned how to stay clam under pressure.By setting a goal it makes the work day easier to map out.Having a manager who is on call until the last driver returns makes the job easier as well. The hardest part of the job is not knowing if their will be a late truck, or having a company wide system crash. Although those are factors out of my control it still falls on me to get everything delivered.The workplace culture is friendly and competitive. Their are contractors who will offer you better intensives to work for them. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you have a manageable stop count and I can get in and out of the building without any problems."
good,"Good company to work for if you become a driver, dock workers in my opinion should be single and have no kids. Benefits are good but not great, and the supervisors have a ""country club"" type of attitude, meaning if they don't like you they'll keep you from progressing."
good,The benefits are fantastic but this is a high stress job. Constant understaffed in most departments. There are a lot of changes happening right now in the company.
good,"tell you one thing, turn around and they say something differrent. atmosphere can be tumoltuous at times and if you dont watch your back, no one will."
good,I learned how to be very organized and work in a very fast work environment. This job is not for everyone in order to be good at this job you have to be aware of your environment and adaptable to situations.
good,The entire place was segregated where a lot of women were in management and the men dominated from senior to tenured whereas the females driver is left grappling from trying to figure who's on first and so on.  Mixed together with any minority group or something like a young male feeling the sting too!!
good,"Empresa de grande porte, dinâmica boa,atenta aos funcionários e ao serviço."
good,I enjoyed working at Fed Ex once I got the hang of the drivers preference in loading the trucks for deliveries.  I worked during the holidays so that was very fast paced.  Since it was part time it was hard to keep good people unless you were a college student.
good,Management would only give a driver 5 min to pick-up and delivery at every stop. Sometime imposable to do. Would have to go back to a stop two and three times.
good,"Work Long hours, no breaks or lunch. Have to stay out late until all packages are picked up and delivered. Not enough pay for all the hours you work. No Benefits."
good,"Fed Ex was ok to work with, but they got to were they were dictating the warehouse.  Management did not have control.    The teammates that I worked will was a great group of people."
good,"Los sueldos son bajos , no promueben al personal en base a experiencia o conocimiento sino de la afinidad o amistad."
good,"When i started working here i loved it. it is a fast paced job with decent pay and benefits. Sort of like getting paid to work out. However over the past year or so it has gone downhill, fast. The management has either stopped caring how well the day is going or cant handle the responsibilities in order to make it better. They have push away a ton of new and old package handlers forcing the rest of the work on the remaining ones, further pushing them to their limits. Like i said when its running well its a good job, but many are running for the door."
good,"The company workplace culture is stressful and extremely faced paced.  Most drivers are not able to take breaks in order to complete the shift.  Once a week, you may be required to stay two hours over your shift to do a late pick up."
good,"Not applicable do not wish to give a review,  poor judgement on who was selected as the CEO of sites and favoritism within HR is not fair to employees,  this company does NOT give equal rights nor do they provided or given fair treatment."
good,Job was stressful in number of stops compared to hours in day management was constantly changing co workers would help one another in rare occasions work facelty got alot better once it relocated everyone was friendly
good,Early mornings sorting of packages for daily residential and commercial delivery. Re-packing damaged package. Re-labeling packages with wrong destination address label.
good,"I didn't know what I was getting into when i applied for the job. The job is very fast pace, sometimes they would get upset if you couldn't unload a trailer by yourself in a certain amount of time. The pay is very low for the work they expect of their employees."
good,"As a package handler, you don't get treated as well as the drivers.  It is a great part=time job for students since it pays well and has different shifts available. Safety is rated high and most coworkers work well together.  Team lifting is encouraged on heavy boxes/packages.  Being a great team player makes this job efficient and somewhat fun."
good,"FedEx is a job that requires one to be physically fit and quick. The packages rarely stop coming down the conveyor belt and you have a time that you need the packages to be sorted so that they can be shipped. The money I is decent for a high school student but if you are an adult with a family this job would not be sufficient unless you were in a higher paying position."
good,A typical day at work is very unorganized. started off with a pre shift about the previous days results and the goals for the day. Upper management has no idea how to keep the shifts organized from day to day operations and will blame the shift supervisors for poor performance. The hardest part is knowing you will get blamed for something before you even clock in for the day.
good,"My typical day at work is back to back calls, within 1sec between calls, learned how to have perfect listening skills and saying the customers name correctly. Otherwise you would be scored off. The new management is good and easy to get along with, understanding and very proactive. There is no hard part of the job other than being there and taking calls one at a time and showing empathy."
good,The tone that  some people in management set in the workplace was very unpleasant. I did learn a lot from my supervisor he was very helpful in helping me advance to another level.
good,"its ok, not the best place to work. if you need to make some easy money then its just right for that. some of the hours are ridiculous, if you don't have a family then its cool.not much room for advancement but you get annual raise regardless"
good,"We go by how much arrives in the yard. One day we could be doing a 4-5 hr job, the next a 2-3 hr job. Depending on where you are in the building, depends on how hard the work is."
good,"Fedex was relaxed about dress codes, at the facility I worked at there was 7 managers and only 2 of them were good with their management skills for their employees. The other 5 were constantly on Facebook and Twitter on their phones not paying any attention to their employees."
good,"Easy money, easy work, as long as you don’t let the other people get to you, which they will. Management is very dumb and you can tell they think they don’t do much about anything."
good,"This location was a typically male dominated workplace and made no if, ands about it. I learned alot about Hazmat shipments and I loved the drivers themselves. Management was the ones that were male dominated and I understand it is not that way at all locations."
good,I enjoy FedEx  just don't like not having any benefits. I enjoy building a relationship with my customers. Just a some better management and more time looking into some of the routes that have grown.
good,"This company is a great if your in the right location or city but the work culture is not as fair as it seems to put on. I started out as a part time dock worker and begin the driver apprentice program and have been a driver for 12 plus years. While being a driver I completed my Bachelors Degree in Business Management and since I have not been provided an opportunity for advancement while others around me have, even though they do not have my LTL experience, seniority or my educational background. Instead I have been told to apply outside my center in order to give  myself a chance at advancement. Relocation is not in the cards at this point in time but others who have been promoted in my same center did not have to transfer or relocate. There has not been a driver promoted within the last ten years at my center."
good,"tell you one thing, turn around and they say something differrent. atmosphere can be tumoltuous at times and if you dont watch your back, no one will."
good,I only worked her temporary and it was okay as a second job. Couldn't imagine working here long term or as a primary job. It didn't pay enough and hours aren't great.
good,Very military in every way.  Did not inspire any critical thinking in my field.  Great corporate opportunity and to learn the airline culture.  Experience good.
good,Entreprise très mal organisée et beaucoup de méchanceté gratuite.
good,Had a great career but its physically draining! Very challenging for those who have a family with young children. Great benefits and raises but I need less stressful environment.
good,"i had a great time working here bbut the job security wasn't good at all. My supervisor decided to give the route i was driving, back to the person who had is before me. The only explanation given (verbatim) was that he had to many drivers so i had to go."
good,Good learning experience with room to grow if that is what you want. Hours are horrible but you are well compensated in return. fast paced  working environment.
good,"Very fast paced, you really need to be able to multitask and be quick as well as solve problems very quickly without anyone helping you. Management was horrible."
good,"Managers did not have a good grasp on employee workload and capacity. Everything is priority. Tenured managers stayed in their roles into their 70's, making for a lack of advancement opportunity. Some managers are very good and supportive but they are in the minority. The culture is good at the top but there's an assumption that it trickles down, which it does not do. The turnover was extremely high during 2015 and 2016 (not sure if it still is) but senior leadership dismissed it as a non-issue. It's a great place to get acquainted with the fundamentals of sourcing and procurement. It looks great on your resume. But there are much better sourcing organizations out there that have a more realistic view of workload and provide you better tools to do your job."
good,"Nice place to work, fast paced fast action. not for slow people or people unable to keep up in that kind of enviornment. It's a good job to pick up extra hours, extra pay for the holidays."
good,"Great team to work with.  The operations people have a high business acumen with growth always in the forefront.  Third party margins can be lean, so resources are always at a premium."
good,I liked some of the people there but it seems like either you have to kiss a** or know someone to advance there. It wasn't based on your performance. Some of the hardest workers remained in the trailers and the only thing you receive for employee of the month is a parking spot up front and a water bottle. The labor is really hard on your body.
good,"The overall company is good, but the stress level is high.  The pressure to hit unreal goal is also very high.  The managers are pushed extremely hard and it leads to pressure on the hourly employees."
good,"I worked at FedEx close to 4 years, I left because there was no job advancement, the hours were great for a part time job. I worked by myself most of the time I was there."
good,They work you until you want to quit.  Pressured to make sales even though you were a support team.  Stressed out from management pushing you all the time.
good,"This place is full of people who are sitting around waiting on retirement. It’s very top heavy and the hiring and advancement process is sometimes based completely on personal relationships or connections. If you take a job here don’t expect to get promoted for at least 5-10 years no matter how hard you work. That is of course unless you have a personal connection to someone in management. The pay is okay for the area , but the benefits are becoming less competitive compared to other companies of this size."
good,None of the higher ups listen to what could make the building better. Management cares more about production then the well being of their staff. Management lets the line back up and then blames it on the workers even though management could have prevented it.
good,"Good company with good intentions.  "
good,"* Daily routines filled with maintaining deliveries on time."
good,Good processes. Hard Work. Lower pay. Basically moving boxes.  The culture in management is very competitive with a healthy load of negative interactions and back stabbing
good,"A typical day was coming in load trucks it wasn't a fast paced job."
good,Over the past couple of years fedex turned into a numbers only company.  They did not care about there people.  Especially management.  Almost impossible to get promoted.
good,"no real chance for advancement or full time employment, i enjoyed mang, but never felt like I would be given the opportunists that were discussed with me."
good,It's a nice job but with no benefits it's kind of a downer but it keeps my bills paid and I'm not out all hours of the night but the job could b much easier it's lack of trucks and workers
good,i liked working for the company however the long shift hours were not all that good couldnt leave when my shift ended had to leave when they said i could and wasnt getting paid any overtime
good,Driving all over the US and Canada delivering interesting things and meeting a lot of neat people for FedEx Custom Critical was very enjoyable.  The hardest part of the job was being away from home a lot and missing some funerals and as time went on it seemed harder to secure good loads.
good,"The hub management can be unfair at times without any repercussion, even if they are wrong. Favoritism plays a role in the unfairness a lot. The upper management (i.e managing director) cares a lot more about the employee than the lower management (i.e Hub Mangers and sr. Managers)"
good,"Lot of work around holidays. Fast paced, long hours with little time at home."
good,Lack of organization. Managers more concerned about their bonuses n no interest in employee hrs. Satisfactory team work. Demand of moves with the ration of help in their timely manner was very frustrating.
good,"Honestly Fedex is a hard labor job, and I'm fine with that but not for that pay, especially the way the management treats you. I hurt my eye really bad and they refused to let me leave to go to the doctor."
good,If working for a contractor there is chance for only working short-term but the job is really busy during holidays and other days are just regular delivery. You really depend on the customers to keep the business afloat.
good,Working at FedEx is very harsh. You work very long hours for very little pay. I would show up at 3 in the morning and wouldn't get off until after 8. It's not a very family friendly place. I had to deal with not getting paid for a day just to take my baby's mother to the hospital.
good,just couldn't get enough hours to get by. Also can be difficult hours to work around depending on your daily life schedule. Not the worst job actually.
good,"Good people, great work, hours are good, hard to get on full time. Supervisors have very little to do with employees other than to rate their progress, hire, or fire them."
good,"Working at fedex was not for me the pay was great but the labor was not fun, always having to deal with so many bruises on your legs and cuts on your hands."
good,"On a typical day at work, it could be a good day or a bad day, it just depends on the amount of packages that has to be shipped out. Other than that is still will be a long and tiring night. What I learned was what boxes go which belt and how to move at a fast pace. Besides that, management was pretty good, she would encourage us to keep going, and even get on the line and help with the packages. The workplace culture was okay. The hardest part about the job was lifting and moving packages all day without no breaks and the most enjoyable part was getting to know my co workers and getting off."
good,"This job is not for everyone. If you like being away from home and sleeping at truck stops, it's the job for you. I have been driving for over seven years now and I am ready to have a regular job and be home daily. I miss having a routine and being able to get a regular paycheck."
good,I had to get packages off the conveyor belt and scan them to see what skid they went on .Most of the time you are the only one working on the line. You don't get to leave until every package on every line is where it belongs. Even if your shift is over.
good,Outbound calls to small and medium size businessez to gain add more shipping services. Hardest part of the job was making dials sometimes based on long talk times. Culture was good and everyone encouraged each other to pusht themselves.
good,"Performance based job, with fast paced environment. Great HR department that does take care of it's employees. Great benefits not offered at most companies."
good,It was a job. Income over the winter. Managers were nice but lacked management skills. Pay was terrible for the work being done. Shift hours were inconsistent. No real options for advancement.
good,"Great benefits,great pay.  Management has no people skills.  Treat part time employees badly, which explains why they have a large turn over.  Part time employees stay part time."
good,"aprendi a manejar mi habla con las personas , relacionarme con ellas y atender bien al cliente"
good,"Nice workplace .Employees of the company is very clam and nice with others.managers are also helpful.Working hours from morning 10 to 5 or 6 "
good,"A typical day at FedEx Ground is simply just constant loading and unloading of packages until everything is out. The management is pretty poor, they make very questionable decisions regarding planning, as in how they decide to get things done. When it comes to workplace culture, there is practically none to speak of. The hardest part of the job is getting used to being so physical after your first day, the job is very physically demanding. The easiest part of the job is the work itself. What I learned from working for FedEx is simply that working for a good corporation doesn't mean the job is enjoyable or that the staff and management are good about keeping people working there."
good,when i first started this job it was enjoyable.  then when my first year  anniversary came along i was informed that all wage progressions have been discontinued and we were only getting 2% raises every year if you meet your criteria on your evaluations.
good,this job is ok to work for.  you dont get very many hours and the pay isnt that great but its great for you if you are still enrolled in school or have a different job that you go to.
good,"The job overall wasn't bad, how ever my experience went sour after one winter when I became sick and couldn't work for a week. So when i finally came back later that week i was 5 minutes late and was fired for it."
good,"it is not bad, but very fast paced. supplies benefits and vacation time for employees. but very little incentive to actually improve work ethics. high turnover rate."
good,"Fed Ex is a fast paced job, No two days are the same."
good,"Would have about 120 stops in total, up to about 140 or so packages to be delivered most days. A lot of walking and lifting is involved but you become very comfortable with the people around you."
good,"For most people FedEx is a really good job, but for me it not somewhere I feel I can really use all of my best skills to the fullest."
good,Work was not too bad just not enough room for growth in the company wish I was able to advance further but also a lot faster.It is a fine company and I am blessed to be able to be given that chance to work with them
good,A typical work day includes loading packages and scanning packages. The environment is warehouse logistics typical. This job also requires you to be in all types of elements of the weather. You would fuel up and start your day delivering packages. There is no real time for socializing with co-workers . The hardest part of the job is loading and unloading heavy parcels . The most enjoyable part of the job is getting paid.
good,"Keep in mind, I worked for a subcontractor (AT&R Enterprises), not FedEx corporate. If you put your mind to it, give it 3/4 weeks, you will have a great job with a decent pay. It takes dedication and hard work, you have to *want* it, but it is worth it."
good,"Working in a warehouse environment with extremely physical work that has to be done quickly to get mail to customers.  Not much compensation and mostly part-time work.  There is some opportunity for advancement, but it is difficult to advance unless you are willing to relocate.  Good for a part-time job if you have other sources of income."
good,Pensando também um pouco em seus colaboradores a cada três meses faziam uma lembrancinha para os Aniversáriantes com premiação para o funcionário do mês
good,"For working at FedEx Home Delivery, the job is well established by contractor, though the overall job is very time consuming, and pays great, but no benefits. The warehouse does not operate well."
good,"If you want to progress you have to relocate every 18 months. Benefits are outstanding. Get into P and D if possible, the work balance is a lot more manageable."
good,"short shifts for short pay for doing overwhelming work"
good,A place do develop your experience in logistics and office work. Shifts are demanding. Major downfall is management. A lot of the male managers are unprofessional and absolutely tend to take advantage of female employees. There is a serious lack of respect when it comes to management and their employees.
good,hard work but get you right this job at the time was one of the jobs i had a great time at the people was cool an i loved it wile it lasted.
good,"todas las áreas se mantienen en comunicación, esto da como resultado la solución de problemas que surgen inesperadamente, y en el caso de que lleguen a existir problemas entre los empleados se busca tener un ambiente que ayude a que fluya el trabajo de una manera agradable."
good,FedEx used to be a great company with great pay and benefits until they stopped caring about their employees and only focus on profit and the number of deliveries made each day.
good,"Good job if you like to do physical work. There is limited potential for advancement but they will tell you otherwise. The work schedule is based on the incoming packages. Overall, a good place to work but don't expect to move up unless you are friends with the right people."
good,"This place has excellent benefits for employees, they work their employee to the ground, timing is very strict. Working with fedex is good for college student that is looking for good benefits while in school"
good,I liked the fact that you work independently  and was able to work at your own speed.  The overnight crew had lots to keep you busy so your always busy.
good,a very fast pace all work shift. i learned a lot of lifting techniques .everyone helped each other and you get a free work out
good,FedEx freight is in desperate need of a union. Guys have been getting mistreated and released for unfair work practices. Their policies are not fair and consistent. The rules and guidelines change day to day and depending on the employee. Pay rate is good benefits are horrible and have gotten worse every year.
good,It is very difficult to make lateral movements within the Local Dept and the quickest route to advancement is through the actual Driver opportunities.
good,A usual day was we gathered for a brief meeting before we did the sort and then we headed to our work stations. I didn't really get to know my co-workers that well since I worked alone most of the time. The work was very tiresome but you get a lot of exercise.
good,"There is never a typical dull day at FedEx, this a fast paced job that demands you keep up with it. From loading to unloading to delivering packages you'll never be bored."
good,"Contract work. No benefits...at all. You don't work and don't get paid."
good,"they kind of look more at numbers then employee hours, that they don't get during there shift. The job had lots of pressure but most times we got all the pallets in place for truck loading on time.."
good,"Uma boa empresa em questão de benefícios, pagamento certinho, no 5º dia útil ou até antes, paga hora extra e boas oportunidades."
good,FedEx Ground was a good place to work. There were many great benefits and the hours were so that you can work full time or part time. One was able to make their own schedule and work as they wanted
good,This job is the most demanding job I have ever held. So much so that most tasks are not even achievable. The management team is somewhat unresponsive to concerns.
good,"Job Work/Life Balance is OK OK"
good,I would have to say that this job was pretty okay. but there are a lot of favoritism for certain individuals. Unloading was a good workout. You had help less (team work) than what we should have.
good,"My day begins with assisting my Team in the daily operations of Custom Brokerage. I am responsible for queue management, various reporting of all kinds, and making sure my Team stays on task and meets or exceeds daily goals. I report directly to the ECO Manager. I am assigned multiple task from the ECO Manager in which must be completed in a timely manner. I lead team meetings and help aid in making sure policy,procedures, and all changes that directly affect the operations of our business, remain current and are implemented. I work along six other Team Leads and am in constant communication in regards to helping and assist each others team members. One of the most challenging parts of my job is not having the power to control what happens with a customers shipment once it leaves my department. Once my department processes,  the shipment moves to another queue and is out of my reach. If the customer has an issue afterwards, I am extremely limited on the help that I can provide. I would like to know that at the end of the day, all the shipments that my team processed where delivered and the customer beyond satisfied. What I enjoy most about my job is being blessed with being a part of helping one my team members grow in their current positions and reach a level of successful that they feel good about."
good,"Pre load would start before the actual shift and we would get as much done as possible to make it easier for the actual shift. Once the shift started it would vary from minimal slow work to hectic and too much work for our area to handle. "
good,"unload trucks,inbound packages,then van scan packages, load drivers trucks, scan and load pallets, stretch wrap pallets, train temp and new employees."
good,its a part time job would work only 2 to 3 hours due to work being slow only more hours when holidays would come. you come in at the time you must punch in for work and when job was done early each employee was forced to punch out. not good management. They wouldn't treat you well there knowing the hard work each employee does especially when unloading trailers from packages weighting from 50 to 250 pounds
good,"I did not enjoy working at FedEx ground. The pay was alright, but the whole time that I did work there. I was constantly having to watch my every movement inside the trailer to make sure that I didn't hurt myself. Plus, when it would get really hot in the trailer, I almost wanted to faint. Plus, I was getting stressed out because my trailer was being bombarded by boxes 24/7"
good,My co-workers were nice.  In fact I made quite a few good friends in there.  We were always busy everyday.  The best thing about FedEx is the working hour because it's a guaranteed Monday to Friday schedule.
good,"A typical day at work.  Check in at 730.  Unload the freight truck.  Load my truck and begin my route at 850.  Deliver my 1030 or 1200 service depending on my route.  Work until about noon or 1230 before taking lunch.  Then from there work afternoon deliveries and pick ups.  Return to station on most routes between 430 and 6."
good,Decent people for the most part and good company that is growing a lot.Qulaity of life is good too. Company supports out of the box thinking and encourages new ideas.
good,"Moving frieght in all kinds of adverse weather,heavy lifting,this job is only part-time and can get slow around the holidays"
good,Job was not that bad.  But with the lack of training it made the job very difficult.  The hours were not bad.  Some of the management wasn't to bad
good,"i really enjoyed my time at Fedex, its been a great learning experience. Its extremely hard work and not for the faint of heart, but i feel like a job like this builds character"
good,"repair trailer brakes, abs, electrical, panel work, frame repairs, tire inflation system. all other repairs as needed, pm service. how to make all repairs for trailers. learned to manage shop. worked well with co-workers. few parts in stock. making repairs to keep trailers running."
good,decent job with decent pay no benefits and 55+ hour work weeks lots of driving but pretty easy job. 600 a week salary pay. Do it if you starting out or dont have a family.
good,"A day consist of loading and unloading cargo for a conveyor belt, platform, or a shoot where packages or mail are sent from. This was a repetitive job, the focus was speed and accuracy. "
good,Great place if one loves to work by themselves. Benefits are offered even if you work part time.  The hardest part for me is actually working alone most of the day.  A lot of people enjoy that aspect.
good,"Generate new business"
good,"Heavy lifting and and careful handling of packages is a MUST."
good,This location is a very fast pace work environment. Little to no down time. Very high expectations and deliverable. Great co-workers but managers with very aggressive management styles.
good,"It is a good organization but I am not motivated at all because of no growth and low salary despite the fact that I have been awarded with star employee awards many times and my management and my boss is satisfied with me. Management is lingering on my promotion which is due now for about more than half a year."
good,"Learned a great deal, something new happens every day, worker with plenty of good people, meet new interesting costumers every day, customer interaction was great, hardest part was interaction with management"
good,"I think my summary says it all. It was a great company to get me through the college years; flexible, decent enough pay, and a tuition assistance program. I was promoted once, but due to conflicting class schedule I eventually had to elect to demote myself. As it happens, that's a career killer. I eventually got a straight answer that the terminal manager expected me to leave eventually, and being re-promoted wasn't in the cards, which, in the end, worked out just as well."
good,great company and co workers. great pay and hours. Enjoy most of my days at this company.
good,Get ready for a fast paced job. This career demands a lot of hard work.
good,Long hours. The pay was good.  No advancement opportunities.  No clear expectations.  Little feedback.
good,punch in and get assignment. start by ensuring forklift is in working order. the hardest part of the job is removing pallets that are scattered throughout the trailer.
good,"8-14 hr days."
good,was a job i had at school for work study it was only for two month but it was ok for the time period
good,Busy.  Pay invoices. Research problems.  Call customers. Input data.
good,this was temporary while looking for other employment in my field.
good,"Go in, scan boxes, put them on pallets, leave."
good,It was a great job but was only part time which made it hard to make it a job to really have
good,"The job is never hard at all. But depending on the manager they can make your job difficult for no apparent reason. I have been with the company for 8 years and have had some great managers but there are certain places within the company that hurt your career. Ellenwood, GA is a terrible place and a outdated facility. They throw countless packages and walk on moving belts all the time. In order to save productivity they cut package handlers and have managers fill and load countless doors to cover up the fact they was not productive during the sort as a whole. No one works together and in the past year 5 managers have stepped down and moved on."
good,"Transport freight across dock area to/from trailers for loading to trailers."
good,"not the best for a person with a family."
good,"Typical day: start time of 4 a.m., presort meeting about not getting hurt and how presort meetings had become hilarious. Get to specified trucks to load or unload. Talk with co-workers about the volume of packages for the day, then proceed to get physically, mentally, emotionally, and - on occasion - spiritually assaulted by aforementioned volume. Emergency stop is pulled, a co-worker curses out a boss until they actually do something, then start right back up with minimal changes. End of sort, loading last minute boxes while drivers shout about the lack of professionalism in the workplace. Finish, go home, sleep."
good,"My day is a 5-8 hrs aday job depending on the volume of freight that has to be processed. I have all the required knowledge to complete my job on a day to day basis. My co workers are mostly young, some are friendly, and enjoyable to be around. The  hardest part of the job is dealing with the weather , the extream heat and extream cold, and rain. As this is  an outside job. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I help to deliver transplant material in a timely manner so that a life my be saved."
good,I really felt like we were a large family in the forecasting department. It seemed the new director was not fond of me and did not see me in his plans for the directorate
good,A package handlers load and unload trucks and help sort the packages for shipment to another ups center or delivery.  The most think I learned while working in FedEx was that it's not what people make it to be. For Example FedEx Ground employees doesn't really work for FedEX company. The only person that works for the company is the contract. Also there no benefit at all when you work for Ground.  Fedex Express does get all the benefit that the company gives. The management was not to good in my eyes. I enjoy working with my co-workers that was the only best part of the job. The hardest part was lifting more than 75 pounds. The most enjoyable part was being able to be outside and enjoy the warm weather.
good,"Great Work Place, just no job stability, Expanded scope of work, good and bad."
good,My starts by assisting Accounts Excutives with establishing accounts for clients or prospective clients. the most difficult part of this job is the advancement can be taken at anytime and you stagger back in place over years of striing with this company.
good,Not a secure place of employment. There is a lot of finger pointing and threats from management. Every employee at the Fed Ex station I work at is miserable with their job.
good,great company but pay was lacking. A lot of manual labor and driving was required at this job. I was very good at my job but decided to move on to another opportunity.
good,"A typical day is responding to client issues, such as billing issues, taking payments, and researching lost packages."
good,"I worked at FedEx Express as a package handler, started out at $12.25/hr. Work started at 2-3AM depending on how busy it was going to be. I worked during the winter months. Boxes are constantly coming at you and you need to stack fast while making sure that those boxes are scanned and belong in your canister. I learned that it doesn't matter if you work extremely hard for a job advancement because if the guy/girl working next to you started the day before, even if they do the bare minimum, they are first in line for job advancement due to seniority. Also trying to get different schedule like evening shifts at my hub, you would had to wait for an opening, and that could be awhile. The hardest part of the job for me was waking up, I mean lifting things is tiring but waking up at a time not biologically normal for people is hard along with you having to plan your time off a little differently. They have a rule of how many times you can be late or call off, and they are pretty strict about it, to them it doesn't matter if you are one minute late or one hour late, it gets written up."
good,"Uma empresa que permite profissionais sem experiência tenham uma oportunidade de trabalho. Nisto é um ponto à favor dela. Mas, nos cargos operacionais, não pude perceber nenhuma oportunidade de crescimento e segurança no emprego."
good,"Good company in commoditized industry. Profit margins are slim so there is not a lot of profit to go around. Great brand, overall good people, but less than competitive compensation."
good,provide efficient pick up and delivery service. support to the customers. cover any issues.
good,"A empresa como um todo é boa de se trabalhar, afinal agora somos uma multinacioonal muito bem vista na area que atua. No entanto o setor que me encontro não oferece crescimento. Tanto eu como outros colegas participamos de seleções internas mas o gestor não liberou a transferência, não tem uma visão de crescimento da equipe, não promove ninguém e nem deixa as pessoas sairem para outros setores."
good,"fast less brakes,learned how to use the tugger carrying eq. management was bad, co-workers was ok the hardest part is having floor manegers in your face trying to make you mad why your doing your job and there was no part I enjoyed"
good,"A typical day at work starts with me checking the condition of my load area from the previous sort. If my area is in bad condition I then get with the previous manager of that area to help get it in better shape for the prime. I would then go to the daily management meeting to discuss numbers from the previous day or week, and check company emails. After the meeting we are released back to the dock to set up our areas. This requires opening trailers in a handheld dolphin, dispatching trailers that are already full,and assigning flow to destinations in the computer. once our package handlers are allowed to clock in and make it to their areas we are required to give a meeting going over the safety topic of the day, and the previous days numbers. After the meeting package handlers will then proceed to their assigned trailers and begin loading. I manage the productivity of the package handlers, and the dispatching of trailers until the end of the sort."
good,The work is usually pretty hard with no time to rest in-between trucks. Little to no help with the heavier packages.
good,"Pay and benefits are awesome; however management is very poor. New supervisors are in place that have no knowledge of FMCSA rules and regulations. When you attempt to explain why what they are asking you to do as a driver are outside of the guidelines they tell you it doesn't matter and you do what they say. When you do what they say, the HR system generates a violation. Even if you tell them that you did what they ask they turn it on you and say it was your responsibility. Tenured drivers get the most respect, but new drivers beware!!!!"
good,I would clock in and start work right away.  It was laid back and fun but management was not willing to accommodate your personal life unless it would benefit them.  You would get trained to do several jobs but yet you were not allowed to move up in the company ladder.  The hardest part of my job was having to leave and the most enjoyable part were my co workers.
good,"when I first started here two years ago I was excited for the opportunities to come, now my job has turned in to a nightmare.... never knowing what they will change next.... there is absolutely NO work life balance and vacations and days off are done as a bidding process which involves over 300 employees in the WHOLE company dealing with our department.... used to be a high seniority.... now im into the 200's ...not fair at all!"
good,"Management is cutting cost on diesel techs. I'm worried about the safety of their trucks. 115 trucks with only two techs. They expect you to do preventive maintenance, repairs, follow ups, write ups, parts, road  call everyday. Time will tell maybe OSHA will visit their shops any day now. It was used to be 28 trucks per mechanic now its 58. Dont work here if you are a diesel mechanic."
good,Most of your hard work goes unnoticed. Stressful environment during the summer. Poor pay.
good,Days can extend longer than expected based on load and delivery. Good position to establish time management and organizational skills.
good,"Overnight transport is a billion$$ business.  I learned a lot about logistics and transportation management that I wasn't aware of.  That was a big plus for me."
good,A typical day at fed ex is long n hard loadin ur truck from 6 to 8 am then u drive to ur work site.
good,"Go in @ 6:30 am,  do a safety check of my van , get battery for my scanner , scan packages to be delivered , load my van , chit-chat with my co-workers , we all helped each other even though , we all worked for different independent contractors. "
good,"It's a nice starting job with decent pay and workable shifts. Co-workers are nice as you're all in the same group. The supervisors can range from cool to power-tripping pricks but hey, that's life."
good,"Working in the warehouse sorting out packages in the cold weather, dust and loud machines. The hours were great and I enjoyed learning how the company operated from the floor.  Lifting boxes from different areas. Looking for lost or returned packages."
good,"Typical day is long, working in the elements"
good,my co workers are nice people to work with on a daily basic. A typical day a work is delivering packages to customers.  Meeting new people and seeing old customers.
good,It was a experience working in a factory dealing with shipping and organizing packages. It was a challenge learning addresses and how to organize certain trucks. co-workers were okay.
good,Go in and for presort meeting then start loading trucks!The hardest part of the job is it feels like the packages never end!
good,"Its a very hard yet active job, we all work as a team to get the job done in a safely manner."
good,"If you have never had to WORK in your life, this is not the job for you."
good,Work for supplemental job to make extra money. Lot of different cultures.
good,was a good company tell fedex bought them out use to be called american freight ways  had a good route met a lot of nice customers my job was not hard just bad management there
good,making sure packages to your assigned delievery trucks make it on the trucks. very fast pace and physical job
good,requried effcient work. the work needed to be done in a timely matter. Stressful because majority of the time the printers would not work properly which made it impossible to get the work done in time.
good,Fedex is a very busy company with lots of hard work. The only thing that lets the company down is the way the office staff are unaware of important aspects included in the job and so are unable to appreciate the difficulties of the driving staff and so create unneccessary complications.
good,customer oriented but not employee oriented. planning daily routes. Company doesn't hire timely. station will be staffed for 8 to 10 weeks before a position is filled.
good,"Fun place to work, though work day is very challenging!"
good,just have to come to work everyday for four hours under any weather condition
good,"A day at work started at 0725. I receive the truck into the station, unloaded the containers from the truck, unloaded containers, Split and scanded all packages. Went on break,came back at 1530 and did the same thing in reverse. I had no problems with management. Hardest part was working two shifts.Enjoyed my workers."
good,Although my Job at Fedex wasn't for more than two yrs. i enjoy some part of it. the fellowship between driver and mor.....integrity is the key to work at Fedex 
good,"I worked fast and as a team. I learned most of everything in the building. i knew where every package went by memorizing addresses, cities, and zip codes and how important every minute cost the company. Management was great but most of the time we managed our selfs so we had to know higher priorities about our job."
good,"A normal day is one that keeps me busy. Between customer satisfaction, FedEx shipping and ""kinkos"" printing, the days are rarely dull. I have been taught many lessons on new and interesting machinery. My management and co-workers have become like family, being such a small group of workers. We all find it difficult, at times, to be able to identify what the customer is asking for, and what they really mean/need. This can make the job tricky, but at the same time it challenges you to think hard and verify details frequently."
good,not a bad job to start off life but eventually you have to look other places
good,As a driver for FedEx Ground you work for a contractor who owns the routes and trucks. Even though you Drive the truck and wear the uniform you do not work as an empoyee of FedEx. Your compensation is negotiated between you and the contractor.
good,"It is a physical, manual work, long standing, lifting heavy packages."
good,There is a lot to see in rural america and fedex gives you the opportunity to see just about anything within 50 miles of your terminal if your a temp worker. Once you have a semi-permanent route you see the same things over and over and it is then that you realize that you are working 14+ hour days five days a week for a take home pay that barely rivals a 9-5 job. Once the terminal management team figures out that you have realized this they will outright lie to you just to keep you coming to work. If you can get a contract or work for one of the better contractors directly it can be a fun and rewarding job as long as the rewards you are seeking are not appropriate compensation for the time worked. Expect to leave your house sometime before dawn and not return until long after dark. If there is anyone you want to see throughout the work week you better take then with you otherwise you will never see them while you work here.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is the customers and my co workers.
good,"This is a great place to work if the management cared more about their employees and the employees cared more about their job. The pay is not great, and the possibility of raises and/or advancement or promotion is almost non-existent. The actual work is not bad, the people I work with/for are the only issue."
good,"Load Pallets,Deliver packages in and around the city scan, paperwork, customer service"
good,"ok to work there,got to meet alot of people,liked being on my own most of the day"
good,"delivering packages to clients. I learn the Reston Virginia and Northern Virginia area. Management was professional and helpful in that making sure I understood the policies greetings, and I could go to them if I had a concern."
good,Most of the time we deal with inbound and outbound packages. I learned the different cultures and diverse personality as well as my ability to be a team player in a supposed team work environment. The management is alright most of them deals with the Company's ideals of People and Service Care. The hardest part of the job is when you have to lift packages and or freight of more than 90 lbs. The only enjoyable part of the job is when you are able to satisfy each customers that their packages have been taken care of.
good,Went through a SAFE driving class for the first week. Learned many valuable driving skills. Everyday we would have a safe driving conference call before getting out on the road. Learned to navigate multiple stops per day. Was a very fasted-paced business.
good,"FedEx for the most part is a good place to work if you are in drastic need of a job. Advancement is next to impossible as they have a strong belief in the ""Who You Know"" way of things."
good,"Liked the job and relationships I built with my Customers, but management would not back you up when it came decision time and I often caught them in lies. Safety manager was very rude and oversteped his authority"
good,"A daily routine includes communicating with a lot of cross functional teams mainly to get the data for pricing and proposal / solution to the customer. Maintaining and updating the database is yet another fun task which gets dynamically changed as per the warehouses lease agreements, new buy outs, etc"
good,"I would go in get everything set up for my employees. When the employee would get there I would organize them on the jobs they would be doing that night. I learned great leadership skills,aircraft loading, and organization. I worked with a great group of people that helped me group as a person and leader. The hardest part of my job would be one nights when flights would be late and the freight would come all at once. But that was a rare occurence. The most enjoyable part was the fast pace environment. Consistly being on the move, having something to do and staying busy."
good,"An overall good place to work. Benefits are great, hours per week may vary from week to week. Some deliveries are overwhelming for one man to handle alone, but your expected to get the job done regardless."
good,"Work shirts range from two to eight hours depending on how much freight is in. Basic positions include unloading trailers, scanning packages, sorting packages, palletizing packages, and load trailers. Beyond that, there are positions of leadership and logistics. The management runs everything, but most of the leading on the small scale is done by employees. The people I work with are decent people, however being in a warehouse setting, they are not always the most professional. I have learned to work with many different personalities, the different communication requirements for co-workers and with management and corporate figures, leadership skills, and independent problem solving skills. The most difficult part of work is keeping up the energy necessary for the physical demands after a few hours. The most enjoyable aspect is learning new tasks to give more variation to the job while gaining a better understanding of the company."
good,Typical corporate experiences. A lot of change in the position made it challenging to adapt a consistent and polished game plan. Despite the consistent change in the position it was one that I often enjoyed.
good,"I would unload the trucks from their ""pick-up"" routes every night. I really enjoyed the people I worked with. I had to find new opportunities because this was only a part-time position."
good,- Typical work day on the dock 10-12 hours a day
good,"I have been working with this company for over seven years and the quality of the company has decreased throughout time. The benifits have decreased and there are a lot of things to learn but the pay is not equivalent. I have however learned a lot in my time here, including, management, office work, document creation with Adobe software, Fedex shipping and many more."
good,its a ok job it pays the bill barely not enough hours or large enough pay scale
good,There were a few ups and downs as with any job. for the most part the company is great the locations i worked at not so great due to the childish employees and management.
good,It's a contracted job. You will not have job security unless you own your own route.
good,A lot of heavy lifting and good atmosphere among the employees. very very very high team morale throughout the building. ive never seen a single person not recieve help when it was needed. managers sometimes were unreasonable and presented deadlines they were not expecting to be accmplished. often gave new employees a hard time simply because they were new. and if your performance was underpar threats of being fired were often throughout the building.
good,its was hard work but it was over very fast. you were constanlty busy and the end of the work day seemed to come before you noticed it.
good,Fedex is a job where you have to work down and dirty for your hourly wage but it is very reliable and offers great benefits.
good,"When I first started working here it was a descent place. The customer was the number 1 priority and employees were treated with respect. However, over the last 2-3 years management has gone down hill, starting with upper management all the way down to the lowest level of management. The employee benefits that Fedex was once famous for are at best average now and the employees are treated as numbers, not people, who can easily be replaced. You will not get to work more than 30 hours a week unless you are a favorite of management or full time, and you will watch your hours get cut over and over again."
good,Being a package handler at fedex takes alot of energy. The work site is dangerous. You are searched everyday you come to work.
good,Great place for students to get a start in the working world. Cold when its cold and hot when hot. Fun to see how packages got to where they were going and where they come from
good,"They don’t care about their drivers, only that you get the freight off. They don’t use driver discretion rather use google maps. Dispatch is amazing but upper management is a joke. Wear your knee pads to work so you’re on their good side because a lot of favoritism goes on. If you have a beating heart, you’ll get hired , no worries. They don’t search for quality candidates just someone to fill slots."
good,"Empresa boa pra trabalhar, mais a gestão  muito a desejar"
good,Good but not put together they should care more about helping the employees succeed but they don’t at all managers don’t help out on the line but they have the nerve to rush u
good,"If you are a computer, it's good. Otherwise more work less money. The boss is in the states and you never meet them. Everything is run by the US.  Good to start, not good to stay."
good,"Fedex has great team atmosphere"
good,"very strict with their guidelines, and don't like to be questioned.  Do your job and go home, and you will be fine.  Don't inquiry about anything else."
good,I worked at fed ex in 2016 things could have changed along with pay and management the hours and different shifts is a plus but midnight usually pay more
good,"the wages aren't the best considering that you don't receive any type of medical or back roll investment opportunities, but has a consistent work schedule and depending on which contractor you work with it has its perks."
good,"I have worked at Fedex for three years and my dad for over twenty years now, since there I had the opportunity to advance and grow as a person. But lately it doesn't feel like I'm growing in my job but that I am being used and not trained up for bigger things. I want to work in a job that values my hard work and dedication to what I do there."
good,"Fedex is good but you can allways get something better 100%. "
good,"Was there 37 yrs started out being a great company but as it grew benefits "
good,"I was repair hand scanner , it is enjoyable , my coworkers from different cultures so i have good friends there , we have many managers there some of them very good ."
good,"Different challenges everyday to meet the required sort completion, workplace culture is generally good with everyone aligned to meet performance targets/cost."
good,Liked the work but management let some employees continue with vulgar language and rude conduct.  Most employees were great work mates.  Formal complaints were filed with HR but nothing done.  No one should have to listen to vulgar and rude language at work.  Management allowed customers to hear the language in the main office.  Not professional.
good,Horrible leadership and management. I have had a lot of issues here since i have started in March. It is more so a boring culture with a lot of lazy workers.
good,I have been employed at FedEx For over 15yrs and have experience run both load and unload areas. Throughout my time as a Manager with the company I've been promoted from dock worker to Service Manager.
good,The employee comradery is unmatched. The office workplace culture for the most part is friendly. Customer and courier interaction is normally smooth on a day to day basis.
good,"They have low pay and poor management. FedEx has high expectations for goal and we almost never made it. Whether we did or not we weren't told but we we're lied to about the amount of packages we were given. However, you get paid weekly."
good,great job if you dont mind being told how to drive by a bunch of desk jockeys that dont have the stones to do the job anymore. if you enjoy hypocrisy this is the place for you!
good,"Fast paced, demanding environment. Management is interested in numbers only, development and support of employees is lacking. Heavy turnover amongst vital positions."
good,Great experience but I didn’t feel there was room to grow and I didn’t feel I was being paid fairly but I’m thankful for the opportunity I learned alot
good,"Long hours, no work home work life balance, okay pay. No benefits. It is nice to work alone but also causes you to have long hours, no room for promotions."
good,"Everything else 👎it's a very fast paced job and can be stressful at times, you'll have more stressful days than anything ! The pay is great and the benefits are good, so it has its pros and cons...just like any other job."
good,"The job was easy, didn't have to be trained to long, they only thing was not ok was everyone breaking at one time, felt like we were being kids, and treated as if we didn't know what time break was over I guess it felt like we were being baby sat."
good,Het is een fijn bedrijf om te werken maar het is niet duidelijk voor hoe lang jr werk hebt zodra er niet veel meer te doen is word je direct ontslagen
good,Fun and high pace environment. Most important thing is to start early so you can make more overtime hours. With experience delivering on your route gets easier and you become efficient.
good,"Warehouse was fast paced, In the building was more quiet and calm for the public and was very clean (Because of me) and smelt very good, Representatives were very polite and helpful as you do your job."
good,"Alot of waiting for trucks to be loaded, usually a couple of hours. Money is not bad but you get paid by the trip not by the hour so alot of waiting makes for lower paid if broke down by hour."
good,"Steady job, not to difficult , you must pay to have your own van sign written, you must make sure you have the correct insurances to cover all ie courier insurance , public liability,  goods in transit, you need to know a considerable amount about shipping around the world and the relevant paperwork"
good,Good to work for but too many meetings for the sake of meetings and progress is frustratingly slow. Communication between internal and external partners is poor.
good,"I had a package addressed to a strip mall. I looked all over but the business was not there. I stopped in to ask a business if they knew who the people were that I had a package for them. The business said they had never heard of them. We looked the business up on the internet and it was located in another section of the city. I called the number and it had been disconnected. I marked the package as undeliverable; not 5 minutes later I received a call from my boss demanding why I marked the package as undeliverable. I went into detail and explained. He then asked me why I had an ""attitude"". Frankly, I had been working there for 2 years and have always tried my best to ensure the packages are all delivered. I was wondering why are you grilling me on this package, versus the hundreds I have delivered with no incident?"
good,"Hot 🥵 🥵 n fast paced like working there "
good,This job constantly deleting certain departments while growing as a company. At the same time the only people benefitting is package handlers and the people who are in salary. The rest of the people like QA do not get any benefit from all the adjustments. The business is great with benefits and discounts but that is the main reasons why people stay as long as they do.
good,"It's a fast paced environment, and stressful but requires a lot of time on task. On your feet for 10 hours have to be on time. Several departments to choose from."
good,"Upper and middle management has shown their primary focus is on bottom line, not employee satisfaction or advancement, especially in recent months."
good,It's a good job if you like to work constantly and keep busy but you had to work two shifts to work overtime to get your hours weekly. They give good benefits
good,"It is not a place for an older individual. It is hard work and hard on your body, especially your knees and back. There is very little job advancement, that I saw. Nice place to work if you are young and healthy."
good,The Denver Ramp is always changing and the environment never stays the same. It is a constantly changing flow based on material and packages coming through.
good,No recognize ation.if you're a hard worker they overwork you with no help. brakes are only 10 minutes and sometimes you could work more than 2 hours almost 3 without a break. and very hard to move up managers are very picky and want to much from you
good,High turnover. Constantly moving pieces against competition. Lots of independence. Uniforms given very high complex field.lots of moving pieces in this line of work.
good,"Good benefits, decent pay but not enough hours. Can't make a living off of this 1 job. There is also no room for advancement only part time work available"
good,"It is a fast moving fast loading fast coding job. The building is drab and the working space is dangerous. you must be alert at all times."
good,"Usually the work day starts by just getting to the belt and getting ready for all the packages to come down, if you're unloading the trailers you need to send them down so they can be moved to the right trucks. It's a fairly simple job and the pay is decent, but it doesn't provide enough hours for the work that you do."
good,FedEx feels like a family. They want you to succeed but not to outshine the people that have been there for Christmas' working over & or double time. Every part of the job is lifting & from little 75 pound boxes to 10 pounds nigh stand like boxes.
good,Work 2 or 3 hours a day. No management skills. Only great for part time. They tell you it's going to be 3am to 11 am which is a lie . They expect you to work fast pace and they don't fully train you.
good,"Worked as an outside sales rep in the Houston area. I enjoyed working for FedEx Services, but like any job it has it's problems."
good,"This was a high volume fast past job. You would work from time you got there until the time you left especial during the holidays. the good part is, you would have to be in shape to work there."
good,"Every day  my manager let me make corrections in the time cards, from the day before, and we make reports to make sure who was absent many days  for example, after that I distribute the time card for the current day and we run the belt and my job change to select  hazardous material  to scan"
good,Be at fedex almost 20 yrs. Just need a new start and better wages. Have had a good carrer with fedex but there are not enough opportunities for advancement.
good,"A typical day as a FedEx package handler depends on what position you work in, as it is a blanket title for all employees at a sort facility except for managers and QA. You could be unloading trailers, scanning boxes, manning a sort tower, loading delivery vehicles, or moving NCs, which is the term for anything that is too large or too heavy (75 to 150 pounds) to go on the conveyor belts. Nothing is particularly complicated, though it does take time to get settled in to new positions. It is also quite the workout, though some positions are more physical than others."
good,Fast paced in a constantly changing work environment. Poor maintenance of vehicles and low team work. Unexperienced managers making poor choices. In and out of vehicle 200+ times a day. Hard on knees and back.
good,the hardest part of the job is the environment. very dirty warehouse like job. you are exposed to the elements of weather and sickness is very prevalent.
good,"FedEx as a company is a fine place to work and form a career in, so long as you are not placed within the first floor's operations departments. In those various positions one will find themselves continually stuck in a job that overworks and underpays you for the tremendous load of information and effort that needs to be processed daily by one basic agent. Any attempt to move to other departments will be shot down by supervisors who will go to great lengths to suppress your ability to advance beyond them, and any attempts to bring such issues up with HR will result in a brush off."
good,"hourlys are running the company. If a new policy comes out and they don't like it, start crying union and the policy goes away. Mid management has no dog in the fight"
good,"people were so cut throat that you ended up alienated from them to get your work done.  they didnt like being shown up.   if you dont drink and party with them then they wont help you.  so if youre self motivated, you dont need them to do whatever you want.  they just wont help you when you need them.  so try not to need them."
good,The work space was very open. There was a lot of team communication. There was not really a lot of mix ups. Everyone was pretty much at the same speed.
good,"Relaxed atmosphere, but terrible pay and benefits.  Little to no chance for advancement.  Vehicles were older and were not in the best of shape.  Broke down frequently."
good,"Big company. I heard good things about most of the company, but Supply Chain and certainly the Trade Networks should be avoided like the plague. I worked at the later and couldn't wait to leave."
good,Training is not consistent with the company.  There is alot of layers in this position that  are not covered specifically in the training process. Benefits are amazing.
good,"Depending on where you work for Fedex the management is  obviously different in each place , the location I worked in ( Bethpage, N.Y.) the management was a young kid that got a job thru his daddy and didn’t know how to manage the workers or how to run the job  efficiently . "
good,long hours poor management the people they are giving contracts to are cheating people out of their money and working them like slaves nasty attitudes from people in the office
good,"A typical day of work consisted of 6-8 face to face meetings, 1-2 hours of call notes, 3-4 hours on each pricing proposal/presentation."
good,"Salaried employees work more than 40 hours a week- close to 70.  typical day consisted of going to work 2 hours prior to operation, reading emails and printing documents for subordinates ( because internet was extremely slow and not readily available).  Expectation was to be on the dock to its entirety regardless of what the operation's circumstances were (superiors only worked one sort, my peers worked 2).  Expectation was to stay after operations was completed to supervise and remove hourly managers (subordinates) manage hours by physically watching them as opposed to simply hold them accountable.  Least desirable was the ""boy's club"".  There are a lot of ""cliques"", prevented hard work and results to be noted and recognized."
good,"Most people at each others throats over workload and work process. Management unreliable, confusing, and only looking out for themselves. Each individual member of management have their own agenda on how and what needs to be done."
good,"If you like to be micro-managed, and don't mind participating in unethical and/or potentially illegal activity, this is the place for you. These people don't sip the Kool-Aid, they pound it!"
good,"casual atmosphere as far as co-workers are concerned, but supervisors can be over-bearing sometimes even when work is getting done. not a good place to work if you can't bear the elements, very hot in summer and freezing in the winter."
good,Drive and operate a forklift for 4 hours a day to move pallets and merchandise onto trailers. Stocking and lifting weight from 50-100 pounds around the warehouse. The best part about the job is having a good support group within the team that makes the work day go by much smoother. The hardest part about the job is working your hardest to get the job done right and not being appreciated for all the work and effort that I put in. It is a very labor intensive job but the hours are not a good fit and it's hard to get more if needed.
good,Was a great place to work when I started but things changed dramatically in the last 3 months especially since they bought out TNT. The work volume was ok but the parcels are very heavy and sometimes exceed 25kg
good,"A typical day depends on what role you have in the office, but you essentially sit down and do 1~3 different things for the entire shift + answering phone calls. Depending on whether people in the office have time off or are sick/injured, your schedule may get shifted around or you may be asked to work extra hours. If a center is understaffed, the workload is split up and redistributed to whoever can do it. If the incoming workflow is too much to keep up with, it becomes very apparent in the center."
good,"*Pre-trip and Post-trip "
good,For the most part they provide you with the tools you need to do your job and some decent education opportunities.  Behind the technology curve and caters to older generations.  Environment does not promote innovative thinking.
good,I didn’t like the rate of pay that I received there it was too low for the amount of work that I did and the work was I hurt prone so I wouldn’t recommend this job to many people because of the work
good,A typical day at work would be handling customer complaints training new hires and being the general lead for all the agents due to accumulating knowledge over the years. Making sure all scanning procedures are adhered to all packages by commitment time. International specialist as well as a Dangerous Goods specialist. Helped increased revenue for retail supplies and  assisted in scheduling shifts for all the agents. Helped to manage the work flow for all the agents.
good,Everybody know fedex is a billion dollar company but that doesent mean everything is up to part. They have some the worst working conditions and you overwork yourself and get underpaid.
good,"Typical day loading packages, picking up packages and returning packages to warehouse. I learned the difficult process of distribution."
good,"my time at fedex was not good the managers are lazy and uneducated. The managers do nothing but try to undermine all the employees when they could be making sure freight is not damaged. best paying worst job ive ever had.I don't understand the reason for any of it but it doesn't make since .People are leaving daily because of the atmosphere and they wonder why they cant find and retain good workers. I wouldn't hire any manager they got, they don't have what it takes to compete in the future with competition."
good,"Bad hours far distance within traveling , Fast paced , Loading and unloading , Sorting , D bagging All Of That As a package Handler . But I was a loader"
good,"horrible management decisions on implementing programs that have no chance of success are a constant negative. too much overhead. good people working there, just led by fools"
good,very stressful place to work.FedEx is a great company to work for however they don't encourage advancement to higher positions with greater pay and an opportunity to plan for retirement one day.
good,"This FedEx Supply Chain customer was bought.  The original management were left over from the previous company.  The favoritism is very, very high and you have to be a part of the good ol boy club.  Most of the employees are part timers and do not want to work.  There is much gossip and this makes for a very stressful environment.  The hours were 10 hours a day with Friday off.  That was ok unless it was very hot in the warehouse."
good,.non respect des norme de sécurité concernant le travaille demander.véhicule surcharger .travaille dépassant les norme dans un environnement de compétition .Blessure fréquente beaucoup trot de gents sur les accident de travaille.
good,"If you are favored great job great pay... flavor of the month changes so importance of job changes. No GPS expected to get delivers off at certain times they overload you. Pick ups are hectic, be prepared to work long shifts no teamwork and no AC in trucks."
good,I rode a bus 2 hours to get to my job so they could tell me that there wasn't enough work and to go home. Why not call? It happened very frequently and when I did get to stay I worked 2-3 hours the most. I made enough o cover my bus passes and lunch that's about it. I did like it though only if they had more hours to give. I dont understand why they keep hiring people if they dont have the hours to give them.
good,"The typical day of work was good, but unorganized. Little to no training for new hires, with tons of people who scraped by doing little to no work. Management was filled with good people, but bad management styles. Some managers actually cared about their workers, while some did not."
good,Many of the workers did not do their job correctly and as a new hire it made me upset that i was being forced to completely redo parts of my work when others were putting in little to no effort in their work.
good,Nice job to have when you are working on your own time and planning your own route. Nice to know there is no set time to be at work but the later you choose to work is the later you'll be working to get all of your packages delivered. The management of packages and deliveries can be better.
good,"Fun place to work.  The management isn't the best.  They don't offer full-time positions, so it would be the ideal workplace for a college student or someone who want this job to supplement their other job."
good,Don't like being yelled at by a bull horn. Fast paced. No down time. If your part time. They expect you to come in first thing in the morning. Bust balls for two hours. Send you home have to come back and bust balls for 3  or four hours. Times are never the same. To many cheifs standing around
good,"This is the first time I worked in a calls center.  I like the people I work with, but the structure of the job is very unappealing.   I feel like I am in jr high school/elementary school.  The hours are awful, my schedule changes all the time.  The pay does not match the work that is required."
good,"my experience may be different but when i were employed with fed ex. the environment was okay as long as things went smooth and there were no backed up convener belts. A plus for me was that i am kinda a tall guy so i didn't really like scanning the boxes too well so i was given a opportunity to work i the unloading trucks. because of my body type it was easier for me. also with my experience, not saying this is everywhere at every FedEx but at my FedEx i had a manager that was sad to say a racist. after plenty of infractions with this one particular manager, i ended up resigning and taking a better opportunity at another establishment."
good,"I'm neither witty nor clever enough to come up with something interesting. I have a bachelors, some experience in undergrad research, a decent gpa, and an interest"
good,"Driving for FEDEX is like going back to the days before sat nav reading the A-Z to get to drops! You need your own apps to create you're own route but once out there you have thr freedom to do it your own way unlike the others so learning the route is everything! The quicker you get around it the quicker you get done. Its a fixed round and you're on it all the time but whilst learning it I was on £50 a day for 12 hour days which wasn't for me!"
good,Mornings I would load my truck then do a truck inspection . Then the day begins on a a typical day I would do 115 to 130 stops a day and then scheduled pick ups that had to be done at the time given
good,"part time workers are expendable. but work is easy hours are ok.dock stand supervisors have to much say so in employee work scheduling. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
good,Every day is hard work. It involves constant bending and lifting. If you enjoy that kind of repetitiveness then its a good job to apply for. Excercise is a must.
good,"Spent nearly 10 years working for FedEx and put a lot of time and effort into the job. Depending on the manager and situation it was easy to become discouraged because so many were ""in charge"" and each was a bit different as personality and expectations went. One manager in particular seemed to be inclined to fire me from the first day of my transfer and certain conditions and situations made that possible after 5+ years without any real issues."
good,A typical day for Fed Ex was very fast pace I have to deliver and pick up package on time everyday. Hardest part about the job was picking up heavy packages.
good,fun easy job. fast paced.not enough hours.it was only from monday to friday and the hours was not enough. maybe on a ggod week i brought home 336$ dollars.
good,its a job that you can pay your basic bills with. has good benifits and maybe some great perks at work . you really have to look for the perks in the compnay
good,Typical day at work is fast paced productive and I went in there not knowing how to operate a forklift and now I’m well experienced the hardest part of the job is having to get out the hot bills and the back of the truck that means you have to remove other freight in order to get them
good,"only during peak season, they have alot of work, but through the year, the work load is slow and not too many hours are offered. The management sucks at fedex cuz the managers don't tdo their jobs right by being equal to all"
good,"Working for fedex  was fun no issues and I learned to work with a lot of people from different cultural background. Management was alright except they do not last long at one station. Moving up on the job, I to do a lot of traveling and I was not ready then."
good,"Package sorting is the main hiring position. Very Physically demanding. Management somewhat lacking. Driving is a better position if you can get it. Decent benefits, but not great"
good,Although I met man interesting people that helped me continue m education in American Sign Language I just could not keep up with the work. Moving extremely heavy things at a ridiculous pace was far more than my back and wrists could handle.
good,had a manager make racists comments and nothing was done.Had another employee threaten my life.And my ramp agent tried to intimidate other verbally. this took place at the ind hub
good,Arrived to work very early in the morning to plan out my delivery route. Arranged packages and route to provide timely an accurate delivery. Picked up packages from customers requesting pick up.
good,"There seems to be a complete lack of strategic planning by upper management.  Reactive to situations that should have been managed"
good,Scan packages on to pallets or colorize the packages the work day is pretty fast when we have volume but the managers pretty much just watch things happen not much doing anything
good,Working at FedEx Custom Critical is exciting always something new to learn. The management depending on the department can biased. Stay focused and do your tasks efficiently and you will do great.
good,"start with supervisor meeting then do a turn over with previous supervisor. Do projections for freight.Management on your back all through the shift even if everything is going smoothly. Dock associates are hard working. Learn not to trust management, will turn on you to save them self especially  when they tell you to do something and it does not work out. I have a start time but not an end time( could work from 11 to 13 hours)"
good,"It's best to tune out, keep your head down, and get the work done so you can go home. When I was first brought in, HR made it seem like the place was managed better than what it actually is. Training is seriously lacking and I even told HR about it and she literally smirked and laughed in my face because even she knows how half-assed ""training"" is and nothing has ever really been done about it. You'll learn more on your own and from your coworkers than anything else.  If you're lucky enough to be a manager favorite you might even get away with not having to do any work and micromanaging people who have been there for way longer and do way more.  Equipment is often missing or raggedy and doesn't work. "
good,A typical day at work started at 4:30 PM and you didn't know if you were going to do you assigned job or have to fill in at other stations.  Hard part of job was working in the cold weather during the winter.
good,Good company to work for. The culture and atmosphere portrayed by management and employees is that of tolerance and acceptance. The work is production and maintains you busy and time flies by. Many opportunities to cross train and learn many skills.
good,"Management was poor seamed like you had a new boss every other week,equipement was old,no driving hours so I had to leave,seamed like they worried about petty issues and not important ones"
good,I reaally liked working at FedEx but there was no room for advancement. Managment was very poor. it was a safe enviroment. it was NOT hard. Too early im the am.
good,"Fed ex was a great place to work, i had a great team and manager luz Vasquez but some of the policy was wrong. Children and their parents shouldn't be able to work there, due to alot of favortism."
good,"Empresa en la cual aprendes demasiado, las áreas están peleadas entre si se echan la culpa unas a otras de algún detalle, hay beneficiados en cuanto a promoción."
good,Management and job culture is great. Unfortunately pay and job/work life balance is not great- in fact be ready to black out the entire month of December.
good,"Fedex ground isn't too bad a job"
good,good opportunity to step through the door but no real room for advancement i enjoyed the job but time to move on i just felt as though i have learned and asked for more challenges and advancement opportunities but i got none
good,FedEx is an excellent company but its a very physical and demanding job. You must be able to be proficient with 100% accuracy at all times. You are constantly racing against the clock.
good,"long hours, no breaks, no lunch, no overtime paid. I worked for a private contractor, who made my job title a private contractor which I was not I was a driver working for a private contractor, this was done in order to avoid paying me overtime."
good,it wasn't what I'd call fun but if you can get the managers of your back while you continue to do the job they're telling you to do then yeah... maybe.
good,Great teammates who are dedicated and work hard each and every day.  Excellent pay and benefits.  Too much management with conflicting directions to the teams.
good,"I am working here until I can land a new job, The people are pretty nice here but for the work I do not feel the compensation is correct.It is definitely mindless work but very physically demanding."
good,Long hours takes lots of dedication and knowledge of address .Fun and very upbeat job very fast pace ! I really enjoyed getting to know the regular customers !
good,I enjoy the job and I would not look for another job if they offered more hours. It's a great job for someone who doesn't have any bills to pay.  They will work with your school schedule and they will give you time off when it's final's.  I definitely appreciated that.
good,Fedex supply chain is a great place to work for a short period of time.  There is no room for advancement.  Management doesn't really care or put the effort in.
good,"FedEx has changes over the years, It used to be a great company but now it is focused on cost-containment and getting older workers with higher salaries out of the company."
good,"From the time you step in the building, everything is fast pace. Delivering packages makes you feel like a year round Santa Clause. Once you're done, you have a sense of accomplishment."
good,"3to 4 hours of fast paced work moving boxes."
good,Overall it was a good place to work I was driving 2 hours one way and wanted something closer to home is the only reason that I quit but I would recommend this facility. If you are from another country I would not recommend this site.
good,Go into work and start working right away. Hardest part was keeping up with their pace and can get stressful. Come ready to work everyday. Most positions are good once you get them but they want quick learners for sure.
good,Working at Fed Ex is a very quick paced job.  You must pay attention to detail and be aware of safety when driving and delivering.  It is a good job because it is outdoors and you get to meet many different people.
good,"Job is very physical. You spend the entire time loading/unloading boxes. The belt will never stop unless it has to (jams, spills, or an injury occurs) and that means you get no breaks unless you work 7 hours and they force you to clock out for a 30 minute lunch. Overall, I enjoyed my time because it worked with my schedule. It was very physical, I lifted about 600-800 boxes and walked a few miles each sort. If you're someone who can handle working in the elements (the warehouse is either really hot or cold depending on the season) and show up everyday it makes for a good part-time job. The company really prides itself in promoting from within as most of the managers started off as package handlers, however it can take a long time to get a promotion. "
good,"They should pay better wages for the task giving, it's a very  stressful job dealing with the customer, the weather and your job time frame for delivery."
good,"Management doest care about you or trying to help you get hours. They say they do but really they just blow you off, and also the absolute worse dispatchers you could imagine."
good,pay was bad for the hours I worked. I work at FedEx for over eight years and only received 2 weeks of paid time off. I left because of long hours and lack of pay.
good,"Great team, benefits, and salary, poor, inconsistent communication from divisional level down. Enjoyable job, just never certain what direction we were to head in and just when we had it figured....the direction changed again."
good,I had to be to work at 7:00 am and sometimes i wouldn't get off til 8 or 9'o clock at night no overtime pay no benefits ...i just didn't feel like it was a career job......but the people were great its a great atmosphere
good,"The company culture changed drastically when Kinko's was bought out by Fedex. It is an entirely different company from the one I remember. Kinko's was originally a very relaxed, even fun place to work. Once they were purchased by Fedex, everything began to change...and not necessarily for the better. It is now unrecognizable. What began as a small company serving the Berkeley College campus was swallowed whole by a corporate giant. And the company was never the same again."
good,"Being an employee at fedex is stressful. It is easy to be promoted in this company but its not advertised to the people to apply(play by ear). If you are fired without any knowledge of what you did they will fight you to give you unemployment. there's also no workers comp unless you suing them. this job teaches you basic organization skills and cleanliness within a dirty and fast paste environment."
good,"I worked either for an independent contractor or as one  The work environment was generally good, but as with most ""deadline"" work there was pressure and time constraints placed on the worker/contractor.  Communication between corporate and the contractors was sometimes an issue.  Safety and efficiency are key in this work.  Customer service is emphasized but productivity was the cash-cow.  This conundrum is not well addressed by the company.  This company operates under a corporate/independent contractor status.   The contractor one works for is the key.  Corporate demands are ever-changing but the contractor will make or break the work experience."
good,Very stressful without help from management. Expects to much work to be done by one person. No breaks. Had to work entire shift which was between 4 to 6 hours with no time to rest.
good,"no benefits on home delivery side....... long hours,.. no vacation.... no sick pay....no time off.... nice to work out side. good people to work with."
good,FedEx stadium was a good workout for me. I liked the fast money in tips for my part time working. The stadium was a good workout for carrying and selling acholic beverages in the VIP level.
good,"While working en route it was enjoyable and relatively relaxed even thought it was quick paced.  However, The mornings were very frustrating.  They could either make or break the day."
good,"Met some really good people there,made some great friend..it is a very stressful job,,fast pace and it's a hot environment in the summer and cold in the winter.."
good,"I truly did not like working for Fed Ex, not my kind of job.  I did not like some of the people that I dealt with directly on my team. Manager was horrible and racist a true red neck."
good,"Salary not competitive for work required, Ground lacks offering benefits, turnover is high, no paid vacation, nor medical or 401 k working as a ground driver"
good,"FedEx Office is a great place to work, like every job it has it's ups and downs but it balances out. I am just getting out of school and is looking for something in my field but if wasn't I wouldn't mind staying. Overall I would re-apply if I was to find employment else where and I wasn't happy."
good,good company enjoy the people. great place to provide for a family. money is great. training is great and the leaders are very concern with workers life and family outside of company hours.
good,"6:30am - 8am, you get to load your truck according to route given. "
good,"The job was cool but it was very hard work , it was a safe environment I had fun co-workers but the bosses were a little on edge with their anger issues"
good,"I temped there for Christmas and eventually a bit longer. I was in the truck putting up packaged mostly and call to other jobs as help was needed. Simple job, decent pay for a short amount of work and friendly coworkers. Odd hours, sometimes cut early due to lack of work. Weirdly strict security but overall as fairly easy job. Physical work can be strenuous."
good,Worked Long days with little to no help as others went home early with route unfinished. favorites are picked. Very unorganized. physical aspect of job wasn't bad but management was.
good,"Fed Ex has time constraints and must meet them; therefore, it is a hectic place to work but a stable one. The pay is fair, and insurance benefits are great!"
good,If you are looking for a place that will hire you quickly is the place to go. Management was alright but they did have favoritism within the workers and those people were not expected to perform like the rest of the team and were given the easier jobs.
good,it was a good job experience only bad thing about this job it was just a temporarily job due to seasonal but it worked out for me due to I was still enroll in school
good,"Stressful, management was poor only cared about numbers, favoritism, most enjoyable part was dealing with customers. Hardest part is dealing with mgmt."
good,"They kept you busy, I only worked part time, but i would do it again  if the pay was better. and it wasn't so much drama in the work place. It was an okay place to work."
good,"Get up early. Clock in, start pulling packages from the line and loading them onto pallets. Help push packages down the assembly belt. Staying on your feet can take a toll, wear comfortable insoles. Packages are HEAVY."
good,Very cut throat when things arent going the way managers want them to. This type of behavior wouldnt be bad however it is inconsistent. When things are slow managers dont care about whats going on.
good,"poor work enviroment and poor pay expect you to work full tilt all the time with no incentive, on the other hand if you last 6 months probably have a job for life"
good,"Fedex provides an environment with plenty of hard workers who are willing to give a helping hand to whoever needs it. Help will be needed as the hours can extend up to times of 12 hours do to the workload. There are moments where the hours worked do not add up to the amount of pay compensated, for the pay rate is not by the hour. However, the job is perfect anyone is who is looking to consistently be on their feet and get some good exercise."
good,"got to work. then go home. nothing more, nothing less. Must be willing to be available at all times. The work is physical, but not overwhelming. Must be able to work in all weather."
good,"My typical day at work consisted of making sure I was to be punctual, which brought out consistency that I had lacked before. The demanding culture made me an accountable person. The hardest part of the job was maintaining bill counts that were expected of all employees. Some trailers were more difficult to unload than others. The best part of the job were the hours."
good,"Overall fedex is a good partime job, you meet or exceed expectaions, most people are nice but, they empower lazy people and don't reward you with promises made in the interviews. (Employee of the month incentives) was a lie, they try to squeeze by Osha regulations when they can."
good,It was very difficult working the night shift. I didn't get enough hours plus the pay wasn't very good and it was impossible to get a raise or a promotion.
good,Typical day at work included sorting and lifting boxes for about 3hrs straight. I love how everyone works together and help when needed. I didn't like the heavy lifting and crazy 3a.m work hours
good,Ground and Home Delivery are ran by contractors so there is no room for growth or advancement. Hours are great and flexible. Benefits are minimal and pay rarely increases.
good,part time looking for more hours need a full time jib to make ends meet not really good for part time hours I think unless need more time for classes or what not
good,worked here since i was in high school. loved my manager mary but the company was mpl back then and they got bought out so i dont know what working there now would be like.
good,"on a daily basis i received high volume amount of files, then i will have to contact individual, company's, brokers, to receive the  information that is required to be able to release their package that is being held in USA Customs. I have dual computer screens, work with multiply applications, some days are a breeze and can have all my work done by 3 and someday i work till 8 pm. My job is a very busy and fast past job."
good,It's a call center so you are at your desk for 8+ hours. Since this site is only a vendor you do not get FedEx benefits you get C3 benefits. Calls are back to back your job is to track peoples packages and schedule picks ups.
good,"A typical day at the fed ex ramp consists of loading and unloading aircraft, operating ground support equipment, and sorting freight inside the warehouse. The hardest part of the job is being able to constantly be moving, however there is a decent amount of down time when everything is completed. There isn't much management, and a lot goes on that shouldn't, however for those who aren't sure what they want to do with their career, or are in school, it's a good place to work."
good,I will not miss pull a-trains down the road. Very high security around the property and a check point. Dispatcher has no sense of humor or personality.
good,"always on the road. no set hours, when you're done with your route your day is done. you can go home as early as you finish and get paid for the entire day."
good,"The shift hours depend on which operating company you work for. The benefits are pretty good. As with many other jobs, employees are expected to do more than what they are paid to do. So pay is not based on experience or job duties but your job title. This may vary between each Opco. There are always jobs posted which is a good thing if you're looking to bid out. Current management is not very effective as far as leadership skills. This may not be the case at the other operating companies."
good,"Face paced from clock in til clock out"
good,"FedEx is a good company to work for. I advise to apply for Services Opco, they have better treatment of employees. Overall the benefits are very good and its beneficial to know somebody who can help you get in best position."
good,FedEx started out wonderful for me but quickly turned into something I wouldnt want to go back to. From the rude customers who had accounts with us to the management who in my opinion need more training. All in All it comes to management and I think they all need more time to grow and more training. They have a knack for laughing in your face and then going behind your back and stabbing you. Its not worth it. If you somehow come across a manager who is good stay with them because it can be way worse.
good,"I worked for two FedEx branches in College Station same problem with both poorly managed. The managers and upper management don't care about workers, just numbers. The leaders of this company tend to overlook this area and manipulate policies to fit their agenda no matter who they over work or screw over"
good,"Normal amount of work during regular hours, and significant increase during peak. Management could use more training. Co-workers are  great to work with and I continue to learn the inner workings of the package delivery industry."
good,"Management is stuck on their old school ways (back in the day mentality) with no new younger managers on board."
good,"swipe in, stretch before getting into trailer. Have a high load or unload rate.  Make sure have the proper cloths and boots. Fast past work place. Be on time."
good,"É uma empresa multinacional "
good,"a typical day at work consists of unloading trucks and a lot of hand coordination, my managers do they're job well I would say and for me I don't think any part of my job is hard."
good,it was alright. i became pregnant while working there and they still had me doing to much and were not very understanding
good,You will feel better about working here if you don't care that managers don't hold co-workers accountable for under-performance of job duties. If you like picking up other peoples slack you'll love this. If it's important to you that poor job performance won't get you fired and slackers can get promoted...it's great!
good,Close-kitted company with family values. Good trainers and easy access to managers. Makes use of advancements in technology to improve work flow. Contractors are able to apply for full time positions.
good,FedEx is a great company to work for. I enjoyed my time with this company however it was a contract position. I enjoyed the team I was assigned to work with.
good,"Typical day of work conists of checking the scan report as well as the bulk report. Scan report shows how well you scanned the previous day at work while the bulk tells you how many packages you have coming to each designated truck. The fact that you get these reports allows you to know what you need to improve on and also makes you consider new ways to better your percentages. Management is always around if any assistance is needed, the hardest part of the job is picking up the slack of others who don't care to help out. The most enjoyable part of the week is when we are rewarded for our hard work."
good,"Schedule constantly changing working 8-16 hour days"
good,"I worked in of the easy routes, but the work load just became heavier and heavier over time. It was just too much for the team to handle"
good,"Work is very physical. "
good,I love the friends I made while working here its very hsard to get on permanent here they profile you from day 1 so they automatically know who they want to hire so don't get your hopes up I love the environment but a lot of the workers with senority are fake and liers however if I could work here again I would because I was there to work not make friends
good,"Typical day at work pick ups , deliveries , manage your time and your route , drive safe and get the job done the best and safest posible way."
good,"Not the greatest place to work"
good,"Enjoyable work and all, just was not getting the hours promised by Fed Ex upon Hire, Was almost getting 3 hours a day, a month after peak. "
good,Management seems to think of themselves and not typically about the employee.  If you are a hard worker it seems to go unnoticed.
good,My goal each and every night was to safely and rapidly offload the aircraft and get the freight to it's proper destination.
good,What I loved about fed-ex was the benefits for health and for college. I wanted to move up in the company but wasn't able to due to health issues. If you have asthma this would not be the best job for you if you working with loading planes or in the Hub. My asthma got worse due to what I was inhaling while I was employed there.
good,Woke too early for not much. Management was awful. If you worked hard you werent appreciated. If you were a pendejo you would get appreciated. Waste of my life. Not all Fedex's are like this.
good,"Served as a Customer Service representative with FedEx for over 16  months at Bangalore, India."
good,Hardest Part of the job is having no benefits and working long hours without family time... There are more things out there worth working for..
good,good place to work .some management is better than others..pay is good most of times tho hard to make plans cause you never get out of work the same time everyday
good,i dont complain i just go to work i have bills to pay Fedex is a ok job it keeps you busy year around  plenty to be done people are ok and it depends on the weather in the warehouse it can get real cold in winter and it can get real hot in the summer
good,"É um bom local para trabalhar."
good,clock in arrive early begin my stretches that are important to me every day. listen to the safety topics contribute them during the work day . safety is my priority . keep aware of my surrounding . there are days that become challenging but i take that as a way to over come it and do the best i can to were i limit myself and not over due my strength and ability. i simply enjoy working with a great team and help them get the job done .
good,"Deliver over 300 hundred packages no benefits no holiday pay but the pay is good  you don't have to worry about anyone being on your back its a laid back job if you like working in the sun, rain, storm and snow"
good,Working for Fed Ex isn't the best but it isn't the worst either. A typical day at work for me begins around 6:30 a.m. and ends between 5-10 p.m. I am currently a courier for the company delivering different packages to various customers. This job has definitely taught me time management and great customer service. The hardest part of my job would be keeping packages from falling when I'm driving honestly. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing a satisfied customer receive his or her package.
good,Working as an employee there I've enjoyed working the general public. The staff was very pleasant and fun and it will always be a joy to be apart of the staff.
good,"hard work, not enough pay then you're not guaranteed hours.  I took packages to belt under  a doable time restraint, but your are rushed to leave as soon as the work is done.  management was respectful and hr was good.  It was a fun and friendly environment as long as work got done."
good,this company is all about greed now. people have no way of making a living wage with the excessive cutting of hours and benefits.
good,"Record & Receive incoming freight at the main hub, distribute and organize freight accordingly among specific & dedicated routes & locations. Utilize heavy machinery & equipment such as: Pallet riders, Propane operated forklifts, conveyor belts, tug vehicles, and hydraulic operated elevators to lower and raise freight to and from FedEx airplanes."
good,FedEx cares nothing about the employees. all about the company. they work you like a dog or a slave on a plantation. But that's any job.but overall FedEx handles business.
good,"You can be send home after two hours of work if your boss doesn't like you, there isn't enough work or your slow. Part time employees can get benefits which is nice."
good,"Working for fedex ground you don't actually work for fedex.  Contractors buy the routes from fedex and hire their own drivers.  Due to the cost of the routes and equipment, contractors aren't left much money to pay good drivers decent wages for the amount of work the drivers put in to keep the company moving forward."
good,the people were great very fast environment that kept me on my feet at all times lots of multi tasking and great communication with colleagues and supervisor
good,"It is a large company with many opportunities. However, there is a lot of competition. FedEx Trade Networks has fewer opportunities than the other operating companies."
good,"FedEx Freight used to be a great work place and work environment. Over the years it has gone downhill drastically as they have slowly become ""Corporate America"". Worked there for 16 years and finally quit after all of the ""good"" management left."
good,Loading semi trailers in tight walls so the boxes don't fall. If your chute is slow go help someone else. Sometimes you work 30 minutes other times you work a couple hours over your shift.
good,"I joined FedEx thinking that this would be a good work/life balance for me and my family. The job posting that I applied for said that my work schedule would be Sundays 530p-10p, Mondays 715p-11p. and Tuesday through Thursday 730p-11p. Within about four months I was not working those shifts anymore. I was coming in before those shifts and staying later than those shifts. At first, yes that is the schedule I worked and at times we even got out early but then that all changed where I was giving more and more of my time and wouldn't even get a break from the company or even get a thank you. Don't get me wrong it was cool working at the MSP ramp but still the managers it was all about themselves to get their raises and yet we still didn't get one."
good,"The workers are the best part of these job. The team work is great. People are able to communicate with each other and people there also care about each other. If you need help learning a specific job, they will assist you in performing that task."
good,The pay is decent but the people arent the best. Its managable and simple . honestly not happy but need the pay ist okay to work.
good,As a Courier I fulfilled the duties of picking up and delivering packages al throughout San Francisco. maintain safe/clean work environment
good,You are just a worker so work! They act like they care about you but at the end of the day its all about how efficient you are and how many complaints you have gotten.
good,safety is key. management is of a different culture. co-workers good to work with. pay not so good. benefits fair. parts not always available to correct issues.
good,"FedEx Corporation is an American global courier delivery services company headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee. The name ""FedEx"" is a syllabic abbreviation of the name of the company's original air division, Federal Express, which was used from 1973 until 2000. Good company to work for with many benefits"
good,Fast pace job. I work in a Hot or Cold Environment depends on the season. Overall its an OK workplace managing is a little bit shaky.
good,Benefits are decent but the work is ruff. Its very hard in summer time if you don't like extreme heat. They try to make sure everyone has plenty to drink.
good,"Learing how to deliver parcels in a safe and timely manner, following address directions and a good memory. especially during the holiday season. i worked with one other driver and he knew the route much better and i was the runner.hardest part is keeping up the pace and the most enjoyable when the truck is empty."
good,At federal express you learn a lot about the company and what you put in federal express that's what you get out. Great benefits but not enough pay.
good,"Everyday you do the same thing at this job, if you like a routine this is the job for you. Hardly any room to move up within have to be really self-motivated, which I am. I was able to move up within the company. Only to find out a lot of the managers you came to agree with and believe in where no the same behind closed doors. Overall, a strong redo of management is a must at FedEx if success will ever happen in my eyes."
good,"FedEx is a terrible place to work for anyone, Management is terrible, your treated like a step child and your only a number there"
good,"Too many adults acting like they are in high school, rather than at work. The security line before entering the facilities is biased. Some people can get through without a problem, while others cannot even bring a phone in."
good,"You learn a'lot working for this company, there's definitely opportunity for growth and great benefits but theres not much balance between work life and day to day. Its a great company but definitely has its downsides."
good,"FDX (Ground) is a decent place to work if you don't mind working for contractor or FDX hub as a Temp driver."
good,"A typical day at FedEx includes answering calls, communicate with customers, co-workers, drivers and management, go out on deliveries and collections, use a certain program on the computers, use scanners for the parcels, check parcels for damage, correct name/address and dates, seek and collect parcels for customers."
good,"Not terrible for unskilled labor. Good if you need work but I wouldn't want to stay there. The work is incredibly hard, and if you out of shape you will get in shape really quickly. The standards are little over ambitious."
good,"Responsible for the physical loading and unloading of shipping trucks as well as sorting of packages by hand. Worked twilight shift, very laborious job. Repetitive, but pay was above average."
good,"While this is a great company to work for and to have on your resume, I feel that the station lacks motivation and communication.  People are extremely friendly and most employees do their jobs, however, most employees are just going through the motions.  There does not seem to be any employee engagement.  I think that with the right leadership and direction, this could be a great place to work and develop."
good,"very fast paced job with little training, very stressful with no traininng, but other than that good people and some cool managers"
good,"Aprendi a faturar,a conferir e bipar os produtos,aprendi a usar o sistema sap e kysoft,colegas de trabalho amigos e respeitosos,a parte mais agradável do trabalho era trabalhar com quem gosta de você e te respeita."
good,"The hardest part about the job, is you don't get paid for what you do, but I have enjoyed being part of this company, they show they care."
good,It was an okay place to work and I really enjoyed the shift that I worked for the seasonal Operations Administration position.
good,Fun company to work for if you like helping others. Internet help desk position with no real advancement opportunities. Two managers that will contradict each other. standard benefits. Small company environment - co-workers normally great - company changed from more technical to customer care side of IT.
good,"I enjoyed my time there.The work was steady,the people were helpful,the job was at a fast pace,but it did not bother me.The management were helpful in teaching the way of how things are done."
good,"My job was to scan and load federal express trucks. my job was to also assist drivers with any assistance they needed with the packages. Other duties included splitting the belt, and being a team leader during the day to day operations."
good,"Nesta empresa tudo é muito dinâmico. Lida com clientes e por isso tem que atender as demandas que podem mudar rapidamente. A gestão é focada em satisfazer os clientes e todos adotam a mesma cultura. A parte mais agradável são os desafios diários. O mais dificil é motivar as lideranças, uma vez que todos os beneficios são voltados para a Base Operacional."
good,A regular day is usually offloading and on loading at least two planes and multiple trucks in a work day.  Management was here and there but it was not very good or helpful.  Most of the co-workers made it feel like a family work environment.  Easiest part of the day is unloading the plane the hardest is making sure it goes out on time when you load it back.
good,"Possibilities with FedEx can be great if you want to move around, or become a driver/ etc."
good,"The work environment at FedEx Smartpost is fairly standard if you stay within the Parcel Assistant or Parcel Sorter (FT) positions. Once you step up into any of the title positions the general consensus from employees is that they regret the choice due to the hub manager's preference to micromanage the entire facility. As a result the rest of management also suffers which has become a breeding ground for resentment and mistrust."
good,"I have three time Awarded- Employee of the Month.. I have an excellent attenance and work hard..  I have great motivation of my job. I have experienced in material handling, warehouse and production ..."
good,"My title is Package Handler, and my job is to load boxes into trailers."
good,Easy day of work sometimes it was fast sometimes it was long and slow but that's just work.
good,"An average day @Bed Bath & Beyond always brought something new to light..."
good,"very physical, hard job. good shifts available. start at the bottom and work your way up mentality."
good,"They lie to you in the interview and tell you its the best job in the world, but its like torture. Everyday gets worse and worse. The managers are the worse part."
good,"Co-workers were good but you had to wtch what you do and say. Very stressful job"
good,"Work as a team"
good,"Plain and simply, I unloaded semi trailers  of packaging. required a quick pace and consistency."
good,"This is good place for people without an education to move up the corporate ladder.  Most dock jobs require a lot of hard work, lifting, and motivating package handlers."
good,"Yard inventory"
good,provide good customer service and enjoying the driving and loading your truck aswell
good,"They would work you to hard for little money unloading an loading trucks."
good,It have it good days & Bad. employee attitudes need improving.
good,"Not the greatest, but thankful for what I've learned in my time there."
good,I have worked both in management and on the dock. both of witch are very fast paced and stressful. On the dock you unload and load trailers as fast as you can trying to make your high production goals. management is the same way except you have different goals than a dock worker for example making your gates and cut times. it is a good environment to work in as long as you have a manager that does not hate his/her job and tells it to you to your face. the hardest part of the job is when management does not follow safety policies and procedures that are set in place to keep you as a dock worker safe. it does not make you feel like you are cared for as an employee. the most enjoyable part of my job as a dock worker would be having great benefits.
good,"only complaint cant get 40 hours a week. You top out at a max of 32 per week, and the shifts varies, which sucks when your going to college-you need a care to work their"
good,"inbound mail , organize all incoming mail for the drivers to deliver them. Unload truck."
good,"My job and its responsibilities were interesting and vast; however, they were missing automation tools to handle workload and the department wasn't sized or organized properly to handle workload. "
good,"Operate forklift"
good,"- overworked and tiring"
good,"Fast pace working environment where teamwork and attendance is a mandatory priority.  The diverse styles of management creates a sense of confusion in some cases, but none more direct than the political agenda the assistant building manager has put in place.  Being paid to exercise has a created a positive outlook among most co-workers as well as a sense of humor to pass the time.   Cross training has become the cornerstone for those who want to learn and grow with the company."
good,"Great gig if you are a student looking for part time work."
good,"Delivered packages from warehouse terminal to customer’s home, &             trained other temporary drivers. Gained route delivery experience. Great workplace, great coworkers just low pay compensation."
good,My typical work day consisted of loading and unloading trucks. This was a great job. I like working in fast paced environments so this was perfect. The hardest part of my job was not being given enough hours to support my family and live on. Management was awesome and so were my co-workers.
good,low pay get laid off easy not a real stable job to work unless you get hired in and very little hours
good,"Worked sunrise shift which is early in the morning"
good,Well working at Fedex as a part time worker I only work up to 4 hours a day or less then that. So my day starts off like this call the hotline to see what time does the sort start. I learn working in the warehouse can be hard at times cause of the fast pace environment due to how many trucks come in. The co-workers at the job are friendly but sometimes a little rowdy. Management at fedex is ok. They do their best to keep things going at a steady rate. Hardest part on the job well the isnt nothing hard to be honest i really havent find something hard For example Scaning and build pallet it takes time to get use to but again its very easy.
good,"A typical night at fedex can be fun depending on who is leading and whom you are working with."
good,"Very fast paced organization as a courier, handle package with care, always provide a safe driving habit and still delivery packages to customers in a timely manner"
good,Overall it was a job that was full of surprises. There was alot of work to be done so your day was always well occupied.
good,"Todo o meu aprendizado na área  agradeço ao meu chefe direto e aos meus colegas de trabalho, pois temos uma ótima relação interpessoal com todos onde torna o nosso trabalho, apesar das dificuldades muito agradável. "
good,"The day starts at 7:00am reviewing the load on the truck,I leave the terminal at 8:00am to start my deliveries(about 100). AT 3:00"
good,i enjoyed the pay and the type of work. although the stress level was very high
good,A normal day I would pick up my truck organize all the boxes and then drive my route delivering boxes. Furthermore ensuring to build relationships with the people on my route to ensure business.
good,"I would start to work as soon as stepped in the door."
good,"Good working staff, ok benefits, but pay should be more for labor of work that u do"
good,j' ai vécu une très bonne expérience dans cette entreprise car j'ai découvert le métier d ' agent de piste qui consiste a circuler et travailler sur les pistes avec les avions
good,"I enjoyed my time at fed ex.  The job is a great job for many and was for myself, but my degree has no barring on advancement within the company.  I worked 50 plus hours a week regularly and the money was fantastic."
good,"typical day at work was loading trailers with customer items."
good,"It was a very time consuming job that does take a toll on your body physically, due to all of the bending and lifting the heavy parcels. It does teach you how to be very self sufficient because there is no hourly pay. You get paid by the stop and the package so the faster you work the better. Management was very understanding of the obstacles that we encountered on a daily basis. The best part of the job was the freedom that you had due to the type of work environment that the job in-tells."
good,"worked there 25+ years and was fired for a supposed policy violation , yet there are people with multiple accidents and tickets that have kept their jobs .DWI's and have kept their job . In a supposedly people first company I lost my job after a new manager took over .  their GFT process which used to be fantastic is now a joke .It took 5 months to complete and not once was I contacted after the first level . Beware senior employees they are looking for ways to get rid of you ."
good,Call in each morning to see the time to report to work. Clock-in go to my line start scanning packages or loading trucks. Re-leave co-workers for breaks.
good,"When it was run by Fred Smith, this company was truly a people-first company. However, the company is embarking on outsourcing/off-shoring, and the culture has really changed."
good,The work is not hard but during peak just be ready to work as long as they want you to.
good,"This is a good place to work for a short period of time, i.e. to pay off your car loan or for extra Christmas cash. You will work odd hours in a noisy warehouse environment. Expect to work up a sweat, get dirty and be disciplined by management if you are not working fast enough."
good,"For the amount of money that the upper management gets paid you would think that this company would be ran more efficiently than it is. No organization, no planning, everything is based off of assumptions. Need to loosen purse strings an upgrade applications and systems and hire MORE workers. Try to work a department of 3 when you really need 7 to run properly. Wouldn't dare come back once I leave."
good,When you getting your hours its ok when you not getting hours its a pain in the back literally
good,FedEx is a good company to work for besides the fact that you don't have very much job security as a part time worker.
good,"Let me first say that the benefits are great.  They come at the cost of abandoning your family and personal life.  Do not plan on doing anything Monday or Friday even if it includes having a twice a year dentist appointment.  "
good,Come to work and just load and unloading boxes.  I learned how to how to orgazine.  the hardest part of the job was lifting and packing
good,"working conditions suck, managment is alright, coworkers are all different, "
good,"FedEx is structured using a contractor model. Drivers of contractors do not work for FedEx and do not receive benefits or have the ability to advance in the company.  However, I have gained a lot of valuable experience which includes developing my management, teamwork, and communication skills."
good,"FedEx Express does promote work life balance."
good,"Good benefits, but quality management is lacking. It is a fast pace work environment from day to day, witch I immensely enjoyed. I learned very much in my years with fedex including but not limited to: work with Microsoft office, conducting a wide variety of people, how to use ten key, handle money, general logistics, written and oral communications, packing efficiently for shipment, conducting myself professionally with outside business partners, and various research. I had a good relationship with my co workers as I am very people oriented person. The hardest part of working at fedex was the ever changing work environment, but I was able to endure profusely.    "
good,"Poor Management"
good,"Pretty good company to work for, a little hard to get promoted from within, they would rather hire outside of the company for management positions"
good,"This place is suffering from long distance management. There is a culture of entitlement that has some of the employees acting as though they can do less than others or pick and choose thier repairs as they see fit because they honestly beleive they are better than he rest. This company has the potential to be a great place to work, but it is just unrealised."
good,"show up hit the floor from the time you get there no time for paper work, i learned how to multitask and run teams of guys to the peak of there posibe productivity while being safe."
good,FedEx Office (Kinkos) had great benefits at a low-cost and treats its employees fairly well but in the end it is still retail. Poor scheduling and low pay. Management on the retail level is sub par but talk to someone on the corporate level or on the package handling side and you will find a different story.
good,"Are you ready to be over-worked, under-paid and constantly called with questions even when off the clock? Then go on down to FedEx Office. They have a spot for you because people are always leaving the insanity!"
good,FedEx Office has high expectations with minimal rewards and pay. You can make more quitting and coming back then you could make by staying in the company getting raises. They literally gave my friend a $0.02 raise.
good,"Have no illusions, this job is very physically demanding and you will be sore for weeks. You will probably be popping aspirins constantly just to get by."
good,Very busy place. The time goes by quickly. Nice part time work.
good,"Performing repairs on company equipment, company processes-training, management operates for a company point of view mostly. Some co-workers will not share knowledge or experience with others. Knowing that your just a number and only there to do everything for the company and being micro-managed. For myself, I was able to teach and assist new hires with equipment repairs."
good,As a package handler for FedEx Ground the work is incredibly athletic. It's really only a nice place to work if you want to loose weight and get paid for it.
good,"Co-workers are usually the best part of going to work, everyone is usually laid back besides some of the managers. Depending on the location you are the work can be long and demanding and the customers are usually very bad to work with for some employees."
good,"It was not a happy place to work. I was not able to work enough hours. I was a part-time employee. When ever I was able to land another part-time job to supplement my income, my shift would change."
good,"scannning barcodes and packages.The job is nice,but its not for me.I am looking to build a long-term career with opportunities for career growth, to use my skills in the best possible way for achieving the company’s goals, and also to solve problems in an effective/creative manner in a challenging position"
good,"For this job, they don't care if you're doing good for the company in other words there is no recognition of good things you've been doing for the company. This job have no permanent starting time everyday in a graveyard shift and the thing is that is hard to woke up during that time. they don't really care about small employee."
good,All around good work place. i would recommend anyone to work at Fedex
good,"I learned a lot about the promotional side of running a business. It was fun running all the machines and working alone during graveyard hours. Managers were cool, always seemed like they were getting fired. Never had any issues with co-workers. All around easy job"
good,If your not a quick worker and have a low tolerence for people than this is not the job for you.The job is simple. you go into a trailor full of packages staked from the back all the way to the front and you unload them onto the conveyor belt system so that the package will go through the system and eventually end up at the delivery trucks
good,I enjoyed this company. I wish I never ruined my opportunity with this company.
good,"In a typical work day i would unload trailers untill the load is done. Ive learned the value of packeage handling and importance of shipping Coworkers are pretty friendly. Hardest part of the job is working with defected equipment and being expect to perform regularly. i enjoy the fact that if and when i go on military leave i will always have my job, and there are many locations"
good,dock worker. loaded and unloaded trucks. management was bad winter months were very cold
good,fun place love delievering packages to custumers.management will sit back and correct problems that arises
good,I love working the trucks.
good,Depressing environment. None of the employees want to be there and the supervisors are not too understanding because they are only concerned about making their goal for the day/week/month.
good,"We have a short meeting, and get right to work, its fast paced, and not much talking is allowed, managment is fine, most hardest part of the job would be being on your feet the entire time without no breaks"
good,"Despite being a printing office, this place is like the fast food of the print industry. You have to be both a salesman and a production operator and a shipping specialist."
good,a typical day at work race against the clock .
good,all of that changed over the years when profit was put ahead of the people
good,Processing jobs and running jobs while helping to coach team members.
good,"need new and challenging, experience and no opportunity advanncement"
good,"A typical day would be to parcel sorting, palletizing, loading and unloading while also assisting co workers with their work."
good,Parcel scan packages to bags and assist other workers
good,Not a good job if your looking to have a full time job with this pay rate.
good,"the work days are very long ,you get to learn the city well, management runs the show like a slave camp ,co-workers most are great people drive trucks with no AC ,meeting the customers"
good,Go into work prep before start time great co-workers and management start work and meet truck drivers and help out team mates if needed and end of work.
good,Nite shift was very trying but working independently and satisfying helped me to achieve my goals
good,"This is a very fast paced job,but they dont take car of employees who get hurt on the job!!"
good,Is a good company with grate benefit but is only good for a part time jog because it is very difficult to get a full time position
good,"theres nothing wrong with the job at all ,i love working for them!"
good,"The pace of business is very steady, for the packages never stop coming."
good,driving and delivering packages meeting some really appreciative people and finding that on some days customer satisfaction was not on the radar..
good,I would have retired from Fedex if it weren't for a mass layoff.
good,"Promoted to manager position a short time after employment to recruit, train, and supervise employers. Effectively facilitate production meetings; accurately monitor packages to assure quality assurance and safety."
good,"To load and unload breakers, to scan freight on and off the breaker, and to secure freight for travel."
good,"This company provides excellent benefits for prescriptions, doctor visits, and eye care."
good,fedex was a god campany to work for all the the hours could have been better and the work we was doin was switched around instead of doin the same thing everyday when there was many other positions in the warehouse people could do
good,The down side to working for Fed Ex when I did was there was Not enough hours and little pay. The up side was it was a fast pace working environment
good,"We work hard at FedEx, you will sweat. It is hot in the summer and cold in the winter. It is a part - time, flexible job which works out great for extra income if you have another job as I do. The health care benefits are excellent and that is the main reason why I work there."
good,"A normal day at work is pretty routine. You come in, grab a manifest, and get right to work. Its a fast pace environment that you need to give your full attention to. Learning to operate a forklift was pretty easy as is adjusting to the workplace environment. Not a hard job to do at all but that all depends if you get a good trainer to really guide you."
good,"Too much micro management, if you are older guy that may be in your 40's you will do a lot of warehouse work loading and unloading trucks instead of driving"
good,I really liked this job but it became to much to handle on my body I became sore from heavylifting double shifts and eventually broke my hand due to that.
good,While working at Fedex I got a chance to meet some really great and diverse individuals. Although we all came from different walks a life for the most part everyone seemed very genuine and caring.
good,"I have 2 young kids and the hours I was working just weren’t good for me and my family. My manager and contractor were excellent and helped me with anything I needed, they were not the reason I left!"
good,This was an ok place to work i didn't work here for long but its perfect for someone who has no trouble lifting.I personally couldn't handle it for over a certain amount of time. Definitely a lot of lifting and you have to make sure you are accurately scanning each package. It could be nerve wrecking at times when the wrist scanner isn't scanning correctly. Or even when you struggle lifting/handling sum of the packages. Great workout but harder than it seems.
good,"Over all, FEDEX is one of the best places to work.  "
good,"FedEx offers both early morning and early evening schedules. This is particularly ideal for someone looking to earn extra money throughout the year, while being able to remain committed to their primary F/T employer."
good,"I was happy to get the job but realized how abusive Fed-ex is in regards to caring for the people who work their butts off as Package Handlers and with little to no appreciation, pay was ok but benefits to expensive to purchase, got hurt badly 3 times because you are expected to lift way over the up to 50lbs it says on job info and fairness after being there 3 yrs and not moving up to supervisor  was disappointing as well"
good,Had nice people working there and before work we all had a stretching session. That and the fact that it was a relatively friendly working environment.
good,"Good company that doesn't compete with other organizations for technology candidates due to under average pay. Great facilities, decent benefits, but pay is seriously low."
good,"Fedex is all about the numbers, you are a number, not a person.  They do not care as long as the freight is moved.  Bad weather? well, you better show up and try to drive your set of doubles 200+ miles on ice covered roads.  Not showing up and trying to get your truck stuck in the ditch can get you wrote up."
good,"pay based on 50 hrs, but frequently worked more. terminal management didn't listen to driver suggestions.  holiday season is stressful, stops went from around 70 to as much as 120 on a rural route. undelivered packages roll over to the next day"
good,"I had a great time working but i had no reliable transportation which caused me to lost the position. Overall it was a great place to work, great environment."
good,You dont get bennifties till you work a 1000 hours in reno. The staff was grate. The drive was long. When it is the holiday season there is a lot fo work to be done you are lifting up to 150 lbs
good,"I like working at FedEx because I meet new people everyday."
good,"Some supervisors are unapproachable. If you have a valid question they will treat you like you're stupid for asking. Ive worked there long enough to know how most everything works, but there is still questions you gotta ask in order to do your job right. One supervisor just yells at everyone when he needs something done and if you mess up he'll all but cuss you out. Also i bust my butt everyday and i still get paid the same as every other part time employee. it would be nice to get some  recognition every once in a while.im not working for peoples approval but i am trying my bestt. So it would be nice if management show some appreciation."
good,"Work life balance was a challenge. High concentration of Indian Developers. Typical work day consists of a minimum of 5 meetings. very much a 'get it done' approach to the work. "
good,Must be able to manage a group of employees from 10-200 employees depending on the job title. Daily reporting in higher management and repetitive work daily.
good,The warehouse conditions weren't the best. The work wasn't properly distributed and the managers shave hours. Some of the veteran employees were helpful though.
good,Fast paced work place with a lot of walking and working in inclement weather delivering packages. Driving is a high demand for this job and working outside in all sorts of weather.
good,"Fedex Freight in the Fort Worth location needs a lot of improvement, starting with the management. It is no secret that a that you have to know someone in management to become a supervisor."
good,its an ok job to work at. It got its ups and downs but overall i feel it should look out for us when it comes to benefits but other than that its a cool job
good,"the people there were great. Fun environment. A lot of system issues that were very frustrating. Overall not a bad place to work. Everyone helps each other to achieve matrix. There really wasn't anything hard about the position. The calls came at a manageable speed. Another frustrating thing was that the calls are recycled a lot which upset customers for calling to much. Not many positions to advance. Most management has been there for years, I have not seen anyone move up past a team lead because there just wasn't any positions available to move up."
good,"Only do it if you have to, great for a part time job. It's not good for your only Job eventhough the medical benefits are great. They will drain you for 8 hours of work in 4 hours."
good,FedEx is all about numbers and metrics. If you produce you stay. It is not easy chasing an ever moving hoop to jump through but 12 hour days gives you plenty of time to try.
good,Company talks about safety and safe working conditions but Maneger seems not to know what working in a safe place is for example on the roads you can not use you phone but Maneger are the first one calling you to ask your time to arrival and if you do not pick up the phone they give you a warning that can be come a letter.
good,"Training isn't adequate and they through you to the wolves and expect you to thrive."
good,"great job with good pay, being able to see different areas is also a plus and driving with no one hassling you I also another benefit because sometimes you just need to be with your self to gain some clarity and stay focused."
good,"The best place to work for based on the benefits package. The pay is awesome. THE JOB IS EASY. IF YOU LOVE TO WORK"
good,Great place to work for if you're only looking for part time if you Want full time you are better off looking else where because full time there is not worth it it's only real busy during the holidays like Thanksgiving til January after that this place is super dead they send you home early and you can only work 20 hrs but out of all the jobs I had this is one that is actually good except for management they suck but other then that I loved the place
good,"Its a job, but theres definitely much better out there. Managers know enough to get by, but dont really know what they are doing half the time. Other times they are downright unprofessional."
good,This place knows how to nickel and dime you on the amount of work you put out compared to how much you get paid. They are a very fast paced environment exspecially around the holidays on and heavy on work loads not just on package handlers but on drivers as well.
good,opened trucks for loading emptied the belts onto rollers to be loaded into trucks and kept the shuts empty for merchandise to flow quickly while loading the trucks
good,"I worked with people who couldn’t wait to get there and with others that didn’t like it but needed a job"
good,They dont hire nayone full time. The hours are only 4 hours one day a week and 2 hour shifts the other 4 days. During peak is the only time u make your full hours.
good,"Algae in the lines feeding the ice machine, air conditioning regularly does not work in the summer with office temps reaching 80F or higher and the break room is often even hotter, vending machine is refilled once every 2-3 weeks for 100+ people, signs on bathroom doors having to remind people to clean up their feces/urine off the seat/floor/wall, shared desks with other shifts, open office with a team lead at the back of every row to monitor employees, talking highly discouraged, each team has THREE team leads and a manager and all 4 most be included in multiple emails a day, paperless office that requires lots of printing and marking documents in ink pen for scanning back into the system, complete disconnect from corporate management, if you want to advance in the company you have to be willing to move states and have at least a 4-year degree, no bonuses and only a merit-based pay increase which is usually at or below inflation rate depending on your review. No fast food within reasonable driving distance, refrigerators often have food taken from them, food trucks banned from property due to 'solicitation policies'."
good,It’s good for a temporary side job I was a package handler if you want hours you have to slave for hours in order to make good money too much work and I wouldn’t recommend working there as a career
good,"My manager told me that 3 specific people, he named them, ""hate working with you"".  I had no idea and I was let go about 4 months later.  That manager had just been promoted and he never like me either, he told me that to my face."
good,"I wish I never came to the customer representative side. Too stressful for little pay. Now my Bill's heavy."
good,"Working there was an experience that was mixed with both terrible times and wonderful times. I started out a seasonal worker that was converted to a full Fed-ex package handler. It is not easy work when you start out and with some managers working you to death before replacing you with someone else was not fun at all. Switching from loading to unloading was the best but was in no way easier. My manager in the beginning was awful however my second was a real down-to-earth guy that though more realistically as I am a human and not a machine. It was good working for him but unfortunately after peak season, hours were being cut and I couldn't stay anymore."
good,"There are a few good moments in there, you can have a banter with everyone and you get a few ciggy breaks, but it will drag at time and you will get sick of it. Money isn't bad though."
good,"good place to work just needs to pay more some management is great  good work ethic fun place to work teamates are easy to get along with"
good,"Fast paced , short staff"
good,The organization's treatment of it's employees are substandard and the environment often feels like the requirements feel harder than what is required. There is no air conditioning the indoor temperature feels like working outdoors.
good,"The hardest part of the job is there is so much to learn and know training. Training is based on placement with various team members some members are pleasant and actually are patient enough to train you , however, mostly you watch while nothing is explained so to get adequate training has been a challenge."
good,The job is very demanding. There is alot of overtime which is considered mandatory. The benefits are good. The pay is decent. The business is ever changing and so is the job.
good,"I Work Fedex Ground and Work For A Contractor,, The Amount Of Work Is Insane Be Expected To Lift Up To 150lbs Basically Lifting Furniture Car Parts 5 Gallon Buckets Clothes Tires Mattresses Box Springs Freezers Tvs Fridgerators Washers Dryers Wooden Barrels Pools Swingsets Anything You Can Think Of Honestly Anywhere Between 40lbs To 150lbs By Yourself With The Help Of A Dolly NOT Another Individual. Youll Be Delivering To Residentials And Businesses. The Amount Of Packages You Deliver On A Daily Basis Is Ridiculous Anywhere Between 150-300pkgs Stop Count Is Somewhere Between 90-140 Daily Be Expected To Work Anywhere Between 9-12hrs A Day Depending On Route Peak Season Aka Holiday Season Hours Are Long,, There Are Days Where Packages Cant Fit Inside Truck And You Wont Get Out Until After 8pm Just About Everyday, Mandatory 6 Day Work Week During The Holiday Season November-Mid January. Pay Depends On Route And Volume If Ever Asked To Be Hourly Or Salary Based Go With Hourly Otherwise You Will Feel Taken Advantage Of."
good,I worked the night shift while taking some college courses. The time requirements interfered with school at the time. The job was good for what I needed. The company had very clear set standards and goals that were effectively communicated. Although I was at the bottom of the ladder I was able to learn about management and how it directly effects workplace culture. I also got to view supply chain management from a new perspective.
good,"I felt like I was back in high school. The management keeps the place running just enough. The workers are like the students. There is a range of a**-hole-workers to everyday good hard-working employee. Do not expect any mental stimulation here. All it takes is for someone on the ""belt"" having a bad day or they are an a**-hole and they will pour their aggravation down your throat. This kind of work place is a time bomb. It is a place where someone is just waiting to explode."
good,Hours vary everyday and so do start times. We had to text our boss at 1:00pm for our start time which could be from 3-6 and we work until the work is done. The main boss needs to get over with his mid-life crisis already.
good,When you transfer from one FedEx to another they should let you know how much you are going to be paid not letting it be a surprise that your pay has been lowered.
good,I took this job over ten years ago.  I was really young so I don’t really remember a lot.  I can say it is very fast paced.  You work about 3 to 4 hours a day.  This job was part time for me and I think it wld be good for high school ppl.
good,"They tried to deliver twice without notice and decided they did their part, then asked me to come pick up my package in their stacja, 3h away from my place. They lied several times, on the phone, about coming a 3rd and 4th time. The phone employees are rude and clearly do not understand english. I had to declare my package as 'lost' because i was not able to make it to their office. Highly rude, unprofessional and disrespectful company. Delivery fee was more than 5 euros and i never received my package. Outrageous."
good,"If you work anything other than full time, you are at risk.  No benefits for you nor your family.  You have to be employed FULL TIME in order to obtain services provided.  Uniforms were not issued to part time workers; however, you would have to work overtime and take assignments in various places in order to be considered a FULL TIME EMPLOYEE."
good,"Package handler, if you are able to load and unload you will bust your butt at work everyday. The easier jobs will not be given to you. Fact. Depending on location...some management are great and others are terrible. The actual work culture at my location was agressive, no support, just yelling. I learned that no matter where you go, you leave because of bad management and you stay if management is good to you and helps you."
good,"You learn to work faster than you normally would, with still being able to think and know what your doing, to remain safe. Peers are energetic and fun, good atmosphere."
good,"Only a couple of hours a day, sometimes work starts around 6 in the morning all the way to 2 in the afternoon, but other than that its not to bad, 5 hour days the rest of the week."
good,"All positions even entry level pay extremely well. The schedules are all rough there are no good hours. Management is very hit or miss depending on the operations manager. Either they're focused on the overall goal and keep everyone on track to succeed or they allow the operation to run itself - often creating chaos. The majority of staff and management are male. Unfortunately, the boys club culture is something that is still very real. It creates a tough work dynamic in addition to contributing to the female stalled career progression. Seniority also plays a huge role for everything at Fedex Freight so positions that are not management are based on seniority not qualifications."
good,"It's a fast paced place to work and can be pretty stressful, they want you to go as fast as you can. The trucks can come in looking like there was an earthquake, and can be dangerously packed. I was injured and they basically swept me under the rug after they did the minimum to help, I don't think my back will ever recover."
good,"This is a job for a person who is freshly out of high school/attending college or old. This isn’t ideal for an adult with actual bills to pay. Inconsistent working hours and the managers/leads attitudes are a bit much sometimes.... The environment is okay, and favoritism is a HUGE thing here.."
good,I am not going to go into great detail. Our management team relies solely on the numbers of work being done but not on quality. They are not concerned with the quality of life of their agents nor with their concerns. They do not build-up their employees but filter out what the employee did wrong. When they do this they do not offer constructive ways to improve. I believe part of that reason is because they do not know how to do the job themselves. They are not required to know how to the job that they are supposed to managing.
good,My experience at FedEx is satisfactory. Coworkers are decent and management is ok.  There is no future career in this job so it is motivating to continue my experience elsewhere.
good,"FedEx Office runs with skeleton crews, mostly 1 person per shift."
good,"Very tough environment unless you are an hourly employee.  The culture had improved over the past five years due to the efforts of our new CEO.  However, now that he has retired it has quickly fallen back to the brow beating mentality from upper management.  H/R will not support leadership when issues arise. Expect to be just an employee i.d. number that is quickly replaceable."
good,Was an experience as a temporary employee with the potential for full time.  it was very demanding and stressful. Unfortunately did not work out due to personnel there in leadership
good,"Non male lo stipendio, ma la persona è un numero usa e getta. Difficile resistere"
good,"if youre looking for a part time job only to make extra money, then fedex is the place. It takes a extremely long time to get into a permanent position."
good,FedEx was a company that was fast-paced and energetic. Workers had to move at a pace that was beneficial to the company which in return sometimes caused issues with their workers. It was challenging and fun because I learned the job and areas quickly.
good,"Very poor management, no communication. They has they picks and do how they wants. No compassion for the people. The don't care about the associates as long as the work gets done."
good,"Typical customer service over the phone. Repetitive. It gets boring."
good,"Outside of 1/2 dozen managers, most are pretty good at what they do.  The rest are very young, and inexperienced in dealing with the variety of people that management staff deal with.  Some don't know how to communicate effectively, and others are just rude."
good,Great job to start out in and make a career out of. No vacations during the end of the year and you are forced to plan your vacation a year in advance
good,It is A good job just have to run around on your feet 10 hours all day had to pick items off of floor and put them in bin then send bin to be packed and with putting you put items on to the floor
good,Good contractor for Fed Ex but there are no benefits or health insurance. I also prefer to be off on weekends and the hours are longer during the holidays. It makes it difficult to make plans with the family.
good,I am a temp and am looking to start a career. And start a life . Looking to get something more solid and stable .  FedEx  is very  demanding   Witch is good if you like that
good,There was a great change that came months after I started working at FedEx where I unloaded packages onto a conveyor belt but the speed was hard and fast. The job that I started at was standing in one position for a couple of hours but I found that the first job was a bigger and less strenuous job where the work was constant but it became manageable
good,This is part time work four hours a day if there is packages to sort. Sent home early if there is not enough production. Last week I only worked a total of 6 hours.
good,"Eveyday was up and down. You never know if you're going to have a good day or bad day. Not all, but a lot of managers would throw employees under the bus to keep themselves from getting in trouble. Fedex is a team corporation that can turn into an individual workplace at any moment."
good,Hard work. Fast paced and management needs improvement. If you are a temp expect to work harder than the regular employee. Most likely other temps will help you.
good,"I loved working here despite the low hours, but you can work other shifts if you wanted to."
good,"job started out fine, but ended very quickly.  peak time was very chaotic and at times you worked 15 hour days to deliver 170 stops to which you never made that much more money for the work."
good,If you have any kind of background in mail or even if you don't have any experience with the United States mail this job is completely learnable and doable. Are special training and as long as you show up on time this job is yours as long as you want it.
good,FedEx is great for males seeking to bulk up and keep themselves limber and strong. Professional environment and clean. Short hours available. Alot of heavy lifting
good,"Solid company with good leadership.  Profits over people but most companies are.  Met many good people and made lots of great contacts.  I would recommend, especially as part time work."
good,Collaborated in a safe working environment and ensured assigned tasks were completed in allotted time. Operated a scanning device in a PC and RF based scanning software. Completed assigned tasks in a reasonable amount of time with a high level of accuracy. Loaded two box trucks per shift with little room for error. Researched patterns using Fedex shipping software and layout of all trucks dispatched daily.
good,"every day is busy , we learned to work together in  small areas ,,,, management  should send managers to schools of management Before appointments ,,,,,, culture is ok , not too much fun,,,,, the hardest part of the job is keeping pace with the workflow and the most enjoyable part was the getting to know a lot of different people and the very few cookouts and leaving after a long stressful morning."
good,"Its physically demanding, but overall a good entry level position.. if  a person is ambitious and can follow directions moving up is not difficult at all."
good,"Sales representatives sell retail products, goods and services to customers. Sales representatives work with customers to find what they want, create solutions and ensure a smooth sales process. Sales representatives will work to find new sales leads, through business directories, client referrals, etc."
good,Enjoyed working for this company was one of my favorite jobs just got frustrated with lack of promotion based off of Bologna. I felt like if I've been doing the job for a certain amount of months I need to get paid for doing that job
good,"My contract at FedEx was perhaps my least favorite assignment. To be fair, I was probably not their favorite contractor either.  It was a poor fit for me and for them.  The people were nice enough, but the culture and atmosphere was very different than what I am accustomed to.  That may be due to the size of the company. Regardless, I did not feel successful at FedEx and they would most likely agree with that."
good,"Truck Drivers transport items from warehouses and production areas to retail stores and businesses. Common duties listed on a Truck Driver resume sample are loading and unloading goods, delivering materials, reporting mechanical problems, maintaining the vehicle in good condition, and doing delivery paperwork."
good,"fast paced, sometimes chaotic job, that is often short on people, which in a positive light, means they are always looking! Management can sometimes be a little ignorant when it comes to how the hours and work may be affecting you. Its a great job if you can keep up"
good,It was a great place to work but the other managers just did what they wanted to do which was nothing the big boss didn't want to give me a raise as a full-time lead so I had to take a pay cut and step down to get a raise in 30 days a just full-time parcel sorter which was a very stressful situation
good,"A typical day at work is receiving holds, opening the front counter, working on issue packages as well and handling walk in customers. As a front facing staff we need to be always in our best mood and understand and empathize with the customer and help as much as possible at store level. There are restrictions throughout the shipping world and we need to be on our toes to catch the unlikely items that would be prohibited in certain countries. We are set with a large list of responsibilities that need to be followed at all times. The workplace is a relatively good place to be, the majority of the time we are faced with being short staffed and that would be the hardest part, we were given 12 hour shifts because of this issue and the hardest part is that we were expected to do these long shifts. It is mentally and physically exhausting. The people; both customers and co-workers are extremely enjoyable and we genuinely have a friendship."
good,"Was a holiday worker. Only hired  for a short amount of time , before finding a a new more fulfilling position. A good company though. Worked with great people"
good,"Management isn't the best. In my experience we were given a work load that was way beyond what our sort was able to do.  Warehouse has no air conditioning, fans for trailers don't cool you off. No breaks, just time to drink some water every once in a while."
good,FedEx is definitely a great company to work. They have a great management team and security force. It’s a good company to be a driver. I worked in the warehouse which was good as well. The only problem was lack of hours
good,"never a dull moment, changing environment. teamwork long hours hard to maintain life work balance. ………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………….."
good,I work there to get some money for college that it I personally don't like working in factory but I need that cash so I got the cash okay my way today useless words
good,"It is a great company, but the Trace Department is the worse place out of them all. There is no growth here. My colleagues have been her for 15+ years and not once was offered a promotion or hired in another departments."
good,Not a bad place to work. The job has its usual ups and downs like any other job. Management does its best to ensure the employees work in a safe and respected environment.
good,I understand clearly why the salary is started off at such a high pay rate. The work is constant and very difficult to maintain organized work ethic. Thank you
good,"Courier/Driver"
good,"4am to 8am sometime 9am depending on trucks arrival."
good,"Very fast paced. Hardest part was learning tariffs and NMFC regulations. "
good,"Part time work that is very accelerated and physical. Loading fleet trucks, unloading trailers and sorting packages in a timely fashion Great Health benefits."
good,I appreciate the work life balance the company provides.  The hardest part of my job is working on out of scope project initiatives that requires management decision.
good,"I can’t speak for others when I say that federal express isn’t a job for me. The managers there doesn’t care about anyone but themselves and product more the the workers. And to me that’s bad business, because safety would be the number one priority. Although they say safety is an priority their actions speak otherwise."
good,"The hours here are not fixed if you work unloading planes and trucks. If there are not enough packages, they will send people home early. When there is a lot of packages and a lunch break is required, they often to not give the break until after 4 hours have past, which is required by law to give the lunch break with a 4 hour period during a shift lasting longer than 6 hours."
good,"sucks working in all weather temps, working nights gets old though, job feels repetitive but simple, nothing very difficult to do. nice coworkers everyone is friendly"
good,"As a package handler.  A typical day at work consists of clocking in when you come in.  Than after you clock in you go to your work area and have a little safety briefing/meeting.  After that your manager assigns you to a truck to work with and that's about it.  You will be loading, or unloading a fed ex truck."
good,Fastpace work with no breaks or lunch because of only 4-5 hr shifts but would be a better job if employees could maintain a 40+ hr work week to better provide for their families
good,"I enjoyed the work while at fed ex, but at the same time that was when there was work to do there. I was hired as full time but ended up getting less then 20 hours a week and sometimes maybe 1 to 2 hours of dock time a day. Then clock out and go home. IT just was not enough to pay the bills and keep my head a float as well. If there were more hours and more work to keep busy the job would have been 5 stars. I do think they should pay more then what they do, especially when you are unloading poisonous materials in which if the package was to break open you could die before making it off the truck."
good,"IT is a very fast pace job to do, it is not fun and it is also a lot of stress. None stop movement odd hours a very little break the pay is okay but not worth it for that job."
good,I am the best in the building when it comes to almost everything .Instead of relying on the team management uses me and a select of other skilled individuals to do the job.It has been like that so to take the work off me i start training the new hires to improve the culture ; which it did but i still have a hard time. I am looking for another job because of the medical benefits .
good,"A Fedex Brasil é uma empresa boa para se trabalhar, pois o serviço é acessível a todos e possui ótimos benefícios, porém existe problemas na gestão de pessoas e cultura no geral. O serviço possibilitava trabalho em equipe e respeito, pois são atividades que um depende do outro."
good,The same people who worked hard did most of the work while those who didn't work sat around or chill in the Locker-room. once the plant became more and more short staffed the people became lazier.
good,"Working at FedEx doesn't really offer room for advancement. I need to work for a company that I can grow with, that offers insurance, and that I can someday retire from."
good,"Ok place to work. Heavy on micromanagement, otherwise it is not the worst place to work. Generally, the staff are nice. The management are a bit greedy and over obssessed with pilots though."
good,"Fun"
good,fast paced goal orientated not enough hours for the dock workers. very cold in the winter. drivers are treated like gods most everyone else are expendable.
good,"This job was awesome until a new manager came on board and began treating those not the same race as he, poorly in comparison to the counterparts whom shared his race.  He was able to fire people he didn't like for no apparent reason.  There is no union and no one to go to bat for you."
good,"Overall, I have enjoyed my time with FedEx. I have grown a lot and will walk away with great job skills I would love to further elsewhere.The fast-paced job really did make the days fly by. The people I have met along the way have all be great and brought a ton of diversity to the table."
good,"Al principio es bueno, pero después al ser una empresa en donde todo es medible, requiere uno perfección"
good,I enjoyed working with the people and I tried to make it work out but it just didn’t work out for me. I had to stay up usually most nights just to be up so I could go to work. That’s unhealthy so  I decided it wasn’t worth it.
good,fedex is a great job to be on the open road. the job can be challenging but not over bearing. management is very supportive and understanding. this is to me a great starting job in the delivery field
good,"Pretty simple work with nothing special outside seeing packages move from point A to point B.  Management is fairly relaxed and understanding, but they are also task oriented. The goals are met with well placed staffing and in the end you do one task nearly the entire shift and then go home.  You get left alone most of the time and you collect a paycheck.  Eventually if you work for a year they'll reward you with benefits."
good,"I had worked not in the FedEx division, but in the Kinkos division.  It was a great place to work, as it worked around the school schedule at the Academy of Art.  I learned a lot about print and binding. "
good,"You will get up early in the morning to be there on time, start times for package handlers are around 3:30 am, 2 am in the peak season. You'll be assigned 3 to 4 trucks to load, which is about 300 to 400 packages. Packages will flow down the belt and you will take the ones with your truck number, scan them, and load them onto the truck. "
good,I was only hired as a temporary delivery driver during the peak season for the company. The pay was really good considering where I live. The job itself had long hours usually starting around 7 AM and ending anywhere from 4 PM to 7 PM depending on whether you can drop off the packages quick enough.
good,"Fed Ex became a lot, due to the fact of what I do full time. working around the clock, along with being on call for the city became a bit too much. So had to let Fed Ex go."
good,Its a good place to work.  Alot of people fail to realize that the customer that we service is one of the leading healthcare providers.  Lives depend on us to get the product out of the door.  The only downside is that there isnt a high ceiling in career advancement.  The next step up for me is the Systems/IT Manager postition but my boss probably wont retire for another 10 years atleast.
good,Fast paced job. Had to move quick or you would get backed up. Otherwise good job. They tried to over work me thought. That’s the reason I left. I hit my breaking point loading 4 bull trucks at once.
good,"The best part about it is the potential for advancement in the company,  If you have an annoying manager it can kill the whole experience of working there.  It can also be quick-paced and stressful at times."
good,Fed ex warehouse package handling is a very physically demanding job.If you are interested in jobs that require you to do physically demanding tasks than this the job for you.
good,Not a bad work place. Just like anything else it has it's ups and down. It's very stressful through the winter months when its the peak season. For someone without a college education it's a great place to work and have benefits for yourself and your family.
good,seasonel worker - not always so organized - you are at the mercy of the contractor you will be working for.  Fedex shoves all responsibility onto the contractor and some times formulates routes that are impossible to run in decent amount of time. keep your eyes open as other drivers can help and also hurt your performance.  once I went to the bathroom and returned to find the driver on the belt next to me messing with my boxes mis labeling them and putting them on my cart - no wonder at the end of the day I would have boxes left over that were not on my turn by turns.  but another time  a driver helped rescue me at the end of the day.  take it with a grain of salt
good,A really great work environment unfortunately training was not done very well and you were basically stuck trying to figure out a lot of the things on your own.
good,The best part about working at FedEx Freight are the people you meet while gaining an abundance of knowledge and experience. The opportunity for advancement is there if wanted.
good,Hard working position with limited opportunity for advancement.  Requires attention to detail and ability to work in fast-paced environment. Must be able to work in all kinds of weather conditions.
good,It went by fast if the orders were completed. I learned proper order picking and auditing. management needed work. It was fun and the people were great. Auditing orders with lots of different products. working equipment.
good,WORK WORK WORK says your aloud to get breaks but then get yelled at if you do. if you do well then you get in a special team who work until you cant. if you do well then you will work harder than anyone else.
good,"it's alright I guess. Most people just show up to punch the clock and earn some money. I show up and give 110% every day that I am able. Ofcourse I have had some days where I needed to take things a little slower, but the dense management find it annoying to have to do anything besides talk about which football team is better."
good,"My experience working at Fedex was mostly positive. It was a very fast paced environment, and we didn't leave until all work was finished. The job wasn't bad. I left because of school reasons."
good,It was a fast paced environment. You have many career opportunities to advance in the company. Also have alot benefits as well. You get a workout from the heavy lifting.
good,"Everybody works as a team. Have fun but get the job done. Have to be on time. Working for fed ex opened a lot more opportunities for me. What I learned from working here people sometimes look a a delivery guy as a hero , just like police men , fire fighters etc. Best part about it pay days"
good,"Typical work day in the hub was very fast paced, noisy, depending on the weather, it would be uncomfortable handling various sized packages"
good,"poor management requiring excessive hours be worked in a tense, fast paced environment. disengaged managers with no concept of staff needs, challenges."
good,"Overall the place is a hardworking location. It is not the type of place where you can really relax as more than likely you will be constantly doing something. At the same time, do to how large of a company it is, many things have a tendency to slip under the radar as it were. There seems to be an air of apathy to be had and it never really feels like the managers actually care unless whatever the situation is happens to be too big to just ignore. the managers do their jobs, but they don't do much of anything beyond that, and really just seems to be bare minimum. there are outliers of course and my experience with most have been with those outliers, yet when working with other managers, they just never seemed to care about anything but getting the job done ASAP. Its sad, but that's big business for you."
good,"During my department, I was in charge of the returns, we would take phones and eletronics that would go through the returns section, we as a materials team we would only support all areas. But honestly the repetition of the job was really boring."
good,"hard work, stress. Weather condition with the hard work, it a hard job and with high turn over form employees that makes it ever harder. Everyone in management covers their rears and will let the problem drop on someone else ."
good,"Awesome Company, this was one of the reasons why I wanted to work for FedEx. The location I am working is not very organized. Lack of appreciation for hard workers. The work itself, is not difficult, I rather enjoy it. The lack of appreciation is what I do not agree with. Great job, just poor management. There is a lack of communication amongst managers and workers. Training is non existent as well. I'm not sure how you expect your employees to grow if there is no real training going on. The morale is horrible as well. If you are not a self motivated person you will be disappointed."
good,"No AC.. They have horrible management, they hire anyone who applies. If you work more than 50 hours, expect for hours to be missing on your check. No real room for growth."
good,save yourself. I mean once you are hired here they suck you in with good benefits and pay and then steal your soul. meeting your goals and stats is unrealistic. Management is all over you to meet your numbers. shifts change yearly if that and they are not flexible with shifts or being late.
good,Before they got rid of the FedEx Freight West HQ it was a nice place to work. They decided to have only one HQ. At the time I was working there it was extremely paper based and backwards.
good,Its an OK place to work. Pay isn't bad but it isn't great. Most employees are OK to work with some others are horrible. A lot of jerks but a lot of good people also.
good,poor communication skills between upper management leaving a lot of work to be done by workers to compensate with few hours. Always a fast paced and stressful environment which can be dangerous if not careful. Many coworkers and myself have had to complete work incident reports most was three in one week.
good,"Good group of employees and strong teamwork structure. Fast paced and extremely busy. Good place to work for. Show up to work on time, work hard, and you will always have a job."
good,"very nice and fast paced working place."
good,"Working here drained a lot of my energy, but at the time the pay was good enough for me. This job helped me keep my car running and helped me keep some cash in my pocket."
good,"The work at FedEx is same everyday and dealing with accident and complaints from customer. The biggest thing about is dispatching drivers and making pick ups in a timely manner. As a Manager, i do follow ups with the our Business Partner( Contractors) to ensure there is a plan in place to make sure Packages are transported out of building daily."
good,I enjoy what I do there. The bosses basically let you be so its easy to get what you need done. My contractor does not provide health insurance or any benefits which is a bummer but it is a good job. Not a lot of advancement so I would not say that it is a career. The faster I get done the more I make per hour which can be nice until peak season when I am out from 6am to 5pm.
good,"Crazy amounts of overtime due to high workload, can be frustrating at times when some team mates don't put forth the same effort."
good,a typical days work was getting on a forklift reading the bill of ladings then lodging in a computer at the dock and unloading and transporting freight across the dock.
good,The job was only seasonal and they don't keep very many. Nice workflow.  Good people. Early hours but short workday. Fast paced. Easy to learn jobs.  Weekly pay.
good,My previous job as package handler at FedEx wasn't good at all. Not organized enough to send boxes to load in freight. Sometimes one of freight left unattended and boxes have been send to it and it was completely mess.
good,Fedex Warehouse Package handler is a workout in itself non-stop lifting 50-100 lb. boxes running from the back of one truck to another all while trying to keep pace and meet deadlines.
good,"A day working at fedex is like any other warehouse the job of a package handler can be very busy at times and also temperature watch during the summer, the work place environment has to much   dealing with the location"
good,"This is a good place to work with good benefits, but prepare to do more than one job. I am the shipping and receiving clerk and I also have to help out on the pack line."
good,"I have hate or dislike for FedEx, just some main Management had at the time problems and/or dislike with me, I did ever and anything managers asked of me, but still cut hours from me, and it is a part-time job, I like hard work, but that's if I am being payed handsomely or rewarded with more hours."
good,"The days are long with little benefits (Insurance, paid time off, retirement).  However, working and building relationships with the customers are the highlight of my day."
good,"The work environment wasn't comfortable to work in. Management was terrible, didn't take the time out to understand people and understand of what they were capable of doing."
good,"It was alright, you had to clean up the previous shift's mess."
good,"FedEx has its ups and downs, but it's a company that pushes you to succeed if you choose to do so. The hardest part of the job is anything you make hard."
good,"Provided ample about of training but was micromanaged from my direct supervisor from the beginning.  Good benefits, i.e. days off, sick days, pension, stock options, 401k."
good,"This facility was a warehouse where you had to scan packages at a very high rate. Easy job to acquire and the turnover rate was high, although I met some employees who had been with the company for more than 5 years. You can move up the ladder but it extremely slow because there aren't that many opportunities. It gets extremely hot in the summer and extremely cold in the winter. Some managers were alright, but some didn't manage to the best of their abilities and rude a lot of the time. Some coworkers were extremely rude and did not want to help. Sometimes they forced us to process a large amount of packages with a little amount of people."
good,Worked evening shift loading and unloading truck trailers with a forklift. It was a fun job. The crew was fun to work with. Management was relaxed. fast paced job. The hours and pay is kind of low.
good,Being a courier for Fedex means long days in a fast paced environment and a lot of driving.  It is definitely better suited for younger people with no family at home.
good,"The company is a good place to work, as long as the freight is coming in you will have work, other than when it get's cold in the winter time, or hot in the summer."
good,I loved working for FEDEX.  I had tremendous experiences until last location.  I would love to work for FEDEX again.  The great part about that is there are many locations in Tampa that will provide a positive work environment making it easy to want to strive and shine everyday.
good,A great place to work with a world class brand that holds its own and makes sure it's employees get all the benefits that puts them on an international podium.
good,This job was great for those who would want to earn great pay but at the cost of working very few hours a week for poor management.  This job was fun if you meet and make friends.
good,"The only reason I'm not still with FedEx Home Delivery is because they have bad hours.  "
good,"I don't have to work for FDX again. It is a great company and my time there was up. Overall instilled in one a ,great work ethic and endorsed professionalism 100%."
good,"A typical day at work would be to unload and offload 53 foot trailers at 1059 packages a hour to sustain a average unload/loading rate. i learned time management and how to keep my pace up while working. overall it was manual labor of course and there was ""hard part"" to the job. The hours obtained weekly were horrible."
good,It is a very interesting place to work.  Especially if you are looking for interaction with other employees and people.  As well as teamwork.  The job consisted of keeping the designated area clean and watching for anything faulty.  The people in the suites you made sure they were comfortable and you checked to make sure balance was kept and positivity remained
good,"Disorganized...I've learned how to deal with different people. In addition to, I've required great people skills and I've become PC Efficient. It's not the best place to work. but I've acquired great skills and experiences."
good,"Didn't care for the politics with managment and their inability to tell the truth on a given day. Very vague, never had any clue what was going on."
good,"the work is ok, but its very stressful at most times, customers are very rude, and some of your co workers have attitude problems."
good,FedEx is a comfortable place to work if you have no ambition and are OK being a cog in the wheel. It's an incredibly boring industry.
good,Ok job to start off. Alot of hard work especially during peak season. Dont get alot of hours. Check are not worth the type of work that you are doing.
good,Taking non stop calls from fedex customers. The Job it's self is great but the thing is the company cut back hours training is provided but could use more hands on(navigating) great place to work for but u really have to teach yourself
good,"I was a very hard worker and was asked to preform more then my job description. I found the management to show favoritism . I loved working on aircraft and  with the fight crew that would land at our ramp, but as for being a courier the stress level was off the charts."
good,A typical work day would include preparing documentation for air import and export shipment. I've learned how to use cognitive and mathematical skills under pressure. My management was good but I felt as if they could have been more organized. The most enjoyable part about the job was my co-workers. They are great people.
good,A very time consuming working environment .there is no overtime if deliveries are done after working hours.you get to meet all sorts of people .  You also get to build up a client relationship .
good,"FedEx always has work for people to do, but the routes can take you all day to finish. The managers are understanding and are willing to work with your schedule."
good,a typical day at work consisted of clocking being assigned to 3 or more trucks at a time and trying to be able to fully load them before your shift ended at 4 am.
good,"I was there as a temporary worker.  Even though we had the same job as the permanent workers, the management constantly oppressed the temps. I would have quit, but I knew it was temporary so I stayed until my contract ended."
good,"move into trailers with right labels and have a high scan frequency as well as learning to sort packages great people good experience, the hardest part is keeping up with flow"
good,"Overall, Fedex is a face pace immensely tasking job, the people there are either fit or not. Sometimes things for freight would come onto regular trailers and it was difficult to move things over 150lbs. People do help you and there are some strong characters there as well. You must keep a pace of 1,500 boxes an hr once you've finally become a FedEx crew member. It's hard when all the packages are twice your size and weight. You are expected to do this by yourself or on the off chance there is one other helping you. The managers get flustered easily but its understandable when the supervisors get upset the line isn't moving as fast. The hardest part of the job was splitting the belts from A packages to B packages. I almost threw out my back trying to do this, but I volunteered most times for more hrs and experience.Some of the people there don't last long because they are already medically not fit to do such activity (part time or not!) or they are just too lazy to fit the bill. Overall I wouldn't do it again but I learned a lot of time management and I gained a lot of strength!"
good,"Depending on the contractor and route you signed with, you can have the best or worse experience from the job itself. Working for FedEx Ground you WILL NOT have any benefits, not even discounts at other FedEx branches. Now some of the routes are great, you can knock stops in no time. And other routes are terrible where no matter how you plot your stops you're in for a long day."
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo. "
good,"It is a Physical demanding  job  , Good company to work for. coworkers are helpful and fun to work with. Can use a lot of the skills learned here at other jobs."
good,It's great living and working in a town where you can provide great customer service to not only your customers but your neighbors and friends as well.
good,i liked the part of my job because we would transport goods from place to another...in addition ive manage to familiarise myself with most areas in and around johannesburg. the hardest part of the job would be if we could find a certain place in a particular area and still had other places to deliver to which means that my target was not met with for the day...didnt really have much time to socialise and get to know people because we were out most of the time but all was well...the only thing i enjoyed was meeting new people and glad that i made a difference in someones life
good,"Fedex is a great company to work for, its just all they care about is their selves, work shift sucks, they say in order for you to move to another position is to bid for it, but they put people were they want to put them..i love working there is just we need better managers and more people who care about there employees as well as there job"
good,The benefits and the pay were very good. Moving up in the company is very hard..i have been working here for 3 years and i am still part time which is frustrating.
good,"A typical day at work for supervisor/managers is 10-11 hours, very fast paced and physically demanding. Supervisors often eat lunch on the fly because they generally have no down time to step away from stand up desk."
good,"I would ensure packages and documents were sent to the proper location in a timely manner.  The environment was quick moving, productive and professional.  It was a strong team environment with open-communication."
good,"A typical day was loading trucks and scanning for damaged boxes."
good,"always hard work, every three to four hours, learn to always stretch first, been the knees before lifting, always team work, never lift heavier boxes alone and always practice safety."
good,"Great place to work, if you like to lift objects, even better if you love to work out it pays good and shifts are 4 hours so you could work part time if you wanted to or take a third shift and work 12 hours"
good,"Internationals entry clerk, to capture data and print documentation for airport customs to release shipments that are to be exported abroad. Courier Debrief Clerk, To check that all Courier trip sheets are completed correctly and check that all supporting documentation are attached as they are handed in, to contact customers to confirm and verify delivery address’s, most convenient time for delivery or confirm recipient availability."
good,long hard day while there kept me busy which i liked pay was good not enough hours tho but overall a very busy job with a good work environment
good,"Load your truck drive from the station start your day and be on your own all day. Really nice job, great hours, can be long. Good money worth the long haul if you plan on retiring."
good,"For the PT dockworker position, the day is very fast paced.  Although you are working around about 30+ people, you must be very self-sufficient.  Dock supervisors/management is usually very overwhelmed, yet there are many instances where everyone MUST go to them for guidance.  Attendance needs to be near perfect for this job as well.  The company offers excellent benefits, 401(k), and tuition reimbursement for PT employees.  There is definitely an issue amongst supervisors/managers and their ability to communicate and lift morale.  If you can deal with supervisor/manager gossip and condescension, then you will be fine with this job.  Overall I enjoyed working for the actual company, but the location and politics of that seemed to be a big disappointment."
good,"Repetitive work which is what I like, Loaded packages on to the trucks for shipment. Helped other teammates if they were behind on their trucks."
good,You work many hours and have to help other people who slack. No benefits or Insurance.  You are contracted out so it kinda is what it is.  Nice to have no supervision and just do your job daily though.
good,The company in itself is really good. The benefits are amazing for single and family people. The people I work with are really nice and seem pretty motivated to move forward in life. The only problems is the management I am under don't enforce rules on the higher up positions and there is a lot of favoritism going on.
good,"The company is Ok, but when it comes to advancement within the company, it's all about who you know and if the supervisor likes you.  For about a year, I asked to be put on an earlier shift and they dropped me down from a full time employee to a part time employee and I had been working for this company for 5 years. I was told I would have to apply for the same position again and wasn't told why I had to apply. In the beginning I was told when something became available and was never informed on being put on earlier shift. I didn't feel that was fair to be dropped down from Office Admin to a part time package handler with less pay. When I transferred from one station to another, they opened up a position for another worker with the hours I needed."
good,"Fedex Express is a good place to work with benefits for part time employees, but there is never enough hours. Advancement and full time hours are available after approximately 18 months."
good,arrive at depo sort tickets load and scan parcels onto van then ready for delivering I've learn't the importance of multi drop delivering my manager is very helpful if I've any problems and so are my co-workers hardest part of my job is making sure I deliver all my parcels on time but the most enjoyable part of my job is knowing I've delivered everything
good,"I worked third shift, scanning packages for further shipping. Warehouse was constantly hot. We worked for 10 hours and maybe more if needed."
good,this job was all over the place basically working in the warehouse to being at the store level and working with different types of personalities
good,"Fast paced every day, bad weather conditions, co-workers good but some were related to management and treated differently."
good,always on the move never a dall moment. always on the move and something different everyday. I learned that you have to work as a team to get the job finished. The management wanted to have you grow and develop you as a person within the company. The hardest part of the job was the company was worried about hitting numbers and their goals.
good,It started off as employee friendly then went totally numbers oriented when the company began merging with other smaller companies.
good,"Physically, mentally, & emotionally demanding. Great way to stay on your toes, but huge learning curve! Work until you are done is a great way to get hours but a hard way to schedule personal responsibilities. Hardest job I've ever had."
good,"The job was faced paced and heavy labor. I enjoyed the idea of going for a great ""workout"" and getting paid for it. Most of my co-workers were very helpful. We enjoyed contests of who could get the most scans. I learned a lot about aircraft and how they worked. It is a real learning experience. I would suggest it to anyone. The worst part of the job is the extreme weather conditions. Even if you are under cover, you are still exposed to the elements."
good,"Its hard work for little pay. They have great benefits but the pay sucks. Management train you for like 1 day and then just throw you out on your own. They expect you to do everything so perfect. I do not like working here. The coworker's are great to work with. U can call on them for anything, they'll come running to help."
good,"While the benefits are acceptable at FedEx Ground, it simply isn't a place that I would like to grow. My passion and interest is in photography and the arts including but not limited to working with Premiere, Photoshop, Lightroom and learning new software programs to build upon all things new."
good,"I had to Unload trucks, load trucks, scan packages. I learned how to build walls and pallets of packages. I learned to work with the team effectively"
good,"Job was very physical and demanding. Had to be very organized, delivered as many as 150 stops per day. Providing excellent customer service was a rewarding part of the job."
good,"Typical Day - Monitor HP open view for reported errors.  Report on any errors using Lotus Notes.  Repair issues as able, escalate if not able to repair."
good,"This Job was the longest job I ever had. This was also, the worst job I ever had because the team lead yell, cuss and the workers and there is no team work what so ever."
good,It's a good stable job with benefits until you get on your feet. Clickish and advancement depends on who you know or who likes you.
good,I don't really want to rant but it's difficult to move up. If management has eyes set on who they want to advance you are s.o.l.... you have to relocate if you really want to advance in this company. Limited training and teachable moment. overall its okay
good,"The job is not bad, but it's hard to spend time with your family.  Lately there has been a reduction in employees.  When people are being lost, they are not being replaced.  As a result more work is falling on fewer people and that is effecting the quality of work that is getting done.  People are stretched thin and easily irritable.  The annual compensation increase also does not keep up with inflation.  There is also a feeling of under appreciation, when you consistently attempt to go above and beyond.  It's time for a change.  I just want the company to get back to putting their employees first, as opposed to the stock holders."
good,"It was a good part time job, unfortunately I had to have a Hernia Surgery which prevent me from performing the job at that moment."
good,Another company that give me an opportunity but due to seasonal had to be let go. This company was a joy to work with. The co-workers  where very helpful.
good,The work can be physically demanding but the tuition reimbursement helps if you are trying to finish your education and if you are only trying to earn extra money the hours wont conflict with another job.
good,"Only work there for a short time. Think this would be a great job, but not really. I have hurt my hand there and they wouldn't even help me get works comp. Till this day may hand has never been the same. It may say you get paid 11.95 , but it's part time so you won't get a check over 300 dollars."
good,"-clock in, put ppe on, walk to the belt and do what ever needs doing like sorting out the parcels, moving pallets and cages, building pallets up, wrapping then and putting them in correct place, load on to lorry, "
good,"The environment would make huge changes daily. very unpredictable.  No job security. In a warehouse, sometimes it gets extremely hot or extremely cold."
good,A typical day start at 10pm and is over by 3:30am. I unloaded FedEx freight trucks and handled delicate parcels. There was limited customer interaction and most trucks had to be unloaded by a deadline.
good,A typical day consist of loading and unloading cans. I learned alot about working in warehouse environment. management was good as long as you got the job done accurately and on time.
good,"sometimes a long work week but other weeks like any normal day. This company did help me to become a better manager. Your co-workers are very helpful, very good atmosphere some days."
good,"overall good company, very demanding nth physically and mentally, learned time management and how to drive large vehicle"
good,"A typical day at work consist of  answering on going phone calls, dispatching drivers, data entry and review, assit managemnt by retrieving driver files, handling application process. Some of the co-workers are not very nice. Management is okay but could be better. I learn something new everyday with dispatching drivers. I enjoy the application process and dispatching."
good,Great for a part-time job. It's not a great job where you include personal life like family time. Can get tired after a period of time
good,"i felt like i did much more than others but it was a ok company to work for. Was expected to do alot and no credit was given at times."
good,"I enjoy the job. I dont agree with the mgnt. And all the littles things you have to day to day , besides just doing your job. Fortune 500 company doesn't pay all the empolyees well."
good,"work can be hard at times, you learn how to work well alone, great co-workers, plenty of discounted perks, management generally appreciates you hard work"
good,"Tuesday Through saturday as an employee at fedex we scan heavy packages and sort them into different cans being shipped to different cities and states. We work 2-3 hours a day, hours varies from 17 hours total a week."
good,"From not being eligible for the 401k plan due to my age, to receiving counsel for helping team members out of my area, FedEx has showed me that the employees are not treated fairly in compliance with its ""No Discrimination Policy"". The job is quite unfulfilling because you stack packages for hours on end with little payoff. Half the people employed are there solely for the half decent benefits."
good,"- Good benefits"
good,Physically demanding but rewarding job. Management was difficult at the best of times. Teamwork was a constant lesson to be learned here.
good,overall not a bad part time job good pay good work but its only 4 hours a day 5 to 6 days a week. the atmosphere was fun but cold because it was winterish weather all together it was a fun place but would of been better with more hours
good,Typical day at work would be coming in at about 17:30 - 18:30. Learned how to lift and use certain machinery to move the freight from inside to the planes. Hardest part was doing the work during christmas and due to the extra valume getting injured.
good,It's a good place to work but there are a few cons. No benefits since FedEx ground is owner/operator. Work days are long and stressful. The Christmas rush is murder for drivers and loaders.
good,"In the area where I was employed, the management was tremendously poor. The manager and team leader did not want to work around your job schedule, if you had a another job. They were rude and unfair and constantly changed the hours that a person worked, therefore the cause of money shortages on my paycheck."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is talking to customers.  That's followed up closely with learning how other aspects of my other people's job fits into the big picture for all involved.  I've learned a lot at FedEx Trade Networks.  The industry is very dynamic and ever changing, but there is surprisingly small opportunity for advancement at FedEx Trade Networks.  That can be a good thing for stability in management but not for development and advancement of employees.  The hardest part of the job is times where the customer is disappointed and upset.  Especially when you know you did your best, but the outcome was out of your control."
good,Get to work. They tell us how the shift is going to go. Then head to my department and start working. Loading trucks. Work Part-time
good,Short work shifts and lots of good people to work with great if you need a little money on the side and getting paid to get fit is a plus
good,FedEx ground is a good place to work at. The job security is definitely there but the wages and advancement opportunities are a little scarce.
good,"Very good job for someone who is focused on money. Not so good for someone who is focused on family and a social life. Staffing was a challenge, so everyone works many hours above their scheduled hours."
good,really a typical warehouse job in Memphis..they care about the business and freight more than they do the workers...I think work conditions could be wayyyyy better...all the managers are liers and creeps.
good,I worked independently and drove 300 miles a day. It was an ok job. I just wished I had more days there. I delivered many packages a day.
good,"I was not too fond of the work environment. there was not enough training on how to successfully perform this job, outside of learning yourself. also, it was not emphasized enough how fast-paced the occupation was. however, co-workers were much more helpful than management was."
good,Very good company to grow with. with many of opportunities to grow with company when its permanent positions avaiviable.
good,Burlington is a customer service environment that ask requires patients. the management was okay but the co-workers are great.
good,"This job is not a bad job to have as far as part time jobs are consern, u get off as soon as your work is finished, so that leaves u with the rest of the day to work another job if desierd, its not hard and they take a intred in there workes as well"
good,"Salary for management is based on a 10 hour day.  Compensation is decent, not the best, not the worst, decent.  At the Associate Manager position, there is churn, whether by promotion or termination, so expect a different management style and approach every 6 months or so.  Management co-workers are amiable, not someone I would want to spend much time with outside of work, but they help get the job done.  The hardest part for me was being in an open-air environment, especially during the winter.  Just brutal.  The best part of what I do involves teaching and coaching younger workers to do their best, regardless of whether or not they stay with the company."
good,FedEx Ground is a fast-paced workplace. There are good and bad days within the company with managers and co-workers. I learned a lot about P&D vision and AWAD Plan Submission.
good,"It's a good entry level job to those interested in banking."
good,"very hard work inviroment,cold in the winter and hot in the summer.condition were harsh.some management was poor but others were very motivating.hours were not to great but pay some what made up for it."
good,"11 P.M. - 3 or 4 A.M."
good,Learnt new skills and enhanced leadership qualities. Had good experience with logistics domain but would like to get into some new fields and enhance my skills further more.
good,"only female in all male environment , harassed. the benefits were good. learned a lot about logistics,  shipping receiving"
good,Days with this company start of hectic and ends the same way. Very fast paced environment with little time to recoup. Overall it was a great opportunity and good experience.
good,"FedEx is a great company to be a part of. Great benefits and compensation. The job of a courier is a blast. I enjoy looking forward to work everyday. "
good,"This job was great when I was still in school. They were flexible and scheduled me around my classes. Now that I have finished my undergrad degree I have looked into moving up within the company. Unfortunately the opportunity for advancement there is quite limited. In the 6 1/2 years I've been working this same position, (under different companies and contracts) there have been significant changes within the department. Unfortunately these changes have not all been positive ones. There are now managers in place who are creating a hostile work environment with their antics. The business ethics and accountability in the chain of command has been eroding away for years. It is now time for me to get out of this less than ideal situation, and into something that is more up to par with my capabilities."
good,A typical day at work was a lot of moving from truck to truck ensuring the products were neatly packed and secure for a dispatch. Time sensitive duties were given daily and the hardest part of the job would be working with people who didn't do their job properly.
good,"The job was to unload containers. I learned to work fast. I had very good relations with my colleagues. Some packages were very heavy and it was hard to unload them, it was sometimes necessary to call a colleague to help you, sometimes the supervisor came to help."
good,Long hours and heavy workloads. compensation is alright but not enough for the amount of work done.  Management pushes for outrageous results with little help given.  Moral and culture definitely needs improvement within this career.
good,"Great company overall. FedEx is a great career for anyone who wants to work for a pension, 401k and benefits."
good,A job at night that included a lot of work with loading trailers. Worked during the summer when it was really hot.
good,"micro management, boring and need to allow more breaks good company but could be better how they treat the employees"
good,Loading and unloading adjusting to the weather conditions.
good,"I have truly enjoyed the work that I have done. I start my day off with prayer. I get up and go to work with a positive attitude leaving all cares and obstacles behind and focusing on having a wonderful day. I learned how to show great hospitality to my co-workers and the public. I have had some great experiences with my co-workers. I really enjoyed them all. The hardest part of this was loading your own truck. The most enjoyable part of my job was keeping safety first, getting the job done and making the customers happy."
good,I learned that time is valuable. and most people i met there loved the job and they were great people. The managers are more than fair to new employees training is real easy takes no more than a day to learn what to do.
good,"I enjoyed working there a lot, the work was hard and fast but varied and good for someone self motivated.  The draw backs of the job are having bosses who don't care about you in the slightest."
good,"fast paced environment"
good,"Very good benefits, once you have them anyway, takes a long time to get your benefits going.  Management is alittle snobby / stuck up, my co-workers are good people, they all know the struggle of a package handler just coming in, hardest part of the job is getting enough hours to even survive on, the most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with others to help pass the time."
good,"A rotina de trabalho era tranquila."
good,went to work did my job and went home. Enjoyable people to work with.
good,"great plcae to work the onyl thing not that much room for advancement now, so hard to transfer to a diffierent station and if your part-time its hard to go full-time and part-time not enough hours for people with a family, overral it was a great experience loved the people i worked with."
good,"I worked for this company for a little over 5 years and the experience when I first started was filled with promise of advancement opportunities. I was a college student and a very experienced employee as a driver looking to enter management. I entered management and the experience starting off was good, but going forward there are leaders that cannot explain to you how to consistently be successful. There are a lot of scapegoat practices at this facility. I am sure this does not happen at all FedEx service centers. But being blamed for processes that you have no control over is not good. The hardest part of the day was correcting the mistakes of others when you have no knowledge they occurred. The most enjoyable part of my day was being able to do my part in helping other employees be successful."
good,"I VERY MUCH ENJOYED THE JOB. check in all packages W/scanner, load truck in order of stops, traffic and time frames. Deliver all packages. Close out scanner and return vehicle to yard."
good,"It is an Ideal position for young men and women out of high school, it helps with organizing and prioritizing. It requires a lot of energy, stamina and discipline."
good,Never a dull moment a busy place and a place where you can learn a whole lot
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with my customers.  The hardest part of my job is trying to make my deliveries on time when we have late trucks.
good,"Not Fair Job, constant work. Depends on where you are most mangers are terrible. most co workers are lazy mainly because of bad management and not being treated fair."
good,"Your day is never boring and you will always be asked to do more each day. Few pats on the back, but when they do come watch out ! The whole department is happy for you."
good,There are excellent and friendly staff members there. It is usually always busy. Due to change of management the whole working environment changed and became difficult. Hardest part of the job is the standards and lack of understanding.
good,"A typical day at this job would be delivering packages to residential home through out the Grass Valley area..I have learned customer service which is second to none for this company. I have co-workers but only see them at the terminal in the morning, then I'm off and running. The hardest part of this job is working 14 hour shifts and not getting paid for overtime as I am salary. The most enjoyable part of this job is meeting the customers who are so nice and happy to see me"
good,package handler at Fed EX ground is a great job for students it was very easy for me to find balance between my studies and and work i highly recomend it if you enjoy working with your hands or need a second job or are a student in search of extra income
good,The pay is average for a delivery driver.  No room for advancement unless you own a route.  Hours can be very long on one end of the spectrum and then near nothing on the other end.
good,It feels sometime as if you are working in a slave type environment because of the constant watching by management.   The hardest part of this job is the stacking of boxes on the pallet.  A typical work is mainly going to your area of work and doing your required description or being pulled sometimes to another area to work.  .
good,Constantly unloading packages to residential and commercial properties. Coworkers are very helpful and their is not anything hard about the job. The most enjoyable part of the job is that you meet all diversities of people.
good,I love the delivery industry. FEDEX Ground did not give me a good life balance. Work started at 10 am and ended at 1 am. For advancement you have to relocate
good,"The environment  was good and  there was Some room for growth, given that someone else was promoted, demoted or terminated. The overall   can best be summed up as ""get in, work, and get out""."
good,Nothing easy about fedex.  hard work and alot of hours on the road.  Thier management aren't very good and they have there favorites that cand do what they want.
good,"Every morning we would load our truck with the packages for our specific route.  We would download them in our scanner and then leave the terminal and deliver every package until our truck was empty.  It could take anywhere from 7 to 14 hours.  It is a contractor route and the owner is usually helpful and great as long as he isn't short handed.  If he is short handed than it's every man for himself and it makes work miserable.  For the most part, my co-workers just did there job and went on there way with the exception of a few who would help when needed.  The hardest part of the job was having the largest route in the terminal and getting done around 7 every night to see that you were the last one out by hours and no one called to help including the boss.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the people around me."
good,"Pockets of good people, pockets of toxic people, too big and fast to manage the inconsistencies, good old boys in upper management protect their own to the detriment of the culture"
good,"Empresa escola, local onde se aprende tudo e mais um pouco."
good,A typical day consisted of 3 hours. Didn't really have a chance to learn much. Management was not associate friendly but co-workers where as good as I've experienced before. Not getting paid what you deserved for the work assigned. Going home was the most enjoyable part.
good,I learned alot of skillz everybody always did there job . Benefits was great the hardest part of the job was peek season sometimes we get more package we can handle .
good,"A very demanding, physical job. A lot of heavy lifting a minus, a lot of driving is my favorite part. Good people to work with along with great management."
good,"Answering the phone."
good,I was holding down 3 jobs and had to let one go.  Because this job was overlapping the job I had with health insurance I had to let this one go.
good,"Great place to work"
good,"Started off real well being a City driver. They offered extra board driver position that took me on the road locally/ regional with more miles. Then without notice they took the position away and I became shuttle driver, which at transfer lost seniority and because of my seniority I am doing dock work 95% of the time."
good,Its always more more more.  And the company takes from you and exectives reap all the benefits
good,"FedEx is a good job for the most part. Its a company that really values the customer. I feel they could be more considerate with the way the treat the lower level employees and keep at mind that we are all still human when the day is over. the management could really use an overhaul. They can get so caught with their own agenda to the point were they're willing to sabotage others to reach their goal, forgetting one of the main goals at FedEx, TEAMWORK. My job becomes the most difficult to do when I we are not informed about a major change in our duties. Then we're stuck in a situation were we are playing catch up and never really do."
good,my day can be either a smooth day or stressfull day . if the warehouse does not run smooth on the nightshift this snowballs through the day and effects everyone . this can be drivers leaving late or parcel snot found which then leads to phone calls constantly through the day which can effect the rest of your work .i have learned that consistency is required in order to run a smooth as possible business which sadly lacks at the moment in my opinion mainly due to how management run the depot . the hardest part is not being able to fullfill my role as giving customer satifaction an example would be  a parce not located till later in the morning and as all drivers have left  i cannot get this to the customer.  i enjoy being part of a tea and enjoy the company of my fellow co workers
good,"FedEx is a bottomline business! Its all about meeting stretch goals and doing whatever it takes to make it. They expect alot from their drivers and even puts them in impossible situations in order to complete their job. Drivers at UPS do make more hourly, but FedEx does have above average benefits when compared to many other corporations.  You sign a contract for two years at a station and then have the ability to apply for other positions outside the station. "
good,Very tight operation that is goal and number driven.  Good career for job security.  
good,"Over all FedEx is a very organized and well run company, that is compared to other trucking companies. I can only speak as an owner operator not employee. As a contractor be ready for long hours, and being treated like an employee with none of the benefits. But as I said they are well run so that makes your job a little easier."
good,My experience at FedEx has not been positive.  Although I enjoyed working with a talented group of teammates the management leaves a lot to be desired.  They make decisions without gathering information.  For example they have moved me into other departments without consulting me or even my current manager.
good,"managemnt and co workers would snitch you out for 10 cents , very uncunfortable work setting , in just three weeks was the most productive driver they had. A lot of hater aid was going around because i set the bar for others to pick ther production up.big case of laziness at that hub , hours were good and pay was decent ,too bad for the employees who ruined it for me. "
good,"This is hard, instense job full of labor. The people I with are enjoyable however do not expect to leave there without sweating every night. It the simple discipline of packing trailers is easy to learn the work will cause you to bend and lift alot. I typically worked midnight shift 1130-230 sometimes leaving early or late. The tuition reimbursement plan is very good and worth it if you are a college student."
good,"Take Packages off primary belt, sort the smalls and Heavy packages and Load trucks"
good,Altijd druk met pakjes rondbrengen en je moet dan ook wel erg stress bestendig zijn
good,Was a great place to learn from but had trouble with work life balance.
good,"I have worked with them  going on 20 years i have learned so much from them as its a fast paced place. Its incredible how they get packages from point a to point b. I have worked with some great and not so great coworkers but each person has made a mark in my career. Management come and go as well some great and some are not and they too have taught me a lot. The hardest part of the job is not being able to satisfy a customer, and the most enjoyable part is in the morning when im getting ready to do my work and i get to mingle with the drivers."
good,"Work in a shipping and receiving department that's can be a physically demanding job. I specifically load freight or merchandise inside trailers and make sure they are secured and ready for transit. The shipments vary from size, shapes, and weight, so I have to figure out a way to have certain shipments to fit inside the trailers. overall a typical day at work, is to work safely which is our overall concern of working. What I learned at Fedex Freight is that, on time delivery is very crucial to us, and the time frame we have is very limited, Ive learned to work smarter and not harder and not defeating the purpose when it comes to loading. for instance if a pub trailer (which is a small trailer) is full of carpet roll materials that are laid on the floor of trailer, and I have to make 8 pallet shipments fit in there. that problem can be solved by building a deck (which is a table) to place on top of the carpets without damaging them, or the 8 pallets. Management wise is a bit difficult not everyone is eager to be cooperative however the job gets done. the co-workers have a willing attitude such as ""lets get it done attitude,"" and I for my part have adopted that attitude. The Hardest part of the job is figuring out how to make a lot of the shipments fit inside the trailer but also making sure it is secured in the right way! The most enjoyable part of my job is that the merchandise was loaded safely and when it arrives at another terminal the employee there can unload it safely, and it will be delivered safely to a happy customer whose shipment was arrived on time!"
good,the day start's buy driving to the depo and picking up your drop ticket's witch you have to put in the right order for your route then its the hard part loading all your parcels on to your van and they can be up to 60 kg and around 200 parcels then its off to deliver them around your route witch can be anything up to a 100 places 
good,They enforce saftey all the time and try to keep you happy with ocassional doughnuts and barbequed food after work but their focus is on speed and accuracy which can be physicall demanding. If your a package handler who has to unload trucks be prepared for a workout and possiable back problems. May have to deal with bad drivers blaming you for putting boxes in the wrong spot because they are to lazy to sort it themselves if you wrok on home delivery.
good,Clock in and report to work station. Complete as much work as possible in the amount of time given.
good,The company written down is a great idea. It is the people that they have working there that will not allow you to grow with the company. You need experience to move up and it seems that the same people that will allow or not allow you to move up stay in their positions. They never move it does not allow you to grow at this company. 
good,"Worked for this company for over 13 years. Room for advancement  if willing to travel .Culture of the company is changing. It's not a bad thing, but is catching a lot of old-timers within the company off guard. "
good,"As with most companies recently, FedEx has made cutbacks.  The number of full-time positions, both salary and hourly, are down as the company is transitioning to an almost entirely part-time workforce.  That said, you can see why I wasn't generous in rating the advancement category.  The job security is great, assuming you are able to walk and breath, you will/should have a job forever.  "
good,"Some days can be out of loop but I like the challenge"
good,"Supervised 10- 15 personnel to effectively load aircraft according to FAA guidelines   Communicate with dispatch at various terminals and with dock employees to coordinate the movement of trailers and freight monitor and analyze all opportunities to cut costs and improve efficiencies to meet strict departure times,"
good,I didn't really like my job to much due to the lack of hours. Did learn how to work better as a team.
good,"Very physical job that requires a lot endurance, determination and teamwork. "
good,Good place to work if you are single. Hard to balnce work/ life
good,"A typical day at work includes coming in to start my shift and getting familar with all of the projects we have going on. The majority of my day is spent managing my team members to insure that they get dont correctly and on time. I also work on special projects for the store such as: printing and displaying in store signage, insuring that the retail floor correctly follows our planograms, managing the inflow of projects, among many other things."
good,"The best thing about working for this company is the job security. As long as you don't get fired or quit without notice you will always have a job. Upper management only cares about moving packages, not the people moving the packages (drivers, package handlers)."
good,"I loaded trucks lots of boxes, I loaded lots of trucks, night shift not very fun"
good,"loading and unloading of trucks ,setting up trucks to go out and make deliveries .Make deliveries and pickups, pretrip truck to go out on the road. daily paper work"
good,"Can be a fun place to work. I worked at a Fedex Office. The particular store that I worked at, you have to be flexible with your schedule, willing to work alone at night or sometimes most of your shift by yourself. This is bad customer service as sometimes you are trying to help several customers at once or make them wait. Being late 1 or 2 minutes can rack up a write-up. You must be willing and able to work by the book at this store. The manager will write you up for anything and everything and prevent you from transferring and or moving up. One write up will prevent this. Most enjoyable part of the job is meeting and getting to know the customers."
good,I was in Operations and being told by top management that this job is easy if you just do this got old real fast. As a supervisor you have to come into your own. It's a numbers game and you are constantly judged on you numbers and direct labor hours.
good,"Typical day would involve a pre-sort meeting where the managers would give us a rundown of the night. After that, we get some stretches in, then we grab all of our equipment needed to perform the job you're assigned to. Usually after about 3 hrs, we will then take our 10 minute break. Then we will work for another 2 hrs, then take our 30 minute lunch. Its pretty the same routine every single day. There's opportunities to move up in the company, but you have to take the initiative and learn about the job."
good,"Operated and maintained classs C delivery vechicle. Managed 28 mile delivery terriotry. Completed 50 deliveries perday while maintaining 4 star personal on time rating. Serviced business and residential customers, building client realtionships to increase volume of packages.."
good,"Company changing , no longer supports P.S.P. physiology(people, service, profit ) Now is more like... Profit , Service , Profit . Should have left 6yrs. ago ."
good,"A typical work day is coming in around 10p.m. to 5a.m. doing hard labor in a semi safe enviorment. I have learned about different aircrafts and equipment to make the company operate and be efficient. The management is not up to par in my opinion. The managers tend to make you feel as if your expendable or easily replaced, and the hardest part of the job is dealing with the weather because your always outside. The most enjoyable part to me is meeting the people. There is a very diverse crowd working in the Memphis hub and you never know what connections you might make out there."
good,"A typical at work consist of packages pushed by id from a conveyor onto a slide to be scanned. Then loaded into containers that will be loaded onto an aircraft in a timely manner. The container weights and container numbers are verified before aircraft departure. I have learned that it there is no ""I"" in ""TEAM."" Management has a job to do just as any other employee. Co-workers pull together when the going gets tough. The hardest part of the job would be the different personalities. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing there is always room to advance."
good,"A typical day at work is a calm environment, management rating on a scale through 1-10 is a four. My Co-workers are well to work with. There isn't a difficult task in my job description. The most enjoyable part of my job is dealing with the wonderful customers and providing great customer service. The benefits are also a plus."
good,"It was so much work to do, i could not even walk away to get some water or use bathroom. The truck itself was just a huge headache because boxes would always come down and never stop coming. It was hard work and I did it."
good,"I enjoyed working with my fellow hourly employees. Some were really good friends. Sometimes we had problems, but were able to sort them out. The hardest part of the job is easiest to sum up as politics. Upper management, at times, seemed to want to find ways to fire people. One in particular would hide behind a corner and listen to conversations, or would seem to spy on the shop just to find them doing something wrong. There are safety policies that have been put in place due to former mismanagement that will now cost you your job on the second offense. There were ""spurts"" when almost whole shifts got fired. I will admit that many deserved to be fired, but if lower management were doing their jobs, some of the problems never would have happened. From my own personal experience: If you get put in a room by yourself and they start interrogating you, you're about to be fired. DON'T HELP THEM! I tried to cooperate and it made things much worse for me. When it comes down to it. The only things they can prove are what's actually on the camera, and what you admit. You might still get fired, but they will have to prove it to the unemployment office."
good,Results driven oginazation that tends to focus a lot of attention on improving it's employees skills. This is done by building nurturing relationships that fosters trust and respect. Excellent communicator who consistently inspires direct reports while developing their skills and abilities.
good,I enjoyed being able to assist the internal and external customers within the organization.
good,"it was a good place to work and i made a lo of new friends,the only thing is the lack of hours"
good,"It's an Okay job if you like being in competition with your coworkers. Don't really understand the ""team work"" if you're still in competition with your teammates. The labor is hard and the hours are short. The pay is good but not good enough especially for part time. It's a nice workout but there is too much yelling from the supervisors. Too much work."
good,"Full-Time work was typically 12 hours per day. In the morning you had to organize your truck and write down all the addresses which usually took 2 hours. Planning and organization was the key to getting done early due to the fact that I was not paid hourly. Also navigation and knowledge of the route was another key to a successful day. A lot of coordination was involved, especially during the pick-up hours in the afternoon. The last contractor that I worked for I had the opportunity of managing his route while he was on vacation for 5 weeks. He was a wonderful person to work for and the route was pretty cool."
good,"Hard work, need for details"
good,"punch in and punch out. well i have learned how to load trailers and being a leader. Learning how to cooperate with others and help, teamwork. co-workers were selfish and helpful at times. The hardest part would be the 10 minute breaks and not having enough time to eat properly. being social and helping others who needed help."
good,"A normal day at FedEx Office involves answering e-mails and participating in conference calls for half a day, The other half is spent on auditing company assets."
good,Very tough to get fired but warehouse work that can get old fast
good,Good place to work overall need more hours and better raises for employees.
good,Fast-paced environment processing packages to be delivered. High demand of time sensitive material. Focused environment with little to no down time. FedEx offers great health benefits at an affordable rate.
good,"I would come in @ 10-10:30 pm, check the slide for container availability and condition of containers, check out scanning equipment and astra label printers, move uld's (unit loading devices) to appropriate city id locations on the slide, set up checker station and no-con areas, pick up driving equipment ( tugs or people movers) as needed,open Ramp office and open my Pc Weight and Balance software , scan check, load, close, and weigh uld's for transport on specific aircraft. Continue weight and balance throughout sort following all FAA and FEDEX guidelines and policies, ensure safety among work group, educate and train employees on safety and job function, Keep employees recurrent on their training, handle complaints ,problem resolution between employees and manager , between pilots and load restrictions , handle all Dangerous Goods issues on loading procedures and postioning. Keep detailed ppwk retention and files , Physical and verbal confirmation of freight left over ( piece count and weight of combined freight) to ensure expeditious movement of said freight."
good,"It was a good job that got me through college. Kept me in shape and worked with a bunch of great people. It did consist of some late nights and lifting heavy items, but overall no complaints."
good,"typical warehouse that involves alot of hard work, but overall a good company to have full time or part time"
good,"A typical day at work would be unpredictable. I could never tell what can or would happen. I have learned that the company has more issues then i thought. As far as the managers goes, they are always listening to suggestion to what needs to happen to make things better but nothing ever happens. Sometimes they are a big help but most of the time they are not. The hardest part of the job would be in the morning because I feel like nothing is ever right. The most enjoyable part of the job would be leaving the facility and delivering packages to FedEx customers due to the happy faces and just working on your own."
good,"A typical day at work includes sorting and organizing packages for drivers, as well as quality assurance. The greatest learning advancement has been skilled organization in a fast-paced environment. Management is very involved in employee activity; we have regular meetings, informing us about safety and updated regulations. However, they do not always appear to correspond appropriately with one another. The hardest part of the job is ensuring every package is in its correct position, as each person handles nearly 700 packages in a four-hour period. The most enjoyable part of the job is the challenge this provides as far as physical activity is concerned."
good,I worked for FedEx Office for 7 years. You will learn some valuable knowledge to help you improve your skill set.
good,being an over the road truck driver was hard to get use to at first but after awhile after seeing the usa and everything in between it was pretty fascianting
good,"I provide great customer service, Printing services and we also Provide shipping services when needed."
good,If you can work for very little and and not get recognized for what you do. then good place to work.
good,When you were on your route their was no one to micromanage you
good,When airway bills loaded up on computer enter information and then process.
good,"This job has sustained life through college pursuits but offers no advancement opportunities within its organization, currently looking for a full time job with a career minded company."
good,Typical day included coming in for the 3am to 11am shift and loading/unloading semi-trucks and sorting thousands of packages. Working inside the trucks was difficult because oftentimes they were not properly lit and the nature of the packages varied from one to another and often stacked very precariously. Accidents involving packages falling on associates did occur. There also wasn't sufficient ventilation when working inside the facility so often times people would need to go on breaks to get away from the stifling heat. The best part about the job was their ability to find a place for their associates somewhere else in the process.
good,"A great paying job if you match up with the right contractor. Hours are very long. Might not be a great job fit if youre not hard working and dedicated. Working for a contractor typically means you won't get any benefits. For that reason, you'll meet many people out in the world who say ""I used to work for Fedex."""
good,"well fed ex was alright, i didnt really get too many hours while i was there, but i still made sure that my work got done. My manager was cool, whenever i needed help he was there to help, and the same goes for my co-workers. The hardest part of the job is when so many boxes come down and u have to make sure that everyone of them gets loaded on the truck. The most enjoyable part was the weekends off and getting paid every week."
good,there is absolutly no way to keep a stable household on a 20 hour weekly pay. security was not as tight as they should be. employees arent reconized for their hard work.
good,Fedex business practices seem to be more about production than quality. End of quarter was all about getting the product out the door rather than quality of workmanship
good,"Good place to work, always busy and on he move. Don't really have job security when you work for a contractor, so have to make sure to stay on top of everything at all times."
good,Fedex Freight has a solid group of people working at the facility.  Management is focused.  The facility is challenged with its age and technological capabilities.  Fedex Freight has huge potential growth in South Dakota.  An upgrade in facility would do a lot to help with quality and quantity within the area
good,I was assigned to load and unload shipping containers. Download flights and keep track of all the shipping containers that were being taken in my side of the building.
good,"My experience with Fed Ex as a package handler was an up and down roller coaster, most managers were cool and easy to get along with, some had anger issues and acted as if they hated there own jobs, there's favoritism, people who want to work get the tough spots and the lazy folks get the easy spots."
good,The Bad is have to load heavy boxes & the good is the hours they had us working & also the pay. Also a bad is it is very very fast pace . There is no break while working but it pays good.
good,"At Fedex i learned that my team are great people to work with coz we do team work. I am so grateful with these kind of people i work everyday because with them, it makes work easier."
good,Ce fut une expérience intéressante. cela m'a permis de forger de nouvelles compétences.
good,I don’t think this job was for me but it was something I wanted to try out. I knew it wouldn’t last long working for the company as a package handler.
good,FedEx was a good experience overall. I didnt like how had to come in all types of weather. And the bad management in some cases but good in other areas.
good,"Fedex is a great opportunity for a young worker, but they are all contracted out. Does not offer benefits, of room for growth. Very dependent on whom your contractor is."
good,It was a face paced environment the people are okay. The mangers are understandable about family emergencies and personal issues. Decent pay and the hours are okay.
good,I worked as an overnight package handler at the border Ave location for about a year.  It was a very decent job but there were not many hours available to work.
good,I loved how fast paying it is and how it is early in the morning and how fast the time fly. Every morning we do stretches  which was my favor part of the morning
good,"low hours hard work low pay you are moving at fast paces so you can unload all the boxes quickly which gives you lower hours. When you try to input your hours, they take the lowest minute to the hour and mark that as the time your finished and started."
good,The work is good and the people there are friendly but the managment is poor the manager dont get help when need and they dont really know how to manage their employees need more improvement
good,"Worst job I've ever had, was always underpaid and overworked. Walked in with a promise of 18 dollars and hour and after my first paycheck found out I was only making ten."
good,"motivated work industry"
good,The work load is fairly split up in the shop. I was assigned to a mobile service/repair truck and sent to a non-shop location with minimal support tools provided by Fedex. I had to outfit the service truck myself. They had ensured me they would provide an enclosure with heat for the winter and they never did. I was working outside up until the second week of December.
good,"Others should know this is a strong company, and they work well with each other. A typical day runs smoothly from start to finish. Keeping jobs in motion helps the company. The management is fair and workers well with their coworkers. When needed they can answer questions, and show you how things need to be done. The workers within the company are easy to work with."
good,as a package handler the pay is good however it is important to know that this place is hard labor that provides anyone willing to work plenty of hours if they choose so.
good,As a package handler you will be sweating continuously and be always be moving. Your load rate will be tracked and managers will know if your not meeting quota.
good,for sure job and benefits nice place to work no drama very easy laid back place to work at. No plac eto advance in your career its best to presume somewhere to advance your career
good,"Pay is decent for the work required, hours and flexibility are not often reliable. Heavy hours in November/December during peak with a pay boost, limited hours in the months to follow."
good,It was a decent job. No benefits where I was. Pay was good compared to hours worked. Salary based pay. I was a Pick up and Delivery Driver. I did residential.
good,"Easy getting hired, but staying is hard.  Fedex is a great place to if you ant to make quick cash fast. I gained a lot of work team work and lleadership skills that i was not agle to gain in other places."
good,The actual job itself is not bad however the people usually are not the best the management not very well communicators care for employee wellness and happiness is low ...
good,"Physical work. Long hours during peak season, working 3rd shift  with extended hours as needed. Liftingitems 20 to 80 lbs. Responsible for proper scanning of materials."
good,"I enjoy working in environment where I can be productive, stay busy and be a part of the success of our team and company. Being a part of the warehouse industry allows me to do that."
good,"I learned a lot about processing mail and working various equipment and machines has "
good,Give me a fast-paced job with a lot of Hands-On after 60 days as a chance of advancement to move up to a higher position no benefits good pay. Doesn't give you enough time for training and just throws you out in the route and expect you to know everything on your own gadgets don't always work in their truck as well
good,This company wasn't to bad. You are put into a truck and move packages weighing more than you and expected to fit it inside. You work either a four hour shift or double if you are full time. This job wasn't that enjoyable but it did help me pay the bills. I am grateful for that.
good,You will hear this alot and it is true.A lot of hard work in a short period of time and don't beleive the hours it's not those hours you will told a different stsrt time daily and it will not be four in the morning mostly two and three.
good,"Fedex was a job I thought would be good for me but the hours weren’t as good as the pay, full shifts are never guaranteed over at fedex but I heard ups gas"
good,FedEx was an ok job. It wasn’t bad or good but for the people that like to lift heavy boxes then it’s an ok job but other then that it’s pays good weekly.
good,"For those who enjoy working in a factory, this is the place for you. This job does do a lot of wear and tear on the body. Overall, this is a good place to make some extra cash."
good,"I worked at FedEx for a summer job"
good,At this place you will work hard. Goals are hard to reach and will take a lot of teamwork and strategic planning.  It can be overwhelming and you will have to think on the fly and be able to change your plans.  Hours are not ideal for a family. You are out in the weather elements.
good,You unload company trucks and vans. You sort according to package destination. Nice workout for a younger person. Drivers can do no wrong. Most of the coworkers were cool.
good,"They PANEL interview. It sucks. Stupid questions, blank faces. All formality. They already know if they are hiring you or not. "
good,What we did on a daily basis for about 4 hours was either load or unload packages. Some of them at light weight others you needed someone to help you out. Fast pace and you scan every item; being attentive is very important at my current position.
good,Try to work for fedex express or fedex freight. Any or brand of fedex you are working for a contractor.  Most of them are but holes. But there a a few good ones. Most contractors don't have benefits and or no insurance.
good,picking packing and computer work. easy working environment. super relaxed on dress code. not allowed to have any type of electronic devices. cell phones are a no no.
good,"Nice place to work if you’re looking for part-time work, its not guaranteed to be full-time, but overall fairly easy and fast paced place to be, I definitely liked it"
good,The hours were very early and there was a lot of walking and heavy lifting it was a good place until I found my other job . It's not for anyone who has a bad back it is a lot of lifting and very early
good,working at fedex ground delivery jobs are owned by contractors. you will not receive benefits at all  you are paid by salary. rain or shine it doesnt matter
good,Workplace Culture acceptable to work life balance. Fast paced growth opportunity. Flexible work hours. Fair compensation but not equal to cost of living
good,"I disliked working as a ground delivery driver. It was an excellent workout and pay was the same if you worked a 14 hour shift or an 8 hour shift. Wasn't a fan of management, but it is contractual so it will vary."
good,Not very hard.Might finish late depend on how many package you get. a lot of walking. I would say be in good shape..................................................................
good,This is a physically demanding position that can be fun. You work outside mainly so dressing appropriately is an absolute must. You will work hard and be tired at the end of your shift. There are opportunities for growth and development. The training regiment does take time.
good,"Working with FEDEX was fun and most of the team I was with are fun to be around."
good,Good place to work for. Room for advancement. Your on your feet atleast 5 hours at a time. Fast paced. Lifing small to large package heavey lifting and bending and twisting
good,Good steady work if you like fast paced environments.  The people are friendly but management can be tough at times.  The workload can be more than the amount of workers.
good,"Depending on the hours you work change your pay. My shift 3am to 7 was about 14 dollars an hour, 16 around peak season. Its very fast pace and you have to learn quickly so you won't fall behind."
good,FedEx is wonderful for everyone who is trying to work hard Nd get money every week it’s also perfect for people who need a job Nd extra money you have to be more energized than other companys
good,"typical day of work includes coding and meetings."
good,It was a great company to be employed by but the working distance and me not having the reliable transportation to get there and back by the time schedule I could not continue to work there.
good,Or about making money don’t care the the Staff I was they for 15 years didn’t even get thanks went I left.i I work Saturday for them I done I off overtime for them no thanks or you are a number to them.stay away Trying to get big to Quick.and the Tnt Drivers are on more money and the Fedex Drivers doing the same job
good,"ok a good  place  to  work for the seasonal  employment. paid is good hours are flexible.  training  was ok, hard work. coworker  ok. no vacation  plenty  of  over  time"
good,Working there was really exciting loved coming to work every day the managers new how to relate to every employee that was there but the only thing was coming to work at different times
good,getting no breaks when needed overall i enjoyed working some of the mangers was pretty cool but so far fedex is a good place it was easy wasn’t difficult at all
good,Excelente empresa a unica coisa que deve melhorar o salario que ainda é baixo. O restante excelente.
good,"I loved the people they tried to make it as fun and rewarding as much as they could but its rules everyone has to follow. The rules are not meant to be broken,"
good,"FedEx Freight - Dock worker, City Driver, Line haul driver"
good,"Its a great place to work. Friendly staff with opportunity for advancement. Fast pace work environment. FedEx Ground is a great company to work for if you are a college student or seeking a career within logistics, transportation, business, IT."
good,"It is okay place to work. Come in early in the morning, clock in t get your scanner. Going to your assigned location and making sure you are ready. Watch for the packages to come down the belt, pulling them off to load them on the truck."
good,I love the people that I work with but the management isn't great. It's fast paced and there are never enough employees to work the floor. We do not get breaks.
good,This was a very good job. I learned lots of skills that I can transfer to other jobs in the future. It was a fun and relaxed working environment. Just kind of frustrating when you get passed of on a position change for someone who doesn't know what they are doing when you have been doing the job for free.
good,"Uma boa empresa para trabalhar, cresce muito profissionalmente durante os anos que passei lá."
good,Very fast paced environment with very little room to grow. Not paid enough for the work that you do but the people at the company are great co workers as well as some really awesome managers.
good,"the work was ok i was a package handler before i was a driver.some night hard and back breaking as a loader but it depends everybody work experience is different so I can only speak for myself, thank you."
good,"Hard job to get up for everyday especially for the pay. People are very nice, they treat you good, they also help you pay for your schooling if you’re planning on going back to school."
good,Depending on station and managers.when you leave the building work is fast paced.must call in every morning to find out what time you start because weather may delay aircraft .
good,"Fast east job, for seasonal exta money. Careers can be made there if you would like to stay . They let people leave early harder to get hours unless you've been there a while"
good,I palletize packages and wrap pallets. It is a very very fast pace and is very hot environment. You must be able to be a team player and adapt to the wok flow.
good,Great work environment...loading and unloading trucks in lip loading fashion while conducting a great work environment easy to move up within the company
good,It was ok. I feel that some supervisors are not fair to some other employees. There is like favoritism. The hours that I applied for is not the one that they're giving it to me. I put Fair in a sense of benefits.
good,Two different categories of driver. Ground and home delivery. Ground is mostly to businesses and home is more residential. Company vehicles are used. Home drivers can take vehicle home after last delivery. Ground drivers must return vehicle to warehouse to be loaded by FedEx employees for the next day. Home drivers load their own vehicles the morning of delivery.
good,Not to bad once you learn your route and can work at your own pace.  Not much help from the manager. They want you to come in and work 6 days a week most of the time no matter what you have going on in your life.
good,"I personally can't handle it but they pay is nice, schedules for every type of person are available, people are nice, the work is hard but rewarding.."
good,managers were knowledgeable and friendly and accomadately me sufficiently. taught me what  I needed to know sufficiently. everyone was friendly and I got along with everyone I worked with.
good,"You must be ready to stand and be outside for long periods of times.  Pretty good hours get better hours during holiday seasons.  But overall it's ok , been here for 5 years."
good,The job that I have as a package handler is just alright. It is really hard work for low pay and very short hours. It is a job that’s better for college students.
good,Meet with driver to start daily route. Help organize and deliver packages on time. Also pick up package from location to be delivered at a later time.
good,FedEx is a fast paced work environment. FedEx is a good company to work for if you don't mind working in a fast paced environment. They could adjust their pay for the warehouse.
good,"Working at FedEx was a bit stressful, especially since I worked the night shift. The work could be difficult if there was a lot of freight coming down the conveyor belt, but some nights were slow. It's a face-paced environment. I think I'd rather work there than at a grocery store, though."
good,"The job was ok at first but it just got worse as the days went on, it wasn't difficult work management just expected more from there employees then they should have."
good,"Sorts can be short or long depending of workload."
good,"Work is fast paced and extensive.  Extensive knowledge of the delivery area is a must, learning curve must be short.  Temptation to speed must be avoided as time is made from the truck to the residence.  Again, be in shape."
good,"Bonne expérience pour les autres, ce n'est pas mon cas"
good,"It was good,but then i noticed the management was not so well. Some people would work hard and some would'nt. I was one of the good ones they liked. But I  had to move on to better opportunities."
good,No kind of job for ladies hurting your back and neck no help to hot good job for a hard working man less hours need better pay for hard labor better training
good,It was a good place to work most people try to stay positive they paid well they were great hours it's not too far from the Valley Mall if you work full time you get an extra dollar raise
good,This was very fast paced and challenging.  Difficult working conditions and high expectations.  I felt like I was a better man for it and I was decently compensated but the job is catered towards working young people to death.
good,"You go in at 7 in the morning and might be get off before noon or you might still be out until midnight. Never knew when I was going to work. I'd get a text at 11PM the day before I go in saying ""I'm not needed the next day"""
good,High energy & physical labor are key components to the success of the company as well as yourself in this particular field of employment. Heavy lifting required.
good,First we would have a team meeting. I learned that keep to yourself. Management was poor. Females and males culture. When something didn't work right. When we got the job done
good,"Its a good job to have, its good work in FedEx,its tiresome standing on your feet for multiple hours but if you can make the best of it then it will benefit you in the long run."
good,"I have mixed opinions about working here. There is not much teamwork and not everyone gets along. The payment isn’t enough. Also, there are not many benefits and I want somewhere where I can work for a while, but FedEx is not it."
good,"Although I enjoy working at FedEx, the recent reorganization of the company has brought tremendous low morale to all employees which is an oxymoron to the company's philosophy of People-Service-Profit (PSP).  The majority of the staff no longer feel that People is first in the philosophy.  "
good,If you are looking to lose weight and get in shape this place is great. Management can be a little so so and a lot of your fellow employees will drag you down but I have seen worse.
good,"I gained a training for cell phone repair which is a great platform for me to introduce myself as a repair technician."
good,Difficult hours to have a work life balance. There are very few positions that work during the day if you work in leadership and even that will not change.
good,"Well being a POC in FedEx means I have to keep up with moving people to doors or places they are needed and managing my area in the warehouse, like making sure my floors and doors are clean before we leave and making sure the employees build corrected walls/stacking."
good,"Good company but no work life balance. Seniority rules, and there are people been there for 30+ years and they get to pick their PTO first, jobs, vehicles...etc Benefits are great!"
good,working here was okay lift with your legs type thing seeing thing like a 75inch roll down a huge slide was entertainment and frightening would of stayed if it was full time
good,It was a good experience and I enjoyed it. If it wasn't so far it'll be great. The money is ok and I'll recommend a person to work there. My co-workers and Managers were nice and reasonable.
good,"In general, I enjoyed my job and coworkers, but the days delivering packages typically lasted 10+ hrs/day.  I learned my deliver route within a 64 square-block area very well."
good,FedEx is a great place to work if u need a side job. U get up to six or seven hours a day depending on the number of boxes needed to be shipped that day
good,"I really like working for Fedex. Benefits are great, people are nice but there aren't enough hours. You need to have another job in order to pay the bills. They continually hire more people and at times I have driven all the way into work for 5 am and been sent home."
good,Very dangerous depending on the area you deliver in. This type of job requires high physical demand. To many variables you must face especially bduring peek season. Your payvwill fluctuate because you get paid 1.00 per delivery if your at Fed ex home.
good,It is a very physical job. Work loads can be intense at times. They have a very strict attendance policy. They have part time and full time positions.
good,"Loader and unload merchandise sent to or received by the warehouse.operated forklifts,hand trucks and other equipment to move inventory and place throughout warehouse maintained a safe and clean work environment."
good,I wore a armband with a scanner and i would scan the barcodes on each box i touched so the customers could track the packages and after i scanned the box i would load the boxes into a truck and make a wall of boxes and also fill the belly of the truck until it was full while helping others as well if my area wasnt busy if i could.
good,"fedex was probably the hardest job i worked at, it is a very fast pace you had to keep up with the boxes that came down the chute, sometimes you had to load 3 trucks at one time."
good,The job was pretty simple come in do your job and go home the only thing I didn’t like was when it would rain we would get pushed back and we would stay later that scheduled
good,Learned how to work in shipping and receiving and the pace that's needed to wrk there. I was a seasonal hire and the hours were cool but eventually i need to do different type of wrk.
good,Everything about the company is about the bottomline and production.  I enjoyed the work.  The work load was really light at times which made me worry about job security
good,"It's a good place to work. Fast pace, dirty and hot. But good people. Just to much work for less pay. Management was good. Just overworked for cheap labor"
good,"Work was fairly easy  not much to complain about , just be prepared to do strenuous labor and all will be fine , aside from dealing with certain coworkers the job was decent"
good,I love working for Fed ex cause it's a great environment too work in. I've met a lot of great people and did a lot of great things and learned a whole lot from working wit Fed ex
good,"I really don't want to do this, but apparently to upload my resume I have to so.. it used to be better.. the culture has always been do whatever it takes, so long hours and nights/weekend works are just part of it here.  Recently though, they are relocating our division to Memphis TN and we either go or lose our jobs.  They have done a decent job in this, and are trying to take care of us, but still.. not where most of us want to be so it just stings a bit."
good,So does anyone know if we’re getting raises this year? So much for that sweet tax cut trickledown. That lasted a whole 6 months. We need more robots!!
good,"Kept me busy; friendly employee an staff very dedicated to teach cause I was willing to learn..."
good,"Not a bad company to work for will do absolutely anything for you for you to get hours or need time off. Early mornings are iffy to work, I worked a 5am to 11am shift. All in all an average company."
good,When you start they tell you that half the people will quit in the first six months. As long as you work hard you will be fine. There are alot of benefits to working at fedex.
good,The job was easy and very fast-paced. Once the managers knew that you were decent enough at your job they would send you to other work areas to “help” and leave your area unattended and would blame you for mess.
good,Real good for the most part just some hot work conditions from time to time but overall I pretty good job for people transition into a better job for the most part
good,Productive but the company seemed to not care about their employees. Not enough hours good hourly pay but not enough hours to make up for  good pay check.
good,It was very important for me to develop package handlers into future managers. I was able to do this by teaching them everything that I was shown when I started my career there.
good,"Good place to work. Not really any hard work, hardest part is learning the routes. Needs more orientation for new employees and better training. Could be a great job."
good,this job requires better management they like to yell at employees disrespect employees ... but the moment you say something to try and prove they are wrong that you are doing your job they wanna try to suspend or get you in trouble
good,Very busy work place. There was always something to do when you thought there was nothing to do. Very heinous work and specific attention to detail is required.
good,"Stressful, fast paced, production driven, need more training opportunities, needed more opportunities for advancement, poor department management, mostly good teamwork, manager made workplace difficult."
good,"Lack of career advancements, grueling hours, lack of benefits makes this a less attractive career. No accountability for employees makes employees irresponsible and lazy."
good,"This is a place where you can go to get experience, but there are few mid level positions for advancement. Benefits are good and pay depends on the level grade."
good,"work with nice co workers"
good,The best part about this job was the management.  They let you work and decide for yourself how you worked your day and how you planned your workday.  Fun place to work for.
good,Having to work there was quite an experience of lifetime but tells me that I need better pay. In  additional I will seek for other jobs to see if interest me
good,Always follow job procedures. Must have patience when it comes to working in any part of customer service. Must have a grwar sense of humor and be on top of your game due to this is a fast paced environment.
good,This was a position that was granted immediately out of college. It provided me with the skills needed to provide exceptional levels of customer service to the clients in which we served.
good,"Company paid decent, but felt I had a lot to wait time for next load. When load was dispatched to me, then felt the need to rush in order to get the merchandise to the customer in a timely fashion."
good,"Fedex has plenty of upside that can be enjoyed however like all jobs it is mostly about who is in management, they will make or break that specific facility."
good,Not for everyone. The sort is very hectic. Management needs to be brought up to today's standards not 40 year old standards. Pay is very unequal across the board. Benefits are good for everyone just not the pay.
good,"Overall the job can be stressful with the amount of packages that come. However, the job isn't very difficult, it can be frustrating when you get put in a busy trailer and then you can see other employees not very busy, and it's irritating that everyone gets paid the same regardless of the quality of work. All in all FedEx is a good part time."
good,I actually loved working at Fedex until this manager I received didn't like me. and then they changed about there flexibility with workers having other jobs. the insurance was good though.
good,"Typical work day is stacking and wrapping pallets, I learned to be flexible and adaptable to various positions. The hardest part of the job, the hours"
good,"Very fast paced strenuous environment. The working conditions can be a little stressful at times due to the weather conditions but the job itself is rewarding knowing that you are providing a service to the customers in a fast and timely manner. The team/staff are delightful to work with ,and make the day enjoyable due to the type of work being performed. Overall, FedEx has great benefits/incentives and is a great place to work."
good,When it says FedEx it means FedEx Field or redskins stadium.  I was guest services helping out customers with any help they needed while at the stadium.
good,Fedex taught many ways on how to work faster and quicker on a busy day. I learned to work better with my coworkers and complete things using a team effort.
good,working at fedex was alright i know there's better opportunities out there that's why i left it kinda sucks too when they start cutting down hours once peek season is done
good,hours are variant from starting at 1:00 a.m. to 3:30 a.m. and ending at around 6:00 to 8:00 a.m. the work environment is very competitive and stressful as you are asked to maintain a certain pace throughout the shift.
good,Worked sunrise hours at typically 6 hours per day. Atmosphere is relaxed with a fast paced environment and constant heavy lifting. Learned how to use scanner and to properly route packages in preparation to be distributed to various location. Management lacked required training in areas of safety and employee conduct.Hardest part of job was dealing with lack of professionalism and fairness. Loved the fast pace and the warehouse environment.
good,"Physically demanding labor, Difficult to be promoted without transfering to new faciity, Management keeps getting worse as good managers transfer for promotion leaving the managers with poor skills to try and handle more responsibilities. Management always pushing for more effort causing a high turn over rate of employees. Always being short handed on staff means hard workers end up doing the work of two to three people. Health benefits are a good value for what you get, but is needed over time this job wears you down so you don't recover as fast. Hours are usually around 20 to 25 hours a week but can fluctuate wildly from 15 hours a week up to 45 a week during Christmas season."
good,"Amazing company , good beifits , great times , brilliant management, skilled team members with the ability and strive to learn I'd highly recommend as a company"
good,"It was a good place to work benefits were ok but I wanted something a little bit more "
good,"I worked at FedEx Freight full-time for more than 4 years"
good,good decent place to work at i'm fine with the work area a typical day is working at through the boxes and having to move all day and being on your feet all day
good,had to load and unload trucks for a long period with no breaks.  Was only there for a short time because almost passed out because of the humidity inside the trucks.
good,At this job we work with Procter & Gamble products so we put them in boxes so they can get shipped out that day or next day and we make sure that they product is ok to get in boxes and ready to get shipped out
good,"Not a good job for ppl who are trying to pay monthly bills or and morgage or rent .. the hours were 3/4hrs a day Tues thru sat n which did not work for me."
good,Fedex has good benefits but it is very hard and stressful work. It’s very physical work and most people tend to quit within two weeks. You are required to be able to constantly move at least 70 Pounds for hours. Benefits don’t kick in till you hit a thousand hours.
good,unloading trailers is easy. but poor communication between management. some the manages don't know what they're doing. managers play favoritism. also mangers act different when theyre managers are around
good,its a good job for some one out of high school. You work harder than you are paid. Management is good as long as you have a permanent manager. Some workers can be cool but it is a stressful working enviornment like no other.
good,"Typical Working hours: 9-5"
good,Working at FedEx is an excellent opportunity but they should pay more for the things we do every day. I appreciate the opportunity and the skill set that I acquired but I don't think this is my career. I enjoy making customers smile when they receive their products and services. I enjoy being the one of many behind the scenes and this company was built on just that....customer service!!!
good,"Lifting pushing and stacking parcels; loading and unloading trucks by"
good,Fed Ex is super fast paced and can be fun if you're active but it can be hard and management is disorganization. It's also very hard to move up in the company with incredibly high requirements
good,6:30am Arrive At terminal Load Truck leave terminal Drive To Route Start Route Until Done then drive back to terminal. My route was located on the upper west side on the Manhattan nice People Nice Views All and all a good job just need better yearly Pay.
good,"Good benefits"
good,Excellent benefits and great co-workers. A typical day at FedEx consisted of taking inbound calls and assisting customer with tracking their packages.
good,I worked 3 to 4 hours a day. Tuesday thru Saturday.  Was hard to get full time at distribution center.could be very stressful. Very loud working environment.
good,"I worked there a long time ago, at least in my eyes a long time ago, and it wasn't a bad place to work at. I was even granted the employee of the month one time for the amount of effort I put in. They had a work flow based on what they were getting, meaning most days I would load the trucks with the customers orders, sometimes I'd be outside of the trucks and do palletizing, stacking orders on pallets. I got to know some of the people there and they were pretty good people. It's good for those that could use some extra work and extra pay, but it wasn't enough for me to live on for long."
good,"You Basically have to be there Bit%^ not to get targeted or picked on. The bosses will do things against policy or try to have you do things against policy and if you do not do it, your automatically a target to eliminate or pick on."
good,I enjoyed the ability to plan my day different to reach my goal of maximizing production and get my job done in the most efficient manner.  It was a hard physically tasking job.
good,"Opening the store at 7 am, preparing register draw for the day, checking orders to process for the day.  Lunch was not paid and was only for thirty minutes."
good,"not a bad company just in the department i was in wasn't a career job, work conditions were also not very good having to be inside the trailers trying to get the packages out"
good,"Fedex was a good paying part time hob, i never got the oppurtunity to work full time however the pay after overtime is time and a half. The managers were not the best, they favored people that's been their longer and would never help do a job."
good,"fast-paced, extreme weather conditions, and treated unfairly as a new member. The break is not given when part-time and shuttle bus don't run regularity and of not at work an hour ahead you will arrive late to the area."
good,Unload trucks. I enjoyed working with others. The hardest part of the job was getting others to help with the super heavy items. I learned teamwork can be difficult to find.
good,The hours are up and down so you never know what your pay check will be until the end of the week.Managers were unorganized. Good for just a part time job.
good,the work was great fast paced. the fast pace working environment made the day go quick and enjoyable. I enjoyed working with the management staff that was there during my time.
good,It was okay. Demanding projects at times and slow work at other times. Managers were nice and cared for their works minus a few top level new comer executives.
good,"I worked at FEDEX Smartpost as a Seasonal employee over Christmas a few years ago. It was fast paced and stressful, but I enjoyed it. I was a sorter and a Forklift operator."
good,"I worked as a package handler part time when I was in college.  This would include loading and unloading of the truck, scanning product off and on the trucks.  This was a warehouse setting and was tough manual labor."
good,"It was a nice work environment with nice and helpful people. I was the Janitor for FedEx. I cleaned the front counter, bathrooms, offices, break room, took trash out, dusted."
good,very good place to be at the people are very cool well rounded people lots of work definitely have to be in shape and a dedicated worker to get the job done the pay is decent but can always be better
good,"If you need a solid, consistent job then its great. The balance of work and life is very hard, ESPECIALLY during the holidays. It wont be difficult if you have the right management above you otherwise its very little morale."
good,it is a decent part time job that pays decent. They do provide PTO that you can take at anytime and there are always opportunities for job advancement.
good,"hourly wage good, part time workers don't get many hours, benefits great, training good, 4:30 am - 9:30 am shift loading alot of outgoing freight, cold in warehouse  and on loading docks in winter, teamwork good"
good,"My normal day changed for the most part. The people that I worked with became more like family, then co-workers for the most part. It was a wonderful experience to have in my life. I received a lot of knowledge from the company and the people I worked with."
good,"FedEx is a good place to work. The pay for a part time employee is great, but the opportunity of getting a full time job is not so good. It takes a very long time to get full time employment"
good,The pay is 14.00 in Memphis TN. They should pay more. Training is three weeks long as well. No overtime is given. The managers are cool. The different schedules are cool as well.
good,"Empresa de nivel internacional apegada a cumplir las normas minimas de ley en Mexico, yo actualmente estoy empleado desde outsourcing"
good,It was ok some days were better than others I like the freedom of being out in public and not behind a desk didn't like the days when my truck was over stuffed with packages
good,I feel that this employer could embrace employee concerns as well as other issues to their employees than what they offered.  Fed Ex is a very reputable company to work for but I didn’t see much room for advancement within because they always sent people home because production was slow
good,We deliver packages to homes and businesses. We learned and managed routes and the best way to complete all deliveries. The management varies based on the contractor you work for.
good,Its a fun environment around the other workers but its a lot of lifting and stacking heavy boxes. as for me being a short girl it was a lot of work and pretty scary if a box drops on you.
good,"FedEx is a good experience to have. I don't have a problem with the quick-paced environment, but I do have a problem with the amount of hours I am receiving as a full-time employee."
good,Great place to work while in college. Enjoyed my colleagues and mangers very well. Very family based atmosphere in my branch even though we were a huge company!
good,FedEx is a fast paced job the typical day is that you load trailers the learning experience is easy to learn you have to be quick on your feet watch out hazards and make sure you keep up your work quota
good,"typical work day, some managers are over the top, you get moved around, hardest part during Christmas season, not enough hours, good second job, workplace is ok could be better utilized with the space available"
good,The job is hard and you will only work a few hrs out of the day maybe 3 hours a day and thats not enough to live of off what so ever i dont see how people can survive working tbere honestly
good,"fast pace not worth a darn. to much driving and stops for the pay and being a 1099 employee. 250 to 300 miles a day with 100 plus stops."
good,"wonderful company excellent time working good around your schedule. I really enjoy working here"
good,"The overnight shift was very short on work hours, but they were very fast pace and a lot of work. Their wasn't too much work to receive a sustanable living if you decide to do the overnight package handler."
good,Fast pace work place that offered multiple opportunities to learn all areas of the warehouse. Easy stepping stone place to gain experience to move up or to move on from.
good,"Nice work place to work for college students or part time workers fast pace work environment, less than four hours a day weekend off and less than 20 hours a week"
good,it was stressful at times and when some one did not show up the load was devided between thoses who are closest to the route of the person who did nt show up for work
good,it's hard to get the shift that you want because so many people have seniority over you because they have worked at the company for over 20 years. Mandated over time during Christmas causes you to not be able to celebrate the holidays much. The most enjoyable part of the job is working from home.
good,I was promised two part time shifts at different locations but on many ocassions i arrived and did not work the full four hours. This causes problems because of transportation costs.
good,"Part time job for high-schoolers.Responsible for sorting packages according to destination loading and unloading packages from trucks for delivery. Use scanner to track parcel, enter parcel into database for tracking. Read labels to ensure proper processing and scanned packages on conveyor belt. Maintain cleanliness on equipment and surrounding workspace."
good,"I worked for the original company until FedEx bought them out.  Some of us were led to believe we would still be in Memphis and promised we would like the new building.  First day, location was in Olive Branch and most of us hated the place. The lines didn't make sense, as they were extremely high.  We struggle daily with moving boxes on the line. The program we work with is easy, but at times hard to understand.  Since we moved, we don't have a full crew anymore (people are dropping like flies) and making the ones that are there stressed out because it puts more on us."
good,Managers always criticized you. Didnt know how to give constructive criticism. Good pay and hours but it was a living H**l. I felt like I didnt receive adequate training to complete what was acquired of me. Its a good job to pay the bills (200+ a week) but if you cant handle bad management i would stay away.
good,"FedEx Custom Critical Boettler Road, Uniontown, OH 44685 "
good,you get an up close and personal experience of a fast pace work environment. You learn how to work under pressure. Great job for people thats looking for a part time.
good,"There are only a few warehouse employees on the day shift which makes for a fun and tight nit relationship, all management are easy to get on with and get involved in the banter in the warehouse"
good,Fedex is a fast pace work place. Manangement could use some leadership courses. If you are a new hire you can’t even use the bathroom on your own a Permenant  employee has to escort you. You don’t get a break unless you are working 8 hours or more. Management yells at you like you are in the military.
good,I worked here since April 2017 . I’ve learn a lot from this job and that I could use anywhere . I enjoy my time working here and coming to work everyda
good,I got in because my uncle owns a route and he gave me a position that was never entended for me to be long term i feel i must move on to better things
good,I loved that my mangers were very helpful and gave us rewards for us for our good work. The reason I left was for better opportunity and for a full time position.
good,"Easy way to make money, you just have to be strong and have muscle, also be willing to get hurt on some occasions. Management was cool although they don't follow the safety code which can make the job a bit more dangerous."
good,"Distributed packages and documents for institutions , businesses , apartments , and "
good,Fast pace environment safety zone requirements and lots of movement have to be able to lift above 50 pounds and transfer product from different locations.
good,it was hard stressful work cause u had to lift pretty much everything that came off the truck I believe it to be very hard on a woman anatomy but if u can handle it then go for it
good,hours are grave yard shift but you get use to them must be able to preform and lift and twist constantly. also will be on your feet during the whole time of your shift.
good,To work at fed ex you have to be on your A game at all times. its a very fast paced environment. Not only a fast paced enviornment but a nice one too. coworkers were very nice.
good,fast paced and competitive. great pay with raises along with excellent benefits. I learned how to be a proactive and productive employee as well as a effective team player.
good,"I don't remember a lot about this company but I do know it was hard work, working on the line receiving packages and putting them on the truck. I just wanted to work more hours"
good,The facility that i worked at had awful managers The hours were always getting cut and so they pay was low for the work that was expected. Moral was not good here
good,Ao comecar criamos expecitativas ms em vao pois sabemos que nao ha possibilidadrs de ser efetivado
good,Good company but very stressful. Daily operations involved a fast paced environment. Management does there best to assist employees. Not always accommodating to the employee needs.
good,I was just part time so they tried to force me to stay full time because of my work etic i didn't agree do to me having a full time employment so they gave me a choice to just quit so i did.
good,It was a learning experience. I will not take anything away from my time of employment with this company. I enjoyed my experience and will use all i learned in all my future endeavors.
good,it was a fun job just did not pay enough. I enjoyed driving all around ansd seeing different cities and meeting new people. this job was very easy and relaxed
good,"This location was an ok place to work. The labor was hard and fast pace, but the pay for very low and did not match the average cost of living. I had to work 2 jobs just to make ends meet."
good,"At the time I worked there, I felt as if the company cared more about the customers than the employees. It was always that the customer was right even when they were dead wrong. Management did not have your back."
good,"Get to work in the morning, map your stops. Once your out on the road, you get all your packages dropped off and you head back to the depot."
good,Nothing to say other then you have to see the job for yourself. It's a great company but the pay could be much more better. Even for ground drivers!!!
good,There is always something to do it very safe the equipment is provided. There are always good option to advance yourself move to the work flow watch your sourdings.
good,Takes time to get to working but easy work and many physical actions to take. A lot of repetitive motions but honest workers. The people are very kind and are flexible.
good,It was a good job very fast pace alot of work to get done alot of people working as a team to make sure we met company goals. Also making sure it was done right.
good,"Fedex was a good part time job to earn some extra cash but I was jus there temporarily, its fast paced challenging work environment, it was a big help to me financially tho"
good,FedEx has a big company with a lot of conveyors ..  I suggest go in with a crew and know what needs to be done days ahead of time to stay up to date and on time
good,It's a highly demanding work environment that asks the world of its employees without always providing sufficient support. Non executive level employees do share equitably in the profits that are generated on their backs. Would not recommend.
good,"Mostly standing and scanning, pretty easy. Management is amazing its a great work environment. Hardest part is clocking out. I never want to leave. The staff is friendly, too."
good,"This job can be difficult at first but as your body adusts to the conditons then it gets a little easier. Expect to lift and load boxes nonstop because we do not receive designated breaks. Also expect to get out of work wayy later then the shift you applied for, most shifts end when the workload is finished and there are no more boxes to be unloaded and packed up."
good,Contribute my ability to streamline IT processes. I would love to bring not only this method but my general organizational skills to this job at your company.
good,Manage competing priorities daily while fostering delivery of superior customer care and services. Promoted from accounts billing to office administrator within 2 years. Met and exceeded quota for outbound calls as well as up sold to additional services Fedex provided. Organized and planned the responsibilities of the drivers on a daily basis. Managed a high call volume of inbound and outbound calls.
good,"Unloading freight trailers and/or vans able to lift 60 lbs"
good,The job is stressful numbers have to met. Pay is not a living wage. During peak in December it’s mandatory for overtime no vacation may be taken.  Makes time with the family difficult.
good,I do not wish to comment on the company or policies at this time. It is confidential information. All information should not be used for any external purposes.
good,"management at location was good, sometimes there moments of chaos. Overall good benefits especially for a part time role. Sometimes had to stay later than my shift scheduled."
good,I unload truck and it was cool nice people nice team no one treated you less then you where the pay could have been better but over all it was a  nice place
good,The culture of the company is great with many opportunities. The hours were very flexible with many advantages. The management is very involved in the employees wellbeing.
good,"Time sensitive fast pace work environment at all times, team work is pivotal in this environment learning something new almost everyday weather how things operate or jus the general logistics is always beneficial."
good,Great coworkers but work is very fast pace and stressful and pay is not the best for what you do working fast all day long have to beat times in and out.
good,Position was not a good fit for me.  Maybe for someone else.  It was fast paced and demanding.  Also felt there was lack of appreciation to employees.  Overworked with no overtime pay
good,"People Friendly"
good,Market leader. Work hard play hard. Mad about service. Sometimes they over complicate things. People friendly. Good benefits. Run by German Post Office.
good,In the position I held my supervisor was horrible and was fired for stealing we did not get another one just a few pop in supervisors. Was not able to get a full-time position.
good,"Great environment, good pay, I like my co workers, good security, awesome benefits, I enjoy working at FedEx It's a physical job"
good,"If you can live on a small paycheck but need health care benefits, this is right up your alley. This is a great job for retirees that only need health insurance. It is very hard work though. I hope your have a strong back and shoulders to pull the heavy freight cans. They basically pick your vacation dates for you. If you have children or grandchildren, forget taking any time off when they are out of school. My hours vary depending on my route that night. It would be impossible to have a second job because you do not have a set route or schedule. One day you may work 4 hours. The next day it could be 10. You are expected in sleet, snow, and ice. You cannot support a family on the pay. A second income of some kind is needed. If you want to become a CDL Driver, you have to pay your dues first, you must be a package handler for a minimum of one year first. If you are a hard worker and dependable they will help you get your CDL and pay for the training. Like anything else, there's pros and cons, depending on your needs."
good,"Its a cool job, the only negative as a driver is that you don't get paid for your time. You made your own lunch breaks. Your basically your own boss once you leave the terminal"
good,"Compensation is something Fedex is putting more emphasis on. Overtime after 8 hrs, pension plan, profit sharing and yearly raises. They have been bringing in newer equipment and better technology to aid in job performance"
good,Wasn't happy about work in the climate control but overall the experience was great..had fun working there. The benefits are extremely excellent for u
good,The job was fast paced but fun if you enjoy talking and serving people.  Most people appreciate good food and good service and that is the reward.  This job is a good experience for most people I'd say.
good,Its a contract with FedEx and in all its not the customers that i gave a mediocre rating its the communication within the representatives and leads and managers it makes it a lot harder to be helpful to the client
good,"I called everyday to see what time to came in.  If it was hot outside it was hotter inside. I it was cold outside, it was colder inside.  It was dirty and physically demanding."
good,I work for contractor from fedex under paid stress out the list can go on an on. If you find a good contractor to work for that worth it. It can be stress being tho your. No holiday off.
good,Huge company to work for. Things can change from work being plentiful to not having any work at all. They provide uniforms/ benefits are ok . The company is more about making money for stock holders now.
good,very fast paced and a teaches how to work as a team. Managment is very cool but they are on top of you to make sure you're doing your job the correct way.
good,The job was great. The hours and pay were great. But if you have severe anxiety it is not the job for you which was why I left. But if you can handle the pressure it is pretty fun.
good,Good place to work they take care of their employees with good benefits and safety. They overlook every employee to be sure they’re working safely to avoid injuries.
good,FedEx is a fast pace job. We have so many trucks to unload and load  and it all have to be done at a certain time. Also it could get very hot and cold in the warehoues
good,"It's a place where, the longer you stay there, the more aggrivating it is. For a short, temporary job, it tends to be decent. However, the longer you're there, and the more training you get, the more you realize how broken it can get towards the top. Breaking something that works, then wonder why it doesn't, happens often. Managment, depending on where you are, is either very good, or very bad."
good,"it was a very fast paced work environment "
good,FedEx was a cool place to work. Made some great friends while I was there. The management cares and is down to earth. The ceo will sit with you and talk to you. There is no higharchy for the most part. They try and value their employees. It’s a very hard job and very rare for people to stay long term.
good,"It's a fast- pace place to work, if you like that sort of job. There is never time for standing around and doing nothing. You are constantly moving from trailer to trailer. Definitely make sure you stay hydrated"
good,"Job was okay, as a part time gig. The amount of work you do in a few hours time is enough to wear you out. As most shifts are 3-4 hours, you will be working fast and hard for every minute you are there."
good,good place to work can be very stressful . with proper training this could be a great career. no benefits. if you like driving it is the perfect job. long hours
good,"Long hours, ok pay, constantly write you up for little things, good culture, just another number, nice equipment, nights nights nights horrible insurance"
good,Typical day at work you are removing boxes from a truck onto a belt . The job is tiring and alot of work. You bounce around from truck to truck dont take any breaks.
good,FedEx pushes the employees extremely to hard. There is no work/life balance. Moving up the ladder can take to many years considering FedEx only allows 1 promotion in 12 months for each employee.
good,"Okay if you want part-time work. Only during Christmas rush was there more than three or four hours' work per day.  Constant push for greater production.  Not difficult work, not particularly strenuous. Management very cooperative when I needed time off to take care of my wife when she had surgery.  Location remote, so that commute was long for many employees.  Environment very secure; mngmt. very safety-conscious."
good,The first 7 years at Fedex was enjoyable but they started consolidating service centers resulting in a job location change and when that happened  hrs redused to 32 hrs per week and occasional split shifts
good,There was merely a high demand for productivity with little compensation to be had for the ridiculously high demand of productivity. Yes the pay was relatively nice (not enough to sustain ones self) but there was no real incentive to work at the pace that they expected to be every employees bare minimum.
good,It was a good job got to learn how they find addresses for people who moved. How to handle damaged boxes. Got to work by your self sometime so it was relaxing and quiet.
good,A typical day was opening and unloading trailers and documenting the contents of each trailer.  Management and co-workers were always helpful and kind.
good,had to unload a whole truck just one person a scanner you are one a time limit so you have to move fast once workload is done you are sent home paid weekly
good,Foi uma empresa muito boa porem com as atuais mudanças dentro da empresa a cultura que é fomentada se perdeu.
good,was not a bad place to work people were very friendly and had an open door policy so could talk to managers about anything work was tough moving heavy packages but pretty relaxed job
good,"Call in daily to find out where you will be going that day."
good,Globally recognized corporation. A lot of challenges and obstacles in performing the required job functions. Management under constant directives to change. Customers just want to ship. Not a lot of consistent structures in place.
good,Many of the ground contractors have little respect for the drivers so you need to find one that will treat you right in order to be happy doing this job.  Team driving is where you'll find the best money but finding a co-driver who isn't a jerk can be quite challenging.  If you are willing to pay your dues and get a good dedicated route then you will have predictable pay.  The yards are typically well set up and once you're on the road you can make good time.  Expect to be held up 5-22 hours at each destination as a team.  Solo drivers typically can go after the 10 hour resets.  The work isn't hard and the pay is better than most places.  I would say that it is typical truck driving work.
good,"I did the same thing every day, every week. There was not much excitement and sometimes there was collaboration among us coworkers. I always had drop offs and never had to wait to go to work."
good,Having the spirit and energy to work in a house warming place. Working to keep every package in order and out of wrong placement that causes issues to happen.
good,it was a good place to work at for the time being. self explanitory and easy to achieve goals for the day. managers and co workers were good to work with
good,Sorting and pulling and scanning ....your going to have to cut it if you want to hang on to this job. Preloaders runners and package redeployment you will lose weight.
good,"Fedex did teach me some valuable things. It was never a career choice for myself however. I wanted to apply myself better. I mostly organized packages which were organized by a letter, as well as a tracking number which was how they were sorted properly. It was a very simple, part-time job before I worked full time and was out of school."
good,I gained a lot of knowledge here. They give plenty of opportunities to learn and achieve more weekly. You have options to post out to learn different jobs throughout the workplace.
good,"I worked at FedEx for over a year and I really liked it. I was a very hard worker and could use any of my managers for a refrence. I have done everything there is to do inside of a warehouse that doesn't require a driver's license, so I am capable of many positions."
good,"It is a large company, but promotional opportunities are not easily accessible.  Overall corporate culture is not generally ""admin friendly"".  Insurance, tuition reimbursement and other company benefits are good."
good,Everything is on the go. You slow down the more work you have to put in. It is mainly making sure the truck is stocked up and tight ready to be sent. Management is understanding.
good,"Learned a lot about what people order. Nice place to work, they took good care of the employees who worked there. Riding a bicycle 30 miles a day. Got paid 11.00 an hour for 4 hours a night."
good,"Its hard work but i learned a lot of things like team work, learning the walkie, and also learnimg to work fast but safe. The only problem i feel is the managers dont help as much as they can."
good,"Fed Ex gave me the opportunity to make a living for my children. Unfortunately, there was too few opportunities to advance so ultimately I was forced to find alternative employment."
good,People would wake up everyday and come to work angry and take it out on their co-workers that are just trying to do their jobs more or less; the vibes were always bad until me and my few friends would lighten the mood.
good,not enough hours hard work needs better pay no benefits and you don't truly work for fedex it more like a company within a company good luck to all who will aplly
good,Very inclusive environment.  Good training for most positions.  Supervisors were okay.  Low pay.  Management is not in touch with employees.  Occasional free meals.
good,"Calls are constant for 8 hours, customers need assistance with their downloaded Fedex.com software programs. The call center has a large amount of turnover. The management and subject matter expert positions are understaffed."
good,This company was a great place to work at the time. I received general warehouse experience in a team building environment. I will use my skills for future opportunities.
good,Federal Express provided adequate training to all of its employees and I like the face that you could attend school and they would pay for (partial) tuition. The benefits were also good.
good,I received in glasses. I picked and put them away. Paid lunch. Couldn't leave grounds for lunch. Could only drink water on the work floor. Had to be there at 8 am
good,"fedex was a good place to work, did not really like working at night and it would have been better if the hours was full time, but my manager was nice and the pay was good."
good,es un buen lugar de trabajo pero es deficiente en seguridad
good,Good benefits.  Not a lot of advancement opportunity. New employees are hired for more per hour than current employees make.  Jeans are allowed often.
good,WEll i loved working at fed ex but it just takes to long become a driver on the company. i love the people that work there it is fun to go to work every day
good,I arrive at work every day at 8am and am provided my route.  I check my truck then get my trailer from the door.  Then I start out my route and delivery my product and pick up new product
good,"I have 2 offices and work in 3 places."
good,While working as a package handler on the vanlines i was also working at every other department because the staffing was no organized. The managers were very strict and wanted everything done at a certain time even when the vans showed up late.
good,Your opinion of FedEx depends almost entirely on your attitude toward your job. You can love it or hate it depending on how determined you are to do either.
good,"Not a bad place to work but it is only part time and some of the people are not the most pleasant to be around.  Many people do not show up on time and as a result, it takes longer to get the sorts done."
good,multiple opportunities of senior leadership and HR not supporting local manger. Fratinization between senior leadership and employee to undermine manager.
good,"The pay is not worth the stress. My start time is 7:30 am but I don't have a set end time, which was not much fun. Somedays I would get home well after 9pm after delivering all my packages."
good,"Its a very hard physical labor, so If you aren't physically fit, then its not the place to be. Every now and then, we were given a icey pop to stay hydrated along with coolers of water."
good,"No further details.  Its a regular job with regular part time hours, nothing new to discuss.  Lots of boxes, lots of sweat, no issues. Was fine, recommend college studies in between jobs."
good,You must be adaptable to constant change and a fast paced work environment. Can keep you in decent physical health and some people use it as a type of workout rather than going to a gym.
good,It's very hard work and it's not enough hours and they don't pay you enough for the work you do.  To many people acting like the boss.  Some not being a boss.
good,If you don't mind working long hours with a low pay then this is the job for you. Management is not on the same page which makes the job a bit more difficult.
good,Working for Harte Hanks contract company for FedEx was great learning opportunity and skulking building experience. Despite being my first call center employer they were very willing to train  properly.
good,"Very hard to move up in the company. Very small raises, no ways to make the desired salary you are looking for. Very high, unrealistic expectations. Poor management."
good,FedEx est un modèle de l'entrepreneuriat et est parfaitement organisée.
good,To the point. Fast pace customer base. Hard charging. Dealing with all types of people of all cultures. Problem solving daily with hard to find routes and new sub-divisions. In the end the goal is to unload all packages swiftly and most of all safety is number one!
good,It is fast paced and have constant turn around of staff.   They hiring during the holiday season and the hours fluctuate on the workload for the day..
good,fedex is an okay job if you don't have kids. and you are just looking for extra cash. fedex do not offer benefits. its stressful if you let it. and it could be overwhelming.
good,"Fun company to work for , just do your job well."
good,"Trabajo muy bueno, salario bueno, una lastima los horarios."
good,At FedEx it was pretty straight forward. It was just a part time job for extra money. The company is ran great. The work isn't back breaking and they love hiring within.
good,Fed-Ex company is a very competitive company.  Working hours depend on driver.  I completed each task to the best of my knowledge. I made sure all packages and parcels were delivered on time.
good,Work is fast paced at most times and you have a quota to meet so you really have to make sure your focused on the task at hand. The most enjoyable part of the day is when you leave to go home.
good,its  a  okay  place  to  work.  Its  really  fast  pace  work.  They will  only  explain  your  job  once.  Once  you  learn how  to do  the job they give  you they  move you  to  another  place.
good,"Working here made my sleep schedule super reckless. Up all night like a vampire, sleep during the day like a nocturnal animal. Not a bad place of employment, it just wasn’t for me"
good,"I did two stints at Fedex. The first was terrific, lots of fun, got a lot of cool stuff done, solved lots of problems with converting an in-house application framework to SWT."
good,"was a package handler. had to be there for 5 am and pretty much done by 7 am. unload truck[s] in a timely manner , stack boxes on pallets according to destination. and then go home"
good,unless you are physically strong it is very hard to work this job. it is extremely demanding. it is a great workout though if you can keep up and maintain.
good,I worked hard everyday maintain a healthy diet to work under various conditions and whenever I finished my task i immediately took on helping my other co workers. i had good supervision and safe environment
good,The work begins and ends at the exact time. Friendly and responsible team. During the work I learned a lot of new things. Colleagues do not refuse to help. The working day passes very quickly and is not noticeable. There is a dining room and a place where you can relax on a break.
good,"My experience at FedEx was alright. We worked inside a warehouse so you could figure how that is. It was fast paced and you would move around a lot. That meaning different warehouse positions."
good,"cargo handlers have to work in any type of climate, it is loud, noisy, and can be stressful depending on the work loads. Depending on what your goals are there may be room for advancement."
good,"It's a real labor job, requires hard work. If you lazy, looking for something laid back this is not it . Con is the hours were not consistent, that can be frustrating."
good,Unloading product from trucks on dock in a timely manner the whole shift once in a while sorting packages when ever we were short on associates & gave the drivers help when needed as well.
good,Being a package handler was a workload to handle. If I was not a student-athlete in training then the job may have been more difficult in the initial start. It is a good way to increase shape while getting paid.
good,i dont like it. the managers were slobs and didnt care for anyone. there was no dress code and people really stink. not a good place id wanna work at ever again
good,"FedEx is a fast paced work environment working in extreme elements of hot or cold. If you are alone, you have to work hard to meet your quota and if you have help, they cannot be lazy"
good,"Sunrise shift"
good,my boss was fair all the workers were fun to work with n be around if time of was needed u could get it except during peak time from Nov though Dec...
good,Working at fedex is an experience during peak season you can definitely make a good amount of money but during the off season the hours are short. The work itself can be a little tiring
good,You worked in a very hot warehouse in the summer time and never stopped moving other than your breaks. You had to have good hand eye cordination so you can sort packages that move fast on a conveyor system
good,Drive delivery trucks to residential and commercial business. You learn to become very independent and manage your time wisely. The hardest part of the job was making sure you deliver and pick up packages on time.
good,"supervisors and managers have the right to discriminate against workers if they saw fit. supervisors can send you home if they want to, shorting your hours."
good,It was an okay job but with the face pace job and heavy boxes it was really hard to keep up the pace with what they want you to do and it was not worth the pay i was getting
good,I worked at the Santa Fe springs location my manager was sexist and always picked fights with people they also tell you there's room to grow in the company but never promote people just end up hiring from outside the company also they like to say everything's a team effort but always having you alone working like a slave to lift couches and desks that people order the company only cares about themselves
good,Didn’t enjoy the time I was there although I did like the job itself. Manager/contractor that I was under was very sick so he couldn’t hold up his duty’s to the fullest.
good,worked 4hrs a day early mornings would be good for a part time job for a college student or a suplimental income was a fun job for a while but the early mornings got old
good,Stay quiet and to yourself working here. This job can be stressful and require a lot of your attention. Still can work out for the best.Thank you and have a nice day
good,Work was messy and the introduction was a lie. They sold us a fake job and loaded us with work and no hours. We were promised hours but they didn't want to pay us according
good,I wasn't a fan of FedEx perhaps because the company i worked for got acquired by FedEx and all the changes was taking place very quickly and no actual transitioning plan but i was working to many hours and no appreciation to the work i did.
good,This is a very physical job. you must be able to work at a high intensity and keep it up. If you aren't able to mentally prepare yourself i wouldn't recommend it.
good,"Big corporation and felt like a number with limited career growth opportunities.  Tough place to move up unless you have an ""In"". Would like to see the culture of winning and success versus we always have done it this way."
good,"Working for FedEx Home Delivery as a Package Delivery Driver is good but if you want to make a career out of it, its not so good. Management is great! They treat you with respect! You're salary paid, with no overtime, and no benefits and no paid vacation. If you want a career as a driver for FedEx go for FedEx Express, hourly and overtime pay, and paid vacation."
good,Clock in at 5 Am and we get right to it moving packages out of the truck and down the line. You have 25 to 30 mins to break down the truck. once the trucks are broke down boxes sorted now we have to load the trucks that leaving up before 9 AM
good,Working in this environment learned how to work more on the outbound side and scheduling. hardest part is figuring out some software you do not know about or the correct answer.
good,"Work is physical but fairly easy... Nothing to stressful...co-workers were nice easy going, hard working people... Overall FedEX Smart post was an ok  place to work, i would recommend it to college students or as a 2nd job!!!"
good,Always busy nice clientele base with good team members. There is a lot of job experience here dealing with shipping and printing services. The hardest part about the job is getting promoted.
good,Deeply imbedded lack of culture in this industry holds FedEx Freight back from being an overly attractive opportunity for a younger generation. Opportunity for competitive pay in all levels of work. I believe within 10-20 years high level management will have turned around most of these issues as they have recently outwardly addressed these issues.
good,This job will kill your back if your not careful. You will load and unload trucks in extreme unregulated temperatures. Packages are any where from a pound to Five hundred pounds.
good,Job is very militant your late if you are on time.  good for a part time job.  grave yard hours in a fast paced job can be stressful.  you deal with multiple tired personalities
good,"the hours were okay, the work was tiring, strenuous and stressful, not enough help when loading the trailors, too many lazy people and management, need more pay"
good,"The job is good if you're looking for short hours. Hours depend on how much packages come in daily. Sometimes there's a full work day, sometimes there's a short day. nothing is certain except Peak Season."
good,Was getting up at 4 am to drive 60miles one way to pick up freight from the airport and then 60miles back to unload truck only to have to reload the truck for that days route.
good,I work very hard at Fed Ex it is hard labor in terms of the heaviness of the packages. I like the job but I want to be able to work full time. If I could have a full time fixed schedule I would be very happy. I'd have a real lunch break. I am not able to have my benefits due to a part time position but I have made it known and have proven myself to management that I can handle a full time position.
good,"I work a fedex supply chain international department I prepare load ocean container and air product,picking and driver a forklift.my position is a forklift driver LTO"
good,I have a good amount of experience of leadership for about  3 to 4 years of help people. By Making their  job easy to them and comfortable without make them feeling uncomfortable. I have great communication skills a team player and make sure everybody is safe at the job by following rules and Safely  Procedure
good,you have to be able to pick up heavy stuff and heavy boxes which was not easy because i would have back pain do to the heavy boxes they say its only 70 pounds they made us pick up even more heavy ones.
good,FedEx was really a good working place as a job. If I could I would go back there. Alot of cool people to work with. But they laid me off from the job.
good,Nice place to work. Glad I got a chance to work there. Fast Pace have to be in decent shape not for people that can't lift a lot of heavy packages it's important that you can lift a lot at fast pace.
good,The job was great they needed better organization. Better leaders as far as the people on the floor wasn't ever helpful . I had one of my managers walk out on me and my team.
good,"packing and shipping boxes, sorting boxes on a conveyor belt, teamwork with other personnel for the purposes of package distribution. and loading and unloading trailers, incoming and outgoing"
good,"When I first started at FedEx, it was an outstanding place to work.  As the years progressed, it became a challenging place to work.  The changes in strategy and management made it a place that I eventually had to leave."
good,Moved and packed packages. I learned how to effectively weight lift and organize packages. There were managers that helped tell me what to do. A friendly company. The hardest part of the job is lifting 100+ pound packages. The most enjoyable part is helping the company.
good,Sent homecearlyctoo often. Would like supervisor to let me know in advance if I am not needed.  I do not live near Fed Ex. I catch a ride to work. I pay for gas. I do not live near Fed Ex.
good,"It all honestly depends on the people. Management and your coworkers is what makes or breaks this job. I've heard of people getting cussed out by management, management getting cussed out by employees..etc. If you have poor communication skills and can't follow direction then this isn't a job for you. It's tiring, labor is labor but hey, no gym membership needed. Wish we got more than a 10 minute break after 3 hours of work. Other than that, it's a pretty cool job. They'll most likely hire you on the spot. They have low standards for their employees. Literally just need two legal forms of ID and you're hired."
good,"Fast Paced and Outgoing, Lack of benefits is the only reason I'm looking elsewhere for em[ployment.  Some days you get sent home due to lack of package to route numbers"
good,This is an average company. Nothing to jump for joy about here. I enjoyed my rime here. Other companies do pay more but the work environment is fun and fair.
good,"I have to say that working as a delivery driver for FedEx started as a challenge but is now a easy going job for me. It is physical and tiring but i know i have a goal to reach and a life to make for myself and i have to complete my route to accomplish that goal. Working under a contractor is different, and my contractors are responsible and very busy. The hardest part of my job is dealing with different packages and traffic on the road. The most enjoyable part of my job is the driving and knowing i am making my customer's day by delivering their package."
good,"FedEx is not a good place to work....they offer no benefits at all. Considering the hard labor that the drivers endure on a daily basis you would think they would at least offer health benefits. A lot of the furniture and chewy boxes are extremely heavy and there are some workers with no dolly to make it a little easier. The contractors are a complete joke along with most supervisors.... If you think you might like this kind of work, do yourself a huge favor and go work for UPS....BENEFITS, UNION, 401K and NO CHEWY"
good,Working at FedEx is a good job but you have to move fast and know what you're doing at all times but there are a lot of good people that works there and they pay every week so that's a plus also.
good,"FedEx is a good company that's been around for many years however, the employees are overworked and underpaid. You don't feel like you are appreciated."
good,Has excellent benifits with a low cost for medical for a family. Lots of physical labor. Could be hard on the body. My back and wrist took alot of wear and tear. Room for advancement.
good,FEDEX supply chain is a fast place working environment with good benefits for teammates. the try to build and make the culture great and recognize teammates by giving incentives.
good,"Could be an interesting and worthwhile job, but there were no health benefits.   A typical day is delivering packages throughout the city of Lagrange,  The most difficult part was working with a low salary and no benefits.  Most enjoyable was being outdoors."
good,"Unfortunately season job but I liked the job.  I drive a lot, I was working for a contractor of FEDEX.  It was a good experience for myself and learn that it is not a simply thing."
good,"You get to learn new technologies, and enhance your profile, but the lack of planning in the projects, we have to stay for extra hours everyday, due to which your personal life suffers."
good,"Difficult to provide a fair review, it has been quite some time since having worked there.  Do remember hard work, decent benefits, will say the only place I've ever worked where health benefits are offered to part time"
good,"Drove from Petaluma to Sacramento every night at 9, would make it there around 11. Upon arrival Fedex gives drivers 30 mintutes to unhook and drop a set of trailers and an extra 15 minutes for a break."
good,"It's a faced pace workout with plenty of hours during the peak season (holiday season) but hours can be slow early in the year. Just make sure you dress for the weather.  If its hot outside, its hotter inside; cold outside, colder inside."
good,"Company is decent to work for. As a temp there were no benefits. Applying for a perm position is a little difficult, going thru the interviews are very stressful. For the most part, the position I held was ok."
good,"It was ok it was a job. Currently looking for something else.  It was hard to balance life because you were always expected to work. A lot of overtime,  big turn over."
good,Productive and fun place to work where I enjoyed the people and I came in to contact with. I sometimes did not like my assignments but always found the people interesting and enjoyable to be with.
good,"As a FedEx package handler, I possess the ability to lift 75 lbs at least, if not more."
good,"I was a waitress at the FedEx Forum, The communications skills was not a good out come so it was really hard if you was not a fast learner, it was very stressful and not enough team support."
good,Fun place where the time goes by fast. Laid back but will work hard.Pay is good and the staff is easy going. Easy to transfer to different positions and rolls.
good,"delivered mail to homes and  corporate buisnesses on a daily basis stressful situation most of time  it was ok work place , will reccommend job to other"
good,Overall I liked working for this company but had to leave for personal reason. Just like any other company management had their favorite staff. Very fast pace.
good,The company as a whole was alright. I didn't not like the work. Seams like you put in alot of work for less. And it took them about 3 weeks to consider me going full time.
good,"Many opportunities within this company. Good managers and support staff. They treat people well overall, but they do demand a level of commitment from their employees."
good,"The management staff for the most part are good people to work for but with a third party logistics company, how you operate the business is dictated by the customer you are contracted with, so that can make the company seem like it's not such a good place to work."
good,"We come in at 7pm, the managers would tell us how much we’d have, we hardly got out a the time we were supposed to. We could stay a while later or leave early. Management was alright they could hard on us sometimes for what seems like no reason. Everyone there is laid back and cool. The hardest part of the job was leaving so late at night."
good,"⦁ Ensuring successful transfer and delivery goods to intended destinations "
good,"It is a fast pasted environment that has a lot of work to be done in a short amount of time. The hours are at very early parts of the morning. Also, it is a part time job, so it will not be sustainable to make a decent living."
good,"It's a very fast pace labor intensive surrounding, let alone a highly stress fill job. Very long days, guarantee 12 plus hours per day. Absolutely not family oriented"
good,"Would be much better if the right people were in positions of authority. More often than not the less qualified, ""favored"" candidate gets the promotion over the more qualified, less favored"
good,"Bad working conditions, supervisors weren't the best . Little to no training for new employees. Barely got time to catch composure as for I would be in trailers by myself from time to time"
good,I liked going to work and I like the people I worked with .I learned greater team working skills. I learned how to communicate better. Would definitely recommend the position.
good,"It takes a certain lifestyle and ability to perform the job well on a daily basis. Overall the job is average in comparison to other jobs of the same nature. Management seems to care more about numbers and sometimes its hard to get a one on one with the managers. Advancement is there but at the same time it seems to be more of a need rather than ability. Benefits were not the worst but I have had better considering I was only part-time, it wasnt too bad. Overall the job has many desirable aspects but also some that arent."
good,It could be better just management makes it so much complicated. Can’t trust their actions. HR at times hears us but seems they stand behind management whether their right or wrong.
good,"- the job really open my eyes on how packages get delivered to their appropriate destination. "
good,i honestly do not really remember my work experience there. It has been almost ten years since i have worked there. I dont recall it being a bad place to work for though
good,Fast paced work in all weather. If you don’t like to work outside probably not a good fit for you. This job is demanding and has good opportunity for advancement.
good,just stressful at times with upper management because they will approve and make new polices without notice and we need to comply to those polices. just frustrating sometimes
good,"A typical day consists of beating the numbers and making 10:30 commit service for deliveries. With a continued sense of urgency all day long. Which makes it a very physically demanding and a high pressured job, with little or zero reward. No recognition provided by higher management."
good,Great job to advance in. Benefits are well along with awesome employees to work with. Great labor job. Nice job to get if you were working around the holiday.
good,It’s alright they make us work very quickly and work around like 5-8 hours every day. Be sure to dress for the weather because that’s what it’s gonna feel like in the warehouse
good,high energy and fast paced work environment that put profits ahead of people. Long hours and off work hours that limit time for family and time away from work.
good,"It's a great experience, but very overwhelming at times. Great teamwork and communication . During peak season are the toughest days and many times you have to work alone but overall you learn a lot with this job get to meet a lot of good people."
good,Had a great time working for fedex. i had a great boss named tony and fedex all in all takes very good of there people that are working for them. They told me that i was always welcome back
good,I mean you cant really complain because its a job. but its always hot in the warehouse and it just seems like everything gets rushed and there is no pacing or structure
good,"Early hours and a Fast paced warehouse with  heavy loads, forklift and other ware house items utilized, had to  make sure equiptment is in working order and ready for next person."
good,"all safety procedures and policies are followed, Operate forklifts and pallet jacks to move, pick or distribute product, Load and unload truck as necessary."
good,"This is one of the best places I have worked I enjoyed the people the culture and the move fast mentality. I am sad I ever left and think they are doing big things and moving in the right direction,"
good,"Great benefits - Blue Cross Blue Shield for medical Davis for vision and  CIGNA for Dental.  Great pay  raise every year and mileage increase every year . Great atmosphere  activities for the family picnics bowling barbecue safety award  gifts , And bonuses"
good,"A workday consist of working the sort while loading your vehicle in an organized manner.  You have to work as a team to make sure stops are balanced between teammates.  I learn how to work in a high pace and sometimes stressful environment.  The management was good, but they had some negative issues that needed address and sometimes things weren't addressed in a timely and forthright manner..The hardest part of the Job had to be working the sort, and sometimes going on the road with to many stops can be a bit disconcerting because you not be able to provide the customer with what they paid for.  The most enjoyable part of the job is making customers happy by providing excellent services.  The workplace culture is mostly a fun and enjoyable for the most part but with every workplace you are bound to have a few bad apples or other types of challenges.  Overall, it's a good place to work.."
good,"directors of tech connect  - not good"
good,"great place for anyone thats going to school (high school, college, grad school, university, trade school, anything like that) hours were very early in the mornig."
good,"Very busy from day to day. Competive work environment. Very friendly & hard working co workers. Great management team, who strives for the safest & efficient experience for patrions."
good,while working there didn't get very many hours worked only 3 days a week and was supposedly full-time but while I was there it was pretty decent environment
good,"The pay is extremely great but it’s not worth breathing in toxic fumes from forklifts 6 hours straight. Dealing with the weather is brutal. I got sick all the time from working here. Management is great, they will work with you if you need anything. There’s never a fixed schedule which sucks. Great team members working together. Very physical work."
good,A typical day of work consisted of loading up my truck. Driving to multiple destinations and delivering multiple packages to the proper destinations. I love driving that's why I enjoyed this jobs so much.
good,When FedEx started being more about the analytics and not about the human element of job it became an unfavorable place to work in. The company everyone to perform like robots instead of acknowledging the differences everyone bought to the table.
good,Relaxed setting that helped with a better understanding of how working with a lot of people can be. They make sure that you are on your business and not slacking around.
good,"If you don’t want to make money but have to listen to people complain all day then this is the place to go. Waste of time, money is horrible. Enjoy it"
good,There is no union.  Most work contracted out.  Contractors offer no benefits or  sick leave.  You get one week of vacation a year.  There are no regular raises offered.
good,The days were long. Learned how to drive my truck into and out of long mud filled driveways. I knew how to keep to regular customers satisfied with their deliveries.
good,"I liked FEDEX also, I work night shift and they expect us to work hard and fast...I don't have complain, I did this kind job because I was young and strong"
good,"Fast pace job with no breaks. Work environment is ok depending the area you would like to work. It can get stressful at times, but days go by fast if your focused and there is alot of work"
good,"come in have avmeeting about what's expected for that day"
good,"i really didnt care abput the com[pany long as i was getting paid. the only problem i had was not enough hours. But, all in all it was a job and i worked with some very nice people"
good,Getting my packages and delivering them to the correct address or to the correct business. delivering till you have no more packages in the truck. depends on how fast you are and know your route
good,10 to 12 hour days working the operation and office. Long hours and they can change you to what ever shift they wont to. if the other employees don't like you they don't talk to you
good,"not a bad job, just wish they had better postions open. very fast pace sometimes some managers don't have help. the pay should be more since they start people off part time, then takes month to get a pay of full time just because your started out as part time"
good,not a bad job I only worded seasonal part-time but it was pretty cool. I learned how to stack boxes tight in high. I like how they let us have competitions on loading the truck the best.
good,"There is a great work/life balance and allows employees to have a flexible schedule if needed. Although, there are members of upper management that have been in their careers multiple years making it difficult to move up in your career. If you are willing to relocate, there may be opportunity to move up."
good,"•	Scan and process guest tickets upon arrival"
good,Did not work there very long to to get a real feel for and personal thoughts. But overall relaxed place to work at. Would work there again. Did not enjoy the little pay.
good,"The work is hard if others are not willing to help. Depending on who you know, its hard to move up. Definitely not enough hours depending on the department you work at.Great benefits though!"
good,Come in and get your assigned area from your team lead and manager. Set up was nice if you work off of docks but sucked if you didn't have a good crew on your shift
good,The overall job was good. It should have had better management. I came on time daily to finish my work day. My supervisor wasn't good under pressure. Making things a little complicated.
good,I would go in late in the afternoons and work until finished.    I learned about packaging and LTL freight.   Management was fine and the culture was fine.   Hardest part of the job was the fast pace we had to keep up with and the most enjoyable was the time passed quickly.
good,"Confimed that all ducuments were cleared for Customs."
good,Working for Ground Express means just that. You are part of the ground roots of package handling. Not for everybody. You have to work.  They do offer benefits after a year or a thousand hours.Work  is 15 to 20 hours a week. You do the math.....
good,We would have a meeting to tell us what to expect for the shift. Stretch out so we don't hurt ourself while unloading the trailer. Get in the trailer and start unloading. Make sure you don't put anything over 100 pounds on the belt. If you did that then the belt would break.
good,"very fun people to be around enjoyed my time working with this company honestly coworkers made the job fun and when there's team work, work gets done a lot quicker"
good,"Company does not offer enough hours for mail sorters, this was a big deal in finding something that was better. If the pay was better or more hours i'd reconsider going back."
good,"Empresa com conceito e cultura excelentes, tanto aqui, como fora do país."
good,Good part time job during peak season. The work is hot in the summer and cold in the winter months. Management is good and fair. They have luncheons for the dept. that has no accidents.
good,"Typical day was preparing food for customers, I learned a lot working at Fed EX Forum, for example learning different spices, how colors plays an important part in food presentation. The environment was peaceful."
good,A typical day at FedEx would consist of loading and unloading packages onto trucks depending on where you were stationed. Some of the management was poor and a lot of the times they demanded a lot from you physically. The hardest part of the job was the labor in general. Sometimes an IC package that weighs over 50lbs or more would come down the chute of your truck and you'd have no choice but to lift it regardless of how heavy it may be.
good,Fedex is a great place to work for. It is very fast paced and long work hours during peek season. I would recommend this job for some one with lots of energy and strength.
good,"i was in college at the time i started working here and it payed the bills. but it really wasn't a good job for a woman to work, the work was to heavy"
good,Work for a temp services  working as a contractor. my assignment was up on August 21/2017. Working as a contractor working with accountemp .Had to process check to be ok to pay. I had to stop payment or canceled check and attach to the check and let employee see photo of cash check.
good,Fedex helped me with leadership skill and how to work fast paces with freight. Working offload gave me experience with planes and a wide variety of people.
good,"I worked with  fedex during the holiday season so i experienced a very fast paced environment. as long as the customer had the right tracking number the call went by fast. sometimes i would have to deal with an impatient customer who didnt understand the shipping they had paid for, but i would always try to explain to the best of my abilities. The hardest part of the job would be the claims part because some customers would have things lost or stolen that could never be replaced (like family heirlooms,etc) and the claims process in my  opinion would just run them around without any real closure or company acceptance happening."
good,Im sure there are worse companies to work for. As a City/Road dviver the pay is good with a very strong chance that you'll get at least an hour of OT per day
good,I like the job because it was a challenge different i can say pay was ok they offer alot of benefits work pace was fast and it was a different environment
good,"Began as a 'package specialist' and found the work to be very physically demanding at a low pay, which taught me the value of hard work and my  the desire to appreciate less demanding fields. Transitioned into Quality Assurance and supervisor which lasted a short time as I found other means of employment."
good,they aren't best at coordination but at least you get hours. not great hours or pay but the benefits are good enough i guess. doesn't bother asking for overtime your least likely to get it. they will literally write you up on anything and make a fault out of it.
good,Non chance for another job title in 3 yrs.   No interview mlike theakes you feel like you are not. Qualify.  You feel as though they have filled position
good,"As a package handler my job is, but not limited, to placing boxes that come down the belt into the correct truck. Also cleaning and maintaining a clean work area when things slow down."
good,Load your own truck and delivered all packages before day was done. learned how to manage a route to run as efficiently as possible. Very busy during holidays. Traffic was very stressful during season in Florida.
good,"I would come in at around 6am , best to come in early so you leave out early to deliver.  They give you a gps system to load your route for the day, makes it really easy. Your roster will have addresses on Them as well.  Load your truck in the order of route. I learned the area really quickly and the scanner was really easy to understand.  The workplace culture was mixed.  The hardest part of the job was if you got stuck out at night.. and can't see addresses. The most enjoyable part was being out on the road by yourself and payday of course."
good,"If you are not up to lifting heavy boxes constantly for at least 5 hours straight, do NOT take this job. It will destroy you. But, if you're a big guy and got no other prospects, it's a good place to get some cash as they basically hire anyone with two functioning brain cells."
good,"Buen Trabajador, Responsable , Puntual ..........."
good,As a fedex package handler you do a lot of lifting and continuous walking. it can get very tiring at times but is not a bad job at all. early shifts.4 am starting time
good,"FedEx was a great first job experience. I was a package handler, and my job was to unload and load trucks, and on a typical night I unloaded and loaded about 6 trucks a nights."
good,It's a ok just be hot in there part time don't really get no hours they pay you 11.45 a hour and maybe 4 hours a day so your check don't be that much.
good,It gets the bills paid. Very busy day constant calls coming in Deal with alot of angry customers due to delays and lost packages. We do the best we can.
good,"I once caught someone stealing  and immediately said something that day to the manager and once he found out he approached, he had to stop stealing. I looked at him like a friend so i really didn't wnt him to lose his job for nothin."
good,you work in all types of weather good people to work with. Management is good warehouse cold in the winter hot in the summer good pay no benefits no room to grow
good,"Didn't like the repetitive atmosphere. enjoyed the pay, and the people that worked there. So if you're simple minded and enjoy doing the same thing every day you work it may be the job for you."
good,"If you aren't willing to work in very hot nor cold conditions, lifting very heavy boxes and work at a very fast pace without rest then FedEx isn't for you"
good,I really did not enjoy FedEx. It was horrible and the management there is inconsistent and lost. I definitely will not go back there. That's a guarantee.
good,"Fedex is a good company to work if your looking for a career, you can definitely be there for a long period of time. There are several jobs available. very lucrative."
good,tuesday-saturday i work outbound which is what we receive what customers order online sometimes we have like 3500 packages a day. the packages come down the belt which i have tp spit between odd and even numbers
good,Its was a going over all job. Just wasnt for me anymore. didn't like waking up at 3 to be tat work at 4 till 2 or 4 basically every day. just got interest in another career path
good,as i experienced on Management levels was kinda miss communication most of the times and  timing was not accrue part times not getting  sick pay off or any public holidays
good,At some points at fedex we'll have a quick paced day than sort of slow but most of all working as a team player was the best part of the job helps the day go by alot faster.
good,"Good honest work!  It's not a bad job if you have good time management skills.  Only down side is, you basically run the same route over and over and over."
good,There is no room for growth or increase in pay. All driver positions are through a private contractor so you are not a fedex employee which means no benefits.
good,I've learned a lot about international shipping. It's an ok place to work. There is room for advancement when you network with the right people.I don't have anything bad to say about working at FedEx. Just like any other job. YOU create your own working environment.
good,"Moved freight, stock and other materials to and from storage and production areas and loading docks."
good,"This job was a good experience for a student.  This was my first job.  Although washing dishes is not fun, I learned time management and responsibility."
good,I love the people and the fast pace work environment.The employer were cool and laid back. The shifts were short and pay was not good unless full time
good,"Fast paced warehouse,  Employee appreciation events, 401k, dental and medical.  Discounts on shipping as well as other company perks.  Paid Vacation and Sick time"
good,its good place not great but its good and have a good time doing it and also great work-out. the bosses and good to you but sometimes they have there days at work and take it out on you.
good,"FedEx Freight is a great place to work. They are a company that lives off of safety first, profit second. The three F's the FedEx Corporation lives by are family, faith, FedEx, in that order"
good,"Do what is ask of you and everything will be ok. Know your assignment,be very timely and organized. Have a pleasant demeanor at all times with customers."
good,"a package handler needs two things, physical capability and an ability to work in an extremely fast pace paced environment, there are temperature extremes and comfort is non existent"
good,"FedEx is a good company with great benefits, while at the location I'm at the shop is ran as if your nothing. You get treated like garbage.Your hard work gets over looked at the  effort you put in is thrown to one side. As I said its at my location. But as a company. I love the company."
good,good company i had worked for them a long time and if given the oppurtunity to work them again i definitaky would love to join their company just at a different location
good,Overall a Good company to work for and decent management. Lots of opportunities to grow and work your way up. They pay close attention to all their customers.
good,Expect to have alot of customers and not much help. The job itself is temporary and part time so don't expect it to be a career job. Fun if you like sports. The parking for employees needs work.
good,the management is ok and the pay is decent but you don't get very much hours. the work pretty rough during the summer. if its 95 outside then its 120 in the trucks.
good,"This job is very physical demanding. I dont like how the shifts are set up, it gives very little time in between for your lunch break at times, forcing you to eat quickly and head back to work."
good,"Waking up early"
good,"Weather elements are never predictable and no matter what, you have to be able to give 100% of performance. Customer service is key, be it internal or external customers."
good,This was a cool job. i enjoyed this job. I would suggest this job if you enjoy becoming a body builder whilst simultaneously delivering the joy of a package to customers.
good,This was a good place to work for the experience. I worked all of the weekends which was terrible. I was able to pay for several years of my undergraduate degree.
good,"Fast paced work environment ,good people to work with. Your work day varies based upon the volume of the day.  Your daily duties consist of unloading/ loading of freight."
good,good work less time good team good manger good dispatecher good envroment no overtime always working at the dock if the freight is not ready but weekly payment is good
good,"In a typical day in my last position, I fulfilled management tasks such as reporting and overseeing  staff in Afghanistan. Throughout the day I completed various administrative duties like daily scans of cargos,  freight/merchandise monitoring, answering phones, drafting documents and emails, and filing. I also provided strong customer service and resolved customer issues."
good,it was an alright company to work for. Just depended on the contractors they had u working for! the first one was alright! but the last guy I worked for was very rude. I personally wouldn't go back there.
good,"it's work, not the best place to work nor is it the worst.There is a sense of favoritism and how you move up in the company is based around it. A lot of adults that act like kids."
good,"I started by working on the floor but it didn't seem like people liked their jobs so I moved to were I worked alone. I became an Arrival and Departure Clerk , this job is very fast pace had a lot more to Offer."
good,"Managment at FedEx Hub doesn't appreciate there empolyees and don't know how to communicate with employees ,had a lot of issues with another employee,he was harassing and threatening me and another employee and brought the attention to management and Human Resources; they never did anything about it."
good,This would have been a good job if their starting pay was more. You're on the back of a burning hot of freezing cold truck trailer load everything from shoes to car parts. The work sometimes becomes too much for the pay.
good,Not a terrible experience with FedEx but not easy to keep up with the routes in certain areas. I also had some communication issues with dispatch which could just be the particular location.
good,"your're doing a lot of heavy lifting ,i've to pace myself it can be very tiring. you must work as a team or the job will get a lot harder. keep hydrated at all times. overall its a great experience ."
good,The job was great and it was a good experience to have but the team has me was very rude and disrespectful and we only work 4 hours a Day but some of the employee was great
good,"I really don't remember this job to much its been over 10 years for me and I can't really remember my experience there. The benefits were good and I remember my coworkers were nice,"
good,"if you like not talking to anybody, and doing the same task over and over then you'll enjoy it. Pay only compensates for you working part time that would equal out to working a full time for minimum wage. your only sacrifice is working a early in the mornings."
good,Solely responsible for scanning and packing trucks for FedEx. Also was responsible for sorting packages and down piling (stocking). The warehouse has you work very fast pace to get the trucks stocked and ready to go. sometimes there is way to many trucks ro fill
good,Met great people working here. Fedex had a great environment of team work. The benefits were great as a part time worker and the night hours were not too bad.
good,Steady work. Hourly pay. Not guaranteed 40 hrs but still a full time employee.   Lots of benefits.  Pay is not matching experience for older drivers who have miles under their belt.
good,"Wonderful experience I enjoyed it. I learned a lot from the experience, even though it wasn't my first time working in an evironment like that, because I had experience working at UPS"
good,"If your energetic and don't mind a busy environment, Fed Ex is the job for you. I liked this job because you know what to expect when you get to work."
good,I worked as a currier who delivers packages to residents and businesses. ok job but high turnover because of bad management. No advancement unless you apply for another position.
good,"Not happy where I'm at its a bad unorganized company. Load your own truck everyday, go around dropping off packages to people use a scanner all day at end of day clean out your truck and make sure fluids are good"
good,"ok,i only work there part-time.good people ,good benefits . treated me well I enjoyed working there. managers were nice and understanding. only was there part time I miss working there."
good,warehouse never had our packages done on time. package handlers were let out early to save money which meant drivers had to wait around longer to load up and leave.
good,"Extremely fast paced, managers dont know what  they're doing, everybody gives different orders, and are also power hungry. Good pay, but i hated it there,"
good,"A typical day at work was, well, you never knew what was going on, not even management, never knew where you would end up if you was doing your own route or someone else's route. Never knew if you could make your doctors appointment that was planned months ahead of time, or if they would change your Vacation at the last minute, even after it was planned 6 months ahead of time and your Airline Tickets were paid for. They would ask if you really need your job or not on many occasions and make you feel as your job is/was on the line, even if they did not say it directly. Management would say ""Well if you do not like it, there is other jobs out there, no one is forcing you to stay here with Fed Ex"" Many people that were there for 10 to 20 years were losing their jobs to bring in younger and cheaper labor, well, the employs felt like this, and would worry if they had a disgruntle customer and would be sent home for a week to think about how or why that customer called to complain, even if you did as you was told by management beforehand and ask what to do because you knew it was company policy, so you ask management how can I make my customer happy, management would say nothing, move on. So with that being said, after doing the job for that long Management makes the employees feel as if they do not know how to do the job, and afraid to think for themselves, afraid to lose the job they did for so long, and if the computer says you should be done at a certain time, or the time it takes from stop to stop is a minute longer then it should be you were pulled into the office and question"
good,"A lot of hard work. Would have been more enjoyable but upper management is very incompetent and plays favorites.  Benefits like healthcare, dental, and vision after 1000 hours worked."
good,"Good weekly pay and the job isn't going anywhere. Not much time at home, but working by yourself at your own pace makes the job very low stress. I work with a bunch of people who typically are able to help you out and it is a very dynamic place to be working."
good,"constantly on the go which kept the day ,moving forward. however it is hard to find places sometimes and that puts you behind. The job is stressful and can be difficult at times."
good,"My experience at Fedex proves that with hard work ,consistency,and productivity any task can be accomplished accurately.I have the great experience of meeting great people everyday .We come together to deliver and get the job done."
good,"Moved incoming freight from trailers, scanned in and put on designated trailer for delivery. Used a forklift to move freight and had to fit freight into a trailer."
good,"Bar code reading and scanning was my typical day at work."
good,"Sends out a lot of surveys in an effort to give the appearance of caring, but never makes any changes. Management does whatever they want. Benefits are good. Paid Time-Off is okay. Lots of people who do nothing while the people with visibility take on all the work and stress of actually doing the job."
good,"Working as a materials handler requires very little skill, but you do need to work quickly in order to ensure containers are able to depart/be unloaded in a timely manner for shipment/out for delivery."
good,Consistent workload great culture good management learned to be flexible work life balance was good fit.  Varied work day which was good overall enjoyable experience
good,Cant complain its a overall good job to get great experience.. in like having the experience to be able to move up in companies and fedex is one of them to be able to do different things at
good,"Fed Ex was a good company to work for however, they did not offer any benefits and at times it was not busy so I need something that has more to offer."
good,Other employees willing to help. Normal expected break time. Focus on safety procedures. Or safe lifting and moving techniques when carrying packages or pallets
good,great company with opportunities for advancement. good people depending on your department. computer programs are excellent and make the job easier. working in the elements are less than desirable depending on the dock location.
good,At FedEx you are going to work as hard as you have ever worked before. You have very little air conditiong and if you work during texas summers you will suffer.
good,"Loading the truck in the mornings before the delivering begins, trying to organize as well as possible stop by stop. Then, heading to deliver the packages on time, while making pick ups, picking up packages to take back to the hub, in a timely manner. Thankfully, you get a print out of all stops that need to be made, with which packages go to which place, even which way the route should be ran to make it easier."
good,"The hours are based on how fast you load your truck and deliver, so the hours are not set and the work load tends to fluctuate. Expect to work in any kind of weather. Must be able to spend at least 4 to 6 hours driving alone."
good,"a physically demanding job that takes a toll on your body if you do not take care of it. Other then the physicality of the job, this is a great way to get in shape."
good,Pick cases all day.  Have a percentage they go by daily on each person. Would like to do more at this job. Have breaks that help throughout the day.  The people that work there are wonderful.
good,Very little home life and those who go above and beyond have more work put on them workout an increase of pay. Just like any other big corporation I guess.
good,"同事互相幫忙, 樂意溝通, 良好運用系統,方便處理報關工作, 工作時間穩定, 生活與工作平衡, 管理層也有應員工要求作出改善"
good,Was working there in 2006. I do not remember much about the place or the work. I cannot give a review. Very big organization with lots of people and too many meetings.
good,It was a great working experience. I learned quite a bit from the people there. I would recommend working here. I will miss the people I worked with the most.
good,it is a good place to work a lot of money to be made but the dumbest thing can get you fired security in very strict for coming in on walk ins a lot of times got to work alone on week ends which was nice boss is very relaxed and understands when you need time off
good,I enjoy working there. I worked with a lot of good people. Even if I have to wake up at 6 am in the morning to make it there. But I still enjoy going there.
good,"OK place to work. Shifts are continuous and non changing. If you are scheduled to work 5am to 10 am, that will be your unchanging shift. This is good for life planning. Most people are good to work with. The jobs that are performed are not complicated. People that work with you make the jobs more complicated than they need to be at some times. not all management, but most management doesn't give their employees the time of day. you literally have to keep asking around until you find someone who is willing to answer your questions. Its seems as though fedex as a whole has some unspoken thing about giving information out that can enhance or even just answer someones questions. I personally do not understand this about the company. Their is a huge lack of communication inside this company. especially for updates inside the company with getting new programs or operating systems and the like. Also, they have many opportunities to advance, but only as a part timer. or you can move laterally. Full time is extremely hard to get. Unless someone retires or croaks, you're not getting full time. The benefits are what draws most people to stay."
good,fun place to work. really nice people. wasn't to bad physical wise. things were pretty light. didn't like the shifts for work over there though. they have a cool snack shop in the building. i really enjoyed the planes and learning about them.
good,It's an established company that gives you a job security. Its a fine job that requires physicality. Gives you good benefits and flexibility in working hours. Its good to consider as part time or full time job.
good,"FedEx was a good hardworking job, the hours weren't that great unless you've been there for years. It was very dangerous and uncleanliness work environment."
good,clock in at 6:55am take first overnight packages have to deliver them before 8am go back to the station pick up priority overnight packages deliver then before 10:30 then help who ever needs help
good,3 and 1/2  hour sorts most of the time. Except on mondays and sometimes tuesday. Short shifts good for college students or a second job. It is all about reaching goal for the day.
good,My ranking is based on Fedex Ground not Fedex Express. Overall it was ok. I wish contractors would provide health benefits and higher Daily rates for drivers as you will not work a 8 hour shift more on the lines of 10-12
good,the hours were easy and flexible to balance with personal life. although the weather would sometimes make working conditions difficult. I enjoyed working with fedex
good,"•	Utilized “hand-to-surface” methods for all package handling."
good,it is a good place to work with a few benefits. If you are a hard worker who wants a long term job this is a good company for you.Fedex also gives you a chance to move up depending on what type of job you have.
good,"Super great place, nice boss.  Lots of help provided from management and staff.  Recommended field, great place to grow and find your passion.  Lots of attention to employees of town."
good,"Work day starts around 4:30, earlier or later depending on expected flow. Shifts last around 3-3.5 hours a day, 5 days a week (6 during peak)."
good,Company had a good work ethic and appreciated all its employees equally. Advancement was there if one worked hard for it. Compensation was fair for all.
good,Depending on if you are full or part time the hours very you can stay or come in before your shift and help out other shifts to pick up more hours. they also reimburse for college
good,"The company is amazing, I choose not to speak further on or about this company for lawyer agreement reasons. Please forgive me and my management team!"
good,"plusieurs syndicats ,ambiance agréable entre collègues"
good,"Driver/Courier-Fed Ex-9/2009-5/2010-Chicago, IL "
good,"I worked for an independent contractor who owned FedEx routes, which was great but it we would always have problems dealing with FedEx's own employees who worked at the station. One day they could be very helpful while other days they would be useless and make the day feel a lot longer."
good,"	Responsible for psychical loading and unloading "
good,Started well however project have cause unreasonable work hours and resources are strained.  Too wide of a variance in skill levels causing more burden on the high performers.
good,"8 hour work day is nice.  Benefits are nice.  Opportunity to grow is nice.  Job security is so-so, but if HR is always looking for a reason to reprimand or terminate you.  Isolation from departments that you need help from, such as financials and linehaul, are very far away unless you are at a hub and it makes exceptions and disparities hard to fix.  FedEx also grades you (as an ops manager) on things like disputed deliveries, losses, late deliveries, missed pickups, missed pickup window, etc, even though all these things have nothing to do with the duties of a manager.  The time clock is set up (at least in Colorado) to punish you for taking all your hours.  If you miss a state mandated break by one minute, you can expect your senior manager, your district manager, and HR to conduct interrogations of you and threaten you with termination, so to survive here it is imperative that you don't take the hours they say you can have."
good,We would get there and clock in. Then it was busy from the time you started for 2 maybe or 4 hours. No time to talk or do anything but load and unload packages.
good,"""I have worked for FedEx for a 3 & Half year. I had no illusion that this would be an easy job going in. The work environment is very stressful, more than it needs to be. The atmosphere of disrespect comes from the top down. The job itself is simple but mangers make it difficult. The company as a whole I cannot judge because this could be unique to that location."""
good,"This is one of the project i have worked."
good,The job was tougher than I thought. But enjoyed the people there are nice and caring. The management doesn't really care about its employees and just think your a number to them
good,This was fun because you got to work part time and go to school. The work was tough but the time went by very fast and it helps keep you physical shape.
good,Work is non-stop. Everything has been changed around and it's chaos at the moment. Severely under staffed and ill equipped due to broken equipment. The people make the job enjoyable.
good,Work is non-stop.  Everything has been changed around and it's chaos at the moment.  Severely under staffed and ill equipped due to broken equipment.  The people make the job enjoyable.
good,"Not totally interactive, I mean it is a warehouse job. You clock in get ready to move your body and clock out nothing less nothing more."
good,The job is okay. I just don't like it I'll rather work somewhere else. I just feel like this job is for a man. You work 4 hours and feel like you work . I don't like it. But it's okay.
good,"My review is based on working through the peak season(Holidays)."
good,Pay and benefits were acceptable. It was a good place to work but had problems with language barriers with many members of staff. There was a variety of jobs that you could do.
good,very fast paced environment...requires a lot of multi tasking. transferring to Nashville has been the best career move.
good,We had a quota of unloading minimum of three trucks daily and a timely order. The hardest part about that job at the time was the hours being in school and  young wasn't easy. The most enjoyable part was just having my first job.
good,"Fed Ex cooperate signs contracts with Contractors who in turn hire drivers as contractors.  No benefits, no overtime flat rates. Can be terminated at will."
good,"management is good, this is a part time  job, that has good benefits, but not enough hours, the pay is good too, you work for three to four hours a night, unloaded cans and belts with packages coming from all over the world to be delivered to the customer on time and in good condition.Sometimes you might have to work in the rain, sleek, or snow, Fedex never closes. you are expected to work from the time you clock in until the time you clock out."
good,I had a few good times there... plus I still had time for my family.. I could do overtime if I wanted to without being told too...
good,"I enjoyed my time here, hours are long but they keep you busy. Little down time. Overall great place to work while I was an employee there. I also liked lunch places in the area."
good,Learned new techniques for current skills. Great team work with exllent management  support makes this a great and enjoyable place to work.
good,"It helped to pay the bills. The hours were good, the work was continuous therefore it kept me busy. They didn't micro manage, we were given a job and expected to have it done."
good,Job was fine but the immediate supervisor was unfair and vengeful.  If she didn't like you she would do things to make you quit or outright fire you for no valid reason.
good,A typical day of work is receiving the customer products and putting the in the designated areas for them to be properly ship the where the belong..
good,Well i wasn't working there that long. But i started at like 3 in the morning and got off at like 6am. So not that many hours and messed up my sleep scheduled. It seemed like what we did was never good enough they always pushed us to go faster.
good,"since this was a warehouse, it required manual labor and strength. it was mainly assembly line type productions. loading and unloading trucks, scanning and sorting packages."
good,was a fun and comfortable environment. Had amazing co worker who never let you down. Good teamwork. A lot of opportunity to grow and expand in the company.
good,I loved working there. I loved it most when i had to offload the trucks to show how strong i was not just strength but skill...If i didn't move back to NYC i would of still been working there..
good,made pickup and deliveries through out dallas ft worth area.  very nice customers.  co-workers all worked together to ensure the day went good for us all
good,Its a self sufficient job. Its hard work and dedication. What you put into it you will get back out of it. Computer experience is a plus. Its a great company and you get to meet someone new everyday.
good,I was a scanner receiving the packages from a machine moving fast pace and communicating scanning amazon online store packaging it was a part time job
good,A typical work day is around 10-12 hours. I have learned more about customs and the FDA rules and regulations. The most enjoyable part is the coworkers.
good,"good for second job, you can move into driving that can give you more hours. The job will work around your schedule if you go to school or have another job."
good,"Nights at FedEx were regular, nothing really to overwhelming. Things would go smooth depending on who your manager was.Sometimes you'd get burnt (when a lot of boxes come down the shoot at one time and you can't do the truck by yourself.)"
good,"I learned a lot while working here. Communication with your team is key. We could not get anything done unless we all worked together. It helped me build my teamwork skills, communication and multi tasking skills."
good,The job has early shifts.  The job can be stressful sometimes by the load of work that comes in.  The customers can be over whelming at times about there product.
good,"Great company to work for."
good,A typical day at work for me is just being able to have somebody to work with.I learned new skills such as packing and stacking boxes. My co-workers was very nice an easy to get along with.i never had a hard part to my job i found that positions i worked was very well taught.
good,"Depart & arrive aircrafts and trucks."

good,Questions in advancement opportunities in Ground Operatins and other departments of FedEx. Opportunities in the Ground Operatons area of FedEx are limited. Communication from Supervisors to workers is limited. Supervisors are good at placing workers with different skill levels in different job positions.
good,Its a what you see is what you get job as everything is self explanatory. We simply handle packages day in and day out. Not exactly fun work but you stay busy as you are constantly moving around picking up an array of object ranging from light to heavy.
good,management was decent to work with. I learned about handling of freight and freight industry. hardest part was leaning how to drive a forklift. working with the other dockworkers was the most enjoyable part of the job

good,For me it was ok but I couldn't advance within the company. I knew every position there so I became a valuable floater. If i was able to become a supervisor I would of never left
good,"The Dock is very cold"
good,"A typical day unfolds identically as the last. As a package handler your only objective is to load a truck using an effective method. For five hours at the least you may only break to sip provided water or Gatorade before going right back to work. This job is not for those with a poor work ethic, back problems or sensitivity to heat or exhaustion."

good,My FedEx experience was hard work but quite worth it. The times also fit perfect with my schedule. The work was fast pace and it was easy to keep a rhythm with the boxes on the conveyor belt.
good,"Part-time package handler usually work pre-shift between 3am to 9am, 5 days a week Tuesday through Saturday. Sorting packages to designated routes according to route number and section. Loading Sorting and Unloading are typical functions of package handler with an occasional quality control and QA assistance."
good,Team work hard work and good communication have to be able to move fast and not have any back problems nor should you have any knee problems for this job
good,"Working at Fedex Office taught me to learn even better organizational skills and how to be in a management position.  With the position that I was given, I seen how different it can be to be on the the other side of the business world as far as being in charge and having to make decisions based on other obstacles and issues compared to how I would have to make decisions when being a regular team member."
good,"loved the team work used on the dock in order to get everything done on time in a single work day. i built some long term friendships while working with others on the dock. Some supervisors even look out for your job security, if your performance is being noticed you will be rewarded."
good,"hard working, good pay. "
good,"Recruiter lied saying the contract was for 12-months...ended up being just under 3-months.  Had to deal with corporate to get the company to buy the apartment lease I signed."

good,"Long hours, a lot of driving."
good,a typical day @ work loading and unloading trailers on daily reassuring packages were delivered on time and working side by side with coworkers assisting the managers
good,"I learned a lot in FedEx how to loading and unloading truck, the co-workers are easy to understands and form part of the team work. Management is not good, I think that they have to be more prepare when they distribute the group and also when they give people information in the meeting."
good,"I liked working for fedex, but after awhile, 5 years to be exact, you start feeling the effects it has on your body. The constant bending down and picking up heavy boxes takes its toll."

good,Fedex is a good job gets better beyond entry level and greater with a certificate or more experience. overall a god place to work once you start moving up

good,"FedEx Tech Connect was a great place to work, a typical work day included completing 8 units a day or more, longing parts into a computer. I learned ALOT of troubleshooting skills, Management wasn't so great, its like you don't even have a manager, never walks the floor to check on worker, never is able to talk to him about things going on in the work place because hes never around. People are very nice. Nothing hard about the job at all. The hours are great 6am- 2:30pm. EVERYDAY. Overtime is offered. WEEKENDS and HOLIDAYS off!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

good,"We learn to operate different machines."
good,"- Det svåraste var att köra ut paket när det inte fanns någon AC."
good,I didn't like just part time work and it was not any available full time work that you could do in the department. a typical work day was very difficult in there was not a set of assign work you had first come first serve for the best jobs and women would not want to load the trucks.
good,It was very hot inside the warehouse and very bus which made it shockingly easy to dehydrate. Other than that the work was buy and the pay was good.
good,"Cold in the winter, and hot in the summer.  Great place to work while in college.  Pays great for a part time job.  Driving a forklift is fun."
good,"i am working with fedex more  then 05 years  in between i got a good  knowledge about work but i am not satisfy with my salary .  i have many time to try move to other department but as usual  i have no any god father  that""s  why  i am not selected . management is not good but company is great place to work ."
good,I loving working my current job. I like the people and my customers.  I love researching and using different system to gather information. I enjoy the work.
good,"Sorted different packages, prepared pallet for wrapping and shipping packages. Packages was weighed and separated by size and placed on a shipping pallet."
good,hard work with teams and help wrap on boxes and order of number and letter on parcel. Have to stand all the time and Boss like to keep you if you hard work.
good,"I will clock in using my id 5 minutes early so we could do stretches. After my stretches we were told how much packages to expect and how much there could be more. We would then proceed to our workstations and then begin our assigned task. for loaders and unloaders we will help others when our stations were slow. the management was always out on the floor making sure we were being productive yet safe. I learned how to efficiently and quickly load a trailer. The hardest part was there was no set end time and each outbound trailer varied on how much it gets. Most enjoyable was that it fit my lifestyle, I am a night time person and enjoy night time shifts."
good,I did learn how to load and unload trailers. The management were very helpful and did assist with training and was a good learning experience. Coworkers did assist when needed
good,"Driving forklift in shipping and receiving areas "
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was my drive into work as I ponder how to provide exceptional customers satisfaction and delivering the purple promise to customers.
good,this is a great transition job. This  job is perfect for college students. The  best part about FedEx is the company 401k match program.

good,"Late night shifts"

good,It was okay my work was okay the hours was okay the breaks was okay time off was okay my job duties was okay.
good,"not enough hours. employees were highly intimidated and scared of management. Managers do tend to be a little abusive in the sense that they will load you with more work if you actually try to do your job, while everyone else just plays dumb and does nothing."
good,"This is a great company to work for. If you are looking for a fast pace working company, this is the place for you. also a great company to make into a career."

good,"great place for someone looking for flexible hours and weekly pay. NOT a place I'd consider working long term."
good,"I Loved this company but there is no lunch breaks. Two breaks for full-time and part-time. Very physical, good workout constantly."
good,you can learn alot from this Job you can grow if you really want to grow inside the company and thier are good people that can help you
good,"It was very busy and fast paced, and there was plenty of work to do. The managers there were very lazy and rarely wanted to help when needed."

good,"typical package handling job. you know what your getting into. Hard work, alright pay nothing crazy. they have a good idea of making employees happy."
good,"You work day in and day out especially if youre an over night person. Its a great job if you dont want a break necessarily. I hated the job. There were a bunch of lazy people, took advantage of me because Im a great worker and had me working over time all the time saying that I HAD TO DO IT."
good,"Not a nice place so far, people get stubed in the back all the time. Only nice to you when talking to you. always very busy but don't own much respect from the manager at all."
good,It was really good at first I was working numerous hours making decent money. Then all the sudden my hours were dropped and I and medical was cheap but the deductible was very high.
good,"The work was hard, the hours were bad, the pay was not good, and most of the people hated each other.  The team I worked with was a good one, but there was no way to support myself and my wife on what I made"
good,"All I heard from people outside of fedex  once hired was how great a company it was to work for.  ""Great benefits!""  After reading many of these reviews I had to put mine out there.   "
good,The environment was very professional. Job required working a sixty plus hours to achieve corporate objectives. Very poor work family balance. Would advise a single parent to reconsider unless you have a  strong family support - long hours will be the norm.
good,If you like to work hard and get good pay this would be the place. Great benefits friendly co-workers friendly managers.
good,"Empresa possui ótimo ambiente de trabalho com funcionários respeitosos, o local e infraestrutura ideal para o desenvolvimento das atividades e ótimo trato com os gestores. Porém, deixa a desejar no que tange crescimento profissional e isto que levou-me a conduzir o preenchimento do meu currículo no indeed."
good,"Work hard play less get more done. I learned that less is better than more in many situations. Management is not always fair, but can be a challenging position for the one who hold the position. Most my co-workers are not always as reliable as I am. You can rely on me always. I will do whatever it takes to get the job done. The hardest part of the job is trying to understand and maintain peace on the job, you are not always gonna see eye to eye with staff. However, one of the most important things i have learned, is how to compromise and remain humble. The most enjoyable part of the job is accomplishing my job tasks"
good,"working for fedex is alright. it is busy and you constantly have work. one thing I don't like is the fact that they can't keep any employees. plus, you don't get a lot of hours unless you work morning and afternoon. also the way they load trucks hurts your back a lot."
good,"My daily experience at FedEx was a mix of teamwork, manual labor being able to fill out paper work, being computer literate, and learning how to operate vehicles that aid in daily operations ex..(tug). I learned how to cooperate with others in order to get the job done. I learned that only through the average workers hard work and sacrifice can a company/corporation be productive and competitive. I was got a long with co workers and are good with friends with a lot of them to this day. The hardest part of my job was definitely the physically strain it put on my body. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing I had benefits and that I was bringing in a weekly income."
good,"I learned how to manage my time in order to complete tasks ahead of me. As a package handler at FedEx, we were to scan items into trucks in order to be shipped out to customers. The fast paced environment allowed for quick decision making as well as proper planning to fill all spaces in the trucks. Management allowed for you to swap in and out of trucks to help other employers as needed. The co-workers and I got along very well, in a few short days I was able to make lasting friendships. The hardest part of employment at FedEx was getting in and out of the trucks due to overflowing packages, that come down the lanes. However, it wasn't always bad sometimes the negatives you face in a day, were being isolated in a truck by yourself. The thing I liked most at FedEx were the people. Everyday was a great day to be with my fellow workers who had the same morale and determination I had to continue through the process. FedEx also offered free tuition for college students trying to better themselves like I am."
good,"A typical work day is riding in a car all day delivering packages "
good,It was a good place to work.Except for the weather.Iprobably would still be the there if I had gotten more hours.I would go back for more working hours.
good,"Fedex has great benefits, but working in inclement weather was pretty rough. You don't work long hours . What I didn't like was that you didn't have a set time to come in and get off from work."
good,Being part of how milk is bottled and sent out to different locations was a learning experience. Having to load milk products into trailers or unload trailers was a fun experience.
good,"I enjoy this Job But need something Better, Work is very up and down and there are to many people running it and different rules every day"
good,"I enjoyed being out and about with this company. Very physical job. If you do your job they pretty much leave you alone, until they need to add more stops to your route."
good,Great company to work for but hours are not long enough.  Also there is not alot of room for advancement.  Also not alot of room for education due to poor tuition reimbursement.
good,"pas d opportunités de développement,journée de travail normale"
good,"good learning experience, good benefits. I loved working at fedex. I gained  an awesome skill that requires me to drive an tugger."

good,"My work day starts with reading my emails then moving on to reviewing reports for the prior days’ operation to see if we meet are goals. While doing this I am also checking in both home and ground delivery drivers. I love my coworkers, we all split up the work load if someone takes off or is sick without being asked to. "
good,"Not bad place too work. There is a little problem with communication between management and employee's. It is part time work, and is not hard work."

good,I worked for Fedex for over twenty years.  There are many opportunities for growth and continued training.  The uniforms are purple and orange so if you are picky about the colors you wear you may want to look elsewhere.
good,"Typical day strenuous load/unload parcel"
good,"Working for a contractor through Fedex freight.  My contractor boss was by far the best boss I have ever worked for.  Fedex did not like her straight forward attitude.  She wasn't a ""yes man"".  They eliminated my possition as a result after almost 4 years.  "
good,"Fedex would be a good job for someone who already has a fulltime job and would like some money on the side. If you have a problem showing up to work on time, don't wast your time by applying."
good,"delivering on the purple promise"
good,"Fedex is a awesome place to work, great people, culture, and work schedules. The most enjoyable part is knowing that i get to help people in what i do."
good,"A day at Fedex was just like a regular day for me. Not much of challenge except around winter season. I learned lots of safety tips and what it all took to work as a package handler. Management was strike and always on top of their game. I loved all of my co-workers they were very generous and helpful. Only hard part here was trying not freeze to death. I enjoyed the laughter, free lunches, and weekends off."
good,8 hour days. Learned how to construct a pole barn from ground up. Great experience on how and why things are done in the construction field.
good,enjoyed the pace and the relations with the customers on my delivery route. wasn't there long enough to make a full assessment of the workplace or workforce
good,Start work at 7am usually get off around 5:30pm. Good pay but no benefits provided because you work for a contractor. Your paid weekly either Thursday or Friday it depends on the contractor that you work for.
good,Every day is pretty much the same. There are different types of leads us sales reps call. most leads are linked to accounts so we can enter in the call notes and what we were able to do regarding any sort of issues they were having with their shipping account. I've learned that even professional business owners can be unprofessional at times. I have also learned that all it takes is some time and a bit of an understanding voice to get passed the unprofessionalism. management is a bit distant. Co-workers although they can be a bit loud while I'm pitching a solution to a customer they are all desirable people. The hardest part of the job is when we get  sale that is out of our threshold so we send the lead off to what called an AE to give them the sale. The productivity during normal business hours is the most enjoyable. Fastest time of the whole day. When I'm busy making calls helping small businesses save any type of resources they can while using our service.
good,"chauffeur-livreur dans l'arrière pays grassois,le contact avec les gens"

good,I didn't dislike my time at FedEx nor did I particularly find it thrilling either.  It was an ok experience if you were able to deal with the fast pace and the heat.
good,Employees feel unappreciated although there is job security. During peak season you are sometimes expected to work a 10 hour day with a 20 minute break
good,Everyday is the same. The work there is easy. All you have to do is just pay attention. Payroll is awesome. Benefits are amazing. A few people are nice by the way.

good,"Start off unloading the trucks , go tot he top of the towers to start sorting the boxes to go to the right belt, and than go down to the bottom and load the trucks for in town delivery. The management was very fair and had equal growth opportunities.The co-workers were very fun and down to earth. The hardest part of the job was the first couple days getting the hang of everything. the most enjoyable part was we would be getting off when everyone is just going to work and that gave us a chance to work two jobs.."
good,"Inventory control, cycle counting. worked as a fill in warehouse supervisor. The dock was busy loading 18 - 20 trucks a day for delivery. A typical day we would unload 10-15 trucks."
good,FedEx is a productive and safe place to work for. Its completive place and very steady environment.my co-workers are very laid back. The hardest thing about working at FedEx is when freight arrives without the manifest attach to the freight.

good,"Provide High-Quality Service To The Public"
good,Excellent Fortune 500 company.  Took entry level job trying to get to Human Resources.  Worked in Customer Service and the job was stressful but the people I worked with made it easier.
good,"Its a good company is you want some extra holiday money, but if your looking for a career i would look else where. If your a hard worker you will fit right in. Hours can be fickle especial during the slow season. you could be scheduled for 40 hours a week but could only get 30-35. if you were looking to move up from the 11-12 dollar an hour range be prepared to work there for a few years."
good,"The management was uncaring, unprofessional, and only looked out for themselves. A lot of times they would send a lot of the people who worked there home when it was slow at the office. A lot of us wouldn't receive hours. They had  their favorite who they gave hours too and the rest they would send home. It was a call center and sometimes we had a lot of surveys that needed to be completed but instead of  allowing everyone to help out, they would often choose a few of their favorite people to stay and help. They would send the rest of us  home if it wasn't a lot of work to be done for that day."
good,The job was easy but the hours was part time. They work you hard for a small check. I like that I got paid every week even tho it was not much.
good,The starting pay and set raises are nice but overall you get next to zero chances to advance and will have your starting job for years.

good,fedex was a waist of time I got the job they never even gave me a chance they put me to load and unload three trucks at the same time. now maybe if I had a couple months into the job fine but as soon as u get the job and then u fire me over scanning when im loading three trucks there not organized enough in don't have enough employees
good,Fedex is a good company to work for because they look after their employees and put their safety first.  The hours of their opperations are difficult to adjust to.

Compared to other shipping companies, FedEx falls short including benefits. Physically demanding job experience with injury risks every single day."
good,"good salary, good benefits, but schedule can be a pain for part timers"
good,The job I do at FedEx is a very physical job. It requires strength and endurance. the workers are mostly friendly and will help when needed
good,Its great its just that they provide enough hours. The management was terrible. Co-workers were cool but most of time selfish.
good,Salaried employees are not treated that well.  On the employee annual survey if the region did not score as high as they liked management held a meeting on a weekend until they got the marks they wanted.
good,"There was a lot to learn at this company, and I believe that the management and other co-works helped me in this department. In my short stay at this company I learned a great deal of how it worked in a few different areas of the building."
good,Fast paced environment. Scan and load and unload containers with supervision of Team Leader. Meet scan and load goal of 6 packages a minute. NO CONCERN for your safe. All about the numbers.
good,Long working days and far distances to drive. I was just a temporary driver so not officially apart of the company. Was hired through a temporary service. Other people packed my truck and I learned alot about the area.
good,"Typical warehouse work. Nothing horrible people were nice, management listened and were fast to help. Just got to be alright with doing the same thing everyday unloading/loading trucks."
good,"I enjoyed my work.  It was fast-paced and shift went quickly.  It was hard work.  Would have preferred a full-time, regular schedule."
good,FedEx was an enjoyable experience. I feel it is a little strenuous trying to drive and meet eta in a new area.Management was fair.Co workers were a joy and helpful. The hardest part was learning the area in a time constraint. Enjoyable was meeting the customers.
good,"FedEx has giving me a lot of experience, I have learned a lot when dealing with a diverse group of people and ive learned how to be a leader."
good,"job title was a loader, had a set of 4 trucks with 600 - 800 pieces of mail daily. Learned how to communicate with a diverse amount of people. Best part of the job was working next to people for an extended amount of time and learned from each other how to work together as a team."
good,Loading trucks with packages big and small. It was loud demanding and never a slow moment for you were always moving. Definitely not a career but a good way to get quick mone
good,A typical day at Fedex was Coming into Work and being Greeted by Everyone. We Would have Motivational Meetings Everyday before work by our Supervisors. I learned about teamwork and Leadership. Management was friendly and respectful and always aware of their employees. My Coworkers were great to be around with they would help make work environment fun but yet very helpful. the hardest part of work was the Climate in the Warehouse and the short hours of work.
good,I enjoyed working at fedex. I meet a lot of people and i learned some new things. I got along with lot of people and managers because of my outgoing personality.
good,"AT times appeared to be extension of a playground , lacking structure , focus and discipline.  this is not to say that everyone behaved in this manor and should not take away from those hard working team members who did care about their task."
good,"Loading and unloading packages onto truck carefully. The hardest job was loading, unloading wasn't as bad. The staff was welcoming and very helpful."
good,Federal Express Home Delivery does not have benefits and they do not pay on a hourly basis.  I like driving but I am looking for a company that pay by the hour and has set hours.  Federal Express Home Delivery pay by the packages that you take out of the office.
good,"I would make sure the manning was set everyday, I learned how to manage all different types of people, we had 22 different languages while I worked with Fedex Smartpost. Hardest part of my job would be to translate how to perform the job if an non speaking english employee would come in. A lot of hands-on during my time with FedEx.  "
good,Many challenges to pursue if one is looking for them. The work load is very heavy and support for your effort feels slim. Growth is possible with extreme increases to work load and management varies among different groups. Working along mid size teams of 10 to 15 makes the high pressure more enjoyable by interacting with one another.
good,more of a place for college students not great hours and not a place i would want anyone that i love to work at. you work in heat all day for very little pay for what you do and there always pushing you to go faster
good,Being package handler at Fed Ex is very physical and mental.. I have learn how to lift and use computer for bar codes replace and other things. Very difficult job.
good,"Working as a Operations Manager was a career I truly enjoyed! I loved the daily challenges and overall duties that were required. In fact, I planned on retiring at FedEx. However, my manager had a personal problem with me being transgender and and ended my career because of it. I have so much to offer my next company! I am very dependable and work very well with others. I love to give my best in everything I do and will be a great asset in my new career."
good,"they give you not hard work but not easy too the boxes and conditons are still good compared to other companies with bad air flow you don't have as much machines running, also they were good employees when  i was there"
good,A typical day at FedEx is back to back calls . Every calls allows you to display excellent customer service to even the calls you receive in the most irate manner.
good,"At FedEx, I have moved trailers around the yard and to/from dock doors, loaded and unloaded trailers, and moved large, bulky, and heavy packages along conveyor belts. I have operated radio frequency scanners and primters, This is very fast paced work with little time to rest during the shift. I am not sure that management is in touch with the day to day operations throughout the facility, but instead rely on the ""on paper"" outlook. I enjoy working with people of many different backgrounds, and get along well. The hardest part of this job the lack of a teamwork environment, but I most enjoy feeling that I am doing my part to serve our customers well."
good,"This company  is a good place to work. The pay is good, good benefits, and good human resources. There is room to move around if you want to or stay put."
good,a typical work day starts with loading your truck. organizing your packages to make sure of the route efficiency to ensure on time delivery
good,very exhausting job. you will be worked if your are in the trucks loading or unloading. But decent attendance policy so if you miss a day its not that bad.
good,Fed Ex is an okay organization a typical day would involve clocking in taking my place on the line and begin being productive. It is a nice environment the employers are very friendly and helpful. The only problem is their organizational tactics involving temporary workers. Some workers travel long distances and depending on the openings available will determine if they work for that day. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing what we as a team have accomplished during the shift.
good,Loading and unloading trucks all night without breaks. Management was constantly moving around making sure everyone was doing there fair share of work. Co workers was easy going and always willing to help you when you need it
good,"great demand at ""peak"" work 6 days sometimes 10 or 11 hours. Great staff, but every bldg is different depending on upper management."
good,"Spacious environment where workers can move freely around without obstruction. For any business to succeed there should be a team work. I am a team player, and my contributions are always beneficial to members of the team."
good,"A great place to learn operations, and build up your management skills, Value the ability to grown with the company as a manager and a leader."
good,drove at night but there was no time hardly for family and there is no benefits or insurance trying to find something during the day so I can be home in the evenings with family.
good,"Picking/palletizing orders to be shipped; "
good,A great entry level position for any young applicant looking to enter the workforce. The hours are very flexible as they provide five different shifts to choose from.
good,"Very fast paced work environment. I learned my way around several areas of houston while driving with fedex. The hardest part of the job is making sure all deliveries are made on time, regardless of traffic."
good,You are expected to do what you are assigned. Working conditions can be very harsh. The company does not follow OSHA guidelines.
good,"they don't care about people's well being. the job is easy though, mindless physical labor. rarely hire from within anymore."
good,"loading and unloading freight making split second decisions on where to put something so weight was evenly distributed and others could easily load their freight. most of the supervisors were good, but there were some who were very mean and rude."
good,"I enjoy my job at FedEx as a Truck Control agent. My typical day consists of me entering routes into the system, filing trucking sheets and making sure all routes are departed in the system."
good,"An average day is sorting through 500-800 pieces of hazardous materials and packages. I am either making all of the sort lists on the computer or am sorting the packages physically and building and tieing down a ULD. Organization and attention to detail is very important, misloading and type of dangerous goods can affect the flight and can result in a fine and even termination due to the seriosness of the packages. I enjoy the people and the team that I work with. Myself and two other people from my team have created the new norm of sorting and checking of all hazardous material that we receive. We receive some of the most hazardous material in the whole country through FedEx, we also have one of the best compliance reports for the company. The hardest part of the job is making sure that all of the hazardous material is accounted for because of the high volume we receive. My coworkers and myself work very well together and do a very good job of making sure that we don't lose or misplace any of the dangerous goods we get. I learned that without my team there would be noway that I could accomplish what we do and have such a high percentage or completion. I enjoy the challenge is presents me everyday because no day is the same and making sure the incompatibles are separated by at least 3 feet and always making sure that each package is in the correct spot and ULD. I take pride in doing my job and pride in being part of creating a new system of sorting that now the whole company is now trying to emulate. I also take pride in that I make very few mistakes and that my attention to"
good,"Working at Fedex has been good for me and my family but it has come time to part ways. It ,in my opinion, is no longer a people company but a company that is strictly motivated by the almighty dollar. Even though upper management is correct in its assessment of how to reach its financial goals I am not willing to sacrifice time with my family. Your job is secure here as long as you do your job but pay raises are minimal and bonuses are weak. Overall my first 18 years here were wonderful but the last 4 years I have been wondering what company I work for."
good,"You will be unloading, loading or sorting packages all night or day. Some managers are fair some are not. You have to deal with a lot of different personalities. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the extreme heat ant extreme cold."
good,Fedex is also a great company to work for. Many different departments to choose from. I personally worked inside the hub. I started as a material handler and then finished my last few years as a team leader. I loved my job and willing to go back.
good,I haven't worked for them for very long. They give out free food once in a while which is great. It gets hot in the warehouse in the summer. The managers are easy to talk to.
good,"Working at FedEx was really hard work. There was no playing involved. I began my day first with a good night sleep. Getting rest is the most important way to prepare for a day of work at FedEx. Next you must be prepared to exercise, sweat, and move your body. The management team was there to help as much as they could but mostly the work was all your to handle."
good,"I was an intern so it was good for me... not many restrictions from the company."
good,"Pick up and deliver packages to commercial and residential areas, while following detailed instructions being that same day city is priority shipping services."
good,"I've worked here for almost 6 years.  Working at fedex you have to work in all the elements of weather which can get frustrating sometimes.  Other than that this jobs provides you with job security, overtime hours, and great benefits!"
good,A typical day at the job delivering  packages to customers homes. I learned how to deliver customer packages in a orderly fashion. My co-worker/ Driver was a good person to work with. The hardest part of the was making sure I scanned all package.
good,FedEx is very competitive but they pay very well for it. They need to provide more training to the sales staff before they change to commission.
good,Fedex is a great place to work for. as a young male. Teaches work ethics and how to perform under a performance review system.
good,"Spread sheets for management,"
good,"The was a good company to work for in the beginning.  Later is was more like they did not care about the employee, at least in the department that I worked in."
good,Hard working family orginated strong leadership friendly atmosphere I gave my all towards them because they stood by me
good,Small entity with little room for advancement. Day to day activities were the same day in and day. Individuals not able to expand on knowledge or learn new skills
good,At Fedex is a fast past job i learned how to run equipment and be a leader and management was ok and so is the people. the hardest part of the job is getting the product out on time.
good,"Need to compensate between work and employee."
good,get in and do your expected work and you will be fine. i easily adopted to the pace of stacking and unpacking boxes. i didnt need any help with completing my duties. the hard parts are being overstocked in your station.
good,"just moving boxes and packages to the cages as an package handler.The pay could be better and higher, and to have more hours and set shifts."
good,"I did enjoy the long hours during the holidays, because of my check but I did not like they unset schedules. The working conditions are not the best but bearable."
good,it was a ok job for people who just graduate high school or people who are in college and who needs a stress free job. they showed good employee appreciation and the promoted from with-in. they also gave out awards to employees
good,"Its not a bad place to work, i just personally dont like the night hours. Great benefits and decent part time pay. Its a dirty job though, wouldnt recommend it if youre the not into that."
good,"Good pay, benefits have been better. Work can be very laborious, especially in the summer heat. Working outdoors is nice but if you don't like being in the extreme heat or extreme cold it's not for you."
good,"very busy "
good,"Come in and load/unload trucks. Hardest part was being in extremem heat or cold. Learned how to work hard and fast and teamwork. Even though we didnt need to help others, we all had the choice to and I did to hep others with their work"
good,This job is very hard. You will not have a set check because you get paid by the box. This means depending on how many packages you may have will determine your weekly check. Benefits are not a factor however employer will assist in serious accidents.
good,Load and unload the trucks and  scan packages to specific route.  would have to keep up with the pace making it physical work  but we stayed busy the day was done before you knew it.
good,"A pretty good place to work, cool co workers made the job much easier and the hardest part was overflow of product. Managers and other supervisors were easy to get along with."
good,Delegate dock employee work assignments to meet work performance standards. Motivate employees on productivity and reward and recognize employees accomplishments. Conduct performance reviews both negative and positive performance. Ensure trailer space is maximized without damaging packages through load quality checks.
good,Hard Work for mediocre pay.  Working with Corporate and Independant Contractors is a constant battle.  Salary is negotiable between each contractor.  Be wary of who you agree to work with.
good,"Working at FedEx can be stressful at times, but as a hard worker its something I have to accept in my everyday life. I've learned a lot from FedEx that Id wish to carry on to another company."
good,It was tough labor. Very exhausting with minimal time to rest and only few hours given to part-timers. Co-workers actually make this job enjoyable.
good,"Le travail se fait en équipe et tout le monde est bien coordonné et impliqué. Je portais des charges lourdes dans mon poste, mais voir mon employeur être satisfait de mon travail me motivais encore plus."
good,"loading and unloading of customers purchases"
good,"A very fast pace working environment, with a lot of work to accomplish in a short matter of time. There are no 15min+ breaks within your shift, unless you're full-time. Also sometimes when your shift is over, Managers will not let you leave until every truck chute is cleaned down in your area. There were times, when I was assigned to load up two trucks by myself, with no help (which was very irritating). Overall the co-workers were very friendly and cool, and the weekly paychecks were good."
good,A typical work day is working early hours while using organization precision.I've learned how to be responsible while working early hours in the morning. Management and co-workers are great to work with. The most enjoyable part of this position is work and interacting with other co-workers.
good,"Loading and unloading every package assign to truck. I learned to pace myself and to help others when in need. Management is ok, but can have better communication skills with employees. Co-workers help the day go by fast by helping out when in need. The hardest part was knowing that I was only going to work less than 3.5 hours a day. The most enjoyable part was being recognized for being productive employees."
good,Good place to work but hard to get a full time position within the operations side of things. Good if you're looking for a part time job.
good,"Great pay and benefits, work culture not much to be desired..."
good,"Basically unload and load truck trailers at certain rate per hour. there was always a constant need for improvement. The hours were mediocre , and I was given a great opportunity at such a young age."
good,good starter job thats all i can say pay is competitive with small companys around our area great learning experience all the time have some kind of training or policy improvements
good,Warehouse Associate. Basically picking packages all day. part time was about five hours. Staff are very cooperative with assisting you with orders.
good,"Real easy job, easy to learn and everyone helps out. The managers are always around and always willing to help with anything."
good,FedEx is a great company. However be prepared to work a lot of hours. If you become a full-time employee you can expect to work at least 12 hours a day.
good,"The work can be physically demanding to the point of being grueling. The educational benefits are excellent, but few employees seem to take advantage of them. Employees who are injured should expect to be blamed for their injuries and thrown out like last week's garbage."
good,"As a courier you will pick up and deliver packages along your route which may encompass multiple towns. I had no trouble maneuvering in my local area but when required to go to areas I was not familiar with that was a different story. GPS and cell phones are not permitted ( vehicles actually have plugs to charge with removed or disabled so when your battery dies so do you)"
good,"Solid company for creating friends and getting back into shape. The company is truly committed to making every customer's experience outstanding. Financial responsible and holds itself accountable for results. Ideal corporation from an academic standpoint. Investors should feel highly secure in their investments . Highly diversified portfolio with the Ground, Express, Freight, and Office segments. Has become economy proof."
good,Fees like you are tied to your desk with no wiggle room to do anything else.  Not enough compensation for the drama that you go through on an everyday basis.
good,"Good place to work. Good management team. "
good,"This post was a very involved and tedious place to work, that test all my skills at getting trucks in and out quickly and with the correct paperwork"
good,When I Was Working There I Wait For The Package To Come Off The Assembly Line And Scan Package . Hardest Part Of The Job Is When The Package Come At A Fast Pace.
good,"Fedex Ground is a very productive employer. They have a great deal of work to do every day, and as an employee you are expected to work in a fast paced work environment with out direct supervision."
good,I start work at 5 am and have to route out my deliveries. I then have to load my van according to how I am going to do it. My day is long and very physical and can be very stressful. By the end of the week I am pretty much knackered. Not a lot of backup from management but the other drivers are all friendly.
good,Really easy job. The work here was repetitive. Employees here were helpful. I really enjoyed packing up the shipping trucks.
good,I have worked here for almost 5 years and it has done a lot for me. Not only financially but as a person as well. Im just ready to move on and start a career with something I actually enjoy.
good,"FedEx smart post is a good place to work, the management team on all shifts is great. everyone works together as a team. The company does offer benefits after working 1000 hours. it is only part time"
good,I worked on the dock moving package on the belt lines to fill the truck to go out for delivery if there was an issue with a package as in damage or bad address they were brought to me and I would inspect the package and make the correction to get this package to the customer
good,Information Technology group is highly advanced and always ready to bring new tools and technologies for implementation.
good,"i did receive my license to operate the machines. managers didn't really manage, they were more of friends then managers. the job wasn't really that difficult just boring and repetitive."
good,Work was hard but a very good experience for any driver. Boost any drivers mental power to a whole different level then when previously applied due to harsh working conditions.
good,"No appreciation.  Long hours and very poor management. Enjoyed the tractor trailer driving and the customers."
good,"Many job opportunities and can move to different department quickly. This company is located globally, so if you wanted to move you could possibly transfer elsewhere."
good,Very team oriented environment. Strong team work stills are a plus. Basic knowledge of warehouse protocol would be a major asset to a future applicant.
good,"I learnt a great deal on this job, department provided good training opportunities."
good,"It's a good job and good people, management can be demanding at time. You do same task everyday and if a co-worker misses a day you are required to do their task. Hours are rough, but perfect hours so you can get a side job. Not that many hours, 20-27 hours a week, unless you are full time which the only way to can more hours is to suck up to management. Management tends to favor certain employees, so if your boss doesn't like you, you most likely will not enjoy working for them."
good,"- A typical day was handling and shipping packages"
good,It was an easy job most of the time. the worst part of this job was the pay. It would take 4 years to make a 1.00 raise. could not provide for my family with that.
good,"Typical day at work,I would go in at 2 in the morning and load vans for the drivers, so they could go out in the mornings to make deliveries."
good,very difficult at times. gets very hot in the summer and very cold in the winter. packages are usually not to heavy but there is some trailers that have 80-110 lb packages that not everyone can handle by themselves.
good,as a full time package handler i would usually get there a hour before the shift started and do all the prep work before the shift started. After the shift was wrapping up i would send people home and wrap everything up and make sure every box in my work area was getting on to a truck or going some place else like damages or QA.
good,we were treated horribly lack of hours i just could not take it anymore bad communication bad atmosphere injuries that could be avoided easily .
good,"it was okay i didn't like it as much because it was a far of a drive plus it was labor job"
good,Good place to work with great benefits. There is always room for development. The hrs are pretty good and the work environment is very easy depending on your skills. Everything is based on production and team building for all employees.
good,The environment is not very friendly. The management don't show compassion toward employees and the work load is extremely hard.. I did learn a great deal about material processing.
good,"Hard work in warehouse, no breaks and pay is low considering the pace and difficulty. Good, friendly, helpful co-workers. Supervisor was"
good,ok type job I enjoyed the people as a team but didn't like the hours all that well. Some of the people in management were not very nice they didn't want you to grow in the company.
good,fedex is a tiring place and but will help you lose weight. I do not think there was an enjoyable part at this job but the hardest was adjusting to the weather
good,"It's fast-paced position that involves continual lifting, lowering and sliding packages that typically weigh 25 - 35 lbs. and may weigh up to 70 lbs."
good,"Being a FedEx package handler is ideal for someone who is looking for a second job or a student. A job where you can come work for a few hours then go home. Unfortunately, most of the employees there are neither of those. A large group depend on that as their sole source of income. With that being mentioned, there are opportunities to become full-time or be promoted to a higher position. The main problem is how they go about doing that. There is an obvious display of nepotism. Someone that has only done one thing for 5 years will be promoted to a trainer. Then they'll be someone who has down a variety of things: package handle, load and unload trucks, re-assign routes, amongst other things. They won't get promoted. They work is also not balanced. When you speak to the managers you are either nonchalantly brushed off or assured of something that won't happen. It isn't all bad though, there are plenty of good benefits that the job provides after a certain period of working there."
good,"The work is not terribly difficult, and unless you have late pickups you are finished as soon as you get done delivering."
good,"Very exciting place to work, I enjoy driving and doing my job. Customers were wonderful. The hardest part of job is traffic. The most enjoyable part of the job is my customers."
good,"Managers are understanding, but know how to keep things in line. One or two can push a little too hard, but, on the whole, they were very easy to work to with. Work is very demanding, but everyone is pretty willing to help as long as you pull your weight. People seem to get close very fast, at least in the part of the warehouse I worked in. They pay at a fair rate, but the hours are short enough that the good pay rate almost doesn't matter, most of my paycheck went toward gas. This job is only for you if you work close to the warehouse or you can convince them to give you longer hours or work double shifts."
good,"Manage team and customer service experience"
good,"I enjoyed working here because I was always able to keep myself busy and it allowed the day to go by fast. I spent all my time unloading trucks on to conveyor belts, and unloading boxes full of mail. I learned how to work at a fast rate and maintain that rate throughout the 8 hour work shift."
good,nice job if your going to school and need some extra money....Pretty simple just load trailers and unload trailers. Great temporaily job but not enough hours to make your main job.
good,The job is an okay job and the pay is good. But being a temp I barely get to work and I don't recieve the hours i expect to earn while working there.
good,Take packages out of cargo containers to put on an assembly line. Had a certain amount of time to get all the packages out of the cargo container to the line.
good,"•	Administrative clerical work such as document processing, record keeping and report generation."
good,"Redundant working environment with attention to detail and team work required. Work hours are predawn 2 am til 9 am Tuesday through Sat. Hardest part of job is lack of organization, direction, training, and communication."
good,"It was god working there."
good,Good place to work as long as you go in do the job and go home. Pressure during the holidays and during busy hours
good,"I was not impressed with management. no comment , I have nothing to say about this company"
good,"A typical day at FedEx was very difficult  to me, but I was motivated to finish college. I learned the hard value of the dollar from working here. My co-workers consisted of convicts, and the environment had an out of control, dangerous feel to it. The hardest part of the job was lifting up to or over 3,000 pounds per shift during the Christmas season with my body. The only thing enjoyable about this job was receiving my paycheck."
good,Very fast paced organization with opportunity for advancement.
good,great place to work and great people. you make your own schedule and meet lots of different people.
good,"Entered delivery drivers’ information into the computer system which included hours of service, miles driven, number of packages delivered and picked up.  Performed administrative functions, including maintaining files, copying, answering phones and data entry.  Coordinating pick-ups and drop off situations."

good,run freight and loading and unloading trucks. fed ex freight is great job
good,"*Interns worked together"
good,"Hard work doesn't mean good pay here. The pay is ok, but it is long hours and a lot of work in the beginning. After you get some experience and know a route, the job is easy. But there are no raises."
good,"FedEx is a great place to work if you can keep up with the hard demands, but the pay is not too bad for the labor."
good,"Fast paced environment, great co-workers. Pays well and benefits are typical to most. Most holidays off and vacation/personal days earned."
good,"I had to make sure that I put the package in the right order when loading the trcuk so that I could find the package that go to the right address. Also I had to deal with managment so that I gut the right paper work and ihad to deal with the contractdor of the route so that I knew what route I was doing,so it took a lot of consideration, but at the end when it was over and I was done for the day I felt pretty good about being sure of what I have done."
good,Took advantage of the training programs offered and was able to use the training in another field of choice.
good,"haven't been there in years,so I will not review,but it was a good company to work for back then"
good,I gained better organization skills. Its a very active job and i work here during peak season. There is never a dull moment
good,A typical day at work involved authorizing and maintaining incoming and outgoing shipments of packages. The management was great and my co-workers were hardworking as was I. The hardest part of the job was physical hard labor. The most enjoyable part was the friendship I had with my co-workers and bosses.
good,"Fast paced environment, must be willing to work hard and alone if needed."
good,"I typical day at Fedex ground was standing in the back of a truck and loading it as full as I could, as fast as I could. It was hard work and a majority of the boxes were heavy. The pay was great for the amount of time you worked and there were opportunities to get raises, but you had to be able to ""go the distance"". The summer was extra hot and the winter was extra cold."
good,I learned that safety at this job is important because a man died not following the rules of the job
good,Great company. Consistent work and great pay. Very work oriented

good,load and unload FedEx trailer while scanning packages for the correct delivery truck. helped drivers with package placement. shifts were short the job position was seasonal.
good,Its basic factory job with more benefits good safety practice. Lots of part time and they work you hard to get you out early that's the most annoying part .The good part is they have cook outs for safety days often.
good,A typical day at FedEx included cleaning up the work area and scanning for hazardous materials. When the belts start to run we must keep up with the pace of the packages while still maintaining safety precautions. I always prevailed in production.

good,"the company i worked was very productive, there were many opportunities to advance within the company. the pay was also great."
good,I worked here 2 times they will hire anyone? I dont know what else its like free advertising they are asking for it almost makes me want to drop a star off of there rating.
good,Management pretended to be your friends but when it came down to stand up for you they saved themselves. It was a good job up until the last year of me working there. Management changed and so did the atmosphere of the company.
good,"A typical day as a DRIVER HELPER at a FedEX Home Delivery terminal is walking in at 7AM on a Tuesday-Saturday and grabbing my scanner. After I have my handy-dandy scanner I walk to the truck that I'm assigned by my contractor-yes I work for a contractor using the FedEX logo-and begin scanning all the boxes on the pallets behind the FedEX truck left by the PACKAGE HANDLERS, which typically takes about 30 minutes to scan about 100 boxes or so. I expect to see about 130-200 boxes a day. "
good,"Fed Ex was my out of high school, start college job. This job was a total workout.  Being an active person I loved every minute of it until the first day i got piled in the trailer by boxes.  After getting the hang of things, I had then found myself being the first to jump into a trailer to help out a new co-worker that I find buried in boxes himself.  Not many trades to learn at this job other than how to stack a wall of boxes to were they won't crush the boxes below.  I was responsible for not only stacking a solid wall of boxes, but making sure the box belonged in the right trailer by memorizing and checking the zip codes.  I had then earned the respect to get out of the trailers and work on the IC belt, which is all of the items that are too big or too long to go throughout the conveyor belts.  My manager and I got along great.  He was very supportive and helpful in the time of need.  I had days were the boxes got the best of me, but for the most part i enjoyed going into work to get a good sweat going knowing that i am accomplishing goals with little to no mistakes."

I absolutely loved my co-workers, they were my family, we all worked together as a team. the hardest part of the job was balancing work/life. there was a ton of mandatory overtime, and they didn't give too much time ahead to make arrangements for the children. the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to solve problems and help people."

good,My co-workers were nice to work with. The hardest part about the job was lifting the heavy freight that came down the line.

good,Great place to work always busy never a dual moment great way to stay in shape
good,"-Loading and unloading trucks for shipment"
good,"Loading packages on a variety of trucks going to counties all across the Mississippi gulf coast.  What I learned while working at FedEx would be multitasking, in's and out's of the shipping industry, working with a variety of people, and team work."

good,Unload and load trucks through out entire shift. The most physical demanding back breaking labor I've ever went through. Will definitely put you in shape. Working on the line to remove packages and loading into the trucks. Hardest part was it being so physically demanding. Best part was the short hrs

good,I enjoyed moving big boxes to their proper delivery truck and teamwork with other employees.
good,The only bad thing to me was not getting enough hours but my overall experience I would say were a good one. The hardest part of the job is the beginning when the packages comes down the conveyer belt all at once. After the first half hour the packages come at a fast pace and it get to be hard if your not use to it. But at the end of the day your gaining hands on experience that will help you in the future.

The manager i had when i first started at Fedex was not the greatest but i have new manager now that i am in a different work group. My coworkers are great people hardworking and nice people to be around in general. The hardest part of my job is working on the last slide because i get alot of freight that does not go into my can so i have to pick it up and push it back onto the belt. The most enjoyable part of my job is how everyone gets along and that our team leaders are also helping us get the work done instead of just watching like majority of the team leaders that work there"
good,"A typical day at work would be having a team meeting before we go to work and we would discuss the work load,quantity and goals set for the work day. I learned how to work as a team to achieve goals at high standards. Management was good and respectable to their workers. The co-workers were hit or miss depending on how they were feeling that day. Hardest part of the job was just non stop moving,but you get used to it. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing you set high standards and achieved them."
good,"If you want to work here, know that it will be fast paced, no matter which package handling position you are assigned."

good,"Work, a lot very stressful much of the time. Usually good managers, but some play favorites."
good,I learn packages logistic and distribution. I feel management could do better job at organizing. My co-workers are friendly and helpful. The hardest of my job is unloading the cans without help. Overall my job is good.

good,"The hours were short so most days went by fast, I learned that you have a certain amount of time to do your job, management was not so good, coworkers were the best part of the job everyone easy to get along with"
good,FedEx is a good place to work and grow in experience. This a a good place to learn different jobs.
good,The hardest part about this job is waking up for work if you work the AM shift. You come and get your forklift and your trailer manifest. Set up the computer for unloading and start physically unloading your trailer. Inbound shift unload the trailers and load them into route trailers. You do that 4-6 hrs a day. The job is easy but very repetitive.This is not a long term career but can be as a job to get you by. It is enough to pay the bills.
good,A decent job that gives you a check every week. Very fast paced. Ideal for students
good,"Every day begins the same walking into work with one hat and one mission.  To organize the members of my micro-team to accomplish the task at hand.  Once the night begins I anticipate changing hats several times during my short shift.  I can be called to take on any number or tasks that I have been trained to master with the end result of customer satisfaction being the end game.  Engaging in this constant switching of tasks add an element of excitement to my night, and I can honestly say I'm never bored.  The ability to cross train in almost every department within the company makes this a positive place to build a career.  This is only shadowed by the dis functional behavior of management and the high turn-over rate of the employee base.  For the most part the new employee is happy to be working and full of energy.  This changes at different rates depending on the employee.  For the most part they all work well as a team.  The hardest part of the job is never knowing how many people will actually come to work, and whether or not they are in the working mood.  This usually creates a picking up the slack process for the rest of the team."
good,"I arrive at 1:45am & sometimes work up to 12 hours. That start time is the only undesirable thing about my job. (FHI) is connected to meijers warehouse and we unload all the produce and dairy products off the trucks and organize them the correct way onto pallets. Then it's put up in the warehouse for it to be shipped to its correct destination. I enjoy working with my fellow co-workers, they're good people and we help one another all the time when needed. We all work our tails off every night and management sees that and rewards us with bbq' s for working safe and hard. The managers are easy to work for because they will work with you on anything you need."
good,Full of energy and steady work everyday. Friendly work environment and wonderful people.
good,"Package Handler"
good,"Job is okay, pay is okay.  Good health benefits. Not much room for advancement."
good,fun fast pace setting good people to be around can be made a fun enviroment
good,The people here are mostly young college kids its a good place to make some friends. the job isn't anything great but its a job so i can't complain much.
good,lots of boxes to load loved the hours i worked. worked part time with ft benefits
good,"a fast paced job that can also be fun at times., I learned management skills here as well as skills in claims. The hardest part of the job is working in the natural elements, cold winter nights and hot summer evenings. I enjoyed my co workers and the most enjoyable part of the job is overall success"
good,I worked for fedEx smartpost a little under a year. A typical day at work was so frustrating. The management and supervising is horrible. Although I did learn how to work in a fast pace environment with a team effort. My co-workers motivated me to do more and some where great teachers big on safety. The hardest part of the job was trying to finish a duty they move a worker from place to place so much there is no way to close out.
good,"hot in the summer, cold in the winter.  It was stable work, and was a decent working environment.  Co-workers were always nice and helpful, as was the management team in place."
good,A typical day at FedEx would consist of 7am starts to load your van and set up your run. I learnt how to navigate quickly and plan out my stops every day. my co workers where fun and had a good laugh with them. the hardest (or worst part) was having to drive back to carrickfergus each day from comber to hand over paper work. this took me over an hour sometimes. the best part was that each day was different.

good,"It is great place to work."
good,"Fed Ex is a very busy place to work, I've learned to work with others and to work fast paste! Managers were understanding and they pushed you to do better. Co workers are work together. The hard part was working in the heat! The fun Part getting our work done!"
good,Fun place to meet people and get going on customer service. You will get to knowpeople and how they like your customer service
good,"Was told the job would offer between 20-25 hours. Ended up 15 or less. I do not particularly like factory jobs, but being a full-time student it fit my schedule the best."
good,"tough work. Wont let  you work more than 37 hr/week so as to avoid giving u benefits. They do however do most of their promoting from, within."
good,Loading the packages into the shipment was the hardest part of the job because I had to think it as playing the Tetris by building up a wall of packages.
good,"Load and unload packages from vehicles, and delivered packages to other locations."
good,typical day was operations covering freight. No room for advancement. survived 4 layoffs before finally leaving on my own.
good,"it was okay just was'nt for me"
good,loaded and unloaded trucks everyday until one side was done then preformed maintenance duties around warehouse
good,"A typical day consisted of assessing volume and resources available. Egineering a plan. Executing with excellence. Reviewing performance to expose opportunies. People skills,development. Not enough time in the day. The daily challenges."
good,"Every day was fairly the same even during high production days, the turn around rate was pretty high so you'd meet new people every day, however if you made friend with any one they'd be gone within a week or two. Management was alright as long as you didn't get on anyone's bad side, a few managers were very strict and some were cool and laid back, depending who was on the floor that day."
good,great job but management just sucked. lazy workers which made it    harder for us full timers beccause what they didnt finish we had to finish
good,i really didn't like working here because of the boss but the workers are friendly and some supervisors
good,"loved working with customers, and the staff was great to work with also."
good,"It is hard work. You load trucks with boxes. Boxes come down a conveyer belt, you pick them up and load them in the truck. What else do you want from me Indeed?"
good,"Typical day starts at six am by organizing, scanning, and loading the mail and packages into the truck.  Establish a turn by turn through the computer to set up the shortest route."
good,"Fast pace and long hours. Not the best job for a family man. I liked that I was always busy though, it made time go by faster. could be more organized and have a better and more friendly inviroment."
good,A typical day is a typical day in a call center environment(inbound call center)Learned a lot about the movement of freight shipments both air and truck freight. Management was moderate. Most enjoyable part of the job was the discounts as well as working with coworkers.
good,Overall satisfying job with demanding work schedule.  Very demanding at certain times of the year.
good,It is a good job if you like getting up at odd hours and lifting a lot of wait.
good,"I always felt intimidated not only by the co workers but management, they were really mean and pushing me beyond my limits. I was performing a lot of the guys work by myself and was always picking on me when I always tried my best."

good,"A good place to start off and a good environment for people, Great management."
good,Its a good company to work with . Fedex is a shipping company and a major player in shipping industry.
good,hard fast paced work packing unloading scanning fast moving job liow work hours good supervisors
good,Come in open the programs and get in the mindset that you can be yelled at for some part of your day. I learned so much about the world and how the packaging industry works. I also learned a lot about me. Management is good if they have your back and sometimes can be scary when they don't. Co-workers are great and colorful. They helped me a lot and I could not have gotten thru my day without most of them. Hardest part was the yelling from the customers and them putting their kids on the phone so you had to tell them dad was not getting is xmas present on time because the package was not ordered in time. Most enjoyable was the people.
good,"Every day at work is about the same"
good,An assembly line setting packing boxes onto a truck. Keeping up with the pace was easy so we stood around alot.
good,"management operates under the good old boy system, minorities are subject to different guidelines than whites. i was trouble free for 13 years, and one good old boy, with the help of the other good old boys destroyed me in one year, i thought that documentation was proof, but they proved me wrong."
good,"I moved from Dallas, Texas to Richmond, VA to accept this job. I was giving a financial relocation package to assist with the long move. I was given opportunities to learn under stressful situations which was good and bad. The good is if you learn quick from your mistakes and catch on. The bad is if you continue to struggle which I did. But through time I improved and showed potential thus making the time while I was there decent mostly due to the support of my peers. There is no pleasing those with authority above you so get that out your head from the start. It is all about survival of fittest and sometimes getting lucky. You often work hours for free which is illegal but what are you going to do about it right? (What company does not do this?) You are paid for 10 hours as stated in your contract but normally work no less than 12-13 hours a day which in a 5 day work week adds up to about 10+ hours of free labor at least. You learn many valuable business strategies and problem solving skills which are essential to your growth in management. Your co-workers will make are break you because without their support you will fail! We had to lean on each other to make it through those tough days where it seems difficult to gain production numbers and be successful."
good,Working at this company was a trilling experance my co workers were great also the management.
good,my co workers were a good group of people to work with. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with everybody.
good,"I worked the night shift.  There is less traffic on the road. I liked being able to communicate with the other drivers. We are there for each other in case of break downs, warnings of roads down or storms coming. Its like a family on the road."
good,"The first day i came to work it was pretty fast learning for most of the things i learned like draw blood, CT Scan, X Ray, and many more. i have managed to alway get there on time and make sure i stay on my feet at all times to be sure i have everything done on time and my co-workers helped me out alot by telling me what to do and make sure i had everything down packed before they walk away. The hardest part was to learn how to do the x Ray amd dealing with people problems like there anger. The most enjoyable part was doing everything right and talking to the patients at all times."
good,"I enjoyed this job because I got to earn an honest paycheck every week. The only negative thing about this job was the culture and my coworkers. Some were nice guys, others were very untrustworthy."
good,my day started with moving freight trailers into position for unloading and getting the daily packets ready for the drivers - unloading the trailer then switching trailers for more unloading - processing the damaged packages and entering the reports - cleaning
good,The hardest part of the job was when the rainy season hit alot of packages gets wet and people send them back
good,"Typical day at work I come in set up my truck to how I want to do the route."
good,This job needs to offer more fulltime postion than part time to employees that have been there for many years.
good,I went from being a typical customer service agent to being a customer advocate and solving complicated manager type of calls.  I learned to take ownership of a problem.  Learned to multi-task because I had a lot of customers and problems at a time.  I learned to act in a professional manner and to be professional.  It also allowed me to grow and learn all these things while finishing my bachelors.
good,"When I began at FedEx in1993, the leading principle was P-S-P, which stood for People (if you took care of your employees) Service (they would provide the best Service in the industry) Profit (which would lead to Profit). Sadly, this philosophy changed in or around 2000 when FedEx purchased RPS (which later became FedEx Ground). When this happened a lot of the mid-level/executive level management became people from RPS which obviously had a very different philosophy regarding the business.  There became silo's within the different sales organizations and therefore limited future opportunities within the organization. FedEx drastically changed the compensation structure and the review process. While executive leadership continued to receive massive compensation increase's, management level and below were limited to a 2% annual increase. I felt they lost their focus on their employees and after reaching 20 years (with my pension vested) FedEx offered early buy out opportunities. I took this opportunity and look forward to a different career for the next 15-20 years. I am passionate about my job, I strive to be the best regardless of the position, I am always looking to learn new things. I love to lead and develop people, taking an average employee and working with them until they become a stellar employee. I believe in reward & recognition, and accountability, building a cohesive team to achieve the best possible results."
good,fast pace nice job good management an a nice work out to all around good job to work at
good,Great People. Lot's of ways to work hands on with customers.
good,My typical day at work starts at 6:30pm and usually ends at 5am depending on how fast we unload the trailers. I enjoy helping my managers so that the job get's done and they are happy with the performance of my co-workers and my hard work. My co-workers and I get along well because I'm old enough to be their father and keeping the pace with them. I enjoy meeting different people at my job.
good,Ive been here for 7 years. Met alot of nice people. Good vacation time. Raises have not been as good in recent years as the were in the past.

good,ok place to work in management was alright co-workers were ok hardest part of the job was loading big truck by myself enjoyed my workers
good,"I enjoyed having some freedom once I started driving a tug and helping load and unload aircrafts, but it was also the worst part of the job in the winter.  It was nice to have insurance benefits but not good that I could never work more than 30 hours per week."
good,"Not Eough hours"
good,Constantly growing and changing.  Split shift and part time was all the hours could offer at the time.  might be better now.
good,"Benefits are not that great.They do not have a retirement plan just stock option plan you can buy into. Also, the vacation policy/sick days stinks! You earn so many a year and have to use them for either sick or vacation. It is not so many for sick and you earn vacation separate."
good,Typical day at work it started at 11:30 pm it was a long night with very little breaks. I learned how to work well with others and to work fast. The management is good they all are very knowledgeable of what they are doing. My coworkers are what got me through the day. The hardest part about the job was the south shore it is very heavy and big. The most enjoyable part about the job was hanging out with my coworkers I met a lot of people.
good,"A work day is typically 4 hours. I load 3 trucks, approximately 640-740 packages a day. I've learned how to multitask and complete physical assignments in a fast pace with accuracy and consistency. I've learned how to work as a team with my co- workers, handling our work area by covering for one another with proper communication. The hardest part of my job is having a heavy workload and no available assistance. The most enjoyable would be fulfilling the task or work load as a team with my co-workers as a unit."
good,My day consisted of loading my own truck and then heading out to deliver packages on a daily basis. Customer contact was a big part of my job function as well as establishing good relationships with them. I worked hard daily on getting my packages delivered on time and securely. Management was easy to work with in most instances. I got along pretty well with all of my co workers and we had a real friendly environment where we joked and laughed and talked about our days and events. The camaraderie was like no other i experienced in previous employment. The hardest part of the job was dealing with frustrated customers when shuttle and flights were delayed. Customers didn't want to hear excuses but i made my best efforts to get everyone their packages on time. The best part of my job was being my own manager on the road and providing efficient customer service to all my customers
good,well fede helped me become alot more aware of my short comings in life im not who i used to be but im not were i wanna be either hours were decent around holidays but couldnt really make a proper living there

good,Clock in and grab a package scanner.Scan packages and remove them from the belt and place them in the correct truck so they can be delivered
good,"I learned how to scan and manage packages "
good,"A typical day at work involves helping drivers repack pkgs. answer phones, help customers, basic office skills.  Over the years at this company I have seen a lot.  I have been taught to understand that just because you are a mananger that doesn't mean any job should be beneath you.  The senior manager is the best.  He is understanding and very commited to the company."
good,"Fedex Freight had no real culture or values to bolster its employees, but did have great benefits"
good,"a fast paced environment where I was able to interact with customers, learn how to operate and repair equipment. It was a fun experience."
good,This job was at times strenuous but very fast pace and my co-workers were not to bad.

good,pretty good overall enviornment with competitive pay.peoplr are friendly and benefits are pretty standard
good,Very laboring and hard work. Not for the ones that think it will be easy to work at FedEx. Must come to work everyday prepared for the most work ever.

good,"Enjoyed the hours, nice benefits for part-time, many advancement opportunities"
good,"was ok, did not give enough hours"
good,"Manages 32 employees in a warehouse setting. Monitored the unload, loading, splitting, and home delivery areas. I've learned how to manage processes and not people.  Management was fair and just. Hardest part of the JOB was just the heat on the dock. Most enjoyable part of the job was learning and meeting new people"
good,"Assist customers with packing and shipping."
good,"Its hard work, but pays well if you work hard enough.  Finding different levels of advancement can be difficult, as well as transferring withing certain criteria.  Management can be fair at times, but most only care about your numbers and less about the employees.  Team work is essential, but sometimes you will find yourself picking up someones slack.  Hardest part of the job would be finding time to fit everything you need to have done in small amount of time.  The best thing is learning different cities and meeting great customers."
good,"Day begins at 11:30pm , I run different reports on previous day sort to review with staff, devise a daily plan , which includes various emails to other managers and personell. I' ve learned to move my staff around to other areas to help the sortation run smoother by cross training. The hardest part of the job is tring to fill in people who did not show up to work that day. Being short staff and trying to fill in those positions is one of the toughest things to do."
good,The typical day at work for me is to go to my work area where i pull various boxes n etc off the line and into cans according to state which they belong
good,I truly enjoy working for my contractor he was very professional didn't cut me any slack because I was a woman driver. what I learned was there are a lot of people out there that don't have a clue what merge into traffic means and who has the right of way. My fellow drivers were great if I was struggling with something they always lent a helping hand. hardest part was driving in snow but I did it without an accident for 4 years. Most enjoy the travel to different states. I like to drive
good,not a fun place to work people screaming to much and didn't know how to talk or treat people in the work place.
good,"Besides the temperature changes, heavy lifing, and waking up early, this was a good job."
good,It good process running well from unload trailor truck. Sometime bad manager of plan. Pay hour is low because it part time. Balance kind of not bad.
good,"a typical day at work was very labor intese"
good,FedEx grounds did'nt really give hours. It was a part time job. But the management was great.  The day wasn't long so there really wasn't any hard part of the day.
good,"Non stop loading of trailors. I have learned isscb computer system, management is average for a warehouse enviorment, my co-workers are hard working individuals like my self. The hardest part is the mid-shift rush of packages to be shipped across the country. The most enjoyable part of the job is going home after a hard day of work."
good,"FedEx Express is comprised of an outgoing and diverse group of people.  Training is thorough for couriers and office staff and co-workers are more than willing to work as a team."
good,"FedEx is a never ending job they are always on the move. I do alot of driving, so i am always taking freight to its correct location loading and unloading freight. The hardest part about my job or any other job is trying to get some people to work at a certain pace to get the job done."
good,A typical day at work. The hours were fine. I enjoyed my job as a fork lift driver. But the assignment was just temporary.
good,Package handling job dealing with logistics. Learned the importance of hard work with this job.
good,This was a short term temporary position. But it was interesting to help set up shipments and determine the size of truck. Then if there are any delays in the arrival of the truck due to bad weather or traffic issues contacting the delivery sight letting them know of the delays and new estimated arrival time.
good,"fedex have a cool managers and taught me a lot."
good,Fast paced working environment. Heavy lifting daily. Worked 4hrs unless told otherwise.
good,I have learned that labor filled jobs are not for me. It was very hot on trailers and there were no air conditioning units in the building. Workers are prone to illness or work related injuries.
good,I pulled orders and stocked shelves. I would cut would for customers and help them find the product they needed.
good,"Sorry, Wont say anything positive nor negative about my employer"
good,Over worked and under paid. We havent had a raise in over two years. Yet the management continues to get bonuses from the package handlers hard work. Some package handlers are doing the managers duty while the manager is getting paid for it.
good,"loading and unloading trucks, delivering packages, QA, packing and repacking boxes"
good,Loved the job because it was different everyday worked on a timed schedule so it was kinda hectic on some days.
good,The hardest part of the job is combining working with Independent Service Providers and company employees.
good,I enjoyed working with FedEx Freight.  Everyone was very kind and amicable while I worked there.
good,"Responsible for all aspects of release, classification and data input of shipment in Indy Image."
good,"unloading trucks as they arrived"
good,Very good company to work. Nice people. Fast paced. Solid management
good,A typical day at work for FedEx was loading and scanning merchandise to be put on semi-trucks. I learned how to scan merchandise and trailer bar code. My co-workers were good hardworking guys who were dedicated to doing their job. The hardest part of the job was loading merchandise from bottom of trailer to the top. The most enjoyable part of the job was goin to break and chatting with the co-workers.
good,account specialist ... schedule package pick ups ordering supplies processing payments billing
good,Day to day operations inlcude delivery and pick ups.  Challenging part of the day is to empty my truck to make room for my pick ups.  Providing quality customer service and meeting new people is very rewarding.
good,"i was young when i started working here, i was moved up and promoted very fast. They said since I was tall and a fast worker that i would do great as an inductor. they were right, i really loved this job! i was forced to resign due to a serious injury off duty. they promised to give me my job and position back. But they lied, after re-applying i never was called. i also tried several times."
good,i loved this type of work because id break a sweat every night. It almost became a competitive atmosphere between some people on who can unload the trucks faster. 
good,Good opportunity for advancement. Hot workplace. semi-dangerous workplace as it has belts and rollers.
good,A typical day work is high pace a lot of physical movement. Place is clean but boxes can stack up and cause a mess. Co workers are alright each section feels like a min family/team. Management is alright matters who is your team leader because some of them are not good at utilizing team members strong qualities.  
good,"Running Running Running"
good,Working at FedEx Services was my introduction into the workforce. I was a recent college graduate and did not know much about corporate America. My coworkers were very helpful during my transition period from college to the workforce.   
good,"FedEX is an okay place to work at, but you just really don't work any hours so you can't really get that much income."
good,it was a very fast pace and reliable works that like there job.......
good,Fedex was a job that kept me moving in which i enjoyed. The consistant pace is what made work enjoyable. As I've told you before i enjoy busy work. The hardest part was adjusting to the weather out side because that was also the weather inside.
good,You have be a self motivated and fast pace person to work this job or you will not get it done. Know your route so you can do your job well.
good,some days i worked and some days i didn't because if it slow which most of the times it was they called and told me to stay home
good,My time with FedEx has been steady and full of work. There is little to no advancement within the company and my first raise came after two years working for the company. They do not offer vacation time or paid sick days. Often I would have to bite the bullet and accept the days pay gone due to taking care of sick daughter or me being sick myself. My co-workers and the customers i delivered to were the only plus parts i enjoyed about the job. It's nice having people you can talk to and see everyday that helps you get through your day.
good,"Had hoped to retire there, but my Dept was done away with and a Voluntary Buy out was offered, therefore, I am now unemployed and hoping to find another company I can retire with."
good,At Fedex I would load and unload trailers.  I learned how to make decisions in a fast pace environment.  The hardest part of the job is to keep up with the flow of work for the night during peak season and communicate with coworkers to complete the job.  
good,The managers were insightful and helpful. We worked together as a team to get what we needed done.
good,"Every day very similar in routine, however, the time in which work starts and ends can vary often. The hardest part of the job is the working conditions being either really hot or really cold. "
good,"Job advancements opening were only announced to favorites early."
good,"Worked there when it was just Kinkos. Excellent training, management, compensation. With hindsight, I kind of regret leaving for a self employment opportunity."
good,Ground is an ok company over all however it is very hard to work there in the summer time with no AC in the trucks 
good,they care about there workers. work goes by slow becuse our moving at a nn stop pace
good,"Great job for the time.  Became fork lift certified and utilized dock terminals to account for tons of freight, their routes, and other logistical responsibilities.   "
good,Overall fed ex is a good to place to work. My co-workers(supervisors) and I have a good working relationship.
good,"FedEx Ground requires workers to work at a fast pace. The more boxes that circulates through the building, the better. Management, depending on the shift, has their pros and cons. Some managers are about the statistics, others are about building relationships with their employees. The harder you work, the more people like you. If people like you, people will try to recruit you to work in their area. If people don't like you, you will be on everyone's radar. People will try to force you to quit."
good,"As stated, the pay raises were perfect the hours just did not speak for itself.  12.25/hour with only 3 hours a night when the whole shift is still working does not explain itself after being told to go home for the night."
good,"Scanning packages. Bagging all small packages, then loading on to trucks. Good people to work for.  Could be very fast paced and physically challenging."
good,"-  Work odd hours.  Early morning or evening hours available."
good,A good place to work if you don't mind all weather conditions.
good,tough job that includes lifting heavy packages in hot and cold weather.
good,"It was hectic. My time here was short lived since it was a temp position. If I had to fall back on something, this would be the job for me. The reason I say that is because I liked the workout. "
good,I had to drive the the tug and drop off my freight. That was the fun thing because i was always driving.
good,It is a good part-time job but you must prepare yourself to be lifting heavy objects on an every night basis. The boxes come into the truck at a very fast pace and the package handlers must be sure to maintain that fast pace.
good,nice management and hard work. Very easy to lose some weight during summer hrs.
good,hard working environment with a good support team surrounding the employees
good,"keeping a steady pace"
good,Good job to have around /near holidays. Hard work..manual labor.
good,"Printing and shipping"
good,"Maintained staff PTO"
good,Long days and drove over 180 miles per day. Worked alone in bad weather many times 
good,It was an okay place to work at...you also get a good workout in as well. Co workers weren't too bad...
good,"A fairly busy company with plenty of work to do during the sort. Everyone there is really nice from co-workers, management to truck drivers. The hardest part about the job is to keep up with scanning accuracy when scanning package bar codes to appropriate trucks for delivery. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the people there. They really make the shift go by quick"
good,its just like going to football practice you lift just about the whole sort.
good,My day at FedEx consisted of unloading packages at about a thousand packages an hour over a four hour shift. One valuable lesson I took away from my time at FedEx was the realization that if I kept a consistent pace throughout my workday I was able to achieve more than if I maxed-out the first part of the day then bogged down the last part. The hardest part of the job was just the intense environment. A good lesson in how to manage stress. The part of the job that i did enjoy was the team work. When we combined our efforts we could unload vans and trucks more efficiently. Plus having that common goal in mind forms bonds and that makes the job more enjoyable as well.
good,Check assigned vehicle to ensure safe for public travel. Sort threw freight and load to proper routes. Make deliveries and pick-ups on a timely safe manner. Conduct a safety audit threw out the building to make any marks or suggestions for improvement. Light clerical work at the start and end of the shift.
good,typical day at work i load two truck with in a few hrs sometimes its fast pase. i learn how to load an truck and how to be a better leader .the management are alright.my co workers are fun and you can get tired of them sometimes but most of the time there good people to be around.the hardest part of my job is when you get bumbarded by boxes and you really dont have help.i enjoy most about my job it the people
good,"fast paced and hard work heavy lifting , loading and unloading trucks and loading cans"
good,"The job is okay, its just that. If you need something just to get by this will work, for those looking for a career, I don't think this is what you need. A typical night for me involves creating containers with customer packages. I am lucky to have a good manager, otherwise I wouldn't have lasted as long as I have. Weather plays an important factor in this job; when the weather is bad, plan for a long night."
good,Co-op at FedEx. Liked the people and recruiting for Customer Services Reps.
good,Unloading trucks was fun thats a good workout what I learned is how to use the belts when moving things and also meeting different co workers management was great always respectful the hardest thing was you be shore from unloading trucks but its a good thing.
good,Was a good company to work for.
good,"great work environment, good pay, I learned alot about the parcel business as well as the work experiene"
good,"Truck would be driven up from Portland. I would then deliver the aluminum in the Seattle area. Very few pickups. It was a OK job, but I didn't like the straight flat bed"
good,A typical day as a material package handler for FedEx is loading 300 boxes an hour for about 5 hrs a day in an 18 wheeler trailer in any weather condition.I learned how to pick up the pace and do what is necessary to get packages to customers on time. The management is tough and can bring your moral to a low but it makes you a tougher individual.Co workers are awesome and will show you the ropes if necessary. The hardest part of the job would be the lifting of items that weigh 100 pounds or more by yourself with no help.The most enjoyable part of the job is that they have water for you stationed at the sections you are assigned.
good,"Unloading trailers, Deadline driven environment, co-workers are nice and helpful for the most part."
good,"The workers were nice to work with, I learned a lot about myself as a person. I found out how strong I really am and that I can take much more than I thought I could."
good,"I enjoyed my job, but I was not kept busy enough. The place was mismanaged and there was no guidance, which left no room for advancement. I quickly outgrew my position and became bored. I most enjoyed one of my coworkers, we worked together brilliantly. If he wasn't at work, I preferred to work alone. Another co-worker, who wasn't the manager, mostly ran the place. They allowed the drama of their personal life to infiltrate our work place. The manager allowed this to effect other workers with no recourse."
good,"work at fedex was nice didnt nobody judge the female package handlers, I enjoyed the fast pace work didnt have to deal with customers u unload your trucks and move on to the next."
good,good work place. good part time job. learned to work well with others and understand people better.
good,"learned how to load and unload trucks also learned how to do everything in the bulliding through my traning. the hardest part about the job i would personly say my self would be loading trucks. the most i like out of the job was the days went by fast because yu stay bussy, there was jus not enough hours giving at this job or i would have stayed,"
good,"develops the knowledge and experience of logistics, warehousing / shipping & receiving, transportation of freight and goods"
good,unorganized unprofessional and careless of employees. not enough hours work was too overbearing.
good,"I enjoyed the work i did there, but near the end it started getting more demanding and very stressful."
good,"inspect packages, track packages, deal with customers and shippers help drivers keep work area clean and organized"
good,Everyone at work did some kind of task and we kept busy. My co workers and managers were nice and helpful.
good,Very fast paced job. Good Hours. A lot of driving. Short Breaks.
good,I work from monday-friday 6:30pm-10:00pm
good,"Worked for company for almost 12 years before economic cutbacks eliminated position. Processed US Customs entries for inbound shipments. Held numerous positions in Entry and Billing and Release Classification, Worked at one of local bridges for 3 months. Learned tarrif clasifications, Customs regulations and paperwork, how to read various types on invoices to find appropriate, necessary information and then electronically processed to Customs. Co-workers were great. Most managers were easy to work with and very helpful. Hardest part was at end when economic downturn made all the eliminations happen."
good,"The job took a lot of lifting and hard work which i liked, but you get disciplined even when doing your job. Managers only care about keeping their jobs and not properly doing their own. The environment could of been cleaner but that can be worked around, its the weather that effects the building that would get to you."
good,"Get your paperwork and door, verify trailer number and seal circle and initial. Scan badge enter trailer number open trailer . strip trailer by match bills to pallets ensure no damage to pallet if so enter in computer then scan pallet out move it to given door an scan pallet into trailer load freight might have to build deck an secure to wall . when done return paperwork to strip desk . get another trailer an repeat process"
good,"i liked working there but they didnt offer alot of hours,there is always work non-stop and good opputunity to move up in management"
good,The company as a whole is outstanding. Great managers with great benefits. The only con that really sticks out is the hours.
good,"I worked with mostly males. The job as fairly easy and I enjoyed the fast pace environment. Although, even when given independent tasks, we all worked as a team to accomplish a common goal each day. Daily I would lift, push, and pull up to 100lbs. Sorting packages to be shipped to different destinations"
good,"It was a very quick process of hiring and starting, just a high, and demanding workload. Unfortunately due to lack of transportation and effects on my health, I was laid off."
good,"The hours are great for students trying to get a degree. A typical day at work you come in and load or unload trailers until the shift is over. The load-side usually has you in the same load destination so there are really no surprises as to what they will have you doing. I learned how to load and unload trailers, communicate efficiently, and to work as a team member. Management like anywhere else has good people you will like and those you don't. Most employees here are younger males going to school to get a degree. The physical aspect requires you to be fit otherwise it's not a complicated job. The exercise is great here and accomplishing goals as a team gives you a great sense of satisfaction on a really heavy day."
good,Being employed at Fedex I learned how to work with others. I also learned how to manage not only people but a multi million dollar operation.
good,"loaded trucks, unloaded trucks, in a warehouse. pulled orders, packaged orders"
good,"A typical day was hard work. My days were a routine of loading and unloading semi trailers. I enjoyed the rewards of a job well done. Compliments were readily given out. Service center management was tolerable, but the orders handed down were sometimes asinine. It seemed as if mistakes were not learned from and continued to be repeated. The hardest part of this job was the inconsistency of hours. The most enjoyable part was my co-workers and the customers that I interacted with on a daily basis."
good,good place to learn good customer service skills and put them to used on different places on or off work
good,"Hard job, kept me in shape, easy to get along with coworkers, learned a little"
good,A Typical Day At Work Is Fairly Easy And You Learn Tons Of Things So Its Very Important To Be Versatile Because you May Be Assigned To A Task That You Wasnt Working The Previous Day
good,On a typical day I would assist customers with their shipping and printing needs.
good,"This job has taught me how important transit times are, such as trains, school buses, etc. and how to work around them on heavier days. Plan b, plan c, and maybe even another backup plan depending on how many areas you have to cover in a day."
good,"A typical day is non-stop. Many requests from customers which needs multi-tasking skills. One has to organize their day in order to complete daily task/requests. I enjoy working with the team and a team environment and I enjoy meeting people/customers at the front counter when accepting packages for shipping. The management team,, on the whole, are very pleasant and easy to talk to."
good,Promoted repeatedly through positions of increasing responsibility based on exceptional performance to provide top quality leadership.
good,beneficial and responsible management team. I have had no issues since starting work here.
good,This position was alot of hard work. Constant moving and bending.
good,It is a tough environment to work in daily. I generally liked it.
good,The typiacl work day was filled with productive work. I learned how to work with others in a fast paced envirinment. Management have their own way of connecting with the employees. Co-workers were helpful and fun. The hardest partabout the job was not having a set time to come and go.
good,It's a fast-paced work environment. A typical day can be long but rewarding at the same time. The most enjoyable part about the job would have to be that you're your own boss.

good,"Load trucks with packages, scan each box/package that comes down the chute, organize boxes/paxkages in a way that they can all fit without being squished and or broke. Very fast paced job, no time for breaks."
good,Work hard and dilligently you will be rewarded and recognized.
good,At first you think their requirements are unreasonable. Soon you realize that they just want to see how far you can push yourself. If I only had the requirements to be management with FedEx. I would still work for them.
good,The days were short put fast paste and easy to fit right in and learn new things. Not knowing how long you were needed was most time fustrating especially when traveling from a far distance. Co-workers for most part were friendly and willing to help out.
good,I only worked on the phones so I didnt get exposed to a lot of what goes on at Fedex
good,"A typical day at work is I come on, we sit and wait dor the manager to tell us whats the load count, and what time it needs to be done. I learned how the packaging system works, and what it takes to do it. Management was fine just depends who was working that morning. My co-workers where calm and collective. The hardest part is putting the packages inthe right spot and trying to fit them all their. Most enjoyable time is just the workout."
good,"It was good job, loading trucks something like a assembly line. Easy work"
good,IT was loading unloading trucks sol i learned how load and unload management was cool hardest part of job was lifting for 4 hours without a break but the best part of the job i enjoyed most was competing

good,Load trucks.
good,Fast-paced client atmosphere. Repetitive work with pockets of creative license. Management easy to work with and co-workers behaved as a team.
good,this job was a good mental job. you had to keep focus while your body is getting weak.
good,operate cash register made alcoholic beverages serve customers food in a timely manner .
good,office clerks had to make sure all the drivers have taken the right parcels for delivery that day & get them out in time. Then taking phone calls from customers regarding deliveries & dealing with any problems which arise.
good,i would spend the day loading and unloading freight trucks... the people and co workers were excellent
good,"a day at fedex is working hard to the max, I learned how to work at a fast pace, my manager is fair and pushes you to do good at work, my coworkers were respectful and cool, hardest part of the jon was to get the hang of moving at a fast pace with the boxes."
good,Alot of great experiences and knowledge were obtained during my Working History that I would like to use in Future Opportunity with new employers.
good,This company work you 3 to 5 hours a day but get 8 hour of work out of you. A lot of work small pay.
good,"I was a loader/ Switcher. My day started at 2:45 a.m. each day and i was in charge of helping set up trailers for each dock and moving trailers that needed to be moved. I really learned how to multitask and look for the best in your workmates and how to get in the groove of the task at hand. Management helped me in showing me hw to propely do my job. We worked smoothly and rarely ever had problems. If we did they were resolved quickly. Most enjoyable part was when it got fast paced, keeping up with all that needed to be done and working with everyone to make sure it got done"
good,"Professional corporate style environment. The scheduling was always changing and although willing, was never given 40 hours for budgetary reasons."
good,"My shift start at 9am until 5pm typically tuesday-saturday. My job was to count my teller,refill my receipt machine,and also my grocery bags and last,but not least greeting the customers at all times...."
good,My responsiblities as a cashier were cool & i loved my co-worker. The management is what i didnt like very much .

good,Prioritizes customer service. Prioritizes speedy and accurate service. prioritizes advertisements.
good,"very physical job, part time hours vary due to work load. pay gets capped off after 3 years unless you receive apromotion"
good,From my experience at Fed-ex I learned how to be responsible and multitask.
good,"I learned to operate commercial printers as well as other office supply, digital editing products and services."
good,Typical day at work:

I have taken classes on all aspects of the computer and feel pretty comfortable. Safety has always been important to me and have received safety training annually."
good,Fun workplace part time management is nice to work with .benefits after a year of being there
good,"sort through package to send them to the location and state,clean up the sort"
good,"Growth within this company is based on tenure and not merit, which makes it very difficult to advance. The wealth of logistics knowledge that you gain here is invaluable. Consistent inbound calls and fixing deliveries describes a typical day at NGL. The atmosphere is great although very little interaction with colleagues. The hardest part of this job is not getting paid what your're really worth and the most enjoyable part of this job is when you really help someone who really needed it."
good,"The pay scale is very good. I enjoy the time of day that I work, I prefer to work the night shift."
good,"Interact with all kinds of cultures , customer service . Coworkers made a positive work environment"
good,FedEx ground is a good company for college students and early workers. A lot can be learned and applied later in life from this job.
good,"My day is supposed to start at 8:30. However, with management not caring about the drivers, day now starts around 9:15. For every minute I get out after 8:30, I am 2 minutes behind schedule. So, before I even leave the terminal, I am 90 minutes behind schedule. Once I leave, I love it. I am my own boss. I come in contact with my customers, dropping off or picking up their packages. I am out and about all day."
good,"A typical day at work included long walks to get to designated work areas, loading planes, stacking boxes, and using driving equipment to transport freight to different areas of the Memphis Hub. I learned to always prepare for the worst and to prepare for the unexpected. Most of the managers that I worked with were pretty easygoing and easy to talk to. However, since we're always on such a timed schedule, they can be somewhat overbearing and pushy. The hardest part of the job was the manual labor, and the most enjoyable part of the job was receiving a check on a weekly basis, along with benefits such as tuition reimbursement."
good,Very challenging
good,It a good place to work for the most part the employees are nice and the managmant does work with you so thats good.
good,"I came in to work around 5:30 Monday-Friday. I would load and unload the freight trucks at a fast pace for 5-6 hours with out stopping. The number of packages that would come in and get loaded were between 20,000 and 25,000 a night on average."
good,"Great place to work, great people and nice enviroment. It was a nice learning enviroment."
good,"it was a good place to work at, the sad part is that it was just a temp."
good,I like the work but the hours are not the greatest. all non management jobs are night shift and there is no way to get off night shift unless you get into management in which you would still have to work nights for a long time.
good,management is very helpful and we are given all the nesessary tools in order to do ou jobs effectively.
good,Its an honest living. Hard work. Dangerous driving conditions sometimes.
good,good oppurtunity for someone looking to gain experience as a truck driver when beginning there career
good,bad timing with merger between freight and national they had too many people some terminals and not enough at other was a mess.
good,"I daily managed the work flow of my area, I assisted my co-workers with any and all additional help when needed."
good,"Their is no advancement or Training Programs,Team members know more then the manager."
good,Overall it was great working for this company.Employment didn't last as long as i would have liked.
good,Being a package handler is an ok task depending on your manager and which trailer they decide to put you in. Since I'm an experienced package handler I was in the trailer sending packages to Toronto and GTA area 4/5 times a week. A very poor manager will assign the wrong people to the wrong trailers which takes a toll on the more experienced package handlers. We voice our opinion but they refuse to listen and believe that they are right. Even though all our service managers have almost no experience as a package handler than us.
good,grab items off the belt line & set them in numerical order according to route number.
good,Close to my home. Co-workers are like family. We work as a team and get the job done. Great benefits for part time work.
good,good place but be aware of what contractor you work for. I liked my route ran smoothly.
good,I learned how to properly read a map and get anywhere! The hardest part was lifting the heavy pkgs and carrying them to the customers. Learning how to drive a large vehicle was fun...management can be stresssful since they have to produce immediate results on a daily basis and motivate us to do even more.
good,made sure all package were in the right number order answer phone calls hardest part of the job was lifting heavy objects. the most enjoyable was the customers.
good,Delivering a set route you learn to move quickly while meeting interesting people and building a good relationship with them.
good,Just depends on your management lots of hours to work and it is expected.
good,unload planes and cargo containers. The hardest part of working here must have been the extreme weather.
good,More than 11 years of experience transporting a wide variety of packages to homes and businesses as a contractor and driver.
good,Hard job but you will get what you put into it. Its a lot of mental work it seemed like you have to keep pushing and pushing.
good,FedEx Has High Values for there company. stricked Rules Controling of time away from job.
good,This is a good company in order to establish work ethic and experience.
good,"A very productive work place, where you will know your tasks before hand, minimal sudden changes. great team atmosphere, work is enjoyable."
good,"Very hard work, but you are compensated well. Fast pace environment and you have to be a strong person to work there."
good,If you need extra income on the side or a college student great place to work and get fit at the same time.
good,"It is not a great place to work, you dont get enough working hours."
good,"I worked there for few months as a temporary. It was part-time. I liked work there, because it was easy job. I liked to do productive. I always followed the tasks what they told me to."
good,"Let me start by saying that FedEx is a great company for shipping. I rely on them for anything that I absolutely need to get there on time. Sadly, their purchase of Kinko's hasn't really gone well."
good,"Fedex Freight and Fedex Natl competed for the same business ,which after four years was found to be unprofitable for both divisions."
good,Fed Ex is a nice place to work with plus they offer great benefits.
good,I really enjoyed my tenure with Fedex my overall experience was good especially on the customer side. The only thing that was very alarming was the high turnover rate for managers in 8.5 years I served under 12 different managers and about the same number of Sr managers.
good,"FedEx can be a great company or terrible company it really depends on how you come to work. I'm a quiet person that likes to get the job done and go home. I don't care about any activities or whatever going on at FedEx. one of the great thing they have is benefits, the day you get your employee number that's the day you can sign up for benefits. With the benefits, you have vision, medicare, life insurance, vehicle insurance, and much more. What's really mess up is your trainer or manager will not tell you that you can apply for benefits right away. if you want to know more about the benefits you will have to do some googling."
good,I don’t have a review about the place. It was an okay place just not for everyone. Try it out yourself if you like it great if not then leave it’s that simple.
good,FedEx is great and fair employment opportunity. It has its down fall with manual labor. However the work environment is a great place with outstanding people. Fast paced but it keeps you busy. Opportunity for growth is available.
good,The company as a whole is a great place to work though some of the management that they hire have reason to be questioned in some of there work ethics...... it has gotten better over the years but still  needs a lot of improvement.
good,"As incredible and unbelievable as it may seem,  the only things larger than the starting pay are the attitudes of the young people who work here. I have met perhaps one or two knowledgeable individuals who were surprisingly humble. Yet most of the young people who have been there just months, and are certified in one or two areas, have positioned themselves on pedestals so high that they cannot be seen from ground level. Add to that the cold shoulder you get from everyone else and you have a nice place to work.  Manager was great.  He did all he could but because of the high turnover rate, you have to settle for what you can get.  I often find myself wondering why the heck I was there in the first place. . Afterall, I had a full time job making three times the money."
good,Bem corrido o serviço uma logística bem dinâmica  bom
good,"FedEx does NOT cover you, just makes sure they have loads available.You can request your own schedule for either short runs or long runs, as long as your contractor agrees, lol. But that might hurt your chances at a run for the week. Its best, if at all possible, you take whatever they have for you. Pay is weekly which makes life easier."
good,"Good pay, I had fun working there. I always worked up a little and didn't care because I'm very active. Overall it was a good job to have and was a good workout every day."
good,Lots of work but manageable. Sometimes the top management does not show support. The culture can be good but all depending on which team you are on and who you work for.
good,"FedEx is a great place to work - focused on people and facilitating opportunities for advancement, however the company is in the middle of culture change due to market conditions."
good,"Good: Great name brand and respected globally.  "
good,"I can say it was a good first job, but didn’t really respect employees. I was a loader and unloaded for FedEx. I could never receive extra work cause it’s first come first served which I think is unfair to others."
good,It just depends on the building you work in. The work is not hard and the training is sufficient. And the Managers are somewhat helpful. I like the new building.
good,"This is a good job, if you are willing to go up and beyond the natural duty function of any other job. "
good,"I have always been paid well, but it has always seemed as if that is the only thing that keeps people there; including myself. Overall, the environment is very negative and feels like a dead end. Lots of respect to the place, but a large amount of improvements need to be made for me to have better things to say."
good,It was a good working environment to work at and great teamwork. Everyone would help each other to make the place roll smoothly with no problems. Everyone got along and there were rarely any problems at all.
good,Working at FedEx was overall very fun and enjoyable for the most part. Most of the management inside the factory was great for most part. However there was hardships like for example working on Ramp there can be confusion in the group and we get Delayed and everything would slow down. On the upside all the people I've met at FedEx were very admirable and respectful and had a lot of fun just working with them.
good,"Scan and sort thousands of packages a day and load onto trucks. Fast paced, read fast and move fast. Can lift and carry 50+ lbs all shift. Work safely and work well with other co workers and the drivers, as well as management."
good,"the only think I liked was the weekly pay and the fast paced work day, its a really good workout  also the freedom to eat where you please at the job was great too"
good,If I had to do this all over again I would work for an airline! They pay more and have flight benefits! Airlines give out more raise annually FedEx everything few years and only 30 cents
good,"The flow of packages is very inconsistent. But with the right Co-workers, it's manageable. The various weights that are dealt with can be taxing on the body also."
good,"Management take advance of employees. Moving up into leadership position is who you know rather than what you know. You'll see a lot of young employees kiss up. "
good,"Overall Fedex Freight is a good company to work for. A typical workday you enter the bills of lading in to the computer, answer phones, and check in drivers. The workplace culture is busy and can be noisy at times. The hardest part is tuning out outside noise to concentrate on what I am billing."
good,The pay is great. the work environment is fast paced and you are always moving. You have to pull and load your own truck in the morning and sometime those boxes can be super heavy.
good,"Its a nice place to work, you apparently learn on the job as no beginning in class room training before the 6 months probation period its has a good job security and its an international company so you have to make sure you do your job/task as assigned.  "
good,"Management can be less that desirable from this work place, some of the employees are really crude, and for the most part, if you are a good worker, you end up picking up other's slack on a daily basis."
good,I just needed more money I really liked the work because I'm a competitor I love reaching and attaining goals for life. It was very enjoyable the people want to succeed and help each other become very good.
good,not a bad first job if you like doing labor they have really good benefits and the pay rate was ok u get a raise like ever 3 months or so. Really hot in trailers
good,"I really like FedEx; the overall experience was great.  I was on one of the busiest shifts and we worked hard to unload the trucks and keep packages going on every line.  I started during the holidays, so we got a slightly higher pay, but when that ended they dropped our pay down but we were still doing the same amount of work moving the same amount of packages and some nights moving more than what we did during their busy holiday season.  That would be my only negative is that the pay decreased, and work stayed the same or went up.  I left right at the 3-month mark, so I did not see the pay increase, but it only amounted to .25 cents which is still not enough to live on."
good,"FedEx is fast paced, long hours, tons of problem solving and an overall challenge to manage day to day operations."
good,"I do believe FedEx is a good company to work for, but I also believe that it would be a much better company if it made sure that all of it's employees were adequately trained for the pring and production part of the job."
good,"Working at Fedex wasn't a great experience for me, but not because the way the company was ran was bad. It was bad, because of the culture of the specific location I worked at"
good,"good, hours just suck, advancement seems fairly easy, but it will cause strain on your body if your not mindful, no clear management so you never really know whos in charge, but that has its pros and cons."
good,"Adoro il mio lavoro e prendermi cura dei clienti. Mi piace soddisfare le loro esigenze puntando sempre a migliorare, senza perdere mai l'entusiasmo e la voglia di imparare. Miro sempre a raggiungere i miei obiettivi e dare il massimo per trasmettere la credibilità dell'azione per cui lavoro. Gli stimoli e la voglia di crescere hanno sempre motivato la mia costanza e professionalità, cercando di non perdere mai il focus della mia attività."
good,Typical Hard work for a fast paced labor job. Sometimes felt overloaded with moving too many heavy boxes and without any real direction. Simple work but can be overwhelming for those unused to hard labor.
good,"Working at Fedex ground I noticed you can move up fast if you work hard and show improvement."
good,Decent job for temporary purposes. This was a job while I was in college and paying for tuition. That's one good thing about them as the student reimbursement. Flexible working hours and decent people to be around.
good,It's a well paying job for part time early hours and the co-workers are helpful and nice. Water fountains are convenient and management is always on duty.
good,If you work hard you can work overtime and get guaranteed overtime.  Fair pay but little advancement opportunity.  Flexible hours and management works with you to make sure your getting the number of hours you need at the time that works for you.
good,"Sort on the belt, Load the trucks and organize your own packages, then manage time so you have enough tie to make time hacks, and also have great customer service."
good,Not enough employees to fill the departments. Stressfull. Lack of communication.. Pt hours  i can work but 3rd shift is exhausting. They temps get treated bad at times. They work u too hard at times.
good,"The company is great to work for and the benefits and insurance is nice. "
good,Fast paced and hectic at times.To many people working on such a small dock.never liked it from day 1 that truck drivers were allowed on dock to perform our work!management only cares about themselves.All ememployees got along well.supervisors were nice.
good,"every evening we had a meeting before the shift started. In the meeting my manager told us how many boxes to"
good,"Fast paced environment, busy day shift.   Management is good to work with.  I have learned a lot in OS&D but am very versatile in all areas.  The hardest part of my job is the unsteady (hours) schedule.  Never knowing if I will be on days 1 week or nights the next."
good,"FedEx is a great place to work with a lot of opportunities available whether you would like to get into management, driving, or clerical work. Hours can be flexible depending a what your position is."
good,"a regular day would be parking my car and getting past security and getting on a bus to go to my area. then I would clock in and proceed to stretch and flex. After warming up then walk to my area and wait for packages and put theses ideas into freights. "
good,FedEx is not a terrible company to work for they have tons of problems with lack of communication and fighting and finger pointing between departments.
good,"The money and benefits are outstanding and will be home virtually everyday . The fallback is that you return from your day you immediately eat , shower and go to bed in order to begin the following day . Your weekend is spent preparing for the upcoming week . Very little personal time . But you will make very good money ."
good,The pay and benefits are real good the only thing that is no good is no vacations and no hours over 40 or more...………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..
good,Typical large corporate IT shop.  A lot of good talented people doing good work.   Company is very slow to change.  Sometimes can't seem go get out of their own way.
good,"Unorganized,  low pay, good if your in school and only want 4 to 5 hours a day. Management is ok. They work with your outside schedule.  But not enough hours.  Cheap pay and don't like to give raises.  A lot of favortism"
good,"They don't care about who you are. They WILL work you till your visibly hot or cold and still work you out. Its a hard work environment. Fast paced, if you want to work here, please don't expect it to be all dandy. You will have a tough time. You do your part and leave."
good,"Clock in, pick up necessary equipment to preform the job.Get your assigned truck, scan packages, apply city codes to package, sort package by city codes"
good,"I load trucks and work on the line, and now I work in QA, there is no room for advancement and not offering part time. I really like the benefits offered through this employer."
good,"Definitely job security.  Management could be better, they are somewhat efficient; attitudes could improve.  Otherwise not a bad place to work in my opinion."
good,"The management was poor, more or less on how he treated employees. The atmosphere was great with the employees, very active and exciting.  The incentives they would advertise were great if you worked there. the facility was new so there were no problems there."
good,I work Monday to Friday 6pm to 11pm. I like it but i think the hour is too short. I like moving with this company. I learn a lot of stuff with fedex. they move me position to position to learn about new stuff. I even become a supervisor for the loading. I also get to work at control room.
good,Many opportunities for hours. Works you like a slave. On site training and coaching. Part time and full time for all types of schedules. Pay isn't too great
good,Everyone gets along and we work good as a team but the pay kinda sucks for the work we do poor management the managers are rude and its very repetitive and work can get hard
good,"It's a very decent job. However, peak season is a pain and the managers rarely help out. Christmas time is coming up and I heard some very bad stuff about it."
good,The job is physical. if you're a lazy person this job isn't for you. Love the job atmosphere and how secure the building is. takes about two weeks for your body to get use to the job.
good,"Hard and hot Work Place, its not what you expect its a fast past work environment with no breaks. "
good,"50/50 at most. Job depends on management. It has be great or terrible between my transfers from Houston, Austin, and Dallas. Tip: If a position posted with the same req# has been open for more than a month, red flag."
good,The environment isn't really good and the chances of getting hurt is high and you are expected to work really fast since we have a time limit of when the drivers are suppose to come in.
good,"Excellent pay. But lots of stress and rules to follow. Over time all the time. Weekends off, most of the time. Lots of demands on maintenance with little support and no further training than what you started the job with."
good,"I think that coming through a temp service, that we should have 1st pick for job openings since we are already working in that position. the job that I have will never be an opening."
good,Job was ok but trucks were not up to par they had bad tires no heat and some of the trucks had leaking roofs package handler did not care about the packages because they did not have to deliver them
good,FedEx was my first warehouse job it was a great experience of working there i wasn't trying to leave but i had hurt my back so i had to come out of the job but if you looking for a second job that paid weekly i would work at FedEx.
good,Fedex freight is a good and well paying company. Working at Fedex freight as a truck driver was a dream come true. I started in the warehouse as a forklift driver then promoted to CDL truck driver.
good,"Like any other typical day the moment you walk in its straight to the work station."
good,"FedEx provides the opportunity to advance quickly."
good,"Working for FedEx has been a great journey. The environment was relaxed mostly, but very productive. A typical day at work was usually very busy. I learned more about prioritizing and being very detailed and organized daily. The overall management was not very supportive when necessary. The job provided minimal management and supervision. Everyone got along with each other for the most part and the job promoted a lot of teamwork. The hardest part was overcoming challenges with understanding the different cultures of the different agents we worked with in other countries."
good,"I spent 3 years with them and never loaded a truck next to someone i can talk to. Working overnight shifts, and straining the body with heavy packages, the pay and benefits though were still worth the struggle."
good,I have been a package handler for 4+ years at fedex ground and after doing some research lately have found out ups canada pre loaders and sorters are making $24.71 an hour. That is $7 an hour more than we make. I would say we need someone to organize us because we are getting shafted big time. It is time for fedex to do the right thing and start bridging the gap!
good,"It can be a productive and fun place to work. If you have the right managers, working for. I say this because I have manage for years, and worked under other managers and I have never encountered the type of treatment I have encounter from these managers at FedEx Ground"
good,"Good place to work if your trying to make some extra money, but, its is extremely physically demanding. Management is generally helpful and understanding. Overall a good place of business."
good,it was a good job handling packages and unloading vehicles...loading containers that had to be shipped to Phoenix airport..leaning about HAZMAT items...leaned alot about the company
good,"It was OK working there,except when the holidays come and there are so many boxes falling all over the place almost everyone's cranky and also because you have to go to security before break so half of break is taken by security so instead of Thirty you had a Fifteenth. Fast paced and your on your feet all day some people get paid better then others and don't even work as hard."
good,"On a typical day I would start between 12 a.m and 2 a.m. I would unload the conveyor line, stack packages, unload and load trucks. I learned how to scan and sort packages. There was poor management. I got along with everyone in the workplace. The hardest part about the job was when we had to sit and wait for trucks to come in because I like to keep busy. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to keep my numbers up."
good,"FedEx is a good job with great pay, very safe work environment, very clean work environment, treats employees equally and provides great work experience"
good,"A typical day at work: same thing different day, very boring, people were alright."
good,"A typical day at work, like all job have expectations of getting the job done within a timely manner assuring that all the customer needs are meet and orders are correct"
good,"Don't get me wrong working at Fedex is not bad, it is a decent job with amazing benefits. The job atmosphere is pretty laid back. "
good,This was a good place to work until FedEx Services acquired the original company.  Than things went downhill.  Upper management could make things up to get rid of you.  Hard to work for someone when you could lose your job for not having the same opinion as your boss.
good,It is a very fast paced job working on a line. The job requires a lot of lifting at a set speed and sorting everything to where it goes.The managers at Fed Ex are very professional. The hardest part of the job is keeping up. It is a job to where you have to push yourself.
good,It's an awesome job with great pay. Decent paced but the employees are like family. The teach you very well and there is always someone there to help you if you need it.
good,"The days are almost always busy. There is an ability to learn certain aspects of different jobs. Everyone there mostly gets along. The hardest part of the job is the split shift hours for full timers. The managers are pretty good and fair for the most part. In the summertime, the heat can affect you since it's in a warehouse."
good,Part time. Not enough hours. Not much to the job. The managers are there for you and do push you to complete your assignments in a timely manor. Part time job with health insurance.
good,managed a team of twelve agents.
good,I have nothing to offer about this company.  I am currently looking for employment not trying to sell a business or individual on a company.  This is a waste of my time.
good,The hour are not much. They do not pay enough for the work that you are doing.  It a lot of work especially during there busy season. they have good managers.
good,"Fed Ex is a joke.  Its labor practices are what drove me away.  They penalized the drivers/couriers when the MAIN delivery truck was late.  If im scheduled to be there at 7am, and the MAIN truck is late, they 'll force you to take lunch which may last way longer than your normal lunch (first thing in the morning mind you), until the truck shows up. So you may have to take a 2-3 hour lunch at 8am or so, and because of the route adjustment, may also cost you an hour or 2 in salary. Fed Ex knows how to get you one way or another."
good,Worked in a PIT with a voice system. Went to different locations and picked what I was told over the voice system. Wrapped pallets and dropped off at the locations they needed to be. Due to using a voice headset you can't really talk.
good,We had to work at a quick pace to get packages delivered in a timely manner.Our work day considered of working from 2:00-7:30 AM but did fluctuate from time to time.The hardest part was off loading bulk trucks.The most enjoyable was sitting in the break room with each other having a good time.The People there were friendly and helpful.Managers would work with you if u had a problem and or situation at hand.That job taught me how push thru when I got tired and communicating skills definitely improved.
good,Great part time job. Must be physically fit to succeed. Scanning docs and handling packagses up to 100 lbs/45 kgs. Muti tasking required fast pace. Must be able to work in extreme heat and extreme cold temperature.
good,"Very very busy. Long days which do affect your work life balance. "
good,FedEx is a good company to work for if your sole purpose is to retire. The work/life ratio is off. There is a lot of work to be done. There really isn't room for major growth or advancement.
good,the work isnt that bad if your very fast or if you have help. its a good job to start off at. the start off pay is fine and you get raises very quick. management is kind of bad but they are all about there safety
good,"My typical day at work was, drive a forklift , loading and unloading trailers with freight, maintain a safe record and make sure to wear steal toe boots."
good,"Sort packages in the morning, set your day in your truck and deliver packages according to time frames.  Priority first and standards second.  Loved my route where I established great rapport with customers and civilians."
good,Work got to be very stressful at times but at the end of the day you just accept it because you know that it's gonna be a little tough since you expected to be lifting boxes all day and loading trailers.
good,Well respected company. FedEx is a very profitable company. Limited in salary and advancement if you are not mobile. Salary has not kept up with the market.
good,FedEx hired me as an unexperienced worker right out of Basic Combat Training.  I worked there for as long as I could before the job added stress to my body.
good,"The duties of a driving position with FedEx didn't require much except punctuality, being able to drive, being physically fit and knowledgeable of the area.."
good,"Mangament is 30/70 in term of good and bad. If they have a good manager they will look out for you, that bad manager will give you extremely hard time. The one that is in the middle only doing enough to get by which is scary cause the sometimes do give a care about you situation  ."
good,this is a fast past environment. This is a company that is a great one to learn how to manage and stretch yourself.The hardest part of the job is the how of operation.
good,It's overwelming you have to do too much nice pay but you never work more than 4 hours so pay check was no more than 100 some a week and you have to work threw ANY type of environment/whether
good,"A typical day at FedEx was extremely busy from start to finish. I learned time management, corporate policy, how to deal with people and diffuse complicated problems. Management was very stressful with few rewards. The workplace culture promoted working together as a team and getting things done in a timely manner. The hardest part of the job was working shorthanded at times due to the churn rate. However, the most enjoyable part of the day was knowing all the  freight was delivered or picked up on time with nothing left behind."
good,"The hours are constantly changing, there are different amount of shipment every day, employees usually work at quick paste. Employees know time to work but not clock out"
good,"This is a company you will learn alot from, regarding logistics/supply chain management, but it will be a process. The days are long and the nights can be just as longer but if you have patience you will make it."
good,The pay starting off was good. Seniorority is Indeed a thing at this place. Most managers at this job were pleasant. The hours are horrible. Started at either 1 in the morning or earlier. It’s good to rack up money but not a career.
good,It had its ups and downs but overall the pay was excellent sometimes it could be a little difficult but for the most part not to complexed but the compensation makes up for everything else
good,Loved this job other then the branch manager he was not a very friendly person at all he has since been fired for his ways of treatment towards employees
good,"working here is like eating the same meal the rest of your life.. so boring,  the same thing over and over and over again. but i mean its good pay i didn't mind it too much but after a few months you need something else unless you are a boring person that like to stack boxes, if that the case you should work here."
good,"As a driver, it was pretty enjoyable, it was a fast paced environment, just like the saying time is money. I probabaly wou8ld of stayed but i needed to make more money."
good,"If you like to move around at work,  this is the job for you! From bending and lifting to squatting and sorting,  you will always be moving. Easy way to stay in shape!"
good,"Definitely not employee-friendly.  They offer great benefits but you will earn every one of them.  The hardest part of the job is the lack of support.  Individual managers do the best they can for their employees but it's the company policies that are so negative and stressful.  There are rare instances where you do feel a sense of achievement, times when you actually helped someone who truly needed it, but there is a lot of abuse which they feel is part of the job and totally justifiable on the customers' part."
good,"Needs improvement, managers have too much favoritism the ones who should be gone are not gone and they let go good employees the pay is horrible and the job is hard for the people working on the floor"
good,Productive job etc on the clock the average day is meeting standards set by management. Teamwork was learned the hardest part there wasnt one the best part getting paid weekly.
good,"Asking persons working the job what could be done to make it work better Our day begins with a workout, than we report to our work stations after a brief briefing"
good,"It's a decent place to work. There's still things they need to work, like better notices with schedule changes. Summers are hectic. Don't expect to have many plans. The summer is their busy season"
good,"Easy job in general. Moved freight on a forklift from one trailer to the other. Specifics on how to do so is clear, however not so effective. Lots of stress as there was no room to move around and there was a lot of times that I would have to fix other worker's mistakes."
good,"sehr großen,wachsendes Unternehmen."
good,Fed Ex is a good place to work at if your only wanting part time because it takes a long time to work your way up to full time. its also a vary physically demanding job as well.
good,I worked a private account so really was alone on site most of the time. I can say the company is fast paced. Hard work will get you noticed and moved around to better opportunities.
good,"part time, not enough hours. it would be great if full time. there are very few full time positions. it is ver fast paced, and can be a fun place to work"
good,"Acho que deveria melhorar em questão de salário e começar a trabalhar em turnos, pois as pessoas tem suas vidas pessoais e o horário comercial não possibilita fazer nada em relação a fazer alguma coisa na cidade ou até mesmo ir em consulta médica"
good,A typical day at work is exercising what you've learned through management and workplace culture. The hardest part of the job is the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,"Recebimento dos caminhões por meio de guia cega,carregamento dos carros no setor de distribuição ( rotas ),realização de inventários diários por meio de nota fiscal no final de carregamento e organização dos materiais em rotas."
good,"My career at FedEx was a very stressful, time sensitive job.  The day would vary anywhere from 6 - 12 hours, depending on how busy we were.  The holidays were super stressful but interacting with my clients made my day less stressful."
good,I found the job very stressful trying to keep up with schedule demands. I also found the job not very motivating and typically boring doing the same things by myself at work.
good,"Seasonal driver position, physically and mentally demanding, long hours during holiday season, work at own pace but better move fast on heavy days!. I enjoyed driving and working on my own."
good,"i think they can show a little more care for there staff, one thing i think they can do is have staff shuttle bus from the station Morgan blvd to the job. Another thing i think they can do is have have like a staff room where we cant take our brakes at instead of having to walking around."
good,"Empresa seria, responsável e dedicada com seus interesses,"
good,"Overall i didnt like working there,management sucks, you always working past your schedule time. Dealt with rude customers. The work was repetitive and did not learn new things"
good,"Fast paced job. The work is hard and feels never ending. A lot of heavy lifting, pulling and walking. But at the end of the day, its not actually that bad. It's like being paid to workout."
good,Empresa multinacional con altos estándares de productividad y optimizan de los procesos que se traduce en eficiencias y logro de objetivos.
good,Awesome time at the job loved it just not enough wages paid per week lack of hours. And no real job security love handling packages hard manly work just not enough pay...
good,"Provides accountability and responsibility for young workers looking for a living wage.  Physically demanding, and time consuming, which makes family life difficult, especially during the holidays."
good,productive hard manual labor not enough working hours during the day shift. Can be monotonous day to day. good job for college students who want a workout while being paid.
good,Scan and load packages once received off the convey belt. Take damage goods off the belt or send them to the back of the belt if it's severely damaged or if it's a liquid of any class.
good,"If you can live on $30-40,000. Its for you. Easy as long as you can drive well and don't live in a hot climate. Don't plan on doing anything the month of December."
good,It's a nice job and all but it'll take it out of us. I would  recommend that you  consider working  there. Cause if u think it's gna be easy it is not. Ive learned quite  a  bit  since I've been out ther
good,"Enjoyed my time at FEDEX, but the lack of hours, were the biggest reason for leaving. Got along with everyone, from the highest person in management, to the lowest person, on the dock."
good,"Seniority and area knowledge makes all the difference. Very fast paced, must be detailed oriented and accuracy is essential. The job is not for everybody so before applying make sure your qualified."
good,Fedex pays well during peak season. After that the hours decrease and they tend to send people home when there is not enough packages in the warehouse.
good,"A Fedex é uma verdadeira fábrica de bons profissionais, foi lá que eu aprendi quase tudo do que sei hoje. Tem uma cultura sólida e os colegas de trabalho se tornam sua segunda família. Sobre a gerência, pelo menos a última que acompanhei, falta equilíbrio emocional e respeito pelo próximo. A parte mais difícil foi administrar o relacionamento com essa gerente em questão."
good,"My job is a lot of overtime on a salary schedule that is not very forgiving when it comes to my family life.  I enjoy my work, but the hours make it hard."
good,"Steady work with benefits."
good,Attended a sort operation then filled out an apply.  Took about 5 weeks to start working.  Started working and the environment was pretty fast paced.  It is the type of job where you have to learn fast and be able to endure harsh weather.
good,"I was there for eight years and I was able to learn quite a bit about trucking, dispatch, and billing. I even acquired a forklift license towards the end of my employment there."
good,"Average day has 150-200 boxes per truck,almost never a light day but plenty of heavy days. Very inconsistent hours (starting anywhere from 3 am to 4:30 am and ending between 7 am and 9 am). Managers are helpful but rarely around to help."
good,"FedEx is a good place to work. There are all different kind of position, also you can move up in the company. Good work environment, benefits and discounts as well."
good,It's a good place to start off a graduated high school student but not when you got bills and just not enough hours but on the other hand the benifits are great .
good,"I have learned a lot from working in this environment, Fedex gave me the opportunity to gain work experience and taught me about corporate structure. Fun place to work as the people were great, management was alright and structure could be a bit chaotic due to the nature of the business. Although it was organized chaos and everything usually went as planned. I enjoyed working here and was a good place to learn from a young age about corporate structure."
good,Fed ex the company gives very little to its drivers. All benefits and pay come through contractors. The drivers don't even receive discounts on mailing boxes. Most drivers are underpaid for the amount of work they put in.
good,"How much can you say?  Get to work at 1 a.m., offload trucks at a very fast rate until 8 am."
good,A normal day in the workforce. You have good days and bad days like any other job. You can learn more than enough to help you get through in life and in the work environment.
good,"The work was easy, good pay, the coworkers were nice and friendly."
good,Fast pace place to work; work hours are very suspect. Use to be able to communicate and conversay very well but now it's hard to do that. Maybe it new management.
good,A typical day at FedEx it would be very noisy we would unload so many cans/ trucks and toss the packages on the line. I learned by working for a company like FedEx that you always have to come prepared and ready to work.Your attention must be strictly on the task at hand and safety is the top priority. Manangement was very straight forward.The workplace culture was very fun yet serious everyone came together as a team!The hardest part of the job was lifting packages that where extremely heavy without any assisiance. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting off.
good,day to day operations are easy as long as you do your job. however the management only cares about their bonuses and not the actual needs the company needs to operate effectively. cutting hours and short staffing locations but then wonders why the job isn't getting done in a timely manner
good,very hard work pace type of job . only to be able to work 4 hours a day . not enough money at the time can barley take care of your bills  in other things.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is creating a bond with my co-workers. The hardest part of the job is the software of the scanners freezes, stops working, or goes too slow. A typhical day at work is high-paced, energetic, lively, and short with ranging from 3-5 hours."
good,"Great Part Time Job, hours works well with anyone who has a day job.  Pay reflects the job expectation, but can always be better considering the physical demands on your body."
good,"Not too many benefits for such a big company, no bonuses no Christmas parties, the pay isn't that great but they keep adding to your job description, management is Ok some are too close with their employees so it seems that those are the ones that get promoted."
good,I liked working there but you have to be able to give your whole day up. You usually start out as part time and have to work 10 years to get a full time day route.
good,"Great benefits but management did not care about staff!  They offer medical, dental, pension, 401k, vacation, personal and sick pay."
good,Federal Express has been nothing but a learning experience from personal to business attributes. My position as a Offload Teamleader is very critical due to the time restraints for productivity and distribution of goods and packages. The hardest part of the job is ensuring to follow all policies and procedures correctly while directing and supervising other people's work in a timely manner. The operation can only run as good as the upper management gives good information and is on task with daily operations.
good,mangement needs to do a better job with communicattions with employees. good benefits. needs to provide better work/life balance.
good,A great work area is the most important thing you must provide for your employees.  When everybody works together you wouldn't have to worry about not being able to completing a task because of the in depth teamwork is a vital part for your organization foundation to lay exceptional groundwork.  When you have teamwork and great leaders in your company the sky isn't the limit because you will pass the moon and go beyond the sun.  Great energy is always running to great area of trust and stability.  When one of your team members are down a well rounded company would have other workesr notice and use them as a crutch for them to thrive in the economy.
good,"I really enjoyed working at FedEx everyone was really nice. Management could use some improvement & they could have more perks for the employees! Over all  pay was good, hours were good and paid time off was great ! Very easy job, no brainer,  but physical."
good,Lots of hard work if you are a motivated person. Gets easier after a couple months due to knowledge of how things work.  Managers are very nice.  Sometimes not enough hours if you are a package handler.
good,"Nice place to work, but the part time work is not worth it. looking for more full time so i can put my skills to work with room for advancement........."
good,"Very demanding position.only part time hours available.overtime waves over onto next check."
good,I've worked for the company for 20 years I'm just tired of driving out here to Dallas and also they can't seem to keep enough employees so I have to keep going back to the night shift    If I were to move to a closer location to my house I would lose my seniority
good,"FedEx was an alright place to work. I spent most of my time loading trailers on the dock. As such, there are a few things that are to be expected, noise, a fast pace, our facility was not climate controlled and so on. If you are in shape, don't mind the noise, have steel toed work boots, and don't mind breaking a sweat its an honest living."
good,"This is a good and healthy environment who is looking to improve their programming skills. The management is good, the daily tasks are more flexible and they can extend longer than expected to be finished."
good,"Fedex was a good company... My job was pick ups and deliveries, working on a timely schedule every day."
good,"1 or 2 workers can ruin your whole experience. "
good,"Very early morning due to a incompetence of truck loaders."
good,Falta de promociones esas son dedazo y el sueldo es bajo para lo que haces es elitista unos ganan más por ser de otra razón social los nuevos y multipack gaban la mitad o menos por la misma labor el ambiente laboral es muy bueno
good,"FedEx is a great company to work for if you like fast-pace work. But if you do not do well under stress, i would not recommend this job."
good,"Well, I  work the graveyard shift. Its just like any other job. There's good people and bad people, good days and bad days. The pay is good only because they know no one would do it for anything less than $13"
good,Working at FedEx can be rough at times but hard work pays off it is fast paced and not much down time it is great for someone who likes hard labor.
good,"very tiring fast pace lifting boxes, loading semi-trucks and unloading only part-time work was available at the time I was hired. would not refer anyone to work there only as last resort."
good,"Load FedEx trucks for 4 hours it was a seasonal position and I wasn't to fond of the position temperature was based on the weather I worked in the summer so it was always hot, understaffed at the time so we had to work in multiple trucks at a time."
good,"for a loader, this company will yell and holler trying to keep a person from burning out. But, it does provide great benefits and work life balance."
good,My opinion of the job is that it was very tiring. You go in and get to work for 4 to 4.5 hours or even more depending the day or how many boxes for that day.Management could have been a lot better but all in all the co workers are what made the day interesting. The hardest part was waking up at 3:30 am every day.
good,"Good place to work its just hard work, and dangerous if your not careful. You have to have a tuff skin cause the supervisor  is a little crass. Best part is that the employees sing and definitely make the best out of work."
good,I enjoyed working for the company. They provided a stable working environment with ongoing training. The pay was decent and the hours were great.
good,"It was an alright place to work. Uncertain daily schedules (don't know what time to start the next day before the next day), and strenuous physical labor, both things eventually contributed to my leaving. For about two hours a day you have to pack as many packages (sometimes over 100 lbs) as you can into a truck as fast as you can. However, should those things not bother you, this could be the place for you."
good,"Fedex is a good company to work for, its fast pace and exciting. Best thing about it, is everyday is different and time flies. The pay is good and so is the benifits."
good,"A typical day of work was simply coming to work and doing routine forklift driving, loading and unloading freight trailers. This job provided me the opportunity to learn more about the transportation business and forklift experience. While working for the company most of the co workers and management was good to work with as long as effort was made by myself. The hardest part of the job was the occasional heavy lifting. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that there wasn't much change in the work."
good,FedEx use to be a great company to work.  The benefits change and the quality hiring of employees has changed.  There is no set standard for the company anymore.
good,"Got to know co-workers well, worked outside in the dead of winter during the Christmas season, enjoyed the hard work, did not enjoy the night shift or going through security to get to the conveyor belts"
good,Overall not a bad place to work. Management and co-workers were friendly and supportive. I would say the real problem is with the corporate management where like so many other companies common sense and reasonable expectations get trampled on in the pursuit of higher profits.
good,"This an graveyard shift from 12am to 430am."
good,Every fast paced* learned a lot about shipping & receiving* Enjoyed working with others even some that did not energy time keep up.
good,"Loading truck was challenging for me at first but once i got the hang of it. i did it seeing all the packages, sometimes i got burried int eh truck with all them boxes i'm only 4'10 lol but no it was a good job to do i learned a lot of things from FedEx you have to work fast thats for sure"
good,"Day starts off loading trucks at 6am then depart the terminal to deliver packages. "
good,"arrive at 5 am, wait on packages to be unloaded to the floor. i pick them up and then load it in the truck. Trucks loaded by 9. Leave by 9:30 drive and upload packages all day until the last package i can get done from the hours of 3:00 until 6:00"
good,"The work atmosphere was toxic.....that is why I resigned. Too many boss' not enough workers. Although my job was fun, the environment was a challenge."
good,Most of the coworkers I enjoy working with. Most of the management favor their close friends they work and people get away with things they shouldn't.
good,Great company to work for with supportive Senior Management. Ground level management needs more training and development as they struggle with fair treatment of their employees. All about numbers and not focused on quality enough. Outside of 1 or 2 Managers there is no concern for front line employees growth and development. Lot of red tape and politics.
good,"As a supervisor you are expected to work 10 hours a day, or until the duties assigned to your shift is complete.  They have a wonderful work model and purpose, and are a business icon."
good,this job is different. i worked loading planes and running crews of 3-10 i also got to drive gse equipment meaning tugs loaders and belt loaders
good,"This was a hard job for me to keep. I wasn't able to keep up with overtime demand and the work schedule was messing with my sleep. This is all personal problems but it was important for me to keep a good schedule."
good,I would of loved to stay with company if they offered away to switch areas to something that would of been easier for my bad back.  People are ok but they don't offer as much as people think
good,"I hated everyday that I worked at this company because I worked outside in all of the elements.  I liked my coworkers which were the only reasons why I stayed as long as I did.  Furthermore, I was glad when I was called to be a state intern in Nashville, TN because that was my escape away from being a modern day slave."
good,Working at Fed-Ex was face paced. A typical day at work is packaging mail into a very big package. I sort mail from the conveyer belt. I learned how to scan mail and package mail. Sort through mail and fix packages. Co-workers were very nice and helpful. The hardest part of the job was having to sort all the heavy mail by myself. Getting sore everyday and drained for eight hours a day. The most enjoyable part was having fun co-workers whose company I enjoyed.
good,Good place to work you get to make your schedule to follow once you get your manifest.The hardest part of the jobs is making sure all package are picked up on time. The most enjoyable part is making all pickup on time
good,"FedEx had great pay, hours, and benefits. The issue I had with fedex was that it had bad management and had a horrible job work/ life balance. Other than that, I learned a lot and had fun."
good,"you won't get any hours ,paycheck sucked badly and I was a courier, the managers showed favoritism to certain employees"
good,I started out heading to my work area. Someone came to train me and showed me how to learn the job that I will be on. The co-worker were very friendly and management. The job was kind of easy and I kind of liked the job.
good,"Fun work place with great co-workers. Lots of politics but that's to be expected to any workplace. Learned to perform many task and solve complex issues in a timely manner, no thanks to management. All about the numbers but that's to be expected from such a big company."
good,"A lot of heavy lifting and in some areas, the work load is much worse than other areas. Easy job, pretty mindless but gets annoying."
good,A typical day at work would be working in a fast pace environment while keeping very high standards as well as handling packages from all around the country keeping our customers happy with high quality customer service. Everyday we are to meet same or more  production keeping our customers from delay on any package. What I've learned working for FedEx is how maintain expectations by managers as well as pushing myself to go beyond what is asked. I've enjoyed working with a diverse 300 co workers. Hardest part of the job might be the physical part but all is well if kept maintenance with diet and good exercise. The most enjoyable part about my job is being able to serve thousands around the globe with great quality customer service.
good,A typical day at work. Will start with me pre tripping my truck load the fright on my truck. Communicate with routes in my are to make sure we are good and going to make service. After hit the road where I have a dispatch to communicate with to help me out.
good,A typical day would consist of scanning packages ad loading packages on trucks. I learned teamwork and hard work from working at FedEx. The management was mediocre not enforcing load rates to the slower workers. The hardest part of the job was helping those catch up who didn't put in the effort to maintain efficiency. The most enjoyable part was the isolation in the trailer and having no distractions.
good,"As a switcher you drive semi-truck on the yard: organizing trailers on the yard, look for a specific trailer to bring back to the dock to be unloaded or loaded, operate a computer in the semi-truck, work with 5 to 8 co-switchers switching trailers in and out of 130 docks and maintain over 200 trailers on the yard. Working as a team is crucial to maintaining orderly work flow on the yard. The hardest part of the job is working in the rain and limited room to back up a trailer to the dock if a Fedex Contractor Driver doesn't park correctly in their parking spot or blocks the loading or unloading dock with their truck. This job is easy and enjoyable to work if you always aware of your surrounding, be safe, and follow all safety procedure to checking the trailer of no people inside before pulling the trailer off."
good,"I start at 6:15 a.m. we have a daily meeting about the work load at 6:20 am we sort out packages so they can be delivered to their designated location. Also help other route drivers deliver their overload work so every package can be delivered on time."
good,":typical day at work would consist of organizing your truck truck before you leave. when you leave the terminal you must try to deliver all packages to the best of your ability."
good,"Great place to work. Accountability is lacking in the building. "
good,Super early shifts and your putting boxes into trucks. The automatic belt doesn't stop. But the pay is great. Its good if you can handle fast paced environment.
good,the job is beneficial and fun to work at and it also helps with finding other jobs at the same company but in a different location.
good,"The first of day I am starting worked overnight, I have a good experience of my job. I am doing unloaded the boxes into trucks. My partner and I were help togethers as teams. Sometimes I do all myself all alone while partner isn't here. I did communicate with hearing people as use tablet paper and pens. we understand each other as communication. "
good,Work generally involves taking packages off a loader belt and assorting them on an assembly line for different destinations. The job teaches you about expediency and organization.
good,"Mon - Fri, 06:30pm - 06:30am collect the load from the local depot at Weston-s-Mare and drive it to the hub in Newcastle-under-Lyme. Return via Swindon. "
good,"I loved the people, including the managers. I learned to tolerate the hours. I hated to work out in the weather. There was no way to get cool enough in the summer and no way to stay warm enough in the winter, no matter how many layers of clothing I had on."
good,Good place to work with opportunity to advance from within. work independently without management and at your own pace within reason.
good,"Sort and handle packages with a sense of urgency. "
good,"a typical day at work would be going into a high-tempertured building, cold or hot and being able to keep up with loading the trucks.i learned that you should never lack behind or slow down. the co-workers there were quiet most of the time. the hardest part of the job was liftings packages yourself when help was not available. the most enjoyable part was Break."
good,"Busy days, time goes by quickly, very stressful but no day was the same.  Great management made it great to work for, terrible management made it a horrible career and time for change."
good,"able to enjoy the outdoors but with long miles to drive under a minimal time crunch. some days are longer than others, not appreciated by management."
good,"nice to work there. worked ofr Allied Barton as security. post was at Fed Ex , Jax Airport. Fed Ex was an interesting company. the job of scanning employers items, such as baggage boxes.  etc .  Allied was a good company, Nice benefits"
good,FedEx Smartpost is a growing company with very good future opportunities.  It was my first management position and I learned a lot on how to act as a manager and what is expected of me.
good,"I like the FedEx Field Stadium , It was a great experience . Very face paced customer friendly environment . The only thing I didn't like was the hours and pay"
good,"A typical day at work starts any where from 6:15 am to 7:15 am  I load up my truck and I'm on the road by 8:45 am . I start making deliveries.at around 9:10 until about 2:30 pm i then take a break  and start doing pick ups until about 5:00 pm."
good,"Working at Fedex can be quite challenging when working with people with an immature mind-set and managers who don't take the time to care about our work environment; well maybe my staff management but im sure its not like that everywhere. Understanding my job allows me to practice three key components; awareness, communication, and persistency. Within my 5yrs of Fedex experience i have climbed to the top away from my struggles: and for that i thank God:) Being a Lead Supervisor allows me to see what it really takes to become manager of the company and how dedicated i must be to make my job a complete success. The only thing that makes my job great is being able to reach out to young people my age or younger in understanding their future careers and growth with the company, and sometimes it helps me in various situations. My goal in achieving life deals with prioritizing; God first, family, then my Job which helps me become successful."
good,"Na Filial Itajaí temos boa parte dos dias a todo vapor, produção ao máximo para atender as necessidades do cliente, pela vasta demanda de pedidos é comum colaboradores exercer atividades em mais de 1 setor durante o mês, aumentando o seu conhecimento."
good,The work is easy and stress free and my co workers are nice and helpful. Management is okay. There really isn't a hard part to my day. The best part of my day would be laughing with my co workers and still being able to work.
good,A typical day at work is loading packages at 400 packages per hour with some drink breaks. What I learned was to manage my workload and work at a steady pace.Management moved me around too much. Co-workers were there in a pinch. The hardest part of the job was that it was during school. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I was done with the job and doing physical work although the plus was working out during the job.
good,Good job but I wish the FedEx give more opportunity to grow without spend lot and not been paid  for some classes and have more couching from other managers and Sr managers.
good,Working for FedEx is a learning experience. The things that people don't tell you is that even though you train and work with people. You are responsible for things beyond your control.
good,"I acted as a package handler. I came to an unusual realization. Some of the smallest packages weigh over 100 lbs. while long packages have virtually nothing. This job would scale employees. The reason I was working this job was as a matter of tourism, a taste of life. I always wanted to know what a warehouse job was like so one could apply the proverb, “Be careful what you wish for.” I left this job in spite of scaling of employees thus leading to significantly reduced paychecks. This job was like a child one is ashamed of, one hates his or her actions, but due to blood relations one must love him or her. It is one’s familial duty. There were aspects of this job I hated but multiple activities I liked. As a package handler, I was given responsibility to do remedial tasks on many occasions heavy lifting for the majority of the sort, however, if I complained constantly and in a serious manner I would have lost the job due to negative attitude and poor work morale. I masked a false smile on my face while working. Like I said, I also found thrill in components of my job and found joy while working therefore, not every moment was the smile fake."
good,"Typical day is to clock in, stretch and get to work.i learned how to multitask and work in a fast pace environment. The managers and coworkers get along well and are easy to talk to. The job was not really hard after getting use to the routine and the most enjoyable part of the job was that you are able to be independent."
good,Stand beside a conveyor belt and scan and load packages. I learned great organizational skills. The management was great and very laid back. The co-workers were fun to work with. The hardest part of the job was just getting everything memorized and figured out at first. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to walk around and joke with the drivers and my co-workers.
good,"Scanning packages. T-stacking freight, Loading/Un-loading Freight, Operating Conveyor belt, Completing PST.s, Closing trucks on time."
good,"Before the co workers and i begin working, the supervisors would give us a brief meeting about our work statistics. After the meeting we begin working in our own individual trailers if not to busy. I may load up to one through four trailers a day. Take 30 - 45 minute lunch breaks. One of the hardest parts of the job are getting the IC's in the trailer due to the wait. Most enjoyable part was clocking out of work."
good,"Hardworking "
good,"The place is ok to work for there's quite a few things that need to change, its a poorly ran dock, at times its busy other times its super slow and you are waiting at times 2 hours before you are able to get clocked in. its not a bad place to work for just would not be on my top list of jobs to do."
good,Most enjoyable part is my co-workers. Benefits are good. Hard to advance. I've learned a lot about custom brokerage market.
good,"while working at FedEx I’ve had to learn not only my position in package handling, but everyone else’s position as well. This was necessary to allow me to fill-in just in case a worker was unable to work their shift. As such, I’ve learned to work in the job’s three divisions of labor: loading and unloading, sorting where I received packages from a conveyor belt and directed them to their proper destinations, either home delivery or ground delivery; and scanning, where each package is scanned to be loaded or pre-loaded before they are organized by division then taken to each division’s specific truck. The experience has given me insight and knowledge of many facets of the delivery business."
good,"Fun, productive, and busy...Always meeting and greeting a variety of people that you get an opportunity to assist with choosing popular clothing."
good,A typical day consisted of a safety meeting before shift. The hardest part of the job was working with boxes and the heat.The most enjoyable part of the job was the people.
good,"A typical shift lasts about 2.5 hours, depending on the start time.  However, the higher ups could scale back the number of workers at any time, sending workers home early."
good,"I enjoyed working at FedEx for a short period of time.  Days were difficult at times, but my team always assisted me."
good,scanning and loading trucks managing 10 employees on a assembly line
good,"I would go in at about 11 p.m to the ramp, where airplanes landed to be offloaded, after offloading them I would go help inside stacking boxes, or putting them on a conveyor belt. Then upload a couple more planes, then head home at about 4 a.m. I learned how planes work, the configuration of MD-10, DC-30, 727, and 757 planes, and how FedEx delivers its packages quick and on time. Management was supportive and helpful. Co-workers were amazing and supportive as well. The hardest part of the job was getting used to the graveyard schedule, but the most enjoyable part of work was working in teams at the ramp, being able to achieve our goal quick and efficiently."
good,"Loading trucks in sequence to prepare for home delivery.Organization is a must.Management was their to assist in all matters.Co-workers all rely on each other to shift workload and provide moral support.Not being certain of dispatch times could be frustrating,but once on the route you are independent throughout the day."
good,"Extremely heavy lifting"
good,It would have been a better job if there were more opportunities from growth.
good,"A typical day at work would last about 5-6 hours and 7 hours at the most. Each day I learned how to construct walls inside of trailers using packages as they travel down the chute, onto the truck's rollers. The work environment was safe and positive, co-workers and management got along fine, the day was always smooth and successful. The hardest part about this job is building within a truck that has a faster flow of packages. This causes you to think swiftly and make as few mistakes as possible in order to keep your trailer organized with a constant flow from the chute, to the point it which you are building. The most enjoyable part about this job are the co-workers who keep you motivated and comfort you with casual conversation."
good,The job worked with my school time and paid nicely. Yet wish is was not a season job.
good,"Your day starts off with a team meeting on the statistics from the previous day. Everyone has a goal to strive for and rewards are given (i.e. T-shirts, bags etc.) which makes working hard worth the effort. The management was really supportive but also stern. Hardest part of the job: constant lifting and bending. Had a quota to match per truck load/unload. The most enjoyable part is close to the end of the day, breakfast or any food would be served to workers that was paid for by management. (i.e. Chick-Fil-A, Cracker Barrel etc.)"
good,"laoding and unloading trailers . helping co workers to pick up productivity or to meet deadlines. i love how fast pace and demanding the job was, ""keep you on your toes"","
good,"I have learned a lot at this job. I have learned how important teamwork is to complete the tasks. I have improved exceptionally on my quality of work in conjunction with my quantity of work completed. The hardest part of the job is when we are short-handed, also, when there is an excessive amount of packages going out. The enjoyable part of the job is knowing that I play an important role in the success of of company. I have also learned the importance of being a leader by seeing how our management steps in to help when the packages become backed up. My day at work consists of splitting packages to send down the belt to the correct location. I then proceed to scan packages to go in the truck as I load them in and organize. I have to go back and forth between loading my two trucks and to the belt to make sure my trucks receive all the correct packages."
good,FedEx was a great experience for me being young and just entering into a workplace. I learned a lot about teamwork and time management while being employed there.
good,"pracę w firmie FEDEX oceniam na dobrą,miła atmosfera stałe kursy do klijentów,zrządzająca kadra wymagająca a presonel wykształcony."
good,"My typical day at work was very chaotic. It was not a very great experience for me. Unfortunately, with this being my first job, I didn't learn a whole lot that I could of used in the future. The management seemed two-faced and didn't care about the needs or well-being of their employees. The hardest part of my job was lifting boxes that were way too heavy for me with no help and management always telling me that I was never good enough."
good,A typical Day for me is working in a fast paced environment for four hours.What I learned is communication is important to get our job done correctly.Management is incredible their involved in all operations my co-workers are good and willing to help.The hardest part of the job is working outside on the ramp when its raining.The most enjoyable part of the job is driving the tugs used to pull dollies that the cans are on.
good,As data encoder we always type as usual. I learned always double check what we doing to avoid typo error. The management it is not bad or good but for me their management they need improvement. My co workers is to fun to be with they are kind and politely For me the hardest type is to have a error but it is part of job so I need to accept but the job is easy for me. The most enjoyable part  is to make fun with my co workers and I like my job.
good,"Basically lift packeges/sort Documents "
good,Really good if you want to be paid to work out.  Good hours if you go to school in the day.  Not the greatest pay for work but better than some.
good,"loading and unloading trucks with packages"
good,Learned how to pace myself to endure the physical labor that was expected during my shift of loading and unloading trucks.
good,"I've learned a lot about the mailing business working at FedEx. the people that I worked for were some of the best people ever, the work was fast paced but the wasn't hard at all. I had a lot of great times and the best thing about it I enjoyed the job."
good,"Very physically demanding, need to be in good shape to lift packages throughout the day"
good,"Not too bad of a place to work, they took care of there employees"
good,"Good job, most of the people who worked the belt with me were great. The hours were hard to work and the truck drivers weren't always the nicest, but if you could keep a clean, organized truck for them they were alright."
good,Here I worked early mornings which consisted of sorting packages of various sizes and weight. What I learned was how to move quickly and pay close attention to detail. The management team I felt was unhelpful and unwilling to listen to employee's opinions. My co-workers are hard to describe as I've had very little interaction with them. We all worked in separate departments independantly. The hardest part of this job was the early hours but the most enjoyable part is being able to leave early and enjoy the rest of your day.
good,"Its not hard work. The only problem is management, In the three years I have worked for the company I hae had four  managers and three senior managers."
good,"Palatalized boxes on the correct pallet as they were being sorted, unloaded trucks, loaded bags on the assembly belt ."
good,"Punch in time card, manager gives us orders on what to do, sorting packages, looking out for jams in machines, very physical job."
good,It was an over night job and the planes would come in and we would work hard to get it unloaded. We took our time and did things right and at a pace where everyone would get things done and not get to tired before we had to reload the plane again.
good,They do have good pay and benefits but not good opportunity placement i can get from their warehouse.
good,"I loved working here because you don't work everyday, watching football game for free and as interacting with the fun loving customers."
good,.A typical work day consisted of loading packages on long beg trailers.
good,"We would expect a high number of volume almost daily with very little room for error, in between 10,000 and 15,000 packages a day. Handling so many packages in just 3 and a half to 4 hours isn't for everyone I learned. We witnessed a plethora of people come and go through the company doors, some lasted a week while others lasted only an hour. Management for the most part was reliable but only to a certain extent, which was exactly the way we liked it. The more management stayed out of the way, the more we got done. I have nothing to say about my co-workers simply because that was one of the reasons for doing the job we were doing. There was a real sense of brotherhood especially in a time of urgency."
good,"typical day when you come in duty you need to get all your equipment that you will be needing in your whole day. check your vehicle and your supplies and start to sort your deliveries. "
good,"eSOT application allows contracting entity to track the shipping/sales details and allows an admin user to configure the ownership rules that will determine how the Level IDs are processed by using the Sales Owner Order Management screen in the application.  In addition to providing a GUI for users to directly use the eSOT application, a web service is provided for searching for owners, delegates and alignments, and also for assigning a new owner or delegate to a Level ID.  This web service is also used by other application ePRS (Enterprise Pricing Request System) to have access to the data provided by eSOT."
good,"descent, they pay good, but very time consuming, you get more hours working on fulltime"
good,i got the job through a temp agency. Fedex was looking for temporary employees for the christmas season.
good,"I've learned a lot during my time here.  I've learned how to effectively manage a group of 30+ Service Desk associates. I've learned about communication between various groups.  "
good,"You never know what you will deal with on a daily basis, learned a lot about health care and the people that work in the field. Worst part of the job by far was management"
good,"one day at work , I learned that you have always be patience and never fold under pressure . the management at the was fair , my co workers where fair , very supportive of each other . everyone believed in team work because of the job at task. the hardest part of the job was not being able to have a break because of hire part time."
good,Good work enviorment. scanning and processing packages for delivery or pickup.  Accepting signatures. Good co workers and managers. Hardest part of job around holidays in November and December.  Enjoyable part the benefits and other incentives you can recieve
good,"Clock in. Make sure trailers are open through the scanner. Wax chutes. "
good,"Work hand and hand with different government agencies *FDA *US Customs, etc...."
good,A typical day at work consisted of scanning and loading up to 400 packages an hour into FedEx delivery trucks.  Management was helpful but demanded high quality performance.  The hardest part of the job was the four to five straight hours of bending over and stacking packages.  It demanded a lot from your body as the boxes varied in weight.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the relationships I was able to form with my co-workers.
good,"A professional results-oriented team player with over 7 year’s experience in quality control, logistics and customer service.  Major strengths are in self-motivation, perseverance, and team work.   Also, excellent interpersonal skills with a proven track record and disciplined work habits.  Work well under pressure."
good,"A typical day at work is set-up your truck in the most effective and efficient manner to make service. You work independently, which requires you to make sound judgments in difficult situations. Customer focus is a must. The hardest part of the job is the unreasonable demands the managers place on drivers."
good,"FedEx is rated in Top 3 companies list of Great Place to Work in UAE."
good,"the job was easy but, the work was mostly done during evenings and nights"
good,Arrive at work at 2:00 am and begin sorting incoming freight to correct delivery trucks for the days delivery routes.
good,Good job but it was a part time job. I was looking for a full time job.
good,"it was an ok job. pay was decent, insurance was good and the benefits were as well. Very physical job"
good,I have been with the company for almost 13 years. I  started as a part-time admin clerk in the evenings. I have moved up the ladder and now I am an Operations Manager with the company.
good,"As a FedEx Express Courier the pressure on you is very high. You do get compensated very well for the work and the benefits for tuition reimbursement and other perks are great but the health benefits are not that great.  Their Values get interrupted with the culture that is exuded due to the way management treats you because of the numbers/quota they are trying to reach. As far as the job security they pride themselves on not laying employees off and that is true. As long as you do your job you will have a job. Work life balance can get a little tough sometimes since the only thing that is certain is your start time. You do not have a set end time. Sometimes you'll work 6 hours, 8 hours or even 14hours. Another great thing is guaranteed pay. As long you don't call off during the pay week you will get paid for 32hrs even if you only worked 22hrs. If you go over 40hrs that's time and a half. Pay day is every Friday."
good,this was my first part time job.. it was hard but it grew on me... i in joy my co-worker an the management love...
good,"A typical day at work is to unload all of the sort, separate packages, scan, and stack packages."
good,"Fun days at work "
good,"As a package handler, all you do is load trucks at a pace that you have to be athletic to keep up with. As a manager, there is always presort meetings with other managers, setting up the area and having scanners ready for employees. Since I came from the bottom and became a manager, I learned a lot of things dealing with the delivery field. Some of the management was good and helped you when you needed the tools to exceed, some on the other hand did not. Some just did not care and shouldn't have been managers. most of my co-managers were the good ones. We all got along and you have to be a team to exceed and set records. Hardest part of the job was the stress that came along with it and the wear and tear on your body. You have to come from a sport back ground or physical working background to be able to do this job correctly. The most enjoyable part was actually working and being physical."
good,Shifts consist of working 5:45am to 2:15pm or from 10:30am to 7:00pm.
good,"-A typical day involves me trying to get my work done in an oftentimes fast paced and stressful shipping environment where time is always of the essence."
good,It was ok when i first started at fedex I learned how work with otherco workers better learned how to pick and
good,The good thing about this job is that u never kow wat the day will bring and dats what i like the most is to have a new day bring something new to overcome..
good,"all jobs have there pros and cons, all we did was the same ting day in day out . in the end i felt like a robot"
good,"Some of the managers make this place very difficult to work there. If you come in and do your work, don't breathe too loud, don't take bathroom breaks, and can stay there almost all day, you're a perfect fit!"
good,"It is only a 3 hour job at most. "
good,"Overall I do like this job because it allows me to have some spending money & still have a life during the summer time. What I don't like is the minimal amount of hours. Most of the time you can never go over your allowed 25 hours per week. You can work there for months, possibly even years & still not get paid time off, or any kind of paid vacation/sick leave. Most of the managers are laid back except for a couple of them. You're expected to do your job at standard or else they could possibly write you up & send you home if you don't. No cellphones allowed, no watches or any personal clocks allowed, no music or anything of that sort. You are basically cut off from the outside world for 1 - 10 hours. Some days working in the warehouse does feel like a sweatshop. Cameras are watching your every move. Some co-workers are nice, others are stuck up & have their own little cliques & won't care for talking to you at all. Tri-State temps get all the hours when the FedEx employees barely get any. The job can be laid back if you can get used to it. It can be miserable if you're not adaptive to change. This is a good job to start off with, but its not a good job to live on your own & pay all of your bills."
good,"The work can be tough especially on hot summer days.  But they're set up well to work with students and provide decent pay, benefits, and tuition reimbursement.  Management can be fickle, but they are fair."
good,"Had to arrive at 6AM delivered packages on a time constraint, learned time management, co workers were decent. The hardest part of the job was making the 10am delivery deadlines."
good,"FedEx is a good place to work, if you can handle the work.  As a former really fat person, despite much weight loss I had trouble keeping up at FedEx.  There were nights when the boxes would never stop coming, and my body just couldn't keep up.  It's definitely a hard job.  However, the pay is good and the benefits offered are top tier."
good,"Great company to work for."
good,a typical day at work was hard because you sometimes have to help lazy people with work. If you are a hard worker you will get taken advantage of.
good,Usually you'll start with package handling but you can work into other positions after a year of service. For handlers the pay is way better than UPS. For drivers the pay isn't that great. It can be fun yet parts of the job are really stressful. 
good,"As a Backline Call Centre Agent I have my own job description, being a Problem Parcels Administrator. I start my shift at 08:00 assist with taking call centre call for 4 hours. From 13:00 I start with the problem parcels emails, print the documents that need to be attached to the parcel and prepare for the 16:00 hand over to the exports department. I have learned about all the different paperwork that needs to be attached to a parcel in order to be shipped to another country whether internationally of over boarder. Our management is very supportive and trains new comers very well. My co-workers are also supportive, they are willing to assist at any given time, we get along well overall I don't have any complains. "
good,Some of the most back breaking work I have every did. lifting and turning with heavy objects.
good,"A usual day starts off by coming into the building getting checked by security at the gate entrance. Once done we get the materials we need to do the job, such as scanners. Before we can start however there may be times we will have to wait before each package handler is assigned a trailer to work in. The work was not easy as you had to make sure you scanned every package that came down the chute into the trailer and stacked them appropriately so that the don't get damaged and can hold a lot more packages. You also had to be very quick or you would get backed up with packages and would be behind and end up leaving the other trailers you managed backed up as well due to wasted time. At times, if you were unable to manage your trailers, management would come in and lend some assistance. But if it were happening too often you may either get fired or they may send you to another area within the building that may require help. The co-workers were not the worst but they at times shirked off duty, missed days, or just didn't help out others that were in need of help to help move the workload along. The hardest part of the job was managing the trailers because you were up against two opposing forces, either scan them and stack them in order or scan them and just make sure every package is in the trailer. Management would berate you if your trailer was not clean and packages were well stacked and some only wanted to make sure everything was scanned and in the trailer, usually wanting you to focus more on moving quickly instead of worrying about cleanliness. Finally the most enjoyable"
good,-Met with customer's providing them with information as to all the services we had available
good,"Inventory, shipping and receiving, palletizing and sorting product. Everyone at the workplace was always helpful and understanding. The hardest part was working a variation of 3rd shift hours, but I enjoyed the pace of the workplace."
good,It is a good job to work part-time and it is very fast paced. It is definitely not for a lazy person. Its a great 2nd job for a person.
good,part time job about 5 hours a day. fast paced job have to meet deadlines. start time on mondays is 2 a.m. and Tues. - Friday is 4:30am . The pay is good but the job is part time which is about 20-25 hours a week. Most of the job is driving forklift.
good,"hard work ,fast paced,work with friendly people, would like more hours."
good,This is a very good company to work for to learn the business of this field.
good,fed ex was a good part- time i had during schhol. co- workers was fun to be with. i enjoy the work i got out of it. i learn to stay humble.
good,Great benefits. Communication is disorganized. Management nneds training in coaching and managing skills
good,"At FedEx ground i was an unload expert which meant exactly that, unloading trucks. There was an hourly amount of packages that needed to be taken out. It was a very physical job that was non-stop, lifting packages in excess of 100 lbs. Plus, very oddly shaped or over large packages. The hardest part of the job was the hours, i started at 3 am. and ended at about 6-7 am."
good,"A typical day at work includes managing all lower level employees on the floor (including production, self-serve, and shipping area). Also, manage all production print jobs coming in via e-mail, online, or walk-in. Tracking all print jobs from beginning (order entry) to end (quality check table). Responsible for quality checking all print jobs before calling customer to let them know print order(s) is (are) done."
good,"If you are looking for a stress-free easy job, this is the place to be. There never seems to be an urgency, deadlines are never met, but it is not frowned upon, and the work environment is very slow paced. I will say my co-workers are good people and enjoyable to work with. The most difficult part of my job is trying to keep myself busy, not bored and being able to find something to do."
good,"FedEx is a good company to work for, but like any other company there is much room for improvement. I enjoyed my time with this company, but I felt like I was stuck in neutral with no where to advance. Most of my co-workers have been with the company for 10, 16, and even 20 years and were still in the position they started off at which is a part-time package handler."
good,Work early a.m. hours.
good,"delivering packages in a highly timely manor, picking up packages,"
good,"Great compensation and benefits, but there seems to be a lack of balance between work and home life. Unfortunately advancement is based off of who you know and not your qualifcations our experience."
good,I loved working at FedEx Ground. If you're in need of a part-time job then this is definitely the place for you though I wouldn't consider it a place to earn an income where you could live on your own.
good,"courier on the old air force base in plattsburgh, not great management, not great with following the rules and very biased towards certain workers"
good,FedEx is a well established company operating in 220 countries. I learned how to manage a department at an enterprise level with the best security engineers in the business
good,Communicate with management and user personnel. Compare disputed merchandise with original requisitions and information from invoices and for returned goods. Keep records of customer interactions or transactions.
good,"A night working at Fedex, is very fast pace and productive. The Beginning of the night I unloaded carts and placed the freight on the Belt line and at the end of the Night i Stack the Freight in cans and Loaded the cans on the aircraft. On Fiday's after all the cans are loaded we're usually loading trucks. Management weren' t always in sight but the co-workers were fun and exciting. I learned how to work productively and still keep it enjoyable with co-workers. The Hardest part of the job is on friday many co-workers drag. it was a great experience."
good,"Fed ex is a face paced, environment to work in. I learned to be precise, sufficient, and to perform in inclement weather. Managers are very informative and creative with work solutions. The hardest part is the high demand for performing at a face pace safely with traffic volume and lifting heavy freight at a repetition even when you're not feeling %100. The most enjoyable part of my job are the other fed ex employees who team up with you and to get the job done."
good,I have to be there everyday at 4am from tues-sat not enuff hours managers are cool my co-workers are there when i need them the hardest part about my job is dealing with diffrent weights all day you might get a box up to 140 pounds are something like that and the times i enjoy at work is joking with my co-workers
good,"Get in at 5:30am for review of prior day and dispatch. After dispatch, plan for next day, and anything unusual coming up. Afternoons focus on training and follow-up on assignments. Address contractor, customer, and employee concerns as they arise. Leave between 5-6:30pm."
good,Cargo handling is a responsibility to meet customers demands my co-workers are friendly so is the management but as well serious its a team work effort there might be some heavy loads but after the hard work we enjoy a nice home cooked meal provided from our boss
good,"Working over at FedEx SmartPost can be stressful at times because of the heavy box pressure and constant walking. But, overall it's a pretty okay job. Working there helps you learn how to manage multiple groups of people like line management. Also, you learn how to become a better leader by standing yourself out there as a hard working role model to all employees. FedEx SmartPost is a work with very friendly employee, and once you break out of your silent zone everyone is like family. The hardest part about the job is scheduling your plans around work because FedEx SmartPost is all about calling a hotline to see what time you will start. What I like about this job we have a multicultural employees, and I always get to learn new things about other cultures."
good,"When I get to work I am greeted by my co-workers, which is nice and encouraging. I check all of the incoming printing orders. I review them for accurate pricing and overal completion. I consult with customers and management about best methods and practices for printing. The Center Manager encourages us to better ourselves, but does not really do so himself. I have great respect for him but he is a do as I say not as I do kind of manager. The hardest part of my job is fixing the mistakes of the shift before mine. I am often placed in a position of redoing things that should not have been done wrong. I also often work shifts alone. Running the entire store without help or breaks. The most enjoyable part of my job is the gratitude I receive from the people I help."
good,"Work place is laid back enough to get personal relationship with the customers. but can be busy to where multitasking is the key to survive. I multitask well there and i had great relations with my customers within the Roswell, Marietta, and Woodstock area. Descent perks at times I get to have fun showing of my skills with helping customers develop signs and logos; or just to meet there need immediately."
good,"Customer Service, Damage control, Data entry, Researching addresses."
good,Fedex Hub is a great place for a student who has no financial responsibilities or someone who needs a second job.
good,recheck the load to make sure the correct load is going out.delievery the right package to the correct addrress and making timely pickups
good,the hardest part of the job is trying to get into a full time position. No flexibility on what days you want to work. You have to take what is given to you. You are lucky if you get a really good manager who actually shows concerns for your needs.
good,"Fedex Office can be a great company to work for. At least when it comes to the people. Excellent co-workers and local management is excellent. With wonderful store managers and a District manager that makes herself available to all. Unfortunately this is cancelled out by policies that seem to undercut the store and the employee. Poor salaries that barely meet the ""Living wage"" standard. And in some people's case not even that. Are further complicated by a almost insulting raise schedule and rate. No employee incentives, terrible benefits and just revealed recently. Absolutely horrendous chances for advancement."
good,"dont get me wrong, FedEx is a great company with many benefits. If you havent worked for a shipping company than you have no idea. I am a permanent part time employee with full benefits so I cant complain."
good,at this job it was a very hard one. you had to be physically and mentally able to work this job. but they will give you things such as gatorade when it is hot and hot chocolate when it is cold.
good,FedEx is a cool job if you like to keep busy and work outdoors. Most of the day consist of driving and making deliveries and pick UPS to customers. I've had four different managers since I've been there and the first two were great and two kinda didn't havea good direction of managing but the job is repetitive so its not that hard to get the job done. The coworkers I had were really cool and helped each other make service. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the weather conditions when they were harsh. The most enjoyable part is working outdoors on nice days
good,Job could get tough at times but the staff was friendly and very helpful whenever i needed some help
good,"Working here is fun you do ur job an go home, as long as u doing ur job u have nothing to worry about."
good,"This job is very repetitive. I do exactly the same thing everyday. I enjoy the people I work for, for the most part as well as my peers. I don't really feel like there is a hard part to do the job. The most enjoyable part is having fun with the people that work for me."
good,A typical work day consist working to meet time lines. I learn how to read a map and interact with different personalities. Management was sometime understanding. My co-workers were very pleasant and made it fun to work there. The hardest part of the job was to please customers that were unhappy with the shipper of their packages. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing your route and having a good relationship with your regular customers.
good,"My positon at FedEx was a parcel assistant, which required me to load, unload and scan parcels. Also cleaning the warehouse as needed."
good,my co workers were nice and team players i learned how to unload and load trailer how to use a RF scanner and how to stack and move pallets
good,"Is an employer with great production and commitment to customers. It is a very fast and under high pressure due to the time of delivery. unfortunately does not pay for all the effort made for this and under all the pressure that is applied to employees. the s peer relationships is very good, referring to the first administration are the conditions that the working conditions of employees."
good,"I don’t know what we was on. Five hours of constant movement. No break but I loved it. I got a good workout, but it was the worst thing ever because I was cramped before, during, and after work. Great place for school kids because they have tuition reimbursement, but you have to work for a year before that kicks in."
good,They change the hours of operation all the time and you only get about 15 to 20 hours a week but you cant get a second job because you never know when you are going to have to go in to work and get off work.
good,Working with team members in order to fullfill our customers jobs.
good,Work is routine. Amount of labor varies with events and holidays. No co-worker is ever found idle.
good,Fast pace and steady. The hardest part about this job was the weather. How ever it felt outside was multipied by 2. The most enjoyable part was that it was a great workout and part-time.
good,"A typical day was always busy and went by pretty quickly. It was great finding solutions for people and having the freedom to work independently. The management did get weigh down with much work and wasn't to accessible. I didn't let that be a hindering factor, I stayed with the company for many years. So I enjoyed the independent nature and learned much of my own self management."
good,Most days - clock in and report to dock for loading / unloading of trucks. Pick up bills and schedule. Leave terminal proceed with deliveries / pick ups.
good,Working condittions can be very hot or cold
good,Pay wasnt high enough for the work we did. Work the heck out of you for real. good benefits.
good,The set hours in the evening was convenient for me because of the fact that I attend college full time during the day. work also gives me a good workout for the 5 to 6 hours of work.
good,my manager really didnt know how to talk to people and treated everyone different and special.
good,Working for the company was a great opportunity. I worked for decent managers on my shift and full time was offered to me after a few months.
good,"Management excepts a lot from you, and its a non union job! If there is something you are not happy with you have to fight for yourself! They have nice benefits and retirements plans, and you are vested after five years of employment!"
good,Mostly the job is easy but heavy lifting and steady check weekly but underpaying for this type of job. Overall good excersise and coworkers are cool to hang out
good,tres bon salaire et avantage plus de 800 employer faut aimer travailler physique et a repetitiom
good,Management should be given diversity training on a regular basis.Very cliquish. Promotions don't seem to be given based on any real job related detail or personal employee growth.
good,Temps are treated differently vs Perms across the board. This is really sad at a good place for a career. Temps are hired but its hard to get on permanently. They rather keep recycling techs every 11 months through temp services and retraining individuals instead of just keeping great techs.  A waste of companies money /time that hire FedEx to get the product fixed. If they only KNEW
good,"FedEx would be a better workplace if  the hours for day shift were earlier around 7 or 8 AM and get out between 3-4:30 PM, and choose to stay later if needed. But instead, we get made to come in around 9:00-11 AM, & stay and help other sections, sometimes past our scheduled clock out. Outside of peak, normally 3:00"
good,"My goal at Fed ex is to start driving again. I have 15yrs experience and I feel like they look at me as one of the new guys because I have not been there very long. They see me as a hard worker without much opportunities to move up. I want to move up, I'm very good at what I do and want to make more money."
good,"Fast paced with high expectation of work quality.  Good benefits for the job, just need to keep your work life balance in the forefront.  Just need to do the job with pride and ethics - do what you say, say what you do."
good,Alright has its flaws but is truly a great place to work I would reccomond to a friend and possibly a family memeber its a great experience overall just wish for more hours
good,"I enjoyed being the lead consultant and managing the production flow of the store. I learned how to use Fedex oversize printer, cutting machine, and easy to use document editing system. I enjoyed helping customer with creative design and be a part of growing their businesses. This job gave me the opportunity to be creative and learn helpful tips on how to market my own business."
good,"Awesome company but hard work! Its alot on the body dodging cars,dogs, and thief’s trying to steal from truck. Its a rain or shine job so hope you dont mind getting wet!"
good,We startd at 5am unloading a lorry in to warehouse then help drives load there van then in the afternoon we wood unload van and put parcels in cages then load it on to the lorry
good,"I was a hard worker for going on 5 years at time, it was night shift and the work went out as it came in. Needless to say, it was hustle and bustle, everything is manual and  there's little to no room for advancement due a point system based off senority. I would prefer this job to any high school kid, somebody down on their luck or just trying make stepping stones towards something bigger."
good,Workining in the logistics department has set schedule and fair pay. Would recommend this job to anyone wanting to work at a fast past facility with hardley any management overhead.
good,FedEx is not bad if you are looking for something quick. The work is physically demanding but it is not for everyone. A good job to do during school. I enjoyed the experience.
good,Ótima empresa com um quatro de funcionário encelente e um bom confivel entre os mesmo.
good,"I worked morning shift and it was sometimes a drag to get up that early, I am not a morning person. The pay and benefits are great and my coworkers were for the most part a joy to work with."
good,You do have a lot of benefits which is great but there all only after a year of working with them . its a hard job . no air conditioning system . a lot of safety hazards
good,"Training and management have 2 different ideas. Management goes against the way your trained in class. Very stressful calls coming in, if you don't handle the call the way your trained they fire you."
good,It's hard work and more or less rewarding. Team is practically a must majority of the time but it felt better to get things done on my own. The hardest part was being the last to leave and deal with whatever was left. Management was around but you never knew when.
good,I have worked at FedEx part time for 8 years.They currently only hire part time but you can advance usually if you want to relocate.It is fast paced and the company gives good raises.
good,It's what you make it to be...long days little pay lots of stress... None the less its still fun at times and has it's pros and cons like everything else in life
good,"The hardest part of this job is getting specific vacation weeks."
good,"Overall, it was a better than average work place. Positives include, good affordable benefits, shoes and shirts paid for, physical demanding at times. Negatives, are lack of  hours, long process just to get work area. Pay was fair but less than advertised i.e. make up to $14, only on select jobs. Trainers and management were very professional, however you had to suck it up and get dirty moving bulk freight, younger aged workers.  The co workers and overall culture seemed positive and nice, however if you have a family to feed, lack of hours could be a serious negative."
good,"it was a good job. nice routes friendly people. im not sure what else to say butthis requires a minimun number of words so here you go, but its still not enough"
good,Tienen buenas prestaciones pero si es dificil sobrevivir con el sueldo semanal aprox 1200
good,"FedEx offers a great pension plan, 401k, and tuition reimbursement. Getting promoted within the company can be difficult unless you get your name out there. FedEx is growing, so the company is opening up for more job opportunities for those seeking employment."
good,"Plane lands, material handlers offload the freight containers and move it to the belt to where the package handlers will sort it to the correct locations. Afterwards the Truck Control Agents will put those containers into semis and complete the paperwork for the Ramp Transport Drivers to take to the stations, from there, the Couriers will sort them out to the appropriate addresses and assemble a route and complete by making all deliveries in a timely fashion and reschedule the failed ones for the following day.  I learned how to talk to people even when there having a bad day. How to be efficient on time and distance. "
good,The job is good it pays well and I like it  great Benifits and easy to move up in different positions and become manager plus onsite training for truck drivers
good,"Fast paced environment, job based off volume, shift range anywhere from 2.5 to 6hrs a day, learn multiple positions quickly as staff as is always needed"
good,"The warehouse is typically the same temperature as outside, and you always go home sticky from the environment. The benefits, if you are full time, are great but not a good part-time job."
good,"Pros:"
good,"I was a Dock Worker, Part-Time. They text you while your sleeping each early morning to tell you what time to come in, I kid you not! We would be texted around 3:30 AM from management to know what time we must come in that morning. Very unprofessional, especially because most of the time it was a 1 hour time-frame between the time they texted you and the time you had to be there which was very unfair and unreasonable. "
good,"Hours aren’t consistent, some days you can work 10-15hrs other days you can work 6hrs.  Holiday deliveries is very stressful and there are just so many hours in a day.  Deliveries can be 150-200 packages per day."
good,I would recommend FedEx as an employer because of great opportunities the company has to offer. FedEx have a lot of different programs that can help you further your education as well.
good,"Great pay, great chance for advancement. I wish I would have stayed here, I would currently be making $30 an hour and all I would have had to do was drive a truck"
good,Uma empresa de grande porte na área de transporte de carga e descarga em todo país dinâmica e conceituada empresa onde busca expandir seu foco na área de transporte e logística
good,"Pay is low but benefits are outstanding and very inexpensive. Most shifts are at non traditional times. Management is very good at Richfield location, safety is a top priority"
good,Turning into a corporate call center. Used to be free to handle territory in a more responsible way. Co workers are genuine and an abundance of good knowledge.
good,"Its an difficult job and very stressful but the people their are the best people I have ever worked with. The food a their r is great with a low limited amount of choices, even though it the prices are high it is still a good place to eat"
good,"If your in college get part time job. If your willing to work and work hard you will than this place is great for you. It was fast paced and sometimes harder than you would think. I would recommended this job to a college kid looking for little extra cash, and this job will help you stay in shape."
good,"FedEx is a great company to work for. The pay and benefits and matching 401k were wonderful. It's a great working environment, very helpful and team oriented."
good,"There was no structure,and breaks were not given as they should. The pace of work,would lay out the possibility for many injuries.  I have injured my back and no support for Health benefits were given in order for me to get an MRI.  My only option was to quit."
good,"A late night job that was physically demanding. Lifting package at a fast rate loading shipping containers. As a team Leader, I was in charge of 20-30 employees with a task of loading as many containers as possible in the allotted time.  The downside to this job, your not able to work more than 24 hours a week"
good,I was a contracted delivery driver for the home delivery side of the company. The owners that I worked for were very nice and respectful of their workers personal lives. My pay was not hourly but daily. It was a little different but wasn't terrible.
good,My typical day at work is pretty good. I have learned how to organize my truck. Management and workplace culture is okay. The hardest part is when you have to carry heavy packages up a lot of stairs. The most enjoyable part is in the mornings when everyone gets together.
good,I do recommend this job to people who are dedicated workers and determined to work I also can say this job made me a faster worker and made me more careful.
good,"Not a bad place to work "
good,First shift they say you'll start at 1:00 PM but be prepared to work 2:30 PM or 3:00 PM to about 6:00 PM. If you want the hours you gotta work atleast next shift 6:30 PM to about 10:00 PM. This job I feel would work best for people who have another main job. Or more for students who just need extra money for books and what not. Does not work very well for a single mother like myself whom only has 3 Bill's to pay as of right now and still cant even afford those bills.
good,"through the 6 months, and repetition of the same thing over and over each day. I felt I needed to get a better job with better pay as I had been struggling with getting ahead to pay bills"
good,"When I began work with FedEx Trade Networks in their warehouse, I was in awe at what the company provided their employees and the way the concerns of employees were high-priority. This sort of culture continued through my transition into their office as a release and classification analyst. My direct supervisor was easy to talk to, very welcoming and did everything in her power to make sure her employees were happy at work while still ensuring they were productive. "
good,"-  Long term employees are not compensated "
good,"I was a Sr Import agent. Paid training is 3 wks.,training can be very overwhelming, expected to remember a lot of procedures in order to process shipments. Once you get out of training, you are expected to process at least 20-40 shipments a day after 5 months. Once you hit your quota, you'll be eligible for OT.As long as you are a quick learning and fast typist, you will do well. The shipments you process are randomly checked by customs. You sit all day. "
good,"depending on the manager, most managers are fairly lenient and don't care much. some managers are more strict than other, but there is fairly nothing to worry about. once in a while there is a manager that is very helpful who can help a lot when there is a problem or issue that you cannot handle and they can fix it. others are very lazy and may just shift blame to you and you get write up for it. as long as you can explain your action and it was nothing serious that was wrong, you would not get into any trouble and work is fairly easy."
good,The environment is set to come to work and complete your job. Exercise safety is very important. Complete your shift. Follow the work schedule and all is well.
good,"U work 2-3 hours a day 6 times a week. If it works for ur schedule go for it. "
good,"If you don't mind working hard and earning a decent paycheck,  FedEx is the place to go. Good benefits and friendly people.  The have several different shifts you can work that helps with work life balance."
good,professional operation with daily challenges like every where else.  fluctuation in operational need means you may work irregular and inconsistent hours. Pay is decent and training for me was very good.
good,"Senior Manager over the Courtyard input does now let us do our jobs. He always want to micro manage us and tells us what he needs us to do. The area runs well before he starts making his suggestions, instead of letting us run the area because we are a great performing group anyway."
good,The environment is very fast paced and it can be overwhelming sometimes . In order to advance you just have to stay focus . Fedex has great benefits and rewards its employees every so often .
good,"FedEx is a good company. The work life balance is awful. Management does works 10+ hours a day on your feet with no lunches, no over time, and no additional compensation for overnights"
good,it is a great job for people going college with different work shifts that revolve around school. the best time for more hours and overtime are in season which are the months of October-February. Once season is over there is a huge drop in hours specially overnights which id say was the best shift to work while going to school.
good,to many long hours go in early and dont go home until dark no work life balance other then that it ok but i need to be home more often due to elderly in law and grandchildren
good,The typical day for me started at around 4am at latest (sometimes they'd make you come in early for heavy periods). My coworkers were energetic though there was a lot of complaining when it came to expectations. The hardest parts of the job would be living with the schedule and keeping up with the expectations of the company even with obstacles.
good,"As long as you show your drive they will work with you, although they can be tougher on some situations and unfair to others. At this point the company is very low on hours, and recently alot of contracts have been moved to other locations."
good,"Fast paced work no paid breaks no lunches, scan an load trucks for free. Work days average 5-6hrs a day "
good,"its a fast pace enviroment,  there is limited manapower so teammates are moved to various jobs. to ensure all work is getting done for that day."
good,"co-workers are nice and most are willing to help each other when needed. "
good,"i believe this is a great job for a college student or someone that just graduated from high school, with little responsibility. The older i became the more i realized that there weren't really no potential to advance to reach my long term goals."
good,I enjoyed my job but the management was very poor as well many backstabbing co-workers. They hate to see you advance above them in any role. The benefits were great and i wish i still had them. I would recommend this job to people but explain the cons that come with it.
good,Fed ex is great for a part time job with a workout.The management can be much better. Fed Ex lacked opportunity to advance higher with in the company.
good,i really disliked my job. It was great when i first started but i got a new manager and it went downhill from there. They didn't live up to their own expectations. I hated it there so i quit and found something else.
good,"Fast paced environment , it’s a lot of heavy lifting . I enjoyed working here . It’s competitive pay and your always alert.  I wish i could have went full time."
good,"Good place to work. Kind, friendly, and respectful piers. Decent pay. Management was extremely strict on punctuality. The hardest part of the job would be servicing an irate customer. However, I would try my best to diffuse the situation before involving manager."
good,"I was doing well at Fed Ex I just"
good,"Theres a lot of honest, hard workers at FedEx but I was unable to attain 40 hours a week except during peak season. The wage is very competitive, but that doesn't matter much when you get dropped to part time at the end of peak and then are only able to get, at most, 30 hours a week."
good,"Had Great experience working for fedex.I have been with Cisco for 4 years and I am truly excited each day because I have an opportunity to think about my current role, my opportunity to grow and most important my value to the community and believe it or not earth."
good,"Great hourly pay, but if you’re a part time employee they treat you much different from full time. They don’t care about your need for a certain amount of weekly hours, they just want you to do what they need then cut you loose as soon as possible."
good,Technically work outside what you get on the outer weather you get inside. You have to work in all sort of weather. You have to volunteer if you want more hours. You have to be at work and hour ahead of time its a long process.You receive points for the smallest issue even if Iva minutes behind.
good,"É uma Empresa boa para se trabalhar, oferece algumas vantagens, como a pessoa crescer e subir de cargo."
good,"i enjoyed my time with my FedEx employees , we bonded very well.. everyone was nice an patient , they work with you the whole way ,my co workers never let me down an i gave the same respect to them - its basically like dealing with youre at home family , lol they get on your nerves but you cant help but to love them"
good,The job was kind of stressful very fast paced for little money.  The hours were great for me because I am an morning person.  I was able to go to work at 4am and my day was over before 12pm.
good,There is very little interactions with others. Your area is assign to you and the expectation is that you stay there your entire shift. I allows you a lot of time to reflect and be alone.
good,"Working at FedEx was hard and tiring, there where days that felt stressful but over a few times. Management was easy going sometimes but it's like all other jobs."
good,"The FedEx hub has a way of pushing out 10 hours of work in 4 hours. The work is hard, especially in the courtyard. There is room for advancement. Its best to make your manager your best friend and stay away from the buff or else you'll get fat. The benefits are great, which is why so many work there with so many different backgrounds. There are a lot of business owners that work in the fedex hub, a lot of students, and even teachers. I worked there for the tuition reimbursement. Once I graduated college, I graduated FedEx."
good,"FedEx was a fair employer, especially the management, but there was not enough hours to compensate for the long drive. Promotion was fair, it all depended on how hard you worked at the bottom."
good,Flex-time was a great idea and perfect for me while I still had my full time job. It was to supplement my pay and get great training. They did not disappoint! They know and understand people as consumers and employees.
good,"The 40 Mile drive was bugging me after 2 months, the pay was awesome but very little hours worked in a day, so i ended up quiting after about 3 months. The managers were great and respectful, i usually worked for about 2-3 hours and then was sent back home. -_-"
good,A typical day is you loaded trucks I learned have to loaded trucks the the right way the managements could be better the culture is good everyone help each other it feels like family the hardest part of the job is the labor
good,"Not a good place to learn from scratch. Must be self motivated to learn outside of the shop. Excellent benefits, better than most companies. Hard to get into, but does provide job security if you can handle the workload."
good,A very good place to work.  There are opportunities available for those who desire them.  There are also educational areas for those to improve there personal or professional skills.
good,I enjoyed the people that worked there and the work was simple enough. All you really needed to do to stand out was to show up every day and put in effort.
good,the work was very easy the mangers where cool the only time i would get full time hours was during the hoilday season i learn a lot of new skills just that never got the chance to be a full time worker
good,"1. Employees are treated with humility and respect - something than many indian conglomerates don't"
good,"Not enough work hours, benefits are great, vacation time and how it was distributed was not equal, trucks were not very well equipped, very hot in summer time (no A/C) very cold in winter (heat in cab only)"
good,Fedex is a fast paced environment. Some of their best employees are in shape. Most people lose weight. Its an extremely laborious job. Overall most people were nice but there were the few that didn't need get along with most employees. Fedex is a great company but the first year will be hard.
good,"Being a package handler is physically demanding. You are loading and unloading delivery trucks, in a certain time frame. If you get a good group of co workers, it is a fun place to work."
good,"It all depends on you.  If you are the type of person that has your ducks in a row and you need to top your budget off and get your exerice in, then i would say yes!"
good,"i learned nothing much working at fed ex beacuse of the lack of communication between me and my manager. not a great experience and would not do that to another human being fair is fair and right is right. i tried to get a job transfer and that was unsuccessful."
good,"-There are many growth and training opportunities, if you are willing to travel or move."
good,No real issues beside sometimes safety. There was always work to do and training you can get done. Moving up in the company can be a little hard to accomplish.
good,Very fast pace. I learn something new every day.   Getting up at 1 am. People I work with. Its none stop culture. Good benefits but its just part time need full time
good,Fast paced and beneficial. Job advancement is a plus. Discounts and health benefits are good. Onsite cafeteria and job store. Good for anybody who wants to work.
good,"working at fedex was fun and really tiring. We  mostly did the same things every day. we would load the trucks in a certain order or load tuggers, little carts that bring big packages to our area, into the trucks also"
good,"Very production oriented.  A lot of pressure to complete goals and when you complete them, they raise the standard.  There raises are 3% a year ad no matter how hard you work, you will never get more than that"
good,"If you enjoy drama and craziness, then this is the place for you!! The pay is great, but the payback for you is your sanity, your family. I did meet some really great people."
good,I used to work for FedEx back in 2016. Overall my location and staff was amazing. I started out with a country route and I didn't enjoy that too much simply because I had the same amount of packages as a city route and a ton of miles. There are ways you can cut down time here and there.  didn't like my route basically
good,some great people some not fast paced work great starting place there is advancement if you look for it winters are hel on the switchers  most quit in 3 days
good,"Upon coming into work I notify the supervision that I am there and they assign the work loads.  This could be any of the following jobs, dock responsibilities, going to rail yard, city pickup and deliveries, or going on a line haul run which ever is needed at the time."
good,This job worked well with my other activities. It Is very flexible if you are ok  with waking up at 2 am. Done by noon everyday. Pay is a little below the average.  Very phisical
good,"Loading trucks, moving boxes, and scanning packages is a typical day at work for me. While working here, I learned how to stack boxes accordingly, manage time more wisely, and to accomplish the job well."
good,It's average. Pay is not bad and health care is good. Work can be stressful and boring a lot of the time. I would just recommend finishing school and pursuing something that doesn't make you feel average like this job does.
good,"The FedEx freight that I worked at was very stressful. You do double work due to lack of proper management and equipment. So much money is wasted because of poor management. Management is also untrustworthy and they hang your job over your head if you happen to get sick. They will fire you no matter your impeccable work ethic and corporate obviously has no clue what's going on in their centers. "
good,working at this company was not the best expierence. Your hours would vary everyday. Management was very unproffesional. I would not want to  work in fedex warehouse facility.
good,Good workplace environment. Everyone was pretty cool except the trainers. They were a little out of line when it came to training new workers. Early shift is the best because I still had the whole day to do other things.
good,driver and loading at order at work. A typical day is my shift from 7 am to 10 pm I would drive and ship orders. Before shipping out the orders I would load the orders in the truck.
good,"It was very good experience working at Fedex Supply Chain (Genco), a cell phone repair warehouse owned by Fedex. The working hours were not consistent. Some weeks they would give us 40 hours, some weeks less than 40 hours and some weeks more than 50 hours."
good,"people drive profit services I like the management and service culture at FedEx."
good,"Excellent job ,great benefits and pay, wear and tear on body, management fair, room for advancement, jobs in every state even aboard"
good,Overall the experience has been positive. I worked with a great group and a good culture with a great manager.  There's nothing more I can say about this company except overall everything is good.
good,Your scheduled four hours but if desired you might be able to stay over but often you are sent home earlier due to lack of parcels. Fast paced attention to detail is a very high priority.
good,Liked the people I work with but I work in the hub and it is wear and tear on the body.  Since I have been there I have had three managers once you get use to working with one and understanding his ways they switch them around and it is hard to really get to know your manager.
good,"-Very fast paced enviroment"
good,"- Job title Parcel Sorter,my responsibilities were scanning packages and learning different positions or job titles such as loading trailers, and working well with others when they need the help."
good,Work with assigned new hire in helping understand the proper way to load trailer or truck. Load packages in timely manner so trucks and trailers can dispatch at a good time. Learned to make sure you listen both coworkers and contractors to get things done correctly. Management willing to help when need assistance. Co workers willing to help others when they need help if fall behind. Keeping up with volume at times when a lot comes at you is the hardest part of job. Working with good people.
good,It required hard work ethic and self-motivation. The managers are always yelling at us to pick up the pace and we did the best we could to adapt to the noisy environment. I learned new methods that helped to improve my productivity. The hardest part of the job was meeting the expected 3000 packages/hr. The most enjoyable part of the job was after sort when I searched for packages that did not make it to their destination.
good,"O presente laudo de avaliação está resumido em seções, conforme a seguir demonstrado:"
good,good job for a younger person who doesn't mind waking up at 4am fast paced environment and easy to learn only downside is having to work some holidays
good,"The work in my opinion is just too strenuous and if I had any type of an emergency, they kind of made a big deal about taking a day off."
good,This is a very fast paced company that requires a lot of multi-tasking. I have learned the ins and outs of the freight division. Management can have a little more communication. The hardest part of the job is the time you have much to do in little time. I enjoy the customers the most good and bad.
good,It has great benefits. They are very focused on getting packages out on time. There are plenty of rules in place to insure your safety. You will be worked hard.
good,"Its a good part time job to get through school if you don't mind the labor. Hours are very flexible you can choose from several shifts. Over all its a decent job, not a permanent fix in my opinion."
good,My employer really expected a lot from me. Some days but not all there was too much work to get done in a safe manner. The weekly wage is what kept me there for so long.
good,"A typical work day would include checking emails, walking the facility and managing the sort. Different personalities can be challenging"
good,"The job was not to bad at first, but over time pain accumulated and no consideration is really given to injury. Was interfering with school and life outside work."
good,"Responsible for delivery of ground packages to local businesses and residences which includes inspecting the truck, using the scanner to record the deliveries and most importantly a professional and courteous demeanor at all times while providing superior customer service. I also have an emphasis on safety with the operation of my truck safely at all times."
good,The typical does involves a lot of picking up boxes ranging in weight and size. The hardest part of the job was learning where to place the items inside the truck.
good,Great work ethic and management. Solid company procedures make focusing easy and the company is understanding about work availability.
good,"hard work pays off iam a good team player good with ppl love to talk and keep convos enjoy making ppl happy and also a loyal employe"
good,load the truckin the morining carring stuff for people door to door also pickup for returns of stuff that the have order on line day to day on time
good,loading shipments of packaging and outsourcing them to across the united states. great supervisor understanding and friendly. going home.
good,es buen trabajo tiene un buen ambiente de trabajo te dejan trabar bien y agusto son muy exigentes
good,"Stable job, lower pay, management is only concerned about what is right in front of them. Resolving root cause challenges were not a priority for this company. Don't expect change in the company, or organization and don't try to advocate for it or you will be sorely disappointed. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing and expecting a different result. This is FedEx Trade Networks for sure. The people were wonderful and I miss them every single day but low pay and decreasing benefits don't help pay down college debt."
good,"Loved going into work with the people that were there, the time having to be there was what was killing me. otherwise, once you got over being tired and not wanting to wake up, you're set to go with great people."
good,"Safely perform assigned tasks while meeting predetermined standards.Operating a switcher as assigned by Dock Manager or Lead Parcel Sorter.  Rotate into several areas to perform tasks including loading, unloading, palletizing, scanning, quality assurance assessment."
good,"I have learned a lot in the Logistics area, but  I feel their is no room to grow with-in the company. I have been employed for seven years here with only two promotions."
good,"FedEx has the family feel to it, and it can be very inviting if you're willing to accept long days and zero work-life balance."
good,"busy work place, fast movement, good work aera.only can work 20 hours a week. some of the managers talk to you out they way and disrespectful"
good,"A part-time shift at fedex express is usually a  5-6  hours.   For about    3 1/2 hours of my shift I  drive and after I come off the road, I enter and scan in all the paperwork collected for the day."
good,"At Fedex Trade Network I spent most of my day dealing with customers. This will be via e-mail or by phone. I was a Senior Import Coordinator. I was in charge of processing the customs clearance for a variety of products and customers. From medical devices to alcohol shipments, to Military shipments. I learned a lot a while working for this company. When working for Oz burn Hessey Logistic, I didn't have to deal with alcohol or gun shipments, and at Fedex I was able to learn to deal with these government agencies that were new to me. My managers and co-worker supported  in this learning process, and made it very simple for me to learn. The most challenging part of the job was to learn all of the requirements for every type of shipment, as the department I worked for was in charged of handling all government agencies. Although, this was hard it was also rewarding to see the customers were very happy with my service."
good,"I had a very great manager, he always had our terminal as one of the top ranking. It was very fast pace in the morning and slow in the afternoons."
good,"It was a great place to work. The only bad thing about working there is that they over work you like crazy, the management would come over and move you from belt to belt and let the boxes stack up and not even handle the right situation correctly."
good,"Although Federal Express is one of many Fortune 500 companies, it does has its pros and cons within the FedEx companies."
good,"I did enjoy learning something new about the job every other week. Was it easy? Some of it, but some required more and more work because I had remember where packages went. Working with other co-workers was good, but some didn't work hard."
good,"It's an adventure to say the least, many daily challenges that keep you engaged, whether obstacles from upper management or employee concerns and mistakes. It's definitely one of my most challenging positions as management personnel I've ever had."
good,Strulig ledning som inte alltid var så engagerad i vad som hände på golvet.
good,Very simple work. Everyday I would sort packages and make sure they are going to the right place. Management was excellent.
good,"Dia tipico, aprender conhecimentos novos,aprendi a lidar com pessoas diferentes de mim, a Gerência da empresa era boa,meus colegas eram pessoas boas,a parte mais difícil foi a despedida de todos, a parte agradável foi aprender coisas novas todos os dias,"
good,Scan labels and handle packages for long periods of time. Is a fast and physical work. Also I have learned to work with people of different personalities.
good,This is a very deadline driven company were speed is essential. Management would listen to concerns or suggestions but they often seemed to go unassessed or not implemented. Does not enforce attendance policy. Employees would often become disgruntled or irritated by the pace. Drivers were very stressed and would at times take it out on package handlers. The work itself was enjoyable.
good,I would enter work at 4:30 in the morning. Worked as part time package handler. It would required to lift small boxes to big boxes that could weight up to 120 lbs. and sometimes more.
good,Check in all 35 dirvers. They all sign and review there paperwork then I enter it into the computer so they get paid properly. Talk with and help coworkers when needed. Answer phones. Make copies and file paperwork daily. Take deposits to the bank. Over all a enjoyable place to work with great benifits.
good,Being employed at a Brokerage company can be very interesting. I have learned a lot of valuable information throughout the last 15 years. A typical day for me includes auditing and correcting errors made by other employees.
good,"I have worked for Fedex SmartPost For Four years now, I have seen  11 mangers come and go. My work is easy samething every day dispatch loads, log in incoimng loads, and check the yard equipment . I have learn time mangement skills in order to make my work day easier . My co-workers are easy to get a long with and we work weel as a time."
good,"While on day shift, fast paced. Must be independant worker and reliable. Consistent work. "
good,"FedEx Ground does offer a lot of opportunity for advancement if you put your time into the company. Decent benefits, decent compensation, and solid job security."
good,This is one of the best companies anyone could work for but location does matter because management makes a huge difference. Being in good physical condition is important because you will be doing a lot of heavy lifting but always ask for help when needed.
good,"I would go in find my tug and drive to the designated work area and wait for team meeting. Once in area I would start the night picking boxes off the line and loading them in the AMJ.I learned about labels and scanning there, and became very efficient at my job. I learned to work at a fast and steady pace and also check my work as I work. My co-workers were not always friendly and most hated there job. The hardest part of my job was dealing with my co-workers and a not so well organized management. My best times at the Job was when I was able to work in different areas and learn new things."
good,"I had the most fun at this job. It was like my personal gym. I was never out of shape. I learned all about teamwork. My management was straight by the book, treated everyone the same. That kept down on so much drama. I miss those guys!!!!!!"
good,"Working at FedEx from day to day could go 2 ways. 1 we are under staffed and everyone is expected to be superman/women. We have our regular staffing an still expected to be superman/woman. There is never enough you could do to get respect, there's always a little bit more you could be doing an always something wrong that you've done. I understand the criticism but once inn a while when you see someone breaking there back moving faster than everyone around in 90 degree building that feels like an oven. That person should at least earned a pat on the back. At any point in time you could be moved back to the load end which is were 90% of package handlers start at. No matter how long you've been there or how hard you've worked you can be moved to ground zero out of nowhere. There is numerous hard workers and fantastic co-workers that I've worked with that have terminated there stay and moved on because the respect wasn't given to them. The turnover rate in people keeping the job for 2 months is 2 in 15. And that's only 2 months. I know I am a hard worker and have earned very much respect an have been promoted to easier jobs in the building because of my standing. But in the end this company expects robots and infinite output of work. The people I do work with that are hard workers are amazing an will break there back for the company. I just wish I could be the one that moved them up instead of them not receiving the respect they deserve."
good,I learned the culture work at an international company which moves millions of shipments everyday. It is hard to deal with the customers because they have different needs but what makes enjoyable is when you provide a solution for them and they feel satisfied with the things you have done for them.
good,"I've been with FedEx for about two years. Its a very fast paced company especially if you aren't used to being in a warehouse."
good,"There is always a lot of work to do, which is good because you work when there is work to be done. You can easily earn an annual raises and bonuses, and cost of living increases. There are lots of new insurance programs with the insurance plan. The company is making awareness to the LGBT community. Do not expect the nicest remarks from management. They are very focus on the tasks getting completed because everything is time sensitive. The work is not hard but needs to be done quickly and based on the company standard. There is little room for error. The company is making an effort to make the work environment better. Advancing in the company is possible but it is not easy."
good,It is a highly active job that is fast pace until your shift is over. I liked the job for the most part except going in to work at 3am was tough.
good,"The saying work part time for an all time great company is true. You only commit a few hours a day to working there, but I needed more hours, which led me to working days and nights. The benefits were amazing and cheap though ."
good,"	Fast-paced warehouse environment."
good,The job is very stressful when you first start from trying to learn an area but after a month you should have it down. The money at Home Delivery/Ground as a driver is not as much you think. Great to get some experience though. NO BENEFITS.....which everybody thinks they have amazing benefits but your working for a contractor for fedex so you dont get anything usually. FedEx Express I believe is different as you actually work for FedEx.
good,Job enjoyable .....if you love doing alot moving around Real Physical but its part time sometimes less hours @ time during time period.........
good,"Good benefits, great pay, do not get a lot of hours friendly emvironment to work in. Managers are very respectful and friendly.  very Time consuming."
good,FedEx Ground was a fast pace job. For the most part you see the the same friendly faces but there isn't much time for socializing. You are on a very specific time clock. The trucks and pallets have to be loaded and unloaded in a timely fashion. At times it can be a little hard on the body but it's worth it to know that you get paid weekly.
good,I would clock in at 4:30 am work till 7 or 8 am.  I was a van loader.  I just waited for the package to roll down the conveyor belt and place it in my van.  Each day was always different which made it more fun.  Management was good.  Boss would tell us where to focus on if we were missing packages or if production is too slow.  Co-workers were very hard working and helpful.  Hardest part of the job would be waking up early and balancing it with your day plans.  Normally I was too tired to do anything and I felt my nap was too long.  The most enjoyable part of working there would be the satisfaction of knowing I did my part the best I could.
good,I would get up at 2am get a shower and be at work before 3:17am and get started scanning packages and unloading trucks and then a meeting then back to work scanning and unloading trucks till 8am then home and bed.
good,"learned how to load trucks and unload them, rf scanner, relabel, label boxes, management wasn't so well when it came to knowing what to do, the hardest part of any job is showing up."
good,Good company but hard to move up and the pay is low. The management is really good though.
good,"Very physical. There are many shifts to choose from, and the shifts last no longer than 5 hours."
good,"A typical day on the job consist of ensuring all freight and shipment orders have been updated, and ready to in take inbound. I've learned how to manage my time in regards to daily deadlines, and milestones. The management team are very supportive of their employees, and the needs of the clients. The Hardest part of my job is keeping up with the training for new employees coming in and out seasonally. The most enjoyable part is being under high pressure, and being able to meet all deadlines on a daily basis, its truly a rewarding feeling."
good,Not a very balanced company and treat employees poorly. Not a place I would recommend working.
good,"The job itself is easy, but the supervisors make it harder than it should be. They do not like you taking breaks or talking to co-workers. You do your job and go home, thats it. There is no room for advancement unless you are friends with the managers.  Good pay, bad management, enough said."
good,I would love to stay with company..but the lines of communication in management is terrible. The dock supervisors are ridiculously rude and disrespectful. The instructors for the apprentice program are incapable of dealing with new and fresh driver without frustration.
good,"-they let you choose which shift you wanted to work, whether you wanted a day time, or an overnight shift."
good,"Seasoned Operations/Project Manager with more than 15 years of"
good,"My days at Fedex are only 4 - 4.5 hours long. However, it is non-stop work, you must be hard working at this job in order to get everything done on time. I've learned to do things in new ways based on the situation, and changing up my tactics to do things in a better way. There were good, but also not so good managers, at some points in didn't seem like they knew what they were doing. The hardest part of doing the job is trying to accomplish the job with the incorrect amount of people. Doing a 4-5 man job is very difficult for only two people, but my friend and I have done it anyway each day. The only reasons we could are because we both work constantly, both fast and hard, we do things like split the loads between each other, and also help each other out. The most enjoyable part of the job was whenever you were done, you had the entire rest of the day to do whatever it is that you want."
good,Easy job.  The hard part is getting to it.  It's like working for the post office on steroids sometimes.
good,A typical day at work was running to catch a bus from their screening area and hearing planes and metal clashing everywhere. Getting a tracker and being told from my manager what the night would be like. Doing stretch and flex and beginning scanning and loading aircraft containers. The management was very informative. I learned about the company and how to move in a fast pace industry and being able to get things out on time to the planes.
good,I enjoyed this job because I faxed information to company's that were using FedEx airway billing services.
good,Helping member's of my team with day to day functions of the work group.
good,"hard days but what job is easy,two well in any place ,they did good on running the job,i had a lot of friends and made good money why i was there..."
good,"Working here was pretty good with the work being compared to a workout. I gained a lot of warehouse experience here and the management could have been better. The co-workers were ok, some had negative attitudes and it showed in their work and actions. there were no hard parts of this job and the easy part was the work."
good,"Reviewing flights to ensure our line hauls will be on time and if not must make adjustments to ensure we make service on our 8am dels. Reviewing sick calls if any, and covering any open positions due to sick calls. Ensuring all runs as normal not matter the conditions. We have sort down times to achieve as well as leave building time so that we achieve our am handling hours. We also have to ensure we are launching routes at capacity so that we do not over spend on our on road hours. All drivers need to achieve their on road goal as well as achieve service goals for the day. This all rolls up to one workgroup which I am responsible for. Hardest part of the job is working the am sort. The most enjoyable part of the job is when at the end of the month all your hard work pays off and you make your productivity and service goals."
good,"Participei diretamente de implantações de projetos logísticos dos mais diversificados setores e segmentos, fazendo com que a oportunidade de aprendizado técnico e gerencial se tornasse algo que nenhuma faculdade ou especialização da área me proporcionasse academicamente falando."
good,"Being Self-Employed has it ups and downs like must jobs,"
good,Great place to work in.  Learned a lot with other co-workers.
good,The only thing I like about FedEx is that the pay start averages from 10.65 to 11.15. The bad thing about it is that it is a tiring place to work. Your body is literally beat after the end of a sort.
good,Loading and unloading trucks. Bad management like in a lot of big companies
good,"Long hours may work 6-14hr days which are going to be intense. "
good,"FedEx has an established brand and provides a culture with average to pretty good benefits, and security.   However, employee compensation has decreased over the last 5 years despite billions of dollars spent in acquistions and soaring stock prices."
good,"great expectations, good pay; long hours; hardest part of job working nights. Loved working with people and that no 2 days were the same."
good,"The job was very difficult but over all I loved my supervisor, she was very helpful."
good,fast-paced work with helpful people. A high level of expectancy in speed and tidiness. Heat is always a factor in warehouse work but bearable. The managers are pleasant unless you aren't performing your duties.
good,"Physically Demanding work, not for everybody. The job mainly consist of loading and unloading small and heavy packages into trailers. Working in the loading docks is the worst part of this job because you have work at fast rate for the entire shift and it can get physically exhausting most of the time. "
good,Great company to get your foot in the door and learn how delivery works.  Hardest part of the job is the hours usually starting anytime around 3 am till 8:00 am.  Great job while you are in school.  College tuition benefits available.
good,"This jobs is good. You have good benefits, Great group of people you work with. and management is not bad. My only issue with this job is that it's not enough hours. The job only offer Part-time."
good,Hard work is all I have to say! Seniority and who you know is key in advancing in this company.
good,"A typical day was unloading from 90 trailers -100"
good,The company as a whole is ok to work for. Managment could use an overhaul.. The benefits are to expensive and the pay is not all that great
good,all you do all day is scan boxes and put them into a truck in a 16 inch wall.You learn nothing new about the job ever.management is a joke.The only good part of the job is your co-workers.
good,What I like is that the time does go by fast while you are working in this noisy type of environment. There are people who does rise to the occassion of wanting to better themselves and others by living by the Purple Promise! It is indeed a mulitcultural job but very easy to catch on.
good,Aprendes a ser tolerante con los clientes ya que tu trabajo es ser servicial.
good,"At a typical day at work, we would gather up in a meeting and discuss our goals for the day to complete. I learned that with great teamwork, you can accomplish a lot more than you think. Management was pretty hectic. Co-workers were fun to work with and they did their job. The hardest part of the job was probably leaving in the middle of what you're doing lol. Especially if you set your milestone. The most enjoyable again is working, good workout."
good,"societe performante par son engagement. Rigoureuse ,sisteme americain."
good,"Load truck, get manifest and turn by turn directions. Start my day delivering. I've learned a lot more with customer service being the face of the company. Management is overall good, co-workers are very fun to be around, very productive. The hardest part of my job is dealing with being overwhelmed. It's very easy to get overwhelmed with so many packages/stops. The most enjoyable part of my job is bringing happiness to people. I just think of how happy I am when my delivery arrives, and I channel that into doing my job, I love giving that feeling to other people."
good,"Scanning, loading & unlaoding packages. Learn how to load trucks and ""build walls"" while loading. The job itself is fast paced hard work. The management can be iffy."
good,"Work is ok."
good,Recent leadership changes in some departments are making a positive impact on employees.
good,A lot of hours but the pay made it worth your time.  Very easy to build your business.
good,"Maintains uniform business practices and procedures to ensure compliance with customs and other government agency (OGA) laws and regulations and according to FedEx Express expectations. Analyzes documentation provided to determine that harmonized tariff number and whether the shipment qualifies for special tariff treatment, NAFTA, reduced duty rates and ensures all government agency regulations are followed. Also ensures that the required information is submitted or transmitted electronically."
good,Its was a fairly good place to work. Benefits and compensation was well.
good,"It was a ok place to work, and it was physical job on the body. The people could be better, over all the job is a job that you much move around in company because of it's physical nature on the body."
good,"Loading and Unloading Trailers in a timely mannner. making sure to move a certain amount of boxes per hour. some packages were light and useless, but then you would get certain packages that would be small in size but weight over 70Lbs"
good,"Large company.  Employees are just a number."
good,The company really care about things that affected you personally and tailor your work time around things that you had going on in your personal life.  Great benefits.
good,"Moving 20,000 packages in a work period was a normal day."
good,"It's a noisy and fast pace work environment, heavy duty lifting and management is ok. This is a type of job with decent pay and benefits, but the hours are very short. Not a bad choice for a secondary job that's comes with working very hard in a warehouse full of heavy packages."
good,starting the day with a little meeting telling us a report for what happened the day before how was the production what we do wrong etc. then we do a warm up exercise then we all go to our assigned area to start working you learn a lot of things it only takes time for them to start moving you from different assigned ares of production the hardest part of the job is working without breaks i personally get very well relationship with co-workers 
good,It was a very demanding job of multi tasking and constant changes. I learned many things at this position. The training they offer is outstanding. The hardest part of the job is the fast pace and constant change in policy. I loved my core job of problem solving and helping others. 
good,Steady work good pay and good benefits. Good company to work for
good,"My co-workers are like my family.  We work well as a team to make management productive.  The hardest part of my job is when late flights effect the production of my task.  The most enjoyable part is drivng most of the night, instead of picking up heavy boxes all night.  Over the years, I learn in my position that time is vital for the production of my team and the company."
good,"Typical day at work is a calm day the work flow is good, freight is moving without and problems in the beginning of the shift but once you pass 1 am it can get a little crazy and overwhelming . But I enjoy it that is when the you can tell the men from the boys the ones that go all out and have pride from the ones that make excuses and just do enough work to past the time. Hardest part of the job is dealing with some of the co-workers also maintaining my work space so i can function and be productive. I find my self being a leader on the dock and trying to help all and dictate to the workers what i want done when i am working a trailer "
good,Hard work and challenging but working as a team made the challenges easier to work through
good,"A day to day at FedEx, since I worked there for 3 months and got fired because i was still on probation. I learned a whole lot just  by working in that organization. My co-workers always dropped me food for thought and showed good teamwork skills and my manager was good, she understanded my issue of getting to work on time in meetings at FedEx. The most enjoyable part of the job was the meetings. The most hardest part of the job is when I was in the warehouse and I was handling the heavy packages. Some of them are too heavy to lift by yourself so I asked One of the co-workers."
good,A lot of hard work unloading trailers all night with the managers yelling at you to do this and to do that and to always go faster.
good,* was on call...waited for call to either drive or work the dock * logistics and dock duties * everyman for them selfs but i think thats the ltl bussiness * so fast paced you dont have time to get to know your co-workers * was on call for three yrs average start time was between 10-2 * very damanding...knowing they can depend on me to get the job done
good,"Everyone there is pushy and rushes you to your breaking point. If you do not meet your numbers at the end of the day, you get your butt chewed out. Always going home in a horrible mood and going to work with no enthusiasm. They handle it very badly there,"
good,"Hard and steady work, but it is easy to be entangled in company policies."
good,it is a good company to work for if you need stabilty and long term committment .
good,This job was extremely hot in the summer time. working in 150 degree semi trucks loading and unloading. Not many hours because of the heat
good,Expect alot out of you. not much training when I was there. Salary position go in at 3am get out at 3pm
good,"This job is good to me in certain aspects. I have learned several things involving the grueling work that is done. I learnded to lead others as well as manage myself. The hardest thing about this job is the hours in which the job starts. such hours can drain ones energy, especially if they have another job. Most enjoyable thing is the different personalities in the business."
good,"Identify packages, sort, scan, load, and unload. Various schedules available. Teamwork between employees required for smooth flow and efficiency. Management clearly outlines the requirements and expectations for the job."
good,Very fast paced I learned commitment and how to be a hard worker.
good,early start hard physical work good management team and people to work with
good,"The greatest thing about my job was the fact that the company was focused on the customer experience. We managed to the 96% of the hard working honest people. My team was very well trained and we always had plan B, C, etc..."
good,Develop new accts. Selling the FedEx Ground and Express services.
good,"come in threw security go get our gun and battery, have a meeting , jump in our trailers and start loading tell all the trucks are done outside the hub. to be a team player. management is ok not bad but needs work. co- workers is some what good there good people.on a fast day when its real busy is about the hardest part of the job. most enjoyable part is competing with co-workers."
good,"In the Bulk Truck area, a typical shift last about 3 to 4 hours of solid work unloading trucks by hand. The work is enjoyable for those who like to be continually moving and the work environment is general enjoyable as are the other employees. Policy and Procedure can be cumbersome at times."
good,it was a great work out . i learned quality over timing but to still move at a steady pace. co workers work easy to get along with because i am a friendly person. the hardest part was the fatigue the job caused.
good,"It was a place you could enjoy going to work but lately it has been all about the average transaction numbers and selling people stuff they didn't come in for, not just providing them excelent customer service. CHEAP equipment that breaks down all the time service contracts that dont allow for equipment to be fixed in a timley matter. Understaffing and unrelastic goals towards how things should be done.The hardest part of the job was motivating a team who no longer gets a bonus of profit sharing, to want to excel and raise sales."
good,Fedex it was so much to learn but took long to get it done Im greatful however that I learned much when taught
good,It is a great job if you only want to work part-time.
good,very fast physical pace. people are great management is good for the most part but not very understanding to us package handlers. the pay is good but the hours are not so great only good for part time workers not people who desire a full-time job. career advancement is extremely difficult. they expect you to be the best at everything and they have to like you as a person outside of work not just professionally
good,"I worked with Fedex Freight for about one year, the pay was good, I just wish we were able to become full time dock workers. I had to leave fedex for about a two years because I needed full time work, I'm currently in the process of being rehired to work both jobs. Our Days went by fast, fun people to work with. As long as everyone was willing to get the work done we all had a good time."
good,nightshift starts at 11:00 we move packages off a slide onto a conveyor belt. for 3 to 4 hours per night
good,- Loads of work
good,lond days
good,"Arrive at Fedex terminal between 5&6 AM. I recorded all deliveries and planned my route accordingly. I performed a pre-trip inspection on my 20' step van delivery vehicle. After making all scheduled pickup and deliveries, I returned to the terminal, turned in all paperwork and signed off duty. The hardest part of the job was integrating customer call in pickups into my delivery schedule. The most enjoyable part was being self sufficient."
good,Cargo scannig is endless.Packing and loading safely at a fast pace.Work well with others.When the lines are jammed..
good,"I started work at 3 am, usually ended around 7 am. i learned how to read, load and unload packages. The management there was friendly and always a step ahead. My co-workers made everyday enjoyable and very social. The hardest part of the job was lifting the heaviest packages into certain parts of the trucks. The most enjoyable part of this job was making new friends and getting a great workout."
good,I've learned that how to scan for ICs(Incompatibles) and how to manage a team of 12. Co-workers are very friendly. The hardest part of the job is the heat in the summer time working with a fan. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting our goal.
good,"My days at work are typically very productive, I am a worker who likes to keep busy. But there are not enough hours in my shift to always finish my task. I do usually stay over to complete my work. I consider my work ethic to be coordinated,systematized,engineered, and always prioritized."
good,"I worked part-time in the hub to make extra money that was lacking from my full-time job with the County, however, the wear and tear on my body just wasn't worth the few pennies that they were issuing out. I was only there so that I could pick Fed Ex's Cigna insurance up and drop the one I had with the county which was saving me about 200 bucks a month. So there is where I actually saw the money. And I saw people climb the ladder and advanced."
good,I loved working at FedEx but I needed more hours and they were not hiring for full time.
good,"A typical day at FedEx starts at around 3:30-4:45 depending on how many packages are being projected for a certain station. There is a lot of heavy lifting that goes into this job and sometimes no one to help. Fast pace work place, sometimes stressful, the hardest part of the job is trying to keep up with unrealistic expectations from the managers. The most enjoyable part about this job is that it is first thing in the morning and it feels like you had the whole day off."
good,I don’t like the part time hours you don’t Make anything at all. But the adrenaline rush is awesome. It’s a start of growth I guess. Maybe full time one day
good,"It’s a great job they Offer good benefits and Are very Friendly and treat workers right , they Are flexible with ur schedule if there’s school in the way or Even family Matters"
good,Fed ex home delivery paid wages by the package.(not paid per hour) No benefits are provided to workers. Learned a lot about business at this job and I really enjoyed the culture.
good,Na verdade e uma empresa que eu recomendaria pouco para as pessoas
good,Great team work and always putting safety first it is ver physical and fast paced so I would recommend being somewhat in shape because tjose delivery trucks can get hot
good,"For this job specifically you will use your whole body and you do get tired, but it is also worth the money. A typical day would consist of me clocking in at 11 pm and unloading semi trucks until my shift was over around 3 am. The hardest part about this job is staying mentally strong because you will get tired in the beginning lifting boxes and the environment in the summer is very warm without AC so you do sweat a lot."
good,Learned  alot from this company.  This company provided  great training which lead to promotion.  I worked with some of the best dock workers in the state.
good,"Poor management resulting in reduced hours at multiple facilities . "
good,When I first started at FedEx it was hard but as time went on it got easier to work there my first manager I didn’t get along with but when I went to a different side of the building things got better. FedEx is a great place to work at depends on what building you transfer to
good,"Profissionais muitos bons, gerentes tops, mas o salário + benefícios abaixo do mercado se comparados a outros segmentos."
good,"The job pays very well, but it is a lot of work and you have to be able to lift a good amount of weight. The shifts are not too long, but it can be exhausting."
good,"Kind of stressful at times but the work is pretty easy. The hardest part of the job is recoups, getting freight where they need to be on time and finding a working forklift. Even if you have no experience they train you in a classroom and then you go out on the dock for more training. The benefits and the pay are amazing."
good,Good company to have during peak holidays but it slows down in between the year best to have a second job to be on the safe side hours go up and down for the most part
good,"Fast paced most days, I worked on different lines. My job was a package handler so I loaded trucks. Shift was overnight, so would usually be there between 2 and 3 in the a.m. Its not an easy job at all and wouldn't recommend for the faint of heart. Management was ok but of course there's smart mouths everywhere. If you need supplementary income go for it."
good,Great Benefits and good hours. I liked that we were compensated for travel when we traveled for training. I especially liked where the training is located in Atlanta
good,Fedex is a good place to work if your looking for a part time job. It’s fast paced and there’s a lot of moving around. You will receive help whenever you can’t keep up
good,"Good schedule flexibility, job stability, benefits, and some opportunties to move up in position. Decent pay, but work is physically strenuous. Package Handler position is not recommended for full time; part-time is best."
good,A typical day at work at the FEdEx is very productive.  It is a very good place to start working because it teaches you how to be productive.  THe quick pace of the job is a good way to learn how to move quickly without making mistakes.
good,"good workplace and lots of hours available for work, management is very flexible and the company respects you as a worker and doesn't typically over work you"
good,"Over all a good place to work, Management is very fair and they're willing to work with your hours.I like the fact that I'm not micro managed and I'm always thanked for doing my job."
good,I really like my manager and some of my other conwokrers. I also like the team leaders. Some days are better than others but financially I can’t make it here and my manager doesn’t seem to want to help me bid on other jobs.
good,"I really enjoy working for the company! Even with the stress from a customer service position. The focus on the day-to-day resolution of problems and the execution of complex, sensitive transactions for the customers from the call center was steady."
good,"Management will work with you, are very humane & reasonable. They just can't keep an eye on everything (a lot goes on)"
good,"lacked full Time advancement.  Most to all start part time a couple to few years and then often work split shifts in order to be ""full time"".  Some substitute between routes working some days mornings/afternoon and other days afternoon/evening.   Thus lack of personal/home life."
good,"My shift starts at 5pm,i always make sure i'm well hydrated to withstand any condition.I meet up with the team and ask how their day is going so far.We head straight to business after that...."
good,"No health/dental/vision benefits.Constant delivery vehicle breakdowns.Too many miles,too many deliveries for the low wage they pay,but you get to make customer happy when you deliver their products"
good,This job is very fast paced detail oriented.pay very close attention to the labels. Hours are unconventional 3am to 830 am. Time goes by very fast because you are very busy.
good,"I work about 3 and half per shift. unload trucks with a scanner."
good,"you have to stay moving  or you can get into trouble with the mangers , you start work at 3:30 in the morning to 7 sometimes might stay till 8 or 9 depends on how fast everyone finishes. after 6 months you get benefits , only full-time positions are for mangers."
good,"not a bad place, i just had a personality conflict with an HR manager who said some things to me that made me decide i didn't want to work there anymore."
good,"Good place to work at, everyone always helping each other out to get stuff done and to get done as early as possible. Working with FedEx, they’ll help you to not only think but to think outside the box to make your job as easy as possible."
good,"Depending on what it is you're looking for in a, Fed Ex is a good company."
good,"I enjoyed working for this company. The managers and employees are there for you when you need assistance. This job is very physical. There is a dress code for your own security. You have to have skid and slip resistance shoes. The hours are limited. That's the downside. Overall, good workout and exercise."
good,FedEx has a good work culture with silent and friendly environment. Things do move slowly as things have to be approved by a long chain of management.
good,It’s like working at a prison. You will stand up on your feet for four hours a day in a hot building with no sounds but the machines working. You have to sneak to get the expensive resources they provide.
good,"My time at FedEx by far wasn't the worst job experience I've ever had but it also wasn't the best. I mainly stayed due to the people I worked with, though after I changed shifts that anchor went out the window. If you already have a job you can live off of and you want a little more and don't mind hard work then FedEx is an option. They provide great benefits and the pay is enough to supplement an income. To be fair to FedEx this is what they tell you from the beginning. What made me leave is the management was pretty sub par (except for a few managers). Also the fact that I was consistently asked to do other peoples work because they couldn't do it."
good,Working at Fedex was a fast paced environment especially in the morning times. Lifting boxes that weighs almost as you do on a daily basis and placing them on wood palettes for the drivers to load onto their trucks. Co-workers was a blessing to be around and the managers were caring to some degree.
good,"This job offers very little hours, and at first very little pay. I had to work 1000 hours before i could receive any type of benifits and Overtime pay.  The work itself can get extreamly busy on holidays. The average day was a 5 hour shift, with no break at all during that shift. I couldent find any advancements in my area."
good,I like the fact that they try to put their customers at the top of the field and makes sure that they are pleased with their orders and that everything is great with a big smile on their face.
good,"they say youre full time, but your really working 20 to 30 hours a week. the pay is low. its a warehouse. you have to arrive early for security check reasons. you cant have phone in there. you cant have anything on you, expect like money cash, wallet, and id... those very basics. it also eats your break time breaks since it is only 15 mins break . you wont have much time.  you are literally at ""work"" for 35 hours or so but you get paid for 20 to 30 hours... or as it feels like at least. ive been working there for an year and half. they say they raises every 6 months but thats only for the first year... and then after a year they raises once a YEAR. thats how they lie to get you in working there. but its decent job for young kids i guess.."
good,Great Place to work and awsome work life balance but pays you less. There are good learning opportunities but management is more conservative and lacks behind in taking risks.
good,"A typical day at work is fast past.  Scanning bagages. Loading and Unloading.  It is diversity environment. The typical work day start at 12:00 to 5:00 am, loading and unloading."
good,"Could be stressfull at times or very laidback"
good,"Great company, a lot of work but typically there can be a jam on the belt but other than that it still not bad to do it. Also you will be lifting a lot of boxes so that will keep you in shape."
good,I enjoy FedEx for the most part. There honestly isn't much to complain about. I would suggest that there should be a easier way to get more hours other than signing up for them and that they should update the facility and equipment for a smoother work environment.
good,"This company is great as far as beneifits and wages however, the job culture is like any other. I wouldn't leave a great paying job to come to FedEx looking for advancement."
good,"Job is not complicated at all, you unload & load trailers every evening. The only problem, it's a revolving door, people might last years or one night."
good,Working for FedEx you have to pay attention to everything around you because you are near the airport. There are planes coming in and people driving around you all day. The hardest part of the job is trying to stay safe and be safe around careless people. But if you pay attention you can do the job right and on time.
good,"Fedex will pay for your school (3,000) annually"
good,My days at work were usually relaxed and not chaotic or stressful. A lot of billing and imaging. The most enjoyable part of my job was how friendly my coworkers were.
good,job for those that enjoy daily challenges and great benefits .Plenty of room for advancement .Ability to work different environments and locations.Fast paced and one to keep you on your toes !
good,"FedEx is a wonderful place to work at, its very demanding but they also require you to get the job done in a timely manner also making sure that you are delivering the purple promise.."
good,work at FedEx  was a pain. it was all stress full sending out package in a quickly matter. the packages came really fast and there was no room to move in the trucks
good,"its okay. not a lot of work hours after peak season (nov.-dec.). very quick paced but overall its better as a seasonal job, other than fuul-time/ part time."
good,I would have loved to stay if they had the full time hours and title. They had times where thing got unorganized and fell apart and times where the whole team worked hard together
good,"A typical work day consist of a group meeting, group planning and group stretching. What I've learned over the course of being there is, how to move efficiently and effectively while making accurate decisions. The management was some of the best when it comes to dealing with people and problems. Workplace culture is really friendly and helpful once you've learned your role. The hardest part of the job was the time you had to be there to get started at 2am then be ready to move at a fast pace. The most enjoyable part was the company cookouts!"
good,I would say my time working at FedEx started out great and ended poorly. The training week was great. Getting a feel of the environment and seeing the machines ect was getting me excited to start. Everyone I talked to ( employees/ employers) were awesome friendly people. Issues started when they decided to place me being a new employee on the worst dock in the hub.. I was new and was trying to get in the swing of things and trying to figure out a routine I would be comfortable with because the two people that were training me didn't train me at all. I was stuck not knowing what to do with boxes that weren't scanning ect. Everyday I was told I wasn't trying and that i was doing a horrible job. Not something a person within the first week wants to hear when they are trying their hardest.
good,If you are looking for a fast paced environment with a lot of over time this would be a great opportunity for you . Great management . Weekly pay. Lost of hours.
good,"Great place to work if looking for job fast , but hours are short so your pay is little to nothing , starting pay like 10 and you get a raise every 3-6 months"
good,a typical day at the job was usually running up and down the beltlines to make sure that they do not jam up. it's a very physically and mentally demanding job when you're out there and trying to make sure that nothing gets jammed up. but the managers are professional and courteous most of the time
good,"Not enough hours , too little pay , hard work compared to the pay , awesome managers , very down to earth people , this is more of a job for people who are just looking for something on the side"
good,"First when we arrive we hydrate and stretch and talk about production and they tell us our quota for the day. We Start work and load and unload. Sometimes we use the forklift. Kept workstation clean and neat.  All items had to be put away, locked up and accounted for before leaving."
good,I absolutely loved this job I have ever had. It was challenging physically but so much fun meeting new people and being outside of an office or warehouse all day.
good,I like the job but I need more weekly working hours to take care of my child and myself. They also have great benefits but I haven't been asked to work overtime since I've been there.
good,Productive an a fast pace place to work an get an workout!!! An the bad thing about working there is you have to work in all weather conditions.Another good thing is you are your own boss!!!!
good,"My current job include HR experience, safety experience, and customer experience daily. It allows you learn something new and the expectations are high. The most enjoyable part is seeing your employees promote and grow within the company."
good,"FedEx was a quick paced job. Unloading bout 15 trucks a day in a matter of time. Lifting, bending and moving around a lot. Always lifting heavy objects from different companies in the area."
good,Fast pace job good money per hour but not a lot of hours easy job to learn simple instruction payed every week.........................................
good,"-not a lot of overtime"
good,"A typical day start with reading customer issues and queries and making sure they are attended . After that, the office will be opened to attend to customer I queries and complaints"
good,- fun place to be
good,"it's an extremely fast paced environment, heavy lifting  is involved. it's a fun at time, very competitive. the hours to work are different and very by the content of their shipment."
good,I got this job from a friend of mine. This job is okay for me so far. Everyday I have to come work early to load all the packages and get my truck ready.
good,"A typical work day includes clocking in with your work badge, and simply walking to your work station. On the job training is easy to grasp and coworkers and managers have plenty of patience for new workers. Workplace is clean and active with work, so you'll never be board. Hardest part of the job is just the heavy lifting(40+ lbs.), but the most enjoyable part of the job is how fast the time goes by! Honestly, time( and packages) fly's at FedEx"
good,"Empresa boa de se treabalhar, pode trazer comida que tem refeitorio, e tem disponibilidade de tempos e horários, bem flexivel e bem compreencivel."
good,"Loved the work that i did but the management wasnt the best felt like they showed alot of favoritsm there, but overall loved what i did just didnt like management"
good,as long as you work you have a job. the chances to advance seemed to be more so favoritism. the benefits were outstanding and very hard to replace. very dangerous place to work must be aware of your surroundings at all time
good,"very fast paced and hard on you physically and mentally"
good,I worked at the airport. Majority of workers work 3 to 4 hours per shift. The pace is normally fast with a short slow pace at the end of the shift. I learned how to work at a fast pace. Management can work for you as long as you stay out of their way at the right time. The culture sometimes can show favoritism. An example of this would be one employee getting written up for doing some thing wrong that another employee does not get written up for. The hardest part of the job is working in bad weather. the best part of the job is getting benefits.
good,"The pay is not all that great for what people have to do, and all the overtime we have to work meaning taking time from our family's and having a life outside of work."
good,"The job payed well and it allowed my wife and I to raise our kids without daycare. Very hard on the mind and body, lots of hours, good for you workaholics"
good,As a package handler the wages and benefits did basically nothing. The people were great to work with but in order to advance in the company it was nearly impossible unless you knew someone that was high up in that hub.
good,FedEx is growing everyday and it will never stop growing. Good benefits. If the company take care of their staff then the staff will take care of the company.
good,"Manger was awesome and very understanding, made you feel like a person and not just another employee. I had gotten injured on the job and the managers stuck their necks out for me allowing me to work longer than company policy would allow, they even made allowances to compensate my injury. Other co-workers were very kind and kept checking on me to make ure I was okay."
good,fedex is alright every day is a hard day at fedex becuase there is always business and work it is stressfull and you need to be in shape for that job but its cool working there
good,"working here is great it could be better but hey ill take it it pays for my bills, food, and my child needs. i like the people i work with and i like my supervisor but i have his manger she always want us to go above and beyond but give us like $0.09 cents raise we work our butts off."
good,Good benefits employees work as a team to get product shipped clean building hard worker great pay would love to go back break at the right time off on weekends
good,"Hard work, fast paced.  Don't get benefits for a long time based on hours, only get 3 hours a day at most so far.  Trucks and packages are dirty, gloves with good grip are a must (but aren't provided)."
good,"Director was awesome, operations managers didn't know what was going on except one. Awesome vendor manager as well!! More organization and team work from ops team. Overall great experience I would recommend this job to other people."
good,"FedEx offers vast opportunities and excellent compensation. The health benefits are also better than average. Depending on your role, you may not have a healthy work/life balance."
good,"Having worked for FedEx Office for over 10+ years, I can say that it is a great place to work while building for your future.  Most store have flexible hours and you can learn so much while working there.  The contacts made with coworkers and clients can help you build a foundation that can help in any career you choose.  "
good,FedEx Smartpost was a very organized and productive company that sorts and handles packages. Throughout the warehouse there are multiple areas of work..
good,FedEx is a fast paced work environment that requires everyone to work together to ensure that all packages are sorted and ready to be loaded on planes and trucks by the end of the shift.
good,The job was easy and could be so easy and wonderful when everyone is on the same page and working at the same pace. Higher management didn't do a good job on applauding being top outbound and did a great job at saying we aren't doing good and was quite contradictory. Most maagers didn't care about respect towards package handlers and cared only for the selves which drove moral down.
good,"You must have a clientele that is willing to follow you or you must be willing to make less than training pay after training is complete.  The benefits are great!  Employees are nice, however, you have to earn  your pay.  It is a numbers game.  As a remote user, don't expect a promotion."
good,Fedex is a easy going job that pays well but you can have days where you don't get many hours so your paychecks are not much to live on your own. its probably a great job if your a student working part-time and going to school.
good,"This was my first job out of high school. It was very character building. Working with your hands loading trucks. Rain, sleet or snow, we had to be out there loading trucks."
good,"- A typical day at work involves managing small business accounts with FedEx, providing guidance consultation and maintaining business relationships to help grow their business."
good,"Fast pace environment, great place to start a career at Entry Level. Anyone can advance and be promoted to a higher job making more money than they started."
good,"A typical day at work consist of scanning in packages, loading them into the truck and delivering them. You are expected to work long hours. Management for the subcontractors I work for is good. They help out as much as they can. Hardest part of the job might be that you will get some huge packages( furnitures, tv, etc) and you will have to deliver them yourself. Most enjoyable part of the job is finishing early; finish early and you enjoy the rest of your day."
good,"My hands hurt from using many papers through the machine. At that time I was frustrated and angry, and I quit. Later I found I made a mistake because I'm deaf and didn't know until months later that they were willing to talk with me and possibly transfer me to another department."
good,"typical work day consisted of a minimum 10-12 hours a day, "
good,FedEx is a fast paced very intense workout type of job. You really have to be physically inclined to stack boxes at a box to can ratio of 30 to 100000. The overall pay is fine as long as you are not paying a mortgage or multiple bills. I would recommend this job to high school students or to college students who live with their parents.
good,It's a nice job not all labor is hard.  They need more air/fans and better supervisors who care about the employees.
good,"Difficile de travailler avec une équipe stable des heures spécial et de la machinerie peu conforme, début du travail a 2h am et fin de la journée midi ou 1h, on vois que très rarement les patron donc difficile de changer quel que chose on est jamais des réunions donc pas facile de trouver un équilibre travail loisir.mais le meilleur ces que ces toujours moin lourd donc pas de stress de balance.on est évaluer par un homme qui ne conduit pas de camion donc pas expérience en conduite."
good,Did not work for the company long enough to really give a review. But I can tell you that the job can either be fast paced or the day can drag by very slow.
good,"Good company. We can learn many in this organization. "
good,"FedEx loading company was very professional, with little down time, meaning no time to get bored. Slightly easy hours and they seemed to go by quicker seeing as though there was always work to be done."
good,"package delivering  unloading and load vans"
good,"The hardest part of the job is when you came to feel dizzy reading the list of rates in different countries and the province or city they belong. There are tons of it. You can't master it in a duration of one day."
good,"A typical day at work includes copying,sending packages in and out of the fedex store and I learned how to relax myself when I'm under pressure I had a very down to earth manager he would let you work at your pace,the hardest part of my job is when we were on a time line or had a dead line,the most enjoyable part of my job is working along side of my co-workers."
good,good company good people and work place fast pace fun last four years worked there it got bad due to management and packages over people
good,"good job if you dont mind 15 hours per week, other than that it is pretty good pay and the people are cool. Good management and supervisors"
good,FedEx can be a fun place to work and a good place to start your career but currently not more then that. Unless relocation is an option advancing beyond entry level management would be difficult since there are more then enough people who are willing to move.
good,"Great if everyone do their part. Consequences for me personally was asthma, constantly triggered by all the dust inside the factory."
good,This job is for someone looking for a steady 9 to 5 very steady and reliable work place.i worked here while i was going to school and living in a didffernt city.
good,"A typical day at fedex is to go get the small packages. Once you go get the small packages dump them in the sorter. Sort the small packages in the correct bin. Then once the packages are sorted in the correct bin then you bag the packages.After the packages have been bagged then the place the bags on the ic belt. You continue this cycle until there are no more packages. It's a very fast paste job. No time for taling, you have to get the job done in an fast but safe paste.Co workers usually get along with one another because working at Fed Ex require team work.The hardest park of the job is making sure you are working safe at all time. The most enjoyable part of this job is working really fast."
good,"My typical work day is checking email and following up.  The emails contains searching for customers packages, reviewing time cards, disgruntle customers and employees.  Also, I audit our business process to ensure we are following company policies."
good,Pay is good while working in a team and individual environment is what I like to do. Not climate controlled which is a huge Con in the winter.
good,"A typical day of work usually consists of the team collecting bags of freight and placing them on their correct belts according to the different codes.  The hardest part of the job is being on missort. Missort consists of having to handle your own bags and collecting the documents that have not been scanned correctly. The most enjoyable part of the job is the tuition reimbursement program. FedEx actually helps you pay your loans if you make good grades and have good work ethic.  Every day is different, but it is very rewarding."
good,I learned how to make good decisions on such short notice. How to problem shoot issues and resolve quickly. The staff was very helpful in assisting with whatever you need.
good,Hard work but great overall benefits. It was a company who cared about its employees advancement. They also offered classes to advance in manager positions
good,"I've worked at fedex ground as a package handler for over 5 years. "
good,I enjoyed working with FedEx because I was given a chance to meet someone new everyday on my delivery route. The staff at FedEx Ground were a great team to work for.
good,Assemble packages that came from different city's and place them in the right truck. Learn how to work together as a team the manager was great and understandable.
good,"the job paid very well. The managers were terrible."
good,"-come in have a short team meeting & hop right in a truck & start unloading."
good,"Great company but the Room for advancement is rather slow for my taste , management is good , pay is decent and the benefits superb but everybody starts out as part time and you aren't guaranteed more than 17.5 hours a week (PT employee) and when there are hours available its usually like 1.5 maybe less twice  a week most weeks as a part time employee you average about 15 hours which is hard to live on"
good,"I have been very sorry that the company was taken over by new people i planned on retiring with this company but the new managers made that impossible to do, they brought in friend and family so many of us in long term employees had to leave an look for other work, butt I did not want to go, my wife is still working for the company"
good,"Great entry into workforce position, not a permanent job.  With little pay and no benefits at all the position is not the best position."
good,"I felt like if i didnt move fast enough, that i would get fired. I was being moved around way too much. i was always put in bad situations."
good,Although i liked the job and its people i met i had a hard time with it because of an injury from the past. Yo definitly have to be a fit person to do these kinds of jobs in my eyes
good,"Sign in to start my day.  Admired the coaching(on line) to improve my listening  skills, and problem solving skills. Management team excellent. Fun place to work when at the call center, then we began to work from home. The hardest part was tracking down lost package. The most enjoyable was working from home, and meeting the customers needs"
good,"Company had a nice work environment.  "
good,A typical work day consist of about 4 to 5 hours a day. My co-workers are friendly and down to earth people willing to help you out if help is needed. The hardest part of the job is trying to get the packages to people on time when there are a lot of traffic on the road. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you get the packages off on or before town.
good,una empresa arriesgada tras llevar poco en el correo domestico aca en colombia.los mejores beneficios se los lleva simpre los vinculados por la empresa pero eso es normal .para un tercero como en mi caso no hay estabildad
good,the hardest part of the job is working beside a bunch of non-workers. Its hard for any work to get done because everyone is worried about what everybody else is doing.
good,It is very collaborative and fun place to work. People are very cooperative and willing to help. It is mostly 9-5 job with very felxible work hours.
good,Good place to work good pay great benifets great work culture fast past enviroment time goes by fast. Look forward to work each day
good,A good place If you are single. There is no balance between home and work. I worked nights and never seen my family. If it were days it would be a great place to work. Great people to work with. The opportunities are good to move up with in.
good,Manual labor that sometimes makes you feel like you are being taken advantage of.
good,I learn different ways to load trucks more efficiently and faster. management I feel could be a little more organized. I like some of my co-workers because they help to try and complete the task so we can get out earlier and not be there all night. Others try to wait around and not help out. jumping in and out the truck to stack boxes and hop back down and load. the most enjoyable part is leaving!
good,"Overall good job hard work, good benefits including nice work environment."
good,I would load and unload trucks.  I ran the smalls area and the sorter. I would unload the vans and transport over sized items to the appropriate areas by use of a tugger.
good,I learned a lot about warehouse and team management skills. Fed Ex was a interesting job. It was a comfortable work environment and I enjoyed working with my employees
good,Very short hours. Had to be able lift up to 75 pounds. Management was decent. Co-worker got a long great. The job was easy.
good,"love working with the drivers nothing is really hard of the job, love to see the drivers they have a great time with me and they are very respectful towards me and patient love to work with people."
good,"On a typical work day, feels like a gym almost. Also I've learned to load and unload trailers, how packages get shipped on the ground around the U.S., how to be safe in a warehouse, and also about the company's history. Some of the managers I liked, some I didn't but that's work life. Their were a few co-workers that couldn't handle the job but, that did not stop me from handling mines. Most of the job was hard but, staying energize was the most hardest. On the job I enjoyed the workout and the competition to see who can load or unload their trailer the fastest. All around I did like Fex Ex, the pay wasn't enough."
good,Fedex Ground is a fast paced and very challenging place to work.  Linehaul Transportation management is very challenging especially around the holiday seasons.  Typically daily I would manage a group of coordinators in the day to day operations in the Linehaul department.  Working with outside carriers to ensure timely loading of trailers was very important to maintain good relationships.
good,"A day at FedEx Express is good. There are lot's of challenge's but they all can be accomplish with a great team of employee's. The primary goal there is to make sure packages go out on time to satisfied customers. I learned a lot from this job such as operating on machines, and driving a tug. The management here at fedex is ok. You really have that one on one time with them to get to know them. They'll let you know how your working, and a great job your doing."
good,"Pros: Descent Pay good management, really care about their employees. Quality Driven Management - This program has roots into every nook and cranny of operations and IT. FedEx truly believes in continuously improving to get better, finding better ways of doing things, being more efficient, gaining new skills and always pushing the boundaries of achievement while at the same time encouraging employees to live heavy family lives, taking vacations, flexible work from home options (mandatory 2 weeks of work from home) etc."
good,"I ultimately learned a lot from this specific line of work. It gave me a tougher edge when it comes to gritty type of work, and it taught me how to be more patient even when things aren't going my way. "
good,"Intensely physical work, from start to finish."
good,Fedex is a fun place to work with good people for the most part. Leadership is on point and there are some possible opportunities for advancement. The biggest downfall is that they rarely promote workers to full time positions
good,The hardest part of my job is that it is physical and you are working out in the elements. It is completely different than any other work environment I have worked in. I've met a lot of great people in the 11 years I have been there.
good,While working at FedEx I learned how not to give up and to work smart not hard.
good,"pulling baggage carts, scanning packages ,unloading and loading cans and sorting mail"
good,The hardest part of the job would be the various start times. Waking up at 2 or 3AM is a little difficult to get used to.
good,Goal oriented and ability to handle customers with confidence and learns fun
good,"I've lerneed how to move heavy boxes and how to separte by town,cities. Working there wth your co-workers are fun. There very warming welcoming. Moving the boxes was the hardest thing to do."
good,"If you have extra time in your day to spare than I would say do this job because its good extra money. Other than that, I would not recommend to be a full time employee there. Once you get comfortable there they will ask you to do more and give a terrible raise. This is why I'm trying to leave and get a better job."
good,Over all Fedex is a great company to work for. For the most part management is exceptionally friendly. Co-workers are also all very friendly and make coming into work everyday enjoyable. This particular position (cargo handler)  involves early start times that are all different throughout the week. The warehouse is very cold in the winter and very hot  in the summer which makes it a little difficult to perform at 100%.
good,Pretty fun and relax job once you get used to the amount of work. The job is best compared to getting paid to work out in a gym because it is a good workout. Everyone is laid back.
good,Fast paced heavy lifting good co worker and management and flexible work hours good job to have while in school
good,its hard but we make it because its more as going to the gym all the time so it help you lose weight and gain muscles and co workers are more friendly
good,"FedEx is a very fast-paced and physically strenuous work environment. Breaks are rare and lunches are only required if you work over six hours. If you hate monotony and love a challenge, like me, this company is perfect for you. Rarely does one work day resemble another. Flexibility and quick critical thinking decisions are a must to be successful. Benefits, tuition reimbursement, and/or job security make the hard working conditions worthwhile."
good,"A typical day at work was very hard but only 3 to 4 hrs per day. I loaded 18 wheeler truck from the belly of the truck to the top of the truck. The criteria for the job was to load at least one truck within those three to four hours. I learned hard work, determination and motivation gets you a long way. Management was okay they basically wanted us to meet the quota for the day. My co- workers were hardworkers and team players. The whole day was the hardest part because we had to load an entire 18 wheeler truck within 3 to 4 hrs. The most enjoyable part of the day was working with my co- workers because everyone got along and we all helped each other meet each others quotas."
good,"-Typical Day at work: Not knowing exactly how much work had to be done, different every day. Going into work I did not know what time I would be leaving making it difficult to plan anything outside of work. Could be there 9-13 hours a day."
good,"A usual day at work can go well or not so good depending on your health. It is very intense, timed, and precise. I learned how to work more collaboratively and how to be adaptive and creative. The managers and coworkers are all very nice, friendly, and professional. The hardest part of the job is not giving up and finding your own routine and sticking with it. I like this job because I can exercise as i work."
good,"Great company, great compensation."
good,"It always used to be busy and learned alot from the co-workers and the management, starting from the operating system to the business environment."
good,started at 12:00am till 8:00am. The management will not help you hands on they will send someone else to help you if needed. co workers were either college kids or mostly 30 years old if not older. Hardest part is waking up for the job or working during the summer when its very humid.
good,Hard and extreme work insome cases very cold or hot. I learn to work throu the pressure and how to deal with coworker.the hardest part of my job is the heat at timesand the most enjoyable part of my jobthat it keep you in shape.
good,"If you like making a difference in a company, this is a great place to work for. "
good,"it was okay i loved that i worked mon-fri, fast pace environment. the hardest part of my job was when there was a jam alot of packages came at me all at one time and i couldnt see the packages labels to sort, i enjoyed when the belt stay on which means there won't any jams."
good,"Young adults should definitely consider working at FedEx as a loader. It's decent pay, tuition reimbursement, flexible hours. "
good,Fed ex was my first warehousing job.  The hardest part of the job was nothing I enjoyed every bit of it.
good,There is a posible chance of growth within the company. If you like to be a brown noser. Managment seems to like to play favoriates at times. 
good,"As a Release and Classification Analyst, I was responsible for completing proper documentation for incoming FedEx shipments and submitting it to customs officials. I had friendly and helpful coworkers. I learned much about tariff information. My manager was kind and always available to staff."
good,"fedex is a really great place to work you can learn a lot and grow there. the managers are ok. the co-workers are cool, but the hardest part of the job would be the laboring. but the enjoyable part is that you can meet a lot of great people."
good,good company to work for if ur looking to supplement ur income
good,"a typical day as a loader is loading at a fast!! rate in a specific manner with only a ten mite rate . as a walph stress. dead lines . no excuses , leader , motivator ,on toes , fast, demanding ,"
good,"loading and unloading trucks at a fast pace.i learned all diffrent parts of the trucks, me and all my coworkers worked as a team..the most enjoyable part of work was completing a truck."
good,"A typical day at FedEx usually runs pretty smoothly. You must get there on time and clock in. Then, right away the sort starts. Most days we have around 6 trailers to unload. When we finish we clock out and go home. I have learned to work with others in a high stress level area. The management is good. They treat us fairly, but still enforce the rules. My co-workers are great. I get along with them very well. The hardest part of my job is probably the heavy lifting. I enjoy having others around me to make the day a little more enjoyable."
good,"Working at FED EX you learn about Team work, working together makes things so much easier and finish faster. Management was great, very understanding with different situations. The hardest part of my job there, was when it was at low pace. I enjoyed the hours and my co-workers I enjoyed having a job."
good,"-Dia tipico de trabalho,são encomendas com minutos contados,porem o transito sempre de deixa eufórico o carro para,o semáforo para mas o segundos não para."
good,FedEx is a great place to work if you seek security and work life balance.
good,"Just helped people with making copies, faxing documents and assisting people with services they offered. Processed and shipped peoples packages out. Managed cash drawer. The best part of the job is meeting new people and helping people out. It is always nice to see people walking out with a smile"
good,"• Involving in creating the domain objects and writing the xsd, castor mapping and binding XML files to domain objects."
good,At Fedex I have not only learned of how important it is to be focus on what you suppose to do. Being alert at all times is very important since safe is first. There is daily routine for all workers.
good,A great work place.
good,"Never again, Fedex sucked the entrepnuer out of me, I never felt as good about Fedex as Kinko's"
good,very hard work to do and quickly moving without stop. It was hardest part of the job.
good,This job taught me that customer service should always be a company's number one priority. Being located at the New Orleans Convention center I delt with many diverse groups of people some in better moods than others. This was a very fulfilling job because the customers were typically traveling and I helped make things as easy as possible for them.
good,Management discriminates.
good,able to stand on feet aleast 5 hours. You must be able to lift constantly and build a wall to hold packages. Able to scan packages and sort them to the right destination in a timely manner
good,Loading and unloading trucks
good,"Most workers do not get paid well enough for the tough work that is required of them. The most they hire for is night workers, third shift, but day side is paid better. Not enough hours and not enough pay. They will pretty much hire anyone. Enjoy going home at the end of the shift. You are guaranteed 17 hours a week, but hardly get that. They also state that your start time will not change... it is a lie. A lot about how great this place is is a lie."
good,"Plenty of training to learn new skills, meet a diverse group of people, starting pay is great"
good,Everyday you before you start working you must attend pre-work. Managers relay all pertinent information to employees about what the company expects. After pre-work everyone has to stretch before start working. The hardest part of the job is it can become extremely hot at times. The best part of the job is when there are pot lucks for the work group.
good,We get a lot done in a short amount of time. I have learned that with our turn around time we don't get a lot of cross training done. Management isn't all that bad. We always have new people so it's sometimes hard to get to know anyone. This job is very fiscally demanding so not many stay for long.
good,"Overall, the environment of couriers are not very friendly, and many managers have came and gone, and ones that are left are OK, except one who is the best at what he does. Meeting your goals gets frustrating and if you do more and meet your goals, they swamp you with more work. Best part of this job is that your outside on the best days and can enjoy the sun all day long, and it gets better if you leave early. You learn plenty of areas, makes it easier to visit someone any place else because you can now break down any street so long you know how to check it out."
good,"Working at FedEx Freight as of right now is okay. As of right now, working PT is a little hassle. I will say that I hear different stories from over employers that work at different center locations. I will say that it's dsome of the management that can make the job sort of a hassle. The company overall I think is great."
good,it is a great part time job. ive learned alot about loading planes an warehouse work. i have a great manager and my co workers are great but the hardest part about the job is that there is not enough hours to support a family if your not able to move up through seniority but everything else is hreat
good,I learned to work in a timely manner.A typical day at work for me was loading and unloading the aircraft.Fedexpress is a productive place to work .
good,"Stay on course , move your bills with no exceptions at a steady pace of 6 Bills an hour. My co-workers are great people who will help with anything on or off the job. Manegment needs to keep employuees informed of up comming changes, overtime hours, changes to schedules, and focus more on there duties as supervisors."
good,"Good schedules, Good pay, Good team work, Busy place to work at but good place to learn."
good,"Unload packages varying from different sizes and weight from trailers, drive tugger, repair damaged packages, and scan packages for proper loading into trailers."
good,"It's hard work, the hours suck, but you're working for a great company with great benefits."
good,Great job if you like walking all day....assisting customers and working on computers..
good,"I was responsible for loading and unloading trucks, I learned that I was a quick learner and that I could work expeditiously and effectively. My supervisors were nice. I worked alone and didn't interact much with co- workers due to my job title. The hardest part of this job was the constant lifting of 75 pounds or more. The most enjoyable part of this job was the pay."
good,I would like to see the workplace environment continue to grow into a better environment with better moral and more communication and interaction on an individual basis
good,"The company was a good starting point for me. It laid down the values I use to day in my work ethic, and taught me how to handle myself under stressful situations."
good,"fulltimers work two sorts lasting around two and a half hours each which is a little over five hours a day, thirty hours a week.Not really a good fulltime job"
good,Training takes up your weekends or days off. Management is always in a rush and can be pushy of course to get the air planes out. Just like any other job you have your pros And cons.
good,"The first few weeks will be very hard and is super heavy on the body if youre not used to it so it leads to alot of people quitting after the first day, after a while, it becomes really easy."
good,Its a Job i go to work and i go home because of the hours i work its hard to do anything with my family because i sleep all day and that's not healthy for family
good,"'Fantastic environment to work with great people!!'"
good,Good people to work for training and great work environment. Work hours are great also. Flexible management fellow employees always ready to help when in need.
good,"Been there 6 years and I am a very hard worker and produce above average numbers for the location I work at! My issue is u can literally do nothing all day and still get exactly the same as the next employee. Seems to me during my time there the biggest slackers are the ones that get rewarded.""promoted"" Anyways if u make best friends with management u will go places as far as gettin promotions"
good,The amount of work differentiate depending on what season it is. Around  Summer time the work is usually light. Right around Thanksgiving/ Christmas the work is usually stressful. You will learn the meaning of teamwork and get close to a lot of people. Everyone is very close-knitted.
good,"Fed Ex has great benefits & job opportunities. If you want to move up, it’s up to you to do that. Fed Ex looks within the company first and then looks outside the company."
good,"Good job if your willing to hustle and put in the hours. Pay by day salary is tough when you work past 8 hrs. Otherwise its a good job for a while, no real upside ie. advancement with any good benefits"
good,Everybody was very friendly and understanding of being a newcomer. All of the workers were able to hold conversations with me and make the time go by faster while meeting new people and making more friends in the environment.
good,"I had a good work experience at FedEx. I travelled a lot and was able to learn more about the Texas Hill Country. I enjoyed working with my friends, too."
good,Good company to work for. Fair. hardest part of the job are the hours. Management for the most part is good. Learned a lot about logistics and the city. Good with training for advancement in the company if that is the direction you are wanting to go.
good,Trying to load the trucks when your new and no one really helps. So the hardest part of the job would have to be really figuring out how to do the job.
good,"Enjoyed my time there. The most cheerful management experience I ever had In my life. If I could    take it with me to any other job,  Idefinitely would."
good,FedEx express is great place to gain experience and a great work ethic. It would be better if we could obtain more hours per work week. I was a package handler and it was easy to learn.
good,"I felt that the more dependable you are, they require more of you and not let the other employees on your level pull their weight in work. Managers need to talk to employers in a respectable manner. Better communication is always needed. They say you can take a break, but really fuss when you take it."
good,"Honestly, it can be hard and it's straight labor. I currently work on the load side where you are expected to build of wall inside the trailer using the boxes given to you from the chute. Some can be heavy and some can be light and they come in different amount of shapes and sizes."
good,sometimes the management is lacking skill and backbone. like to over work the ard workers and keep the slow and lazy people doing easy work. shows favoritism. rarely keep your breaks almost never. but do have good benefits and sometimes understaffed.
good,My experience was excellent until I was laid off in June of this year. This is a fast paced environment not everyone that applies and gets hired makes it after first month on their own.
good,"productive workplace, good benefits for a part time position. The work can be physically challenging as packages can weigh from letter size to gym equipment throughout the unloading and loading process,there is assistance from co workers to ease some workload."
good,Its a hot environment to work at in the summer and you sweat a ton however it is also a tough place to balance between school and work because you will lack energy for free time.
good,"hard work at fedex, need to have a lot of strength to work here, lifting boxes and loading trucks can be overwhelming. the people are very friendly at fedex, management isn't all that great they get mad when you take small breaks."
good,"spend all of my shift working with others to load trucks for delivery, learned proper lifting techniques, the management is very understanding and kind. The hardest part of the job is keeping up without wearing yourself down, and there are a lot of room for workplace injuries."
good,"Empresa que incentiva o funcionário com alguns incentivos, para motivar e obter o retorno esperado."
good,"Prior to starting work you will have an orientation which goes over their safety rules as well as other company guidelines. You will train with another package handler until you get the hang of things on your own, then you will start working on filling trucks alone. For the most part the job is pretty simple, you will get the hang of it within a couple weeks. Can be physically demanding at the beginning but it gets easier with time. Job can be very fast paced, you must be able to scan, move and successfully fill trucks while ensuring the companies safety policy. Package handlers will have opportunities to  move up in the company, if they work hard and show leadership qualities."
good,I was hired through a connection at Fedex just to help with the rush of holiday packages for the Christmas season. This year they kept it to only friends and family but the pay was very substantial ($17 per hour). Everyone was required to unload packages from the shipping containers which guaranteed a few hours per day but I was lucky enough to help deliver packages as well which could be up to 10 hours because of the sheer amount of packages. Work was grimy and physically demanding but after about 4 days I had already managed to get overtime.
good,"Been a package handler there for several years. Turnover rate is high, initial package handler training is mediocre at best. Normally come in around 5pm and work until 11pm or so. Promotions are non-existent and opportunities for advancement are very slim. This is a temp job for students or people needing some extra side work. Lots of dust and noise in the building, the trailers are not cleaned out so they are sometimes filthy inside for working. Most of the ops managers are decent people and will work with you on issues such as coming in late. Scanning equipment is OLD and frequently does not work or fails on you a lot."
good,working at fedex you have to enjoy wokring on your feet for 4-8 hours cause it is an job that will make you tired. the bosses are chill they just want make sure the package get out on time
good,"Most positions are repetitious, no room to advance. A lot of complaining from the drivers, employees.  Company gives small tokens of appreciation. No minority representation in the office or in management positions."
good,"The days are usually pretty typical, everybody works hard and try to finish as soon as possible. I've learned how to team work, fast past environment. The managers are always great, always help us out no matter what they are doing. The hardest part of the job is standing on your feet for hours and your back starting to hurt. The most enjoyable part of the job is when we all happy and when we get to leave early."
good,"good place to work, busy, lots of training.  Customer oriented, everyone is trying to jump and help other staff.  Any point you need any help they help."
good,"Will always go back to work there any time, great place to work ,good benefits.An excellent place to grow and improve your career goals to the fullest."
good,"Overall working at Fedex isn't bad, however, if you do go to school or work a second job please give yourself plenty of sleep between each. A problem I had working here was the third shift and then getting two or three hours of sleep before I had to go to class. The pay rate definitely matches for the amount of work you have to do especially during peak season."
good,"I really loved my dock worker position. I went into FedEx with very limited Forklift experience and by the time I left, I was highly skilled on the lift. The Chicago Heights dock was generally very busy and crowded. I would have loved to stay, but was forced to find employment elsewhere due to a lack of work. I was not getting enough hours. FedEx is very rewarding to those employees that have put their time into the company. However, newcomers were always overlooked when it came to working extra hours (overtime). There were many weeks where I did not get my full part time hours for the week (20 hours)."
good,hard to work when printers are always breaking down. Lots of issues with pass down information. Crew is good and management is easy to approach and speak with
good,I had no idea of what my career at Federal Express would be like when I started in 1984. The company was 10 years old and growing by double digit percentages. The security it has given me allowed me the confidence to get into management and then back to an hourly again.
good,"there was a stressful environment, lack of leadership. Tools were old and working conditions were poor. There wasn't any training provided on new and upcoming changes mechanically or electronically."
good,Majority of the coworkers were lazy and only cared for themselves. The work was physically demanding. The pay was good on paper but the hours received were sub par. management staff was amazing always looking out for everyone.
good,"I work the overnight shift.  I scan and load parcels and get them ready for delivery.  "
good,i learn how to be a leader and stay focus on what i was needed to do and i enjoyed working with my friends. Managements was okay. the hardest part of the job was to work in hot areas.
good,"Left due to moving  it was a good"
good,"I enjoy working there, but they have been cutting hours too frequently. there is plenty of overtime available during the holiday season though. needs more full time positions."
good,good workplace but the ppl made it hard. disrespectful attitudes made some parts of the job less desirable  but other than that it was a good job with great benefits.
good,"I dont like the night shift. The work was continuous and did not require the use of a brain. Overall this is not the worst job that i have ever had, however it not fun."
good,I should not have to answer questions about Fedex when i am currently looking for employment. Fedex is the least of my worries I am not interested in giving my opinion
good,"Day: dumpster fire"
good,My time with FedEx Ground was pleasant I fewlt as though the compensation was fair considering the time of day you work and the days you are required to work.
good,"Its a fair job its  Low Pay and very short hours. 3 or 4 hours a day at 9.00 was not enough . Loading and Uploading Packages,Irreg and etc.  Mangement was ok ."
good,These were grueling hours and work was not guaranteed. It was a holiday/seasonal position so with snow and other factors I wasn't guaranteed work. There was a fast paced aspect to the job where there was little room for error.
good,"Good company with perfect people to work with , with great environments and having more confidence and motives to work I got more experiences and professionalism ."
good,"Great place to work. Only thing is I worked for a contractor. Great pay weekly. I drove over 250 miles daily. I was considered a route manager. I also helped load my trucks in the morning, and unloaded it in the evenings."
good,Review past days performance multiple reports and follow up with individuals. People are the most important part of any operation. Management needs to be consistent in inspections and actions. The culture at FedEx Express is fast paced with rapid changes to adjust to the every changing market. The hardest part of being an operations manager at FedEx Express is the daily operations changes to ensure a positive outcome as a whole. The most enjoyable part of the day is when you run your preliminary reports to see the outcome of your plan
good,"A day at FedEx typically starts by walking into the warehouse and getting scanned by security at the front door. You would then go to your designated work area, and listen to your sort manager explain the days package count. After that its time to work, to me the hardest part of a day would be when the managers would have to much going up the system and get it jammed; it stop every one and nothing gets done."
good,Only worked part-time here but enjoyed it very much. the people were always pleasant an easy to get along with. Each day brought about different challenges but we were always up to the task.
good,"you learn things like time management, and the people are very nice and hard working, its not easy if you have a bad back, lots of heavy lifting. Every person there is looking to be the best."
good,Slows down in winter to almost no hours but the rest of the year is great. Workers are usually of but managers seem to quit alot.
good,"Work is fast paced and you gain experience becoming a better team player. Management was friendly and always there to assist you, and motivate you."
good,"A normal day at FedEx would be loading or unloading a trailer depending upon the package handlers scheduled shift. I learned how to properly stack load trailers in a fast-paced manner. The hardest part was keeping up with the ""package per hour"" rating."
good,Drove trucks to deliver mail and it was a very peaceful job. I moved out of state so I had to leave the company. If I didn't move I would still be with this company today.
good,"Worked as an inside sales rep, pretty mundane. I felt like there was no need for so many of us in that office. I was looked down upon by co-workers for exceeding daily goals and making them ""look bad""."
good,"Work days are 5 to 8 hours a day. For a package handle, you are in the back of a fedex truck unloading all the packages onto a conveyor belt. all the employers are very friendly as well as the management. I have learned that"
good,The time I spent there was amazing. I enjoyed working with my team and hanging with them. I was able to take off the time I needed to take off and able to get plenty of training. Hate the weather conditions you had to work in.
good,"Fast pace environment"
good,"A typical day at federal express would include sorting, scanning, flipping, unjamming, rewrapping. loading, and unloading boxes. You are required to lift 75 pounds on your own or with the help of your coworkers."
good,"They change your route on you at any given time, so you have to relearn. They lowered our rate per packed by 50% out of nowhere."
good,"Arriving at about 3 AM and Usually Finished by about 7:30 AM. Working in a warehouse-like environment, receiving and sending packages through conveyor belt."
good,A typical day begins with a brief meeting in which workers are advised to work safely and given the volume for that day.  Good job for work security with flexible work schedules.  The work days are short but productive as team members work toward a common goal---getting that day's work volume done.
good,"The movement of packages from truck routes carrying large shipping containers are monitored, passed on through a conveyor belt and loaded into smaller shipping containers. Freight needs to be gone and on airplane within first three hours of job."
good,a typical day at work is loading two trucks and at fedex I learned boy or girl you will get worked exactly the same. management their can really use some improving and some of the co workers are lazy. the hardest part of the job is loading 800 or 900pacvkages in 4 hours and still have to help some co workers out. the most enjoyable part of the job is going home and the cookouts
good,"Es una una empresa en la cual me permitio tener crecimiento laboral y en lo personal con un buen enfoque en la vida cotidiana. ya que sus politicas son muy bien estipulada y enfocadas al colaborador y al buen servicio del y al  cliente.."
good,Overall a good place to work at with good benefits and advancement opportunities for your career. Also a great work environment.
good,its a good part time job. pay is good and pays every week. early morning hours you get in and get out quick. good management.
good,A typical day at work is sometime very stressful. The hardest part of the job is getting all of the packages to the plane on time.
good,"FeDex is a great place to work. The benefits are great but the hours vary depending on where you are assigned to work. They have hired a lot of young people, so sometime you can run into various immature acts. overall I think it can be better, but for know it is just work."
good,"My day consist of importation of products into the country. Our department has to check and fill out FDA, FCC, and Fish and Wildlife for clearance."
good,Typical day at work is loading 350- 400 packages per hour. We would be assigned to 1 to 3 shoots and be responsible for the packages that slid down these shoots into each truck.
good,"working here was great for me, because this job got my foot in the door.. witch put me on my way. i was never late to work always on time... i member this one time me and a few co-workers was going to lunch and they was telling me if i didn't want to late i shouldn't come so i stayed back at the job, and my co-works was laughing at because i hate to late"
good,"Joining Fedex in the beginning was very frustarting, but I knew that I did not have a back up plan, so I stuck it out. I had not yet completed High School, but I did continue to go to school and make it to work in the evening. I stuck with working for Fedex until my mother became very ill and I had to go take care of her. Fedex was very welcoming and the people there helped me out alot my first few days because lifting those boxes were sometimes hard to lift by myself. There wasnt any air conditioning and sometimes it would get as hot as a hundred degrees outside, while its even hotter inside the trucks that were just sitting outside. There was a fan connected to the truck, but it blew air from the outside. Overall I would have stayed if there wasn't a family emergency."
good,"Come into work at midnight and work till 4am, very fast paced and will make you work for your money. Make sure you have the times to work here, with only giving 20 hours a week they be leave there are your number one job..."
good,I loved working for fed-ex.The only problem that i was having was heavy lifting and living to far from the job.With that being said i missed a lot of days not being able to get to work do to no transportation.
good,A typical day at work is loading or unloading trucks.I learned how to load and stack boxes as neat as possible.They have good managers.Everybody works mostly independent.The hardest part of the job is lifting the heavy boxes.The best part of the job is the flexible schedule.
good,"This company is great with benefits and job protection. On the other hand, the management changes every other year leaving the employees questioning their leadership skills. Employees are aware of changes at the last minute without enough time to adjust properly. The company also has favoritism towards employees that have more seniority."
good,"Working at FedEx Ground during the summer was extremely demanding, yet the managers took steps to ensure quality performance and maintain a positive working environment. The co-workers were always sociable and hard-working."
good,"Couldn't have better management for this position."
good,Aprendi que temos que procurar darmos o melhor sempre e procura evoluir . Era um ambiente agradavel de se trabalhar todos muito animados. A parte mais agradavel é que tudo o que a empresa queria fazer de diferente pegava a opniao de todos os funcionarios sempre presentiando quem se saia melhor no trabalho sempre motivando
good,Fedex is an excellent place to start a career. this job is basically a seasonal job. the hours pick up during holiday times.
good,a typical day at work I would unload at least 4 or maybe 5 trailers. my manager actually helped me out a lot during the time that I was working for FedEx. my co-workers were  awesome the spoke they respected my wishes I respected there's. I think the hardest part of the was loading the trailers instead of unloading them. the most enjoyable part of working for FedEx was that the work they gave us was worth the way they were paying us I also had fun for the time that I was working for FedEx
good,"At the start of the day the crew would talk for a bit and get ready with our equipment, managment had a meeting every morning just to keep us informed on what was going on, i have learned alot from streets and handeling responsability, the hardesnt part was learning the streets after that is was easy after that. the best part of my job was the crew great people"
good,"Fast pace physical work. Tasks like loading, stacking, scanning, and weighing freight. Employees are constantly working the minute they clock in."
good,"A typical workday consist of handling packages expeditiously."
good,"I love my job and my coworkers. At this job, I learn something new on a daily basis. The benifits are great and my job is very secure. I just wish the pay was better."
good,great people to get along with great management amazing fans great coworkers noting hard about the job
good,Great place to work if you don't mind a physically straining job.
good,"A typical day at work at the FedEx smart post is comprised of clerical duties such as lifting packages in and out the building. scanning boxes and inspecting packages."
good,The inclimate weather was difficult. But I enjoyed loading planes.
good,"Estou a 3 anos e 4 meses na empresa e o que pude observar é que a empresa valoriza seus colaboradores, os incentiva a crescer."
good,"1.	Business Relationship (Motivational Fits):"
good,"Good place to work. Great work life balance, nice co-workers, very challenging."
good,"It was a good workforce "
good,"Great place.."
good,"A typical night at work, wasn't so normal because the shift started at 3:45 am, so it was quit early to be trying to laugh and really just be happy to even see anybody that early in the morning for work, but as the morning got later everyone started to wake up and really joke around with each other with an occasional argument here and there. What I learned was how to sort out packages, and deliver them all to the correct line to be loaded into the right trucks to be delivered, and also I learned how to load and unload trucks. My co-workers weren't the average co-workers, they were all from different types of cultures, some were the ruff and tough type, while others were kind but had tough skin and they were all about getting the work done while taking some breaks in between. I think the hardest part about working in a warehouse was that I was the smallest and only female on a line of all men, while loading three trucks alone because I couldn't really get much help with lifting up the heavy big packages. The most enjoyable part of the job was when, we all were awake enough to crack jokes on each other to get done a little faster."
good,It was a very good jobs with great benefits. People worked together and got along well with other employees.
good,"I would say that boxes are something managable and sometimes not, my cowokers where helpful when i or the next person needs help, hardest part when it gets busy with boxes filling up in the trucks and cold especially on cold days."
good,Load and scan every package that came down my shoot. some packages are really heavy. you have to really have a certain mind set to work at Fedex.
good,"ok job, if you dont mind working hard for a few hours at a time, "
good,"This is a job for most people who are in college or who need it as a second job. I wouldn’t perhaps refer this as a primary job unless you are in a upper management position. For the most part, it is a honest job. I would have to say that the best part about working here is the fact that you meet new people almost every day."
good,"A typical day involved receiving packages, and delivering them to unknown areas under strict time constraints. "
good,everybody is moving around doing their jobs there is no standing around everyone is just busy.
good,A flexible part-time job . only 20 per week pays good. fast paste work but simple
good,"a typical day at work, short hours hard work, no increase a year"
good,"Large company with lots of opportunities for advancements, great benefits and compensation."
good,At FedEx I worked a maximum of 4 hours which felt like a full 8 hour shift. I sweated at work and I was bruised from handling heavy freight. Management in some ways only seemed worried about getting the work done instead of the well-being of the employees. My co-workers were hard workers but there was no team work ethics. I enjoyed coming to work because it was my job but I wasn't satisfied with the workload not matching my pay.
good,"Depot supervisor, sorting parcels, distributing to different route drivers,"
good,"A typical day (4-8 AM) consisted of scanning packages and loading them on delivery trucks according to destination. That's it. I learned to read labels and to lift heavy things fairly fast. I worked with some of my closest friends from high school, so everyday was fun! However, this job took a toll on my back and my health in general."
good,"Load and Unload  trucks"
good,Nice equipmet compay paid penison llllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll

good,A typical day at fedex is loading container and scanning packages.
good,"A typical day at work was always busy, never a slow moment. I learned how to operate several machines and computer programs."
good,"Hot, sweaty, long days. Heavy packages handled properly; but takes aloy of effort."
good,"I liked the job for the first year, pay was good but the hours were not long enough"
good,"Its a great job to have, you meet alot of folks along the way and earn a decent living to"
good,The most challanging portion of the job was to be able to pre plan days in advance.
good,"A typical work day would included loading trucks. How important fright and shipping is to the modern world. Management was nice co-workers were welling , outgoing. The job was not very hard at all the most enjoyable part over time."
good,"Well as a Package handler your only job was to scan and load boxes into your designated trucks. Teamwork is MAJOR here and so is being detail oriented and moving quickly. Memorization and working efficiently is key! The belt doesn't stop moving so neither should your hands or brain!!! Co-Workes are always helpful and the team on the line makes sure all is done well!! Hardest part would be peak season, and heavy flow on the belt. When this season comes around, or its a heavy flow things get hectic quick and moving fast seems slow!! but When you know your attention to detail is there and you keep moving no matter what, The rewards are endless!!"
good,"arrive, help unload cargo from freight boxes help load trucks separate prioity mail to deliver first, make sure all needed supplies for the road are loaded, set up route on GPS, drive like a race car driver at speeds un imaginable on public and private roads to get your mail or packages to their locations before time runs out and your late. Parking your vehicle in the middle of the road taking chances of being hit every time you get in and out of your vehicle. being a master mind in finding addressess that dont show on a map."
good,"Hard labor, great benefits, but no hours. Not worth the time"
good,This job is a job that really have you working its hot if its hot outside if its cold outside its could in the inside.
good,I would only work for Fedex in the position I had if I had no other choice.

good,i enjoy working for this company. this compny has good benefits that support me nd my family. everyone at this company are nice and helpful.
good,Enjoy meeting people. Learned how to better organize with time restraints.
good,"They are very flexible for going to school. We work as a team and everyone works together to meet deadlines especially when volume is high like at Christmas, etc. with volume of packages to handle."
good,"Overall, the work was good. Everyone treated me fairly. The manager seemed pretty cool; said he thought I wasn't good for this particular line of work. I completed the work its just that he needed someone that was faster. And so I resigned."
good,A typical day would consist of unloading the trailers for the van loaders to load packages going down the line. I have learned to be self driven at work and use it outside work. The co-workers are always nice and we work as a team. The hardest part is lifting heavy packages and moving fast when the packages are quickly moving down the line. The people are the most enjoyable thing at the job.
good,steady movement while stacking boxes and loading them into semi trucks. You work with the days temperature outside.
good,Good job good working invorment good manger's good hours good schedule pays well nice job invorment easy to get to pays weekly easier to get more hours I was very easy to understand work job
good,Nothing bad to say loved working here management was great only reason I left was due to la'k of transportation at the time made it hard to get back and forth
good,strenuous / time-sensitive work. Company offers good benefits. Part-time position. Physical / manual labor in a warehouse. Friendly managers and higher-ups. Friendly staff and employees.
good,"Good place of work, but the hours are bad. They pay good but the hours don't add up correctly. Other then that its an easy job, not to stressful or exhausting."
good,"It was great work place very fast pace, great people all around. I just didn't like that the manager don't really check up on you If you need assistance"
good,The job is ok if you need quick cash. It is labor intensive but they won't fire you cause you're slow. They train you to get up to speed. Weekly pay is nice as well.
good,I experienced somewhat team work into the depths of understanding certain people’s work ethic & how it was maintained I learned how much capable I am to adapt anything throwing my way & I love that
good,After the holidays if there wasn't anything for the part-time people to do they sent them home early and kept the full-time people. The job was fast at times too fast
good,Working for fedex ground can be very rough. I was injured in the army and have trouble lifting very very heavy objects. While there i didnt think my pain would flair up but it did and i cant do the job anymore. I can still lift things but i cant lift things over 50 pounds constantly for 5 hours.
good,Good place to work at a lot of hours get the most weekends off and good benefits and retirement plan great co workers and great management for the most part
good,"Start work at 3am got off before 9am everyday which left mostly all day to work but some days id only get 3 hours of work do to low volume , i liked my supervisor rodney and my managers ashley and jasmine were cool to"
good,Sometimes after being in the sort line my back would sore but the work was pretty fair. Just wished I could've worked a morning shift and possibly even a full time.
good,I honestly like working at fedex. It was fun it was hard work and it helped with some skills like loading unloading packing and other good things fedex is a good place to work
good,Fedex is fast pace. You have to wake up at 3:00-5:00am 5 days a week and alternating Saturdays and then clock out time is 8:00-9:00. Managers are easy to acces and easy to talk to. They have a open door policy.
good,"Fed ex is a robot that dosent understand the limits of human physicality . The managers at fedex are encouraged to push employees to a professional athlete level of physical stress muscles are torn, tendons are plucked and bones are fractured all in the name of absolute efficiency.  Beneath the surface there is a social structure not unlike that of a prison or a bording school . The popular or beautyfull members of the staff can often find niches and nooks to slip through into easier work and ride waves into less demanding positions"
good,Ability to work without distraction and the ability to learn new skills. Managers look out for you to teach you new skills to help you advance in your work.
good,"atmosphere is very flexible and management is very much friendly and comfortable"
good,Fed ex needs some full time positions if they want to compete in the market of customer service and satisfaction.its not about the quantity of workers it’s about the quality of work there workers are giving them.
good,"Fast pace environment, great benefits and discounts, some coworkers lazy and slow.Just want to get a a pay check.Get free breakfast and donuts at safety meetings"
good,"Must be able to lift 50 plus pounds of products and very fast paste. Good work place for high school and college students. Older adults have been there for 10 plus years. Competitive salary and can apply for full time positions after 1 year of employment or 1,000 hours worked, which ever comes first."
good,Physical Warehouse Job. Fun Environment. Flexible Hours. Competitive Pay. In Most Cases You Wont Need A Gym Membership. Career Advancement. Flexible Shifts.
good,I loved fedex is a good workplace to work & very comfortable all the employees worked as a team and always helped one another out. Everything is very cleaned and organized.
good,"Excellent opportunities to further your knowledge in the career field"
good,"I was responsible for making sure the packages get on the plane in a timely manner, so we can meet are customer needs.. Making sure that are international customer airwaybills we’re right."
good,"...I loved this job for many years.  Intact it kept my attention which is hard to do.  It was the love of my life for 5 years.  Longer than any relationship I have ever had.  Management is amazing!  I loved my people and my team.  It is a high energy, high stress job... and quite frankly that is where I thrive.  I loved this job.  Until I had a very unsafe incident.  But I will not speak of it here.  Fedex is a good job and has amazing benefits."
good,"Overall, the job was not bad. The job is more for active and strong people. If not active or out of shape, the job can be very tough, tiring, and depressing. The managers were great, but when under stress or behind, they tend to forget about the workers and pushes everyone to their limits causing people to quit the next day which ends up causing more work for those who stays and in time, ends up quitting too."
good,A Place of High Energy: A Place to Learn Your Level of patience: A Place to Labor in Love by Delivering The Purple Promise-EVERY Package-BIG or Small!
good,great place to work.  Room for advancement.  Management is wonderful.  I worked an 6p- 230a shift. Very laid back.  Employees were great to work with as well
good,The company is great.  I could not do the cubes for inside sales.  I found myself drifting away.  I excel in outside sales.  Great company to work for.
good,this was a fast pace job as well you would have to check emails in the mornings. this was more like pay attention to what your doing if not you can mess up some else's wotk
good,"Becomes habitual, but with constant surprises. Learn quite a bit fulfilling customers needs and satisfying them. Weekly trainings keep employees up to date with changes throughout the FedEx umbrella."
good,"FedEx offers great benefits for a part time job.  Must pass drug test, and there are random test.  It is possible to slowly add more responsibilities if approved by manager."
good,Busy fast paced pushed to do more long hours. Good friends friendly co workers. But boys game . Love my immediate bosses. Lots of politics great pay. Workers compensation company sucks don't get hurt there.
good,The people were good workers. through my personal experience i had the hardest rout to load with no help from other workers but was paid the same as a person who would do 200 less packages then me. night shift with only 4 hours a day so not a good paying job but a good second job.
good,"There was never a slow day working at Fedex. For better or for worse, each shift was driven my management to constantly exceed above and beyond. You'll be compensated for your time but expect for it to consume your life. So your bills will be paid, just keep a forward thinking attitude that this isn't the end."
good,"Maintained a professional appearance at all times, delivered all mail in a timely manner lift and slide packages onto conveyor for delivery, loaded packages onto truck for delivery Labeled, scanned and weighed packages, unloaded and sorted incoming packages Collaborated with team members to organize loads efficiently, maintained a clean and safe working environment"
good,Was boring because it was a job that only made one thing. I am a person that I like to experience and learn more.
good,"a typical day at work is very fast tempo, it requires alot of hard work.i learned how to work with others and work together as one. the management is decent, it could be alot better."
good,the hardest part of the job is the commute for now....... I've learned a lot the few months I've been employed. Staff is very professional and easy to get along with.
good,Its very stressful. That's was my first time in a factory. its was like the way some the supervisor talk to people. They really don't care if you are sick or had to go to the restroom.
good,"It is a hard place to work because you have to be fast u have to be able to remember were product goes in the truck or van."
good,Your working harder then you get payed they take a lot of tax out the check so your not getting more then you expected  but you do get payed weekly ans full benefits
good,"Very hard work , pay not enough for a person who is caring a baby. I would like to have more pay and people are kinda nice at that place. The supervisor treat people unfairly."
good,We loaded and unloaded cargo. That would be flown from Cedar Rapids all over the world. We would fill shipping containers with over hundreds of boxes heavy lifting anywhere from 20 to 100 pounds. A great job the people that I worked with were amazing. We all make sure that the jobs and tanks were always complete it before we left. Can we help the next person get that job done if they will follow behind.
good,"constantly on your feet all day but i dont mind it, its pretty fun with your working with people you get along with or people who is ready to work. can be very fast pace at times."
good,I took the opportunity fed ex gave me to meet different people at a large hub station we safely loaded cargo to be shipped in a timely manner and closed down operation I dont remember our team ever causing any late departures.
good,"A typical work day was very productive,very hard work no breaks, unless you have been there 90 days. I learned, you work under 4 hours. But you have to travel for 6 hours. You spend a lot a travel. Management was professional and fair."
good,This company gives raises frequently. The benefits are great but warehouse is cold in winter and burning hot in summer.Management was great.
good,"I loved working at Fedex a lot, and I will miss working there even though the workplace was very far away from where I was living. But me working there was a great experience and worth it."
good,"Fedex is not a bad place i actually really like it.the job is also one of those jobs where as its not for everyone. My only problem is that there is rarely an oportunity to become full time. I love the peak seasons,the pay, and the benifits. The only problem i have and ever had was the hours and the small window of oportunity to become a fulltime. sometimes you wonder if the pay rate is worth the the hours."
good,"Fellow deputies make the department as a whole, when command staff changes and new rules are implemented, thing get stressful. Deputies have each others backs and when it comes to use of force issues, there always a story to tell."
good,"Fun people to work with. BAD hours. Start off part time and when applying for full time when it's open, only select few get the position. Would like to have the chance for full time and normal hours."
good,"Completely Back line process."
good,Had my good days and bad days. Typical day at work would be helping scan packages then delivering them to customers. There are days where the attitudes amongst people is childish. Job pays great but solely dont want to depened on just having this job
good,Was a very interesting and fast pace job.Mostly recommended for guys. Had to load and unload trucks in a sort period of time. Workers was very friendly.
good,"Nice place to work and good culture. Lot of fun and extra curricular activities. good chance for beginners growth."
good,"Great job off on weekends, Caring Bosses, Great Pay But at times it can get frustrating an ruff but you can get through them"
good,"FedEx Express is a GREAT company to work for but if you  want to persue a job at FedEx Ground/Freight/Home Delivery, you cant transfer. You'd have to resign and start all over"
good,"I worked there for four years in the hub.  Took tests to go to courier or customer service.  Did well. Hiring from within is supposed to go by employee number first for consideration.  But in the end, I found out that it is really who you know to get those jobs."
good,A typical day at work consists of unloading small packages and documents at a specific rate. Management is fairly decent and the co-workers consist of a vast range of personalities. The hardest part of the job is working at a steady pace. The most enjoyable part is being able to walk around.
good,"You get payed to work, very fast paced work environment that makes the days go by fast, co-workers are friendly, management could use some work, hardest part of this job for me has been making it a reliable source of income. Other than that its a great place to work with amazing benefits, 401K matching, and flexible scheduling."
good,I enjoyed my time with the company and the people I worked with I understand its an airport but the things you have to do just to get inside the building was time consuming and a burden
good,It is a vey fast paced working environment and it has alot to ffer. I would recoomend this job overall it is a good place to work.
good,I enjoyed working for the census. I worked in a clerical position and training and administer test for different position. It is a great company to work for
good,"Personally I started working my way up the corporate ladder of FedEx, which is not easy to do because it takes a long time to get promoted. I think I was pretty lucky to get three promotions in my two years with FedEx. Ultimately I left because once I got to P&D I went to a training seminar where I did not like what I was hearing. I used to be an entrepreneur and I stick up for them. I did not like the ""Us versus Them"" mentality that corporate preaches. I decided to leave FedEx because I want to support the contractors, not watch them fail."
good,Do my job at all time and love to make everyone happy I put my all in my job.I will to stay over and help out and I never been late for work and I will be good for the FedEx forum course I do what ever it take my people happy and love cook good food
good,It wasn't anything too difficult nor too easy. It's could be straining. I lacked in hours so it didn't make a difference if I was really there or not.
good,"Fast placed employer, learn skills at managing deadlines and multi-tasking, Co workers very friendly, very good management. Hardest part of the job was managing the cut times"
good,Begin your day at 7am by doing a vehicle inspection.  Pick up your invoices and handheld.  Scan all packages before leaving the depot to insure everything is loaded prior to leaving.  Deliver and pick up all packages on the assigned route
good,"great job environment. "
good,Always had to work no matter if the weather was bad. More prone to sickness because of the weather changing.  This job does require a lot of physical activities.
good,"Taking care of the public is fun . "
good,For a first job or to build up to something more its an ok way to do that
good,"""Having a secure job with annual pay increases, benefits, the ability to transfer to other hubs."""
good,"In the three months i worked at fedex i learned a little bit such as working a cash register and approaching a customer when in need of help. The management of fedex was awesome i were always paid on time and recieved a good amount of money, but the hardest part of the job was loading fedex trucks with heavy packages and dealing with fustrated customers i still managed to give them the service they needed.The most enjoyable part of my job was probably helping customers in there storage i could find the best storage for any customer that had trouble and lastly recieving my check ."
good,At FedEx I work as a package handler. The work was sometimes hard only because there were a lot of call offs witch would effect some of the employees because you would have to cover there work if that person was not there. With lifting package all day you would get a good workout that was a plus and FedEx provided free drinks and food snacks for there employees.
good,A typical day at work would be doing my mainly job duties. I learned how to move rapidly while packing packages. My Supervisor always stayed on her employees making sure we got the job done. My co-workers were very helpful and friendly. The hardest part of the job would have been lifting heavy pounds of merchandise going back and fourth. My most enjoyable part of the job was getting paid for extra overtime.
good,This a great place to work part time. I still work here and the benefits is good.
good,I loved to work there because its never slow. Its fun. The manager is nice co-workers are friendly. The is not hard part of the job because its easy
good,Overall solid company. Their leadership strategies need a serious overhaul. Way too corporate and too numbers focused. Excellent part time Dock Associate job.
good,"The pay is outstanding($16.00/hr start out in Texas) however after 10 years, 8 of which I have been a courier, I am making exactly .50 cents more then those who start out off the street. Managers at the stations are great but bad decisions from corporate have made some of the veterans irritated."
good,"its a ok job nothing long-term,its really just for college kids. the warehouse aspect of it."
good,Stack boxes for 6 to7 hours. I've learned the correct way to stack boxes inside a truck. the management was good on some sides and the co-workers was a lot of help. the hardest part of the job is when your shoot gets backed up because of a jam and you to hurry up and get the jam out. The best part about the job is receiving your pay check every Friday.
good,Great brand name.
good,Work approximately 4 hour a day.
good,A typical day at work consents of the usually work expectations.I've learned that moving in a careful and steady pace can get along the day.i really haven't had management responsibilities so i cant speak on that.i never had conversations with my co-workers because i was so focused on the job.the hardest part of the job was cleaning up after the shift was over because we had to to do other peoples areas.the most enjoyable part was finishing up everyday on time.
good,"I enjoyed working there a lot. The people were so nice, and I enjoyed the atmosphere. To be honest, I really enjoyed it there because the people I worked with were mostly black people. I felt a close bond to my friends, the black people there. I am not racist. I like all people, of all races; however, having that many black people around me, working, instead of committing crimes or engaging in erroneous behavior was inspirational to me, as I am a native-born African."
good,This Job provided a great work experience to learn from. Showed me how to maintain my hard wok ethic and let me move around the company learning new things every day!
good,FedEx Office has provided me with my first step into the Technology Field. I have learned a lot but would like to advance further into my field of building and troubleshooting PCs more.
good,I loved my job with FedEx. The commute was the hardest part of the job. I appreciate the experience that I now have from working with FedEx. Thanks FedEx
good,Some of the management was very unprofessional. It was like high school all over again. Had some awesome people I worked with and some horrible people
good,I would advice everyone not to work there unless u already working full-time at another job making good money. You have to work two shifts to try to get all of your hours.
good,This job was ok. The money wasn’t good but the job was consistent. My manager Didn’t allow me to take maternity leave or switch to a position with lite lifting.
good,I love it their amazing experience great for youths also best job as a great experience managers was great and environment cool so yeah loved it their and all
good,Last month I ordered from a catalog and it was sent out by FedEx but delivered by the postal service. I thought it was strange also last month I ordered some medical supplies and they were sent out FedEx and to be delivered by the postal service. I think this is dumb. Because if they ship it out by FedEx you pretty much know when it will be delivered. But when they delivered by USPS you have to wait around for the mail carrier. I did google it and found out that they have what's called simple ship which is a cheaper rate when FedEx delivers it to the post office and the post office delivers it. From now on when it says how much shipping is I'm going to ask is this being delivered by FedEx or will it be delivered by USPS. Though I did find a tracking through USPS and they said by the end of the day but knowing our carrier and I'm in a senior building we don't know when that is there's no set time that they deliver.
good,overall a typical day at FedEx is working on the van line and scanning packages. Then after scanning the package you load them onto the correct truck. This process is then repeated for about 4-5 hours.
good,"It was a great place to work during the summer. Off on every major holiday. However, during the end and the beginning of the year, you'll be lucky if you get 15 hours a week. You start out at $15 an hour and you top out at around $18 an hour. The pay is great! I only wish I could've had more hours."
good,"The work is simple and easy. It was just poor management. FedEx is a good company to work for as far as receiving their benefits, but I would recommend getting into an area that suitable for the employee"
good,The money is very good. The befits are great. The Equipment is great management is always understanding to your problems and willing to help but the hours you start out at 10:30 at night and work till about eight to 9 o’clock in the morning you start Monday night and get off Saturday morning
good,I would just like to see different areas to work in different people to see and help. FedEx is a job that helps fast-paced delivery service. Scanning fast palletzing with the right formation to help the customer receive they package on time
good,It's a great place to work. It is a place you steady keep moving. No time to just sit around and talk.  Some people are friendly and some are good to work.
good,"fast paced . hard work if you are willing to do so. It is very hot in the summer time, would need to fuel your body with lots of water and food, winters are okay just cold sweet."
good,"I wish i had better things to say about this job. even though i wear a fedex uniform, I am not a FedEx employee. I am contractor. the only bad thing about this is that I do not receive benefits. If it wasn't for the lack of health insurance, I would recommend this job to most people if they were looking for a stable driving job."
good,Fun and uplifting work environment. Long hours during the holidays. Great benefits and room for advancement. The opportunities are honestly limitless!!
good,El ambiente de trabajo es estable pero lo que no tienen es una buena oragnizacion con los gerentes
good,"A typical day at work is filled with unloading and loading trucks to make sure everything is where it needs to be. The management sucks, they hire managers who sometimes know less than the general works know."
good,Fast paced driving during x mas long hours tough routes had to try and find many locations when GPS couldn't. Roads that could not be found made it tough to try and deliver then get home. Lots of hard driving
good,"I applied here and waited weeks for an available shift. I got it and went through training. It's a very high-maintenance job. I had to quit due to my location not being able to work with my schedule. I couldn't do it. "
good,"A typical day at FedEx is like basically going to a gym. The work is very physical and fast paced. I learned how quickly a person can lose weight and also that the faster you work, the harder they'll work you. The management is very strict when it comes to keeping up with the PPH. The hardest part about the job was moving constantly at a very fast pace and keeping up with the packages loaded per hour. The most enjoyable part of the job was that it keeps you in shape and you get a pay raise about every month."
good,"needs work on those wanting to advance."
good,"None stop fast pace working. The hardest part about the job was not knowing unti the day of what time sort start and the climate. Most enjoyable part of the job was the food, games, and events."
good,"typical day at fedex was where everything was productive, The management is why I quit and left fedex, the most enjoyable part of that job was driving forklift all day, the hardest part was the manager"
good,"Many benefits for full time employees"
good,The work was complicated but I love a difficult job that I can help people and work hard. I learned that the harder I worked the more I can get accomplished. My co workers was difficult to get along with but when you need help they will always lend a helping hand. The management was great they treat there employees with respect.
good,"Working at FedEx is a very demanding job. The hours are long and depending on who you are contracted through, payments might not equate to the amount of hours put in. Luckily my team is squared away and my management takes good care of me."
good,"Start my day off by checking orders that are due soon, for example: posters, fliers, business cards, banners, copies, etc.  I would run production, meaning completing jobs, while others would help front counter with in-coming customers.  I would also assist in our pack & ship department.  Pack personal items for customers according to FedEx pack & ship guidelines.  Ensure package(s) will arrive to destination in the same condition it leaves the customers hand."
good,"Super hot and tiring. Instant sweat when get into trailers. Have to load or unload at a very fast paste, managers expect you to be super fast even when tired. No breaks but only work atleast 3 to 6 hours."
good,You have to have team work. You cant get anything done without it. We supported each other and pushed each other. Management was very helpful  and supportive.
good,Fedex is a family company who brings everyone together as one. Working as a team to load trucks and pallets the best way we can everyone is happy and has a positive attitude.
good,"I loved working with FedEx, it is very fast paced, very hard work. "
good,Good pay for hard work but hours are difficult to work around.
good,"Work is part time, try to end the night at 12:00am. What I have learned there is, what goes on with the air craft, trucks and where the packages go. "
good,Overall it wasn't worth the pay. Hours during late shift were never the same. The area i was put in was very humid
good,"just like another day at work"
good,"First thing, sign in then get assigned to a truck or trucks.  Good training program, not great as a career. Managers are understanding and treat you well."
good,"Provided excellent and courteous and efficient delivery,sorting and pick-up of packages."
good,"Tres bonne entreprise ou j'ai pu evoluer"
good,FedEx is a great place to work because of the benefits. The bad thing about being a package handler is that you only work for 4 hours a day. You have to wake up really early and come to work on time or else you will be terminated.
good,Every shift started at 12pm. Loaded 3-5 large trailers in the time we were given. I always had to be multitasking while moving boxes and taking orders from managers. Got along well with co-workers well.
good,Fedex is hard constant work. Working in offload can b dangerous but it can b fun.
good,typical day at fedex is easy going once you get the hang of the schedule some new hires don't last the day the mangers there are ok co workers are cool there is no hard part of the job and the most enjoyable part of the day is getting off
good,Good benefits. Many challenges makes it enjoyable but so many challenges that new employees take long to acclimate themselves. Benefits most rewarding
good,"A day at work is pretty interesting, you never know really what to expect its always a different scene and situation the best way in being successful at fed x is the adjust to all the requirements labor and work."
good,"Simple tasks, help customer, fix machinery malfunctions, etc. It depends on which center your placed. Some centers are more fun and fast paced than others. I loved it :)"
good,A typical day at work consist of being overwhelmed with large amounts of packages and struggling to keep up with the pace.
good,"The work is very intense work for a couple of hours straight, and it is very strenuous. The benefits are good but not enough hours in the work week to work as a main or only job."
good,"Overall, this job was a well-structured environment that provided order and support to all working employees. The jobs that were poorly performed by employees were disciplined."
good,If you can handle the heat and fast work pace this is the job for you. Vacation time is a minus if you are in department that has employees that have been there 10 yrs plus because they get seniority when it comes to vacation time selection.
good,"Vigorous​ ​physical​ ​ability;​ ​able​ ​to​ ​lift,​ ​lower,​ ​push,​ ​pull,​ ​leverage​ ​and  manipulate​ ​packages​ ​weighing​ ​up​ ​to​ ​80lbs​ ​with​ ​or​ ​without​ ​assistance. Unloaded,​ ​staged,​ ​sorted,​ ​and​ ​loaded​ ​packages​ ​at​ ​an​ ​above​ ​average​ ​pace."
good,"In my experience working for FedEx it was mostly a repeat of the same working habits, working at a face pace and being careful while doing it. Must be aware of your surroundings at all times while managing to to lift fifty pounds plus."
good,I worked there for 7 years started part time then went to Customer Service worked on the dock receptionist OS&D This place I wanted to work there until I retired but things did not go good when the recession in 2008 When it was American freight it was a great Company
good,"The work is not stressful but competitive , everyone want to reach the number of production and helping each other . I leaned to keep attention to details ..."
good,not much to say but is a good place to work just don't make a mistake it will cost you it can be a very stress full job a times but overall it's not a bad place to work.
good,"I was a loader at fed ex ground which meant I loaded boxes into the semi trucks, or I was a belt picker which was a person that stands at the belt while things come down it and you pick the objects off it and put onto the rollers to go into the trucks. I luckily was assigned to a awesome manager who made our work some what easier than other wings. The job really isn't for someone who is not used to lifting heavy things like 100 plus pounds or even 150 ! Not everything is heavy but the managers look for who is best and quickest a lot of people who work there or had good position and stayed the longest were pretty much body builder guys or really strong people."
good,Awesome place but hours not consistant and days are crazy having to work saturdays but when you become full time (you can advance quite quickly) you have your weekends off
good,Fast pace. Show people respect no matter what. kind of day you are having. Management doesn't listen to your concerns. My co-workers and I get along fine. Sometimes my co-workers forget we work as a team and not alone.
good,Get my schedule with my stop paperwork scanner and started picking up at the stops.  Each stop had different times to go pick up and this was as a driver.  Loader was at the airport loading the trucks and airplanes that was the whole shift.  On Sundays I set up the floor for the loaders and was in charge of the floor.  Management at the airport was a great team they where up on the belt also.  Co-workers became family and we help each other.  The hardest part was the insects at the airport all open space.  The most enjoyable was a great work out.
good,My typical day at Fedex is opening the ULD's which means inspecting the ULD's and getting the tickets processed right. Then I scan packages and T stack the ULD's. at the end of the day I close the ULD's. we turn in our slips and clean our areas.
good,fun place to work if you are in college with no responsibilities. benefits good but you have to work 1000 hours to get them
good,this Is a good job but if you do not have a daily schedule or routine this job will take alout out of you.
good,"I go in about 30 minutes  before the  start time and chat with coworkers and get a snack then I clock in and listen to the safety meeting and the report to my area and then I induct in a safe and timely manor then I clock out and take my break till my second shift and repeat."
good,FedEx was a high paced job with great fringe benefits. The job required a lot of loading and lifting boxes. I also had to verify documentation prior to loading. In some cases the boxes weighed over 100 pounds in weight. Assistants were available when needed.
good,"Load and Unload packages"
good,I arrived went through security and put my equipment on and got in my truck. I handled 1500 packages an hour. I learned how to work fast. Management was not the best. My co-workers were fun and helpful. Keeping up with the package handling. Total gym day was the best.
good,"I would say a typical day is coming in and stretch for a little and then start unloaded and loading trucks full of packages."
good,The physical demands of this job are not something I could handle without being a Body Builder. On my route there were apartment complexes in which the tenants would order heavy items on a semi daily basis.
good,"The typical day at work, that there is a breakfast free of charge for all employees, one day each week."
good,I really did not enjoy working here. It is very hectic around the holidays and very stressful for everyone who works there. You go in and do the same thing over and over again every single day.
good,Work day is about 4 hours long. A lot of favoritism. A lot people are racist. Good people. People i work with are like family to me. The hardest part is lifting over 75 pounds.
good,I like the job just wish I was able to work more hours. They give full time benefits to part time employees. Good balance of hard workers and slackers.
good,"The supervisors were very understanding and kind people! It felt like a home. However, the work was horrible. It was 90+ degrees every day, extreme labor, and one break your entire day!!"
good,"Setor de notas fiscais com as seguintes características  devolução, troca, compra e venda de produtos. Em relação a logística, o aprendizado é para o resto da vida, fascinante a maneira como trabalham. Ótimo relacionamento pessoal, equipe dinâmica, a parte mais difícil era mexer com as formulas do excel, porem, com o tempo acaba se acostumando e aprendendo o oficio, a forma como ensinam o serviço é muito agradável."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Fed Ex, the incentives and raffles made coming to work exciting. There was always something new happening. Sales wasnt something i wanted to do long term so it was time for a change."
good,"i shipped boxes to all places, China, Dubai ect. the hard parts were shipping heavy boxes. I learned why it takes so long to ship certain items debating on the pace it was shipped from"
good,it is what you make it. good for school goers that need an open schedule.I loved it while i was there. management is cool along with the staff. work can be tuff at times
good,Excellent company to work for either part time or full time because of the excellent benefits packages offered to both part time and full time employees.
good,"The more you enjoy moving at a fast pace, the easier your job will be. The pace is constant from beginning to end; therefore you're finished working before you know it."
good,"Good place to work,developed leadership skills,"
good,great place to work if you don't mind the labor aspect. great place for growth potential. great management training program.
good,it a good job but need more work hours. You can learn alot at the job. Also you can learn all the diffenets types of planes and what can go and dont go. 
good,they ask for too much from a worker and not enough pay or benefits can be taking from doing so
good,i usually work first shift and second shift. i learned alot about package to delivery or pick up either. i enjoyed courier and handler too.
good,"I was first a freight handler, was later promoted to quality assurance lead the the primary responsibility for tracking lost packages, handling missorts and damage packages related issues."
good,"Good starting pay"
good,A typical day was unloading non-cons. I learned to work as a team. Management was a great help and loved to give a helping hand. Co-workers was funny and enjoyable. The hardest part was having to move the heavier boxes. The most enjoyable part was the team atmosphere.
good,It's a good company to work for good discounts everywhere you go they will work you the pay is okay the managers okay you can pay every week There's a good thing
good,Security is well managed and it's very fast paced!I worked at the hub in Oakland. I usually work 3.5 hours being part time. Management is nice. Don't be tardy or you will be fired. Attendance is important!
good,"The company itself was amazing, however, I was not able to work as many hours as I would have liked to. In my opinion, this job would be better suited for college students needing a part-time job. If you do not like physical labor do not apply."
good,"i had a variety of job responsibilities that helped me be a"
good,"Typical day at work would be standing for 4 hours"
good,The work environment is very pleasant and everybody helps.
good,"SWA, Management was the worst I've ever been a part of at any job. You try to talk to them & you're blackballed & targeted on to be a complainer, & given the hard routes. And dont try to talk to upper management, they will just listen & not really do anything to help, if they do they wont follow up to make sure it's not continuing!"
good,"When you are a driver for fedex you are a contractor for the route owner.  Each route is purchased by somebody and it is their responsibility to hire/train/fire their drivers.  You do not get sick time, you do not get paid vacations (unless your boss is awesome and cares).  Most of the time your boss will dock your paycheck if you do not make your package pickups."
good,"Issues with management, people service profit are not the 3 pillars at this facility. Not listened to, too much reaction, not enough proactive. Too many problems with upper manageme t communication."
good,"Not a great experience, I wouldn't recommend it. Poor management and poor working conditions. Poor communication between management and drivers. Not holding people accountable for their work duties."
good,it was a really good company and learn new things with the company. people work together and made each other feel good. I think I will do good in the company because I love working with people and I think this is a great chance for me to show that.
good,A Typical day at Fed-Ex was loading 18 wheelers trucks by your self. the management was ok co-workers were helpful. haredest part was loading trucks by your self. The most enjoyable part was the exercise
good,this place didn't care about their workers. Management always had us doing more then we can handle and co workers always looked down at everybody 
good,"I really enjoyed working for FedEx and would have loved to still be a part of the Company, but do to low pay n not getting enuff hours, I had to unfortunately leave FedEx in hopes of obtaining new opportunities elsewhere."
good,"um dia tipico de trabalho, cansativo."
good,I was a driver helper. I was to help whoever i was assigned to for the day. Most days it was the same person. The contracted i worked under told me i would get 10/hr. Then i get my first pay check and its short like $80. I let him know and it took almost two weeks for the rest of my money. Not to mention i was working 7am-12pm with no overtime. They treat the Driver Helpers like s#*t !
good,"Honestly, working at Fed-Ex was unpleasant, being new to the company there was no one to show you the ropes. I was placed on a truck and was instructed to load accordingly the packages came off the conveyor."
good,Not a good company to work for The management doesn't care about employees. Ask to much of employees for the pay offered. Work 10 to 14 hours a day. No one wants to help anyone but them selves.
good,"Very busy everyday of work, the sort was always high in volume"
good,A typical day at work would be 90 to a 110 stops followed by 15 to 25 pickups.. I would come in every morning around 7am route my truck and take off by 7:30. I would complete all deliveries by 2:30 start my pick ups and return to the building around 4:30pm.
good,I felt I was treated unfairly. I was paid less than the other 5 people on the team. But I was multi trained to work in the office as fill in. Going in at 1:30 am which was not my normal time of 5 am. I am not  sure if it was because the color of my skin or my boss didn’t care for me. I was the only person with this color on the team. They gave me a cake when I left. Told me I did great they hated to loose  me. When I tried to come back all within the same year my boss told me I had to start from the bottom unloading-trucks
good,"If you enjoy a daily mission, managing chaos and challenging yourself, this is the role for you.  Every day there are new obstacles and challenges in your way.  The role is quite fulfilling if you are looking for a challenge."
good,Always have to pay attention to all the small details when working on routes even the smallest detail that gets left out might be a big problem. Scheduling meetings and always being on time was always a big plus.
good,Most be willing to work long hours and 6 days a week sometimes. And keep a clean driving recoord. I really don't know what your asking me for here. I don't like to talk bad about anybody or company
good,"A typical day at work may start as early as 0730 and end possibly later than 6pm. You normally work for a contractor, so the benefits are limited. The hardest part of the job is never knowing when you were going to get finished with your route"
good,"This company is all about ""The Company"" They don't care about the people at all. They spent all their money on technology, I never made good money, they just keep promising that soon, you'll be a full time employee, but keep you part time, on call."
good,Fed Ex is a great place to work part time for the extra cash. A great to get a early morning workout in then go to the other job.
good,"It's a great work place if you only want to work there for less than a year. Otherwise, that place screws you over. There's nothing more to tell."
good,Ver good company. The money isnt worth it though. A typical day is load the trucks sometimes you get off in 3 hrs sometimes 8.
good,"Enjoyed my boss/contractor"
good,"Overall great company to work for. I learned a lot about the Inbound side, the outbound and the business side of things. It is the kind of operation that many should model their businesses after."
good,This company is a very goal oriented and has a no nonsense approach getting the job done.
good,"FedEx is not a bad company for a struggling college student or a high school senior, but it definatley not a company you can make living with, as you cannot get a full day or let alone week. Your capped off at 25 hours a week and even full time is just 39 hours...."
good,"i have learned on how to load and unload trucks, wrap pallets, and scan mails. i have worked for 12 hours every day for 4 weeks before new year that was the most difficult part of the job but it created a stronger worker in me. I enjoy working with my co-workers. I don't enjoy working by myself."
good,fun team work great friendly no hard part fast past great job
good,"Management wasnt the best."
good,Durante os Jogos Olímpicos foi tumultuado trabalhar lá.
good,"A empresa não valoriza o funcionário, nem financeiramente, e nem por reconhecimento."
good,"the manager in the ipswich depot is a complete t***, any promise of a permanent position will be complete bulls***. hes lied to me and 3 other people. c***."
good,I liked FedEx alot at the moment I was pregnant went on leave came back had to balance having a newborn baby and keeping my job . Around the time of pick season having to work longer hours.
good,"I started working in Customer Service, and worked my way up to Operations Support department. The Company started outsourcing, I had the least seniority in my department. The Senior Manager kept me on board as a Special Assignment, which it regretfully ended. I thought I would ""Retire"" from this Company."
good,as an unloader you have to be strong and fast pace whatever the weather is outside is the weather that you have to be prepared to work in on the inside as well. Peak season is the most competitive time to work
good,Brak mozliwosci rozwoju.zarobki mniejsze niz 10 lat temu
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was getting someone there package. "
good,Get up and be at work by 5 am.  Find your packages and scan therm.  Load your truck. Deliver your packages. Return scanner and paperwork to Fed EX.  Go Home usually by 8pm if lucky.  That's holiday work.
good,Typical day at fed Ex was to follow direction of loading trucks. I learned to rescan to a new system. I have done this work for twenty years. Most enjoyable part of the position was my co-workers.
good,"contractor had basically ran business but they control you. management was horrible. no benefits, responsibility for vacation, and daily costs. had too rent uniforms and scanner"
good,I have been with FedEx for 13 years. I've transferred to 4 different buildings (hubs). I enjoy problem solving and completing difficult tasks. I've made many lifelong friendships.
good,its seasonal so when they are done making you do all the work while managers sit around they let you go. No benefits either
good,i loved working with fedex and the people. everyone had to learn how to work as a team to get things done on time.they offer other job opportunities within the company.
good,"When I get to work I have a good sense of responsibility and determination to get the truck rolling.  I know that paying attention to the surroundings allows me to take charge of my job and get it done properly while working with other ground workers.  I'm always positive that management expedites everything that goes on so they can always be trusted to get all of the fright moved as goes with my co-drivers."
good,"A typical day at FED Ex was filled with training  new drivers and making sure they understood  there  duties as new  Temporary drivers for the company. It also meant preparing them for the pass or fail driving exam needed to become a Driver for the company. My managers were encouraging but I felt I being told to choose between  my day class schedule and my position at the company which was not permanent. At the time I started working with the company I was already enrolled in community college and worked as a package handler int he warehouse, but was promoted to trainer."
good,I enjoyed the ability to assist customer with concerns and also the chance to have hands on the mailing system.
good,"Unloading and loading trucks, scanning shipments, unloading/loading conveyor belts. I learned how to load and unload trucks. I also learned how to use a scanner and split the belt. Management was average here. My co-workers were very cool we all got along. The hardest part of the job was unloading the trucks. The most enjoyable part of the job was loading the trucks."
good,A nice company to work for but some of the guidelines and rules are out in left field.
good,"Very early 4 a.m. start; enjoyed fast pace but not the continual pressure to do more than possible in the time allotted. No allowances made for weather delays, broken equipment etc."
good,"Fed Ex is an very big organization. Throughout my years of working at Fed Ex, I have learned that team work is a priority, without teamwork you are in for failure. Management is very tough.You are expected to be at work no matter the weather or situation! The hardest part of the job was putting up with all of the drama that came along with working with a large group of people. I enjoyed working at fed ex because it made me more competitive at what I did. I was even given rewards for being the most productive which basically means I was the fastest."
good,Great place to work but management will not allow you to grow and move on if you do a good job. Management likes to keep people in the same role.
good,"Very fast paced work environment. Managers are nice but could do better at having employees trained. Dont always know what your day is going to consist of. Good pay, good benefits when its time, PTO after a certain period. Raises are different but you get them."
good,"I typical day for me would start around 7:30 am and end around 6:00 pm. Very long hours with the same daily pay whether I worked 5 hours of 10 hours, very long hours. There are no paid vacation, sick time or personal time. I enjoy working on my own where no one is down my neck constantly. I have a decent supervisor."
good,I love working for fedex I jus wish it was more flexible with the points my son is mentally challenged Nd they make it really hard for me to get him the care he needs by pointing me when I need to take off Nd wats the point of pto if it never gets approved
good,"I got downsized after 20 years and so did most long-term co-workers.  The way they went about it was VERY tacky!  The company didnt want us ""long-timers"" around anymore, so they got rid of us in various, subtle and not-so-subtle ways.  I lost a lot of respect for management, the way this was handled.  The company has changed for the worse the last 5 years or so.  If you have a great boss @ Fed Ex, stick around and consider yourself lucky!  It all boils down to your direct boss and your relationship with him/her, but if corporate makes negative changes (all the time), your boss has to carry those out,and it may be time to move on!"
good,"This job is fast paced, and you have to pay close attention to detail. It's not hard work though. "
good,"-As a package handler I had to make sure that all packages coming through the belt from the incoming trucks were scanned and sent out to the right outgoing trucks for deliveries."
good,"I have a mixed review of my time with FedEx Express. The work was fine. A little stressful at times when your work load is more than it should be and having to get all the time committed  packages off on time. However, most managers I worked for were more concerned with the numbers than the employee. Like I said, MOST managers. There were a couple that genuinely seemed to have the employees best interest in mind and were still able to make their numbers. During my time with FedEx I learned time management, how to deal with people. Both co-workers and customers. Problem solving and route management."
good,"It is an every day hard job that teaches responsibility, planning , and desire to succeed!  It teaches an employee to stay on task while making sure they can coordinate their every day actions."
good,"Demanding & Rewarding:"
good,"Great boss and co workers and quick paced environment, long work hours and days , food company ,  benefits are not available for contractors is the downside"
good,"É uma boa empresa infelizmente os coordenadores que não são justos, protegem quem não trabalha e sobrecarregam os que já trabalham, dão mais valor aos que puxam o saco do que os que realmente estão lá para trabalhar."
good,the work is good but the pay is little.....The management don't have the back of both the contractors nor the drivers.  the contractors sometime are caught in the middle of it.
good,FedEx is a good place to work apart from the manangent they told you like rubbish and don’t care about your family issues but you get on with your colleges
good,It's a tough job  to do epically Fed ex ground it's way different then home delivery and you work all these hours and you have no benefits at all that's the only negative
good,Every morning at work; Tuesday thru Saturday I load my truck by myself. I deliver to residential and some businesses. The warehouse is fast paced and extremely loud. Mangers will come and check to see you need help with lifting or if you need boxes to be PIP to your truck. The hardest part of the job is driving in inclement weather. The most enjoyable part is coming to and from work safely.
good,"Good company to work for. Benefits are good, you get pto after six months, health care, dental, vision, 401k, and you are able to buy stock in the company."
good,"People first ? not really practiced by human resource and management. Processes are overlooked, company does not reward Team members and supervisors on targets"
good,"The hardest place I have worked at yet once you get the hang of the work it becomes easy."
good,"I liked the work but did not care for my immediate manager; she yelled a lot.  I orginally was scheduled to work 20 hours a week on the third shift, but it soon became 2-4 hours per day for many employees."
good,Fed Ex was a good company to work for. My supervisor was very good about me having time off work because I had gotten hurt. Understanding and just asked me to keep in touch.
good,It's nice to have money to do stuff & pay bills but i feel when I get my 2 days off its time to explore other opportunities. I'll explain in the interview.
good,you work a lot of long hours and don't spend much time with family. You have to relocate in order to advance. Co worker are great but management changes the way they do things daily.
good,"Days depend on level of volume, as well as efficiency of terminal operations. This job does provide a great chance to develop provlem solving and customer service skills. Regular delivery customers can be pleasant to interact with."
good,"Shuttle Driver  (Ft. Washington, Pa.)"
good,"This is where I started and I learned as much as I could in all aspects of the company."
good,good experience in the transportation industry. As a team player work with all internal support organizations for resolving issues and order status ensuring communication of delivery are met.
good,Very fast pace I people are not freindly no tolerence for mistakes
good,"A typical day at work was taking care of drivers, employees, and management. I knew everything their had to know about my role as an A&D Clerk. I loved that position. I learned a lot in this position. I learned how to run a small group of people to do my routes. I learned how to fix printers, learned all the programs necessary for the job, learned about all my drivers. I took care of my drivers and made sure they got out on time. Management was ok. It wasn't the best but surely not the worst. My co-workers, I wasn't really around many of them. But when I came into contact with some of them, they were really great. The hardest part of the job was the communication between the managers and myself. They didn't understand that when they were asking me to do something, I was already doing it or already had it done. No questions asked. It was my job to take care of everything and prepare everything for the managers. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing all of my drivers on a day to day basis. I loved talking with them and getting to know them. They made my day better! "
good,great place to work id work there again if i had the chance to managers knew what they were doing being as they were promoted from within the ranks
good,Hard Physical Labor! I work very long hours. I learned how to manage my time more efficiently.
good,fun short hours and managers does not compromise work ethics
good,"I would have loved to have stayed with this company, but there werent any full time positions. My immediate supervisor lead several of us to believe there were openings for full time..but it never led to that. The immediate supervisor was very unorganized."
good,Fedex is a good company but not the best place for advancement.
good,I don't wish to say bad things about a job but I am very unpleased with the way this job is heading.
good,Very nice place to work. But unable to transfer to California lack of hours in Nevada and in the state of California. But happy to be working at this time.
good,I loved the staff and that there is incentive for hard work but the hours are short and I was talked to poorly by a manager. I made great friends and co workers but in the end I needed more hours.
good,Salary not very competitive with other companies it's contrqct d owned and u need to be with the right one or you won't go far the job is not that stressful but the loading in mornings of the truck was very
good,"Must say the work day is long not too hard busy"
good,"worked in early morning hours unloading trucks."
good,"Fedex office is a branch of fedex that may not be as good as the other branches. They certainly don’t pay as much. This job is honestly “make or break” depending on management. The culture is very strong on getting the best numbers (sales, box packing, plus ones....etc), that creates the other major part of the atmosphere which is MICROMANAGEMENT. Everybody wants to get their bonuses so micromanaging will be the norm for many, especially the higher up you look. I always thought you give the best solution to people’s print and shipping issues but some managers prefer you sell no matter the case in order to get their numbers. There are literal conference calls so often talking about the numbers you’d wonder what else the district and regional managers do. It really all depends on the manager at whatever location you work at. I really try to help people not get the most money by overpacking, saying the catch phrases like a robot to everyone no matter the circumstances, printing at the most expensive and just shady tactics at best (cutting hours, basing payroll on sales). The pay is alright but it’s nothing special, especially since there’s a ceiling. The benefits are good but not great. Bonuses on the other hand are horrible. Making sales and great numbers only matter to the managers because they get up to $2000 (multiple times a year and not the biggest bonus possible for a store manager) while team members may get $75. Some even get trips depending on the award. Big sales pushes for the whole district may result in $100 for the team members in that district. You can only imagine"
good,"While I don’t have to work many hours, it’s hard, stressful work while I am there, we are given a guarantee of 17.5 hours, but we can’t go over 20 hours, which means no overtime (this is very new). They’d rather expand and cut employee pay and benefits (losing employees and adding stress) than keep their current employees. A third of the people on my line are temps."
good,A typical day was long and very hot. The particular warehouse that I worked in was behind on orders and shipment. The facility needed more order and more employee training.
good,"FedEx is more concerned about numbers that's why employees are micro-managed. Write-ups for using the bathroom over 8 minutes per day is routine.  And, heaven forbid if you forget to sign in after every break, you're eligible for the guillotine!"
good,FedEx is one of those typical corporations. The management only cares about themselves and the stock holders. Employees get treated like numbers in a system. You are not an individual while working there.
good,It’s hard To move up in the company. It’s just a job to them when I wanted to start a career. It’s a fast paced job you would work from 3 to 6 hours with no breaks.
good,Loading trucks was not bad unloading trucks however was even easier sorting and packaging what's however the fastest pace and it was more like having fun on the job with conversation pieces or trying to pass time but went smooth everybody basically knew their place and actually we helped each other
good,You exercise every morning and the people are friendly.  The job is super easy sorting and scanning mail.  A great part time job to have that get paid every week.
good,"Working at fedex was a valuable experience. I was able to hone my skills as a forklift operator, while learning to problem solve in a very fast-paced, cross dock environment."
good,"We all liked working with each other and helping each other out."
good,The benefits are great. The job was great in the beginning but once you get accustomed then it all goes downward.  Managers are very biased.  They pick their favorites.  You're usually over worked and don't be surprised if you're sent home early once sort goes down.
good,Was great in the beginning but a lot of changes but in all a great place to work great mangment and team members drove for three years changed roughts twice
good,"Job is fast paced, must be able to be aware of your surroundings, must have clean licenses, must have good people skills and how to act properly around everyone you talk to on a daily basis"
good,"If you work for Ground you work for a contractor so you don't have retirement, health insurance! I get up at 4:30 Am and go to the terminal. I sort my truck and if I'm lucky we are out by 8 and then i drive and deliver packages to people and I don't get a lunch so that I can get off before dark."
good,It was a job that paid the bills. I was grateful to have that job. I really  liked the fact that it was a fast  paced environment where my  skills of multitasking and customer service were implemented.
good,"often times we would finish only to have to undo what we did and redo it very unproductive, talk about inclusion but have small exclusive groups work hard with lazy ppl"
good,"It was okay, pay was okay, but not worth the nack problems. Horribles turnover rates and a general lack o f care for employees. Stressful and lack of time to sit/drink or eat"
good,this was a temp job but it was a good experience. A typical work day was 4 hour learned a lot about packages management was good. Overall it was a good job just short hours.
good,"Working hard and fast space and keep busy, time fly,nice people friendly, motivate, no break, enjoy, catch up fast,very cool, help other cowork, easy way"
good,"I didn't dislike this job, but I did have a problem with the compensation.  I spoke with my manager about how the pay wasn't competitive, and he ended up telling me I don't work very hard anyway.  We were the 5th iteration of employees that had been put in there and were the only ones who didn't immediately leave due to the stress of the work.  If you need work its fine, but not to build a career."
good,"I was not happy there, the lack of team work was horrible, no one willing to help each other. The mangement didn’t care about the employees. Fairly dangerous place to work."
good,"It was a good experience, They treated me well, but the work environment was a bit dangerous and you could get hurt if you were not aware. I would work at night and a lot of the time the trailers were quite difficult to locate. So you would spend quite a bit of time driving around and wasting your hours."
good,"No life Monday thru Friday. You work till work is done. Lazy people breeze thru the day while harder workers pick up the slack."
good,Fedex ground is the best place to start working if you like fast pace jobs best place to go. If you have back pain please just know bend with your knees not you back.
good,Paid salary to work well over 60 hours per week and 90 during the holidays.  Worked with contractors who really didn't need to listen to management's directions or requests.
good,I loved this job because I love a fast pace and I'm very organized so I figured out the best plan of action. I had great customers that liked me and appreciated my good work habit's and professionalism . I don't like the managers lack of personal touch or the fact that they don't know how to make things work. They also frequently overload you and then get mad when you don't make service. That's just bad management skills. They did give me the days off that I requested and at least pretended to care about me.The supplies were usual hard to find and the don't properly train the drivers of the right business skills to increase customer appreciation.  They occasionally have cook outs which is great for employee moral. The manager frequently asked me how I was doing.
good,Started as a handler and moved up to courier. Good company that paid weekly. Love weekly checks! The work is repetitive but the work group was great. Good people make work go quickly!
good,Management from contractors horrible and only care about their bootom line they don't care about the employees as we are not true Fed ex employees even though we have to adhere b to all the same policies as express drivers which are corporate drivers .
good,"The place was very busy and it could be a dangerous place to work. The team workers some of them would help you and others could careless, if you got hurt or not. They catered to a lot of different people."
good,For the most part Fedex is a nice place to work with the other drivers being friendly and helpful. I learned how to the dock operate and how to run with this also being my first go around at  delivering freight so it showed me the different between hauling chemicals to freight. I enjoy the freedom that come with driving but the time frame for your stops tend to be short so it has to be in and out. With management there is no room for growth or promotion at my domicle.
good,This job is what you make it. Its a fine part time job about 20 hours for package handler and 30 hours for a trainer. It requires an attention to detail and its very physical.
good,I had the best of times here but it changed dramatically. Sometimes things change for the worst and there is nothing you can do about it. I can't say anymore than that.
good,"Every day i unloaded trucks, lift 50-100 pounds, no breaks, fast pace."
good,Good employer for advancement in career field. Fastpace work environment.Communication with managers & employees can be improved
good,The compensation is comprable to the market. The work life balance for management should be reevaluated. FedEx as a whole is a great company to grow with.
good,Every day I load my truck up with at lease 100 stops and get a turn by turn with addresses for the packages on my truck to be delivered to the customers
good,had to scan and load and unload freight freight by departure time flight and state destination had to rover any damaged packages to rewrap then sigh off paper work
good,"Job was very demanding around holidays with no additional pay. Home delivery was mixed with business deliveries."
good,FedEx was a very professional place to work. The job itself was very easy. A typical days work included repairing package scanners and entering the information into their database.
good,"The clients always greeted you, they learned to trust you with their valuable items. There was always room for advancement. Management was very well rounded."
good,"I honestly couldn't stand the management here, they where so rude. I worked third shift so I slept all day, had no life. A typical night consisted of my manager always lending me to a different team or location instead of just keeping me at my work place. I loved most of my co-workers and the most enjoyable part of my work day was when I got to clock out and go home."
good,"Fed- Ex is a great workplace. You will make a great hourly salary, and not be restricted to just one area at the facility. a typical work day is fast and busy. It's all about getting the job done in a timely fashion. management at fed-ex expresses the concerns and expectations of their company. The most challenging part of your day, or night at work is the repetitive labor. However you will find a family feeling when it comes to your co-workers, managers, and peers. It helps for a better work day."
good,Although the job kept me active the hours were strenuous and exhausting. My co-workers were lazy and unmotivated. The hardest part was the hours that I worked.
good,My typical day was to come in and get myself and my 5 drivers prepared for a productive and safe workday. I learned how to run my own company thru the FedEx name. Management was more hands off as long as you made your deliveries. Drivers and pre load employees were fun to work with. Hardest part of the job was the Christmas rush. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing our great customer base everyday and the smiles they put on when they saw us coming.
good,"Fast steady paced work environment working long shifts during peak season. I was physically challenged in the beginning, however it was a great workout for my body. I enjoyed loading the trailers and helping my co-workers. At first, it was difficult to manage the time while loading and unloading trailers. It became very repetitious and a quick learning experience for me. my co-workers made it a great environment to be in. The hardest part of the job was unable to know what time it was, no one was allowed to have any type of jewelry or electronic devices. The most enjoyable part was being able to socialize while working."
good,There were things that could of been different as far as management. Being a team player and helping other people get there freight out on time.
good,This job was warehouse setting .I learned how to scan all shipments moved them to the right area of socket. I also have to lift packages that weighted up to 75lbs. Helping to keep our line clear of trash  and other objects  that could stop the flow of ship movement. Our peak session starts in  November on a cold winter night we had so much traffic moving in and out the hub . We  could not keep up  with everything moving at one time .Well one of our drivers was going to fast and did not see the packages in the road so we have to make sure we are paying close attention to everything that is going on or if something was smashed on our line we could lose points overall yearly  checks .
good,"My boss was a very nice guy he managed us with hospitality and care. He was very reasonable when it came to his employers. As far as the benefits went there was none we didn't have any health, dental, or any other kind of benefits. I loved the fact that I worked alone and didn't have anyone looking over my shoulders. The hardest part of the job was loading up the truck and getting out of the warehouse in a timely manner. I liked this job because I could be my own boss most of the day. Took lunch breaks when I could or needed to do so. The work environment itself was ok it got cold and limited heat."
good,It was always something different...you learned how to run different areas in the warehouse. It was a constant change and an every day new learning experience.
good,They communication from the top on down was horrible.  If you don't move quick they will keep you in position for as long as they can.
good,I learned how to sort properly according to how management suggest. A typical day is 2 hours of hard non stop working. my coworkers are nice and work hard as well the hardest part of my job is that its not enough hours given. Communicating with my co workers is the most enjoyable part of my job
good,"A parte mais dificil do trabalho foi existirem situações que impediam completamente de satisfazermos o cliente, nos seus envios, pois por vezes existiam situações que eram impossiveis de ultrapassar, como por exemplo a avaria/falha mecanica de um avião de carga"
good,"A typical day at work its is very busy, its more of a hands on job. the hardest part of this job is lifting 100+ packages without assistances.  The enjoyable part of this job is not just deliverying packages but great customer services"
good,It was a very relaxed place but that was an issue when management was able to verbally abuse their employees
good,i had a fun time at fedex only thing i disliked was the supervisors and that they start you off with fulltime hours then as time goes by they cut back on your hours other than that i have no complaints every body else there was super cool and they help you out in case your falling behind but obviously they would expect the same back and another thing the training is super easy and fast 
good,"A typical day at work is me getting there at 6:50, grabbing my scanner, and then I report to my area. There i start my work by moving from truck to truck loading it with packages. You may get help by co-workers sometimes, but most of the time you are on your own. The managers often come by to check on you and see how your doing. The hardest part of the job it getting a package weighing more than 100lbs."
good,Work 3 p m to 5:30 hour break then work 6:30 to 9:00 p m . Co workers are great Management ok The hardest part is unloading . Best part scanning all the big items that cant go through the system.
good,Overall I'm not into play time at work or bs. I go for a reason and that is to do my ob correctly with great quality work. I'm in search of a career espicially if its a good job.
good,14 hour work day with long break in the middle of the day.
good,"It is very hectic and it definetly is a job that you need to multi task all day. Which is something I'm used to. I have learned how to deal with customer projects and presentation like binding, spreadsheets, shipping, retail, fixing technical issues, dealing with customer issues and trying my best to resolve them in a professonal manner."
good,Just not enough work to go around just a normal and rushed day.
good,its a nice place to work for a short time to save up some money but not to many perks when looking long term
good,Enjoyed working here. There's no room for advancement. Pay is not that great and employees can be hostile and act childish. Management isn't that good that's how favortism
good,"I was only a seasonal employee, working there for the month of December. The pay was good and the hours were as well. I hope to be able to go back and work there."
good,Company does a lot to stay ahead but it requires a lot of changes and sometimes not trialed first. Compensation is definitely on the low end of industry
good,I have all positive things to say about the company. I enjoy the weekly pay and the benefits and pension plan. The salary and compensation plan could be better and more defined.
good,Working at fedex is very challenging. You have to cope with time requirements to be able to deliver cargo in the earliest possible time. And to be organized to avoid misrouting cargo in different area.
good,This is a great job to get your foot in the door for the corporate office. The hardest part of the job would be the late hours. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the people you meet to end up being long-time friends
good,"Good great money..............."
good,"Overall it isn’t a terrible place to work. If you can manage to just do your job and not try to fix every little problem in the building you’ll be fine. If you are like me and want perfection at every corner, white glove and so on, it can be challenging."
good,Well known for their benefits package for even PT workers. Not much wiggle room in job duties or ability to advance without nepotism. Enjoyed the crew.
good,it is a great and fun place to work. they are big on teamwork and unity. The hardest part of the job is the long hours. the most enjoyable part of the job is the people.
good,A typical day at work last about 10-14 hrs. Tough environment that can be physically and mentally challenging.  The pay is decent but the benefits are great!!
good,"Hot, fast pace work environment. Employees are friendly and team oriented. Part time so not many hours. Have to be there a year to get any benefits. Worked with plenty of good people"
good,Need more hrs and more pay ro keep employees employed and not quit every day......................never enough workers to cover work. there needs to be training
good,The culture of the company and the people that work there really make it a great place to work. Exciting and challenging place to work. It was a bit difficult to get noticed even after almost a year of being a good rep
good,I enjoyed this job but had to quit for better opportunity  because this company didn't have benefits available  for drivers. The contractor did give us great bonuses .
good,Turn over central  good pay nice benefits revolving door  it’s a big disconnect between supervisors and employees  upper management great middle-management not so good  they need to clean house.
good,Management is trash an unfair they break more rules than the workers but get the workers in trouble for doing it don’t ever work at The one on 3rd st address is 555 compress rd
good,"Enjoyed my time at FedEx. Very friendly environment and nice people to work with. I traced shipments and updated reports on Excel. Also, covered the front desk for receptionist to take breaks."
good,"Work was good most days. The job gets easier as you learn your route more. I really enjoyed the work, but I was frustrated in never getting a raise after being promised I would get a raise."
good,"I worked their as a contractor.Your days are long and longer during holiday season."
good,The people at FedEx are nice but many of the managers will bully their workers and act like they are in charge of everything. I had 6 different managers while I was there and only got along with 2.
good,"Fedex Express offers good pay for this area and great benefits.  A typical day at work starts early and requires you to think on your feet.  It also requires a lot of flexibility and willingness to switch gears at a moment's notice.  I learned to fine tune my critical thinking skills and look beyond the obvious for answers to a variety of problems. The employees at the Huntington station have workgroups that require constant cooperation and clear communication at all times.  The most challenging parts of the job is the physical terrain that we are required to travel, the unrestrained pets and inclimate weather.  The best part of the job is definitely the relationships built with the customers."
good,"I would load and unload trailers with a forklift, making sure all freight was secured and loaded correctly in the trailer. I enjoyed the pay rate and getting free food at least once a month."
good,"A Typical day on peck season was hard work, a lot of moving around, fast paced and just stressful but a normal day was slow and varied hours. The hardest part is just keeping up with your load rate. I do know most of the other jobs besides package handling like Unloading, heaving lifting ICs, Upstairs Jobs(Facer), Scanning in QAT, and Belt Picker."
good,"Super fast paced environment 10 hours minimum a day, but those 10 hours flyby since you’re so busy, All the  people that I delivered two are super cool and I love me it says if I work at over 100 places when I deliver to them and that’s great"
good,"Employees disgruntled not a good environment to work, I wouldnt work here again, because this type of work and type of environment was not for me. A little to rugged for me"
good,"Was a contract driver for fedex, pulling doubles at night. No increase in pay after one and a half years. No benefits at all. Fedex required contractor truck to be turned down, less power and less top speed. More time invested, with no pay compensation. Lots of waiting with no pay for driver from other center. Fedex expected double trailers to reach destination on time, even though other driver did not leave on time."
good,Felt unfair at times the faster u work the harder u pick up other workers slack so days were hard at times work load never stop busy all through the shifts consistent work flow
good,"FedEx is a great place to work. It's hard work. Nightshift isn't fun but thats when they get really busy. Its mostly outside conditions.I hated nightshift, it messed with my sleep schedule. To advance positions, you have to apply on their intraweb and its usually based on seniority so best of luck. Insurance is great and starts day 1. Managers are pretty cool, just depends on what department or where you end up."
good,"it was a great place to work but was looking for a better opportunity for myself and my family, managers and policy changed dramatically and was forced out as a contractor due to not owning enough routes"
good,is a good job depending on the people you work with and the manager you have. the job can become stressful at times but as long as you are motivated and know your route justdo what you have to do.
good,"FedEx is a large company and you can feel lost at times, but there is so much happening at once that as long as you are doing your job it goes by fast."
good,I had the chance to work as both a driver and a package handler. Enjoyed my time as a driver but not so much while doing packages. Takes time to qualify for benefits...
good,era bom trabalha la mexe com o que eu gosto com os peixes atente o clientes era muito bom
good,"You will use a scanner to verify packages, off load high to medium packages by hand, and place packages on the correct truck/van, pallet, or location within warehouse."
good,"a fast pace great place to work. You spend most of your day driving, the winters are difficult, the routes are usually consolidated to help with time management."
good,you better be ready to rage war against packages because they will definitely be attacking you! you are required to scan about 150 boxes per hour and that is the easy part lmao
good,fun place to work. it is laid back. it will be ok for someone who wants to go back to school to better themselves.  With this company you can apply to different companies outside of the FedEx Forum.  The main company is called Compass Group and they have different sub-company under their umbrella.
good,Load trucks and wait until everyone else is done to leave the station. Deliver packages in a Professional way. If finish before the others communicate with management so they can send you to help other drivers.
good,Great co workers. Was not a hard job. Management made it difficult. Most customers were great. Management needs a lot of work. Benefits were great. Working equipment was in good condition.
good,Very good company to work for. Left due to management issues. Transferred my original district manager to a different district. Which moved my general manager to the same location. Resulting in hiring a completely new person which totally changed my outlook on the company.
good,If you want a fast past job that you can work for a few hours and still have time to work another job or have some time off then this is the job for you.
good,"my contractor did not pay hourly. it paid based off of stops and packages per stop. "
good,"Lots of hard work loading & unloading trucks "
good,"Awesome place to work, but was not enough advancement for me to move up in our area. Honestly poor management couldn't handle stress and to much favoritism involved. Great company but horrible management and never really train you."
good,"Not sure of what product to move.overall good plase to work product aways come in with boxes open,and smashed.over all fun plase to work for.very fast paced and time go's by quixkly."
good,"The pay is great for a part time job but then you reach a cap. The time it takes to accumulate vacation is ridiculously slow. The job requires an substantial amount of physical work and the fatigue level drops after long days/nights. FedEx preaches work/life balance and to get enough sleep however there is no sympathy for employees with 2 jobs. If the time-off was better, paid time off for holiday, and they allowed salaries to increase annually, I would work for FedEx Freight. It's not worth the stress, long hours, and tiredness unless you really need the money."
good,"Working at Fed ex isn't a bad place if you're used to working hard. It is very fast-paced and very little time to train. there are friendly people willing to help if needed. There I learned how important time-management was, the hardest part of the job was no breaks. the most enjoyable part of the job were the employees I met there."
good,Quick pace. Package pressure. There were long hours working 10-14 days.  Learn alot about building & managing teams. The hardest part of the job was locating & hiring new employes.
good,"very relaxing job "
good,FedEx is a fun job and I love it. There is always someone there who will make you day other 10x better or 10x worse. As a preloader for home delivery a lot of the drivers are disrespectful. The managers don't really take the time to train ypui for the exception of two. It is how ever a fun job.
good,"Great place to work if you enjoy little to no supervision. The work, life balance isn't the best, especially around the holidays. Pay was decent and the benefits are excellent."
good,"Good company to work for if you don't want to advance in pay or just enjoy long hours that change. Management doesn't care about your safety, they only care about quotas and bonuses..."
good,There was a lot to learn at Fed-ex but gave it all my best. It is a good company to work for. It is a very challenging place and it can be over whelming for some people.
good,"Empresa boa trabalhei durante dez anos nessa empresa nao tenho do que reclamar, pagamento e vale refeicoes nunca atrazou pelo contrario estava na conta um dia antes do previsto. Uma empresa seria"
good,Very good training programs for truck drivers very good training programs for ground Crews very good managers meteor over equipment compensation good not fantastic
good,"I enjoyed my job and was great at it, but dealing with the corporate politics was not for me. The company has plenty of opportunities for advancements."
good,No tiene prestaciones solo el seguro hay falta de apoyo por parte de la gente de oficina
good,managers communication is poor they don't talk to each other that much. people work in there make it a lot better but there's a few problems between the employees.
good,"co workers are great team-players and good work environment."
good,work place is fine and balanced. feel comfortable working around with other crew members and management. the working routine is easy and a well relax atmosphere.
good,Fed Ex Ground drivers are allowed to work on a pace as they see fit.  You aren't directly employed by Fed Ex therefore you do not get company benefits in most cases as a driver. You work at the mercy of your contractor.
good,"log on and work until 5pm or after 6pm clearing international freight, frequent changes and policy updates. no guarantees on leaving on time or OT the next day, short notice on a lot of guidelines."
good,My goals are to obtain employment from a company and or institution where I can utilize my present skills and or knowledge and be an asset to the company in which I will be employed and to possibly obtain future advancement within the company and or institute I am working.
good,"Antes se chamava rapidão cometa uma empresa com raízes e inicio no nordeste brasileiro, mais especificamente em pernambuco, a mesma foi adquirida pela fedex com seu plano de aumenta sua participação em transporte e logistica no brasil também adquiriu a empresa ""tnt"". Apesar de nada ser perfeito e nada agrada a  todo mundo não tenho reclamação grave da fedex."
good,"Supervisors required an excessive number of collection calls per day."
good,The day is very productive and goes by fast due to the fast paced environment. The work is strenuous and the hours are great for a family person. The teamwork is something that helps me get through the day
good,Trabalha demais e ganha pouco muito corrido mas tem seu lado bom da oportunidade de crescimento
good,Not enough training or cooperation from management. Job advancement was extremely difficult. No help from HR on any issues. No job security because of a significant number of unschooled managers.
good,the people were great that i worked with.  the down fall of this company was that there was nowhere to move up in the company.  for instances i worked there for 9 years and got 2 raises and still a 1 week vacation.
good,I would got to my area in the building and get my scanner and be assigned to a trailer where i would load packages for my entire shift. then I would go home after about 4 hours.
good,I like working at FEDEX but the hours are short and too many people on the shifts as they like to move fast and push you to work hard and some times get rewards for it other times is just how they work.
good,Worked here for a year and the pay rate was low. No raises ever. management was decent. I did get a few awards from them.  This was a job through Revana/Teletech.
good,"Hours vary on a day to day basis, work environment was laid back, like working alone, work can be done in a short amount of time, could be done by 1pm or 2pm depending on the kind of day and work load that you have for the day."
good,"This job was very stressful...Their training process lasted for 3 months and was great....alot of testing that if you failed, you were out...out of a class of 40, only 6 of us made the final cut...On the phones, helped fedex expess customers schedule pickups, location of drop boxes and or fedex stations, also tracked packages with and without tracking numbers...Also quoted prices and helped them to determine which shipping was the best for them... The hardest part of  the job was being monitored constantly, contantly apolizing for shipping delays which alot of customers did not accept...Not much we could do for horrible weather but most customers would not accept failure of any kind...Could not change hours or days off due to the fact that the older ops had the prime and they never left....Had to schedule vacation time off in week incremens, once a year...Last hired, last for weeks off...I enjoyed that you had to be on time all the time, Never had a problem with time management, just a nervous job for me..."
good,"	Responsibilities: To provide an efficient picks up and delivery service, support to customers on any issues regarding  features of services, while complying with all operational, security and safety policies, procedures processes with the objective of meeting service commitments and maximizing customer satisfaction"
good,Culture was look out for self.  Direct manger was one who would make calls for operation then have you take the blame if things went wrong.
good,"In my 4 year tenure with Fedex Office/Kinkos CPC"
good,"A Typical day of work is normal 8 hour day"
good,good time i like it so much too bad i moved on to better. but it was a good time. food was high but pay was good people. good enviroment
good,"Fast paced work environment, great and helpful co-workers. Management was supportive and helpful at times. Extremely long work hours was the best part of this job."
good,"FedEx is a great company to work for.  Memphis is not the most ideal place but the fact that FedEx is such a large employer in the area, there are a number of perks related to that."
good,Culture is ever-changing.  Excess middle-management tends to stunt success factors for top performers.  Management lacks industry experience and diversity.
good,"The security was very tight. Stretching was a plus and helped get everyone working together.  It was definitely a physical job. Loading/ unloading trucks, scanning packages, and wrapping pallets were the typical activities in the work shift.  The shifts were only 4 to 5 hours long and most everyone was working part time.  Everyone was supper friendly and the management was fair. It was hard to stay focused due to the repetition.  I most enjoyed the opportunities to set goals and challenge myself when I was able to.  I also learned a lot about work ethic and character."
good,"Working at FedEx has been a very good experience for the most part. I work for FedExs' local department. I load up 2 or 3 vans a day, somewhere along the lines of 700 to 1,000 packages a day. The hardest part about working here is the time. I work 3rd shift, so getting out of the bed is tough."
good,Hard working fast paced job. They will push you to your limits if they can. Most other employees do not do anything but be lazy and still get same pay rate. Does not matter how hard it is to your particular job.
good,"Constant hustle in the morning i learned to be patient and carefull of other drivers and many spontanious pedestrian actvity.The managment for the most part , are very friendly , understanding , professional.The hardest part of the job is when i dont know what to do with the package when they do not answeer the door or other related incidnets. The most enjoyable part is driving and being out and about and not being stuck at a office all day."
good,"I rate Fed-Ex excellent in all ways."
good,needs more better management and team leaders its fun but some people are very mean and they trying to boss you around when they aare not the manager.
good,"You will only reach far if you agree to be a push over, very immature managers act like  fools. very tedious work and liars always trying to hit on the young girls. i learned some great skills working there"
good,"Customer service through safe work habits and adherence to company policy"
good,Was only hired as a seasonal driver so I didn't really get to experience much. My short time there was a fun fast paced job. Hardest part of the job was learning the delivery routes. Co-workers were friendly and willing to whatever to help.
good,I delivered to busineses and factories. My co-workers were very helpful and very good at their jobs. The best part of my job was my customers. The hardest part of the job was learning to use the scanner.
good,"not bad place to start working, good first job, lots to learn and great peoples, some of the management could use an upgrade or a moral boost."
good,the job is good you are basically your own boss when you are out on the road.  the hardest part of the job is dealing with the size of the packages and you never know how many stops you get from one day to the next.
good,working on small station was the best cause i could work at a fast pace
good,they don't take workers into consideration. they don't accept mistake and you work longs hours.
good,"good place to start your first job, ok pay, my management was ok."
good,"It's a contractor-subcontractor operation. Apart from the business operations, it can be somewhat a friendly environment, as with all businesses."
good,"Days started out nice and early before the sun even came up.  Load those boxes into the truck, get them sorted so your job was easy and off I went after I inspected the vehicle to make sure it was both road-ready and worthy!  Some days I would get back before the sun went down, other days I would come back and it was pitch black."
good,A typical day at work was I would sort through the packages and I would scan them to the correct pallet or container.it was a fast paced job so my days went by fast. My co-workers were all very nice and were willing to help when I needed it.
good,Very reputable company to represent with a challenging competitive work environment.
good,I loved this job because I got work hard.  Some managers were good some were horrible.
good,A typical day is delt with lots of running and hard work.I've learned alot with dealing with customer service on a daily basis and built up a good standing with everyone i service.
good,"I work for an independent contractor which mean no benefits. Other than that, it's not a bad place to work."
good,The internal center cultures are depends on the manager but over all the people are great everyone pitches in to help get the job done.
good,"Fast paced environment"
good,"A day at work consisted of training employees to scan, load/unload, deliver packages to the right vanline by tugger train. I learned that working at a warehouse is very different from any other job and you have to be ready for whatever comes your way."
good,At Fedex I felt that the management was professional and well organized.
good,Secure job that is extremely fast paced. Holidays are very stressful at Fedex but its a job that pays relatively well.
good,Moving packages at a fast pace all day. 1050 packages are to be removed in an hour by one person and you must be able to lift up to 100 lb. by yourself off the trucks. You have to sort 500 small mail in an hour. The people are friendly and helping but you have to work really fast in a short time. It's part time only unless you are management.
good,"Great brand name and exposure, direct manager was not very good and culture begin to change"
good,I received the job through a temp agency. I liked the job but I wanted more for my life.
good,Its a short term project. Its a 9 to 5 job u won't see any one working after 5pm.
good,If you work for home delivery expect long days and little pay and no security. Your route gets changed every other day and so does your pay.
good,Good fun working job.
good,long hours standing working in kitchens preparing food.learned how to prepare pizza correctly the hardest part was the long hours
good,a face paced job. Not for someone who is constantly late. Some of the managers had an ego problem and treated some associates badly.
good,"The fedex job was pretty cool, i loved the way that i was able too work unsupervised but meeting new people was the best part of the job."
good,Good ole boy system and hard work but they pay competitive and have great benefits.
good,Copy center manager. Had one employee under me. Took care of all the customers copy orders made sure everything was done right and on time. HArdest part of the job was making sure my employee was doing the same while i was not working.
good,"this was a seasonal job placement, it is a very big company, let me learn about mail and packaging system in the Unites States."
good,"I worked at Fedex ground during the early morning shift which was from 4-8 a.m. It was perfect opportunity for me to work part-time and also attend school. They also offered a school reimbursement of up to 1,500 dollars a year."
good,fedex is a great company to work for dont get me wrong i think the company needs to really pay their employees more for the work they expect them to do
good,my job needs better manager skills and better pay and treat their ragents as people not statics..the co-workers are great my managment stinks no support from them
good,"It was alright, not great but the benefits were amazing. Some of the managers weren’t the best and lots of issues were overlooked and or weren’t even factored into daily task that brought forth a lot of complaints."
good,Pretty good overall experience it just depends on what you want to do in the company and how much you are looking to make. It is who you kmow not what you know there
good,"The work is simple enough, at times the expectations for performance are too high. over all a generally positive laid back environmen. Must be self driven."
good,Was very hard work but left a sense of fulfillment knowing my job was providing happiness to others. Good exercise and kept my body in a positive state of health.
good,It isnt a bad company to work for and I would tell more people about it good for a starter job good people to work around also good benefits and discounts to
good,"Working for FedEx was a good experience over all. I was able to meet so many different people due to the day to day variation of deliveries and customer."
good,"I do enjoy the people that work here. Kinda like a family. I do work part time so it will take about a year to receive benefits. Takes 1,000 hour which I find alittle impulsive. But it is faced paced. Lack of employees is always the problem. There’s a few things I would change about the warehouse. But over all it’s not too bad."
good,"My advice, Don't strive. Work at a meager pace. They don't seem to see people who achieve nor do they want to promote them. They'll Hire outside of the company before they people who know what they are doing."
good,"Great company to work for , which includes health care benefits after 3 months. Hardest part of the job is that you have to be ready to work in ALL weather conditions. Always busy and very time consuming."
good,There is no advancement unless you're screwing management or something. Or unless you know someone well in management. Your work ethics doesn't even matter. You can lose a lot of weight if you do your job. I lost 100lbs in less than a year. The work is easy but it's the lack of appreciation.
good,"This is a very physically demanding job. I always sleep after work, and have injured myself doing my regular duties. "
good,"lots of things to learn, many functions and systems to learn.  ongoing learning process in this department.  2nd shift hours are not working for me but could for others."
good,I enjoyed the company but the managment was terrible. I loved job and all the contact with customers and helping them understand all the fed ex offered.
good,"I was a material handler for FedEx, work on aircraft crew downloading plane and delivering to warehouse for down loading and sorting pf packages in a timely manner."
good,"youll have fun working there, but sometimes you gotta lift heavy stuffs and they don't really care if you gonna brake your back or not. as long as you do your jobs"
good,"Most places require a lot of lifting or a lot of computer knowledge with certain programs with minimal/limited training"
good,"The company is greet to work for in a whole. The culture in the warehouse are horrible. They give you the sense of the good ole boys club, and if your not in the inner circle your disposable. The pay and benefits are second to none, even for the part time workers."
good,FedEx was a great place to work.  I enjoyed the organization and the sense of urgency toward doing good work.  All those who I met had the same work ethic.
good,"Fed ex is a great company I have been with the company for 7 years almost and I love it , there’s a lot of growth and opportunity here and the benefits are great can’t complain."
good,This was a great job for me when I first got out of college. There wasn't any place for me to make more money or advance with this company. I enjoyed working with this company as well as my coworkers.
good,"If you strive to better yourself and to not give up under stress inducing conditions, this place is for you. Also, be prepared to buy smaller fitted clothing since you will be losing a bit of weight."
good,"work at your own pace, but too many big boxes, now for fedex ground everything is big and heavy. terminal managers dont really care if you have too many overweight boxes,"
good,"Great job flexible but tiredness. Not benefits, your work as you can . Managers they are ambitions they want you to work 6 days . They used you . And if you feel sick they get upset"
good,"My normal work day was to be there on time, getting freight from trucks, airplanes that came from different states to the line then to conveyor belt for on time deliveries."
good,"Its a nice Job but you have no life y will work you out the door "
good,I loved Fedex but I need something full time and fedex short sorts allow them to keep employees like me part time despite working 50 hours a week a lot of weeks.
good,"Fast paced they need to screen the loaders a little closer the one that loaded my truck they found out later that he had a reading problem ,I knew it from day one my material was always placed in the wrong section some material placed at the back of the truck when it should have been to the front, just small stuff like that continuously that made the job harder than it should have been."
good,"Company is highly focused on profitability. It's streamlining the corporation. In some cases, it's cutting out muscle. and backups. As a result, Service can suffer. It minimizes the previous advantages it had versus competitors. "
good,This position was sufficient for the time being. I only worked at this company for a short period of time thus I am not able to give an accurate description of the entire scope of this position.
good,If you don't want to be away from home for too long do not become a contract OTR driver for fedex. This job is not for everyone but has it's benefits.
good,Mala valoración x parte de los gerentes no reconocen a las personas que realmente trabajan y existen muchas preferencias y favoritismos.
good,Fedex provide flexible hours and a fair price. If you like quick money on third shift go for it. Its also a workout. You get paid to work out basically.
good,I left the company due to my boss. People at my level quit due to their bosses. I left after exhausting communicating to Human Resources my issues and it falling on deaf ears.
good,"Started at $13.50. Quarterly raises for the first year, then it drops to annually before it's capped at around $16."
good,Benefits are great. People are bad. The work environment is stressful and lacks accountability. Management does not support nor do they listen to suggestions for improvement.
good,"Did temporary work for a private contractor who played favoritism to his friends and any temp that worked for him was constantly getting hammered with extra work, especially if a veteran complained about being overworked."
good,The work days were hard and unsafe at times.Management was alright and understanding at times. My route was dangers. It was lots of gun violence and robbery. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I meet.
good,"Night shift parcel sorting, mandatory work for one week end shift out of 2. Not well managed in my opinion, everyone new questioned the manager running the sift at the time, left over a dispute with the manager. No Guarantee of breaks or Finnish time. morning and afternoon shift seemed to run fine guessing it was just the management of the night shift."
good,Good CEO. Amazing job security with good pay. Advancement is political.  Good benefits. Culture is very good. Expect the best out of you and pushes you to be your best
good,worked only part time from 3-5 hours a day 6 max.  operated forklift to unload and reload trailers for distribution of goods to various destinations.  secure freight with straps and load bars.  fast paced and under time constraints
good,"Fed Ex is not a terrible place to work, I work as a contracted employee to a contractor.  I dont dislike what I am doing, however there are no benefits and the pay is a little lackluster, there also appears to be no opportunity for career advancement.  These are all things i value in future employment."
good,"No benefits at the time,  long days, loading and unloading packages sometime was disorganized at the location.  Hardly any lunch breaks because you would want all packages delivered on time."
good,"Under paid managers."
good,Its an alright place to work. Really liked working there wish I wouldn't have left. Pay was pretty good also. And coworkers were awesome. Deffently good first job
good,"A typical day at work would be, coming in clocking into work, finding a forklift with a accurate calibrated  scale and heading up to the front desk to get your paperwork. After you’ve received your paperwork head to your designated trailer to unload. Match the paperwork with the freight then scan your badge and the freight to find the next location for the freight.  Once freight has been taken to designated area, scan badge and freight and move on to the next piece in your trailer."
good,I enjoyed working at Fedex but like every job you have your bad days. I was there for almost for 4 years and I was never promoted to full time and I think my hard work was taken for granted.
good,"I think FedEx is a good place to work to start off, but there is no growing in this company. Unfortunately they have no benefits either, but for the most part it is an OK job."
good,"NO Climate Control, too many ways to get injured, from either getting hit with a forklift, or getting pulled off the dock with a driver.  Very dangerous work there"
good,"it was just ok, just something i did to make some quick money. Not a career for me just something to feed my family. Management sucked just there to take care of my family thats all"
good,"While compensation is not great, FTN is a great place to learn.  This FTN is not made for long term work.  It is a great place to gain some experience but it lacks promotion."
good,"1. typical day at work consists of scanning and loading freight into large containers nonstop"
good,"Loading van and delivering packages. "
good,"Carga de mercancía, reparto, recogidas, descarga de mercancía, presentar documentación, incidencias"
good,It is what I expected. It is a teporary job. You are allowed to be self directed.  Very little supervision with this job. That was good. No growth potential for specific job.
good,"Ok people and not great hours. Weather cause freight to be slower sometimes. Long hours sometime"
good,"A company that is ever growing and changing, FedEx is a diverse and challenging place to work. As it is constantly changing, staff never get too ised to any one role or system. With the obtaining of TNT, this is set to change everything that makes FedEx so great. In a good way of course!"
good,Fast pace environment. Depending on the postion you are in really makes a difference in how you feel about the company. The type of manager you have makes a difference on your outlook on the company as well.
good,very fast paced and PHYSICAL. I do enjoy the weekly pay. benefits could have came quicker and management could do a better job all around as well. But if you are looking for a consistant weekly check apply
good,"A typical day consisted primarily working with customers in relationship to a package that they are shipping or receiving.  The work environment was predominantly professional.  The management was chosen on personal preference rather than merit, caused moderate internal tension."
good,"It’s a good stepping stone job, not something you want to get stuck in, unless you are looking to become an independent contractor.  It’s very fast paced and can be challenging regarding to your physical shape."
good,"I enjoy the physicality of the job, however the pay doesn't match or is not equal to the effort put forth. However, the main reason would probably be absolutely no benefits offered, i.e. medical or dental."
good,"I feel they are making advances in the way they treat the female workforce. They still have quite a way to go. You must have thick skin to work here. At the local terminal political correctness is out the window. I believe some local management needs to be way more engaged. It is rare you see them for anything other than being reprimanded. Do what is expected and you pretty much fly under the radar. Other than some poor local management, I believe FedEx is fantastic corporation to work for. As a corporation they are trying to create a devoted work force. The pay is competitive. The health benefits are less great each year. If you put the time in, your vacation and paid time off is five weeks. The work environment is very dirty. But it is at times a very fast paced quick work day. As long as you are a hard worker, not sensitive and don’t mind some dirt this would be a good fit for you."
good,"get in a 6am load truck, out of terminal usually by 9. delivery betwwen 100 and 150 stops precisely and in a timely manner. most enjoyable part of day is being out on the road"
good,Fed Ex is a fun and happy place to be. I work alone and free.  I enjoy delivering packages to customers. Management is not on your back.  There is no hard part of the job if you're productive.
good,"It's an alright place to work.  Co-Workers can sometimes be a little difficult to work with at times.  A lot of gossiping goes in, which makes you feel like your back in high school. "
good,The job keeps you pretty busy and is fast paced. You get to meet a lot of great people from delivering to them. Also the training they provide is great.
good,"A typical day at work would be, packing and unpacking trucks for two to three hours a day. I learned that even in a part time job you still want to work hard and do you best while you are there no matter how many hours you work.The management was not that friendly but was willing to talk to you if you had a problem. The culture was diverse. The hardest part of the job was leaving after only two hours. The most enjoyable was while you where working."
good,big company with different products made.  a lot of cross training.  sometimes opportunities for overtime.  medium paced environment.  lots of culture and company outings.
good,"This was a fast pace work place. Everything is time slots. Its a good company with great benefits, but all vacation time around holidays goes by sonority of what days you can schedule off."
good,"I learned that contracting with fedex custom critical is a feast or famine experience. The money is great when you get loads, but getting loads are few and very far between. I had to wait on average of 3 days between loads. Most of the time i only got 1 short run per week. There were hundreds of vans in line waiting for loads."
good,Assisted with delivering packages to customers. Holidays was more work however some customers gave drivers tips. The work can be stressful at time due to the fact that drivers deliver in all weather
good,As an employee of fedex it would be nice to be offered benefits and 401K. Help is appreciated whenever it can be given. It would also be nice for the big guys to stay off of peoples back when they haven't experienced the work environment themselves. Know the deal before you jump to conclusions.
good,"It has been a pleasure learning from both a inbound and outbound operations perspective with both FedEx home delivery and ground. Management for me has been a plus for me because I was able to effectively lead, teach and inspire."
good,"Good company for someone just starting out. Everything is measured in time, you will be responsible for every minute. Very fast paced job. Late hours, good if you like overtime."
good,"This job was a great opportunity for me. I learned a lot about working successfully as a group, and using my time efficiently. Safety and awareness was a big part of my work, and I feel I thrived with this company."
good,the hours are low typically 20-30 if your lucky. the pay is alright 11 an hour. the work is typically more enduring then most job dealing with lifting and moving packages.but not bad at once you get used to it
good,"FedEx Supply chain,  was very unique and a fun place too work. The environment was fast paced and layed back. Management could be a hassle at times, but the over all experience was nice."
good,"The job is super easy, loading and unloading trailers with a forklift your entire shift. Bare-minimum physical labor required, other than to build a decking system in the trailers for loading freight. It is a dusty and dirty environment plus working outside in the summer and winter is a pain but overall this is a decent place to work."
good,good places to work but could use better managers because the ones there are good but the middle to lower managers need work because they don't make team work better .
good,"FedEx Ground is a great place to either start an entry level position, or like myself, re-start after a serious career setback.   Biggest obstacle is that all new hires start as part time and can take years to go full time."
good,"Good company to work for, but the 14 and 16 hour days were terrible. Also working outside in the cold was bad. Not much family time."
good,"I had a good time at my job at FedEx, except for the fact that I was a temp. FedEx treats their employees very well, but their temps are not treated as well."
good,"Working at FedEx warehouse was very physical, fast paced, and can give overtime anytime was a bonus. Also, working at FedEx i learned how to use many different hand held machiary."
good,"It was a great job but not many hrs. It fast work its,good for anyone seeing partime, job.ut gives u a lot of time on your feet. The crew was friendly and willing to help out."
good,A typical work day is I scan and load all packages on to my van and then deliver them in a timely manner.  Once deliveries are completed I pickup packages businesses are sending out through Fedex.
good,It was a great shift but your never guarennteed hours as promised. Sucks  in winter time due to the cold and sucks working with the drivers when things need to be in certain areas but not enough room
good,Going in to work in the morning happy and ready to begin your day  because i enjoy what i do get the products ready and load it into the work truck. All the co-workers are nice and helpful along with supervisors when you have a questions.
good,"Overall good place to work, like teamwork, & when other employees help you out, finishing your route. Really working here"
good,"A typical day at work is very fast paced, once your truck is loaded and your on the road for delivery. Most everyone is pleasant and friendly.I learned that i am more capable than i knew under an extreme amount of stress. Most of my coworkers were good to work with. The hardest part was extreme weather conditions, specifically really hot weather or really cold winter with hazardous road conditions. The most enjoyable part of the job, was when the customer would thank you, and really appreciate  your service."
good,"Good paying job, only problem is that as you work longer the less miles you will get. Once you arrive to your destination it will take you from 3 hours to 3 days to get another load and leave that location. Some co-workers are very good drivers and will help you if you need help, other drivers have no driving experience and will only drive around 200 miles a day."
good,"The culture is changing at FedEx.  Every year, we have no idea if bonus will be paid out.  Often bonus is minimal. More overtime and travel is the norm.  There is a lack of work / life balance."
good,With a diverse group of employs from all over. I had a lot of fun working here. I miss the people form this place a lot. It wasn't that bad of a job.
good,"I enjoy working for fed ex, it's just that there are no benefits offered by the contractors. I enjoy being able to set my own pace, as long as I get my job done."
good,The verbal and psychological abuse may or may not be worth the good pay. They cut hours in the winter months if you are not fast enough.
good,whatever you do make sure you cover your own self! They try to hold you accountable for many things out of your control. They will also push you extremely hard to figure out your limits when you first start.
good,Fast paced environment. Willingness to work well with others despite the sometimes hostile environment. Ability to work under pressure in a timely and efficient manner.
good,"Very productive. Disruptive employees were dealt with efficiently and quickly. Satisfactory management and of third shift hours. Constant work, no breaks."
good,"Very hot environment to work in during the summer and cold during the winter. Overall a great place to work. Awesome people but extremely fast paced workplace. All about the numbers but growth and development are very important as well. Safety is a HUGE factor. You work in a warehouse and inside the bed of trucks loading them with packages from 0lbs. to over 100lbs. Watch your step! I have also worked in the smalls department during my pregnancy, very easy. A lot of females in that department which made it hard sometimes to work along side with them."
good,Very fast paced environment with multiple tasks. Excellent benefits great for part time work. I enjoyed being a team leader. Excellent management team. Working outdoors could be a challenge depending on weather.
good,You meet a lot of people in that line of work. Delivering the package bring them enjoy and happiness because thy been waiting on there package.
good,"Working with this company for over 15 years, I excelled and received many various awards throughout the years.  Overall I loved my job until management was changed with whom I had a personality clash.  It was then that it became a task to go to work."
good,Though the physical labor is hard it is never undoable and beside a lack of available advancement and poor coworkers a fine place to work.
good,"this is a good company, that offer bonus and some benefits,the area where i was the management use to be good but they change the manager and brought someone without experience. after that was horrible management."
good,I had a pretty good supervisor and co-workers. My section tended to get their stuff done so things ran rather smoothly. The jobs overall is easy but you have to work hard and fast.
good,"Set schedule which was nice .If you do not like to work hard it is not the place for you. I lost so much weight and fast because it was a fast pace and lots of heavy lift over a long  period of time. Lots of lifting, twisting, bending and everything in between. worked wit ha lot of kids that were working to get threw collage."
good,"I love my co workers as well as my manager, very laid back work place environment, I get along well with everyone here, everyone is very friendly"
good,"Foi uma experiência legal ter trabalhado em uma multinacional, aprende se muito, e aprende uma visão mais globalizada da sua área de trabalho."
good,"hard work "
good,hours are a little messed up one day you work 4 hours then the next you can end up with  9 hours and the dock management doesn't always seem to know whats going on
good,I enjoyed working here. I wish getting on here permanently wasn't nearly as hard as it is. But it is a great job. I liked the hours and would definitely recommend this job to anyone.
good,Being a driver at FedEx is 12-14 hours a day 5-6 days a week. consistently. Great Place to work and they take care of you well. I loved working for them because theirs so much room for growth in the company. You can transfer anywhere in the world with them. Discounts on flights and hotels.
good,A typical day at work involves hooking two trailers up and  hauling them to Kansas. A driver from Missouri meets me there. We swap trailers and go back to our own cities and drop the trailers at the FedEx yards.
good,"FedEx was a wonderful experience working for them. I enjoyed "
good,"I love the benefits, pay is not so great. I stay here for the benfits, thats it. There are to many politics here, managers mostly suck. Many dont have degrees thay started from the bottom and worked there way up, most are to young and inexperianced to manage."
good,"Plan, organize, direct and control all operations within the service area in a way that provides maximum service to customers while maintaining a cost effective station operation."
good,"I was a seasonal worker and loved working the job. I was a home delivery driver and delivered over 100 stops daily."
good,"While I was in the military I worked as a paralegal specialist. Assisting the attorneys with completing their paper work, for court dates and hearings."
good,"opened the store by myself, counted drawer's for the day also the safe.  Made dough for the next day everyday, also cut veggies and cheese. mangers and co-workers was nice. "
good,"Wonderful first time, real job for a college kid. Great health benefits, vacation time, and college reimbursement."
good,A typical day consist of starting off with a team meeting then lifting and scanning packages preparing them to be delivered. I learned how to be a team member and how to lead by example. Management never wanted to give me no more than 25 hours a week making it hard for me to save money. The hardest part of the job was lifting chrome rims for automobiles. The most enjoyable part was there was not much supervision.
good,"i learned that work is not always just work, it can be a family and fun environment also!! it just depends how you look at things, i look at work not just as a job but something i love to wake up and do!! u always enjoyed waking up and saying hello to the manager and any staff at fedex when i was a package handler!! i got everything that i had to do daily done and sometimes i would be treated out to eat or just a good job was good enough for me, seeing my workers happy and me happy is a great feeling and thats how i want to feel at any place of work!! i know its a job but we must all work and stick together to make things happen!!"
good,Working for Fed ex is very difficult on your body. It is strenuous work and long hours. Family life is limited because of the hours. The pay is pretty good though.
good,"Empresa com atividades fáceis de se trabalhar mas com grandes responsabilidades. "
good,"having to call one hour before work daily to find out what time your shift starts on time or delayed, start work then sort about 500 documents, return to my vehicle and set my route up from scratch analyze and determine when is the most efficient way to run my route, i ran about 180 miles a day with about 100 deliveries, able to adapt on the spot to change cause i did pickups as well and every stop added after i had set up for the day need to adjust to be able to continue and make service. learned a lot about customer service and dealing with all different types of customers attitudes. dealing with management and co-workers is like any job you learn to adapt to the environment. hardest part of the job was the uncertainty of start time on a daily basis and no support. the most enjoyable part was the self satisfaction of getting the job done sense of accomplishment and being able to have that interaction with all my customers."
good,A empresa em si é muito boa pra trabalhar o problema e que não tenho  ajuda de custo para trabalhar e morar fora para trabalhar na mesma .
good,FedEx is a great company to work management needs improvement and education on the fundamentals of being a team player
good,"A typical day at FedEx was generally fast paced but overall fulfilling and fun. I learned many things about leading a team and managing both employees, customers and upper management. I was taught many things about discipline and leadership and was even sent to a course called Emerging Leadership. I liked and enjoyed working with almost everybody I was assigned to tasks or areas with and was taught many things about the company as a whole. The hardest part about being a manager there was it was quite stressful since I worked overnight. It was highly demanding of my time both because it was far away from my home and the hours were long. The best part about the job was how much I learned about leadership and the managing of both people and processes. I also enjoyed helping customers a great deal and all the fun I had working with so many pleasant people."
good,"long hours,need improvment..co-workers was ok..the duties was very easy.."
good,I would come in about 15 to 30 minutes before start to meet with the supervisor and get the break down from yesterdays production. Scan and talk about it. Review what we have on the dock and yard. Make changes if necessary. Go get my area equipment and set up dock. Meet with my personnel and discuss things and let know what we need to work on or do that day. Ask for any questions or thoughts. Give instructions and start the day.
good,"work for FedEx Freight for full time 10 years part time 1 year."
good,"Not hourly, freedom without confinement.  The pay is ok.  Pay rate is daily.  Hard work, with little room for growth with the company."
good,Depending on the Job you do you may be off by 10am the Job is quick and easy as a handler.
good,it was nice to have a job where you could learn about so many things in one incounter.
good,Pay is not good but the insurance is great. I love the people here.
good,i would go in to work from 5pm - 10:30pm i learned how to unload and unload trucks divide packages into trucks by area codes so i learned attention to detail management my manager used to cut take hours away from my check and i would have to complain the hardest part about my job were the hours i was still in high school
good,"The company can be great, however if you are a new employee, the opportunity to move up in the company is slim. Old timers hold their positions so unless they quit, transfer, or die a new position will not open"
good,"By far the best temp job I ever had, for the most part everyone was great and always willing to help me. .had a blast, too bad it was seasonal."
good,"I would clock in and have a little meeting with fellow workers and the boss. After that, my shift would start."
good,a good place to work out and work at same time.  If you don't mind a fast pace in lots of heat this is the place for you.
good,"FedEx is like any other logistics company in this economy. They have their internal challenges to grow business. Their KPI's are difficult, but reasonable."
good,Great people to work with. Management can be lacking sometimes. The Work is hard and fast paced and can be frustrating.
good,"A FedEx , foi onde comecei a ter uma base de como funcionava o mundo coorporativo ,foi com lideres que ,a todo momento procuram  desenvolver habilidades em seus colaboradores  e foi onde comecei a expor minhas habilidades e competências adquiridas e incentivadas a todo momento ."
good,loaded deliver vehicle and delivered packages to customers homes and business
good,"Essa empresa eu aprendi a trabalhar com o transporte "
good,"A typical day was delivering packages, driving long distances, meeting new people, and working with wonderful co-workers.  I learned direction, time management, and to be my own boss throughout the day.  Sometimes the hardest part of the day was fitting in break-time."
good,"Work mainly graveyard shifts. acknowlegde for my hard work but have not gotten hired. I work through an agency and they just keep giving me the run around. Looking for something stable and secure. Typical day would be 5-6 hour shifts, always busy and quick. Everyone usually kept to themselves."
good,there is a lot of deliveries during the Christmas time but its not often you will receive any benefits for your all out work ethics.
good,The contractor I worked for was a hard person to get along with so my experience wasn't the best that it could be
good,Driving forklifts in the most of extreme conditions in a fast paced environment.
good,It was a great experience and wonderful training for a solid corporate company
good,"This job, as the title says, is fast paced and tiring. Its fun but very tiring. There is a lot of heavy lifting (done in teams if required). The management was fair but rarely around to help with what we needed help with. They were good when it came to training, but that was about it. The hardest part of the job was the hours of operation. The shift I worked was overnight but it was made better with the people I worked with."
good,A typical work day for me was very busy but it was a fun place to work. People were more like a family there.
good,"leave in my vehicle by myself; no one over looking my shoulder all day.  To be a great leader you can get co-workers to cooperate with you. Did not set the example Management. Co-workers enjoyed working with them. As you get older, physically gets harder. The daily challenge of satisfying the customer."
good,"A typical day at work includes everything involved with maintaining and operating a large Corporate facility with 32 employees, 27 routes, and 20 vehicles, all needing to operate at full capacity with very little margin for error."
good,Can be extremely challenging on a daily basis. With this job a motivated mindset is mandatory to deal with the stresses and objectives throughout a work day.
good,"No dia dia em sim dia comum de trabalho sem nenhuma  arnomania, aprendi muitas coisas na questão de trabalho em equipe mais infelismente ainda deixa a deseja na gestao na questao de lider de postos avançados, com colegas de trabalhos otimos para trabalhar com mesmo ideal e metas, a parte mais dificil e que as vezes ficamos a derivas de informaçoes que nao chegam ate nos funcionarios, mas é muito agravel e bom fazer parte dessa empresa pelo fato de ser uma multi nacional."
good,enjoy delivering packages to customers homes and business. enjoy interacting with the public. enjoy working as a team player.
good,"i was courier/ loaded trucks, unloaded, and delivered packages by time committed."
good,Load packages onto trailers. Unload trailers. Sort packages.
good,Did not like being away from  home three weeks at a time and could not make any money.
good,it was nice to see new faces and new places everyday. the just had a strict defined schedule
good,"Typical day at work, involves me checking for late arrivals, any loads unloaded at the hub that should have been unloaded some where else. Checking the unload control sheets for any discrepancies that may cause the sort to go down late. Communicating with the Asst Hub Manager about any problems that may cause the sort to go down late or dispatch late. Where this job is meeting all of my challenges that i was looking for, i also notice my hands are tied to what i can control. Co workers are very supportive and very helpful. The hardest part is not being able to control what is in my area. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with others and training."
good,"When i got to the terminal i would get my scanner and set it up. Then I would have to scan all my packages in to the scanner and load my truck. Once loaded I would start out on my route usually ranging  from 110 to 160 stops a day. I would deliver to both business and houses, collecting signatures and place package in a secure spot. Once all the packages are off the truck its time to fuel up and head back to the terminal."
good,"Be prepare to work hard during the sort. Good for people who like to work alone, but bad for people who like human contact during work. Most of the time is spend working in trailers."
good,While at this company I did just about every job there was except managing the store.  I was there for about 5 years and management changed multiple times and was never very improved.
good,"Early morning loading boxes onto trucks, sharing jokes with co-workers to the left & right of me. I learned how to better handle hazardous materials being sent through mail, Also how to work as a team to accomplish a goal. The supervisor works right beside you on the belt helping & guiding you along the way. The hardest part of the job for me was getting there because my shift started at 4 O'clock in the morning. The best part of this job for me was working with an entertaining / reliable team that kept me up & going during those wee hours of the morning."
good,Learned how to scan packages and set in proper place. A very fast pace environment at times. At times it got over whelming because you could get 50 packages at a time from the same address while still looking for other address of boxes that your responsible for.
good,"load and unload boxes and learned a lot about aircraft."
good,I enjoyed my time at fedex. I enjoyed the customers mainly. Making the customers happy was my reward. I was always on the go and made sure I made timely deliveries.
good,seasonal job not to much to say because i worked third shift didnt have breaks to explore the place... just walk in get to work until the next bell ring and than its time to leave
good,The job was pretty good. No complaints except for the long hours. 
good,when you go home at night you will dream of loading boxes. worst job i've ever had. 
good,Hard work and very Fast pace job. Had to learn very quick on how to load trucks by myself.
good,job was easy i learned team work gets the job done as fast and as safe as possible. management was the worst. co-workers were good people 
good,"The training classses are really good for the up to date skills needed in this economy. To help me inform the customer of better and easier ways to get their work done more effectively."
good,nice place to work for a parent or someone that's in school or even both
good,a typical day at work was loading and unloading trailer I learned the proper processors for picking up and putting down a box and how to build a foundation management was rough you could be in the middle of something and they would pull out of it and send you somewhere else and then send you back and the first project you worked on is ruined so you have to work twice as hard the hardest part of the job was keeping the job because the labor was not worth the pay the most enjoyable part was it kept me in shape
good,I enjoyed working with Fed-Ex. It gives you plenty of excercise. I also enjoy communicating with the custormers and ensure they are happy with their product.
good,Driver / Customer Service
good,"I handled all the packages that came through on my conveyer belt and proceeded to sort them into their designated category bins. Management was, of course, very nice and understanding to their employees. They seemed to genuinely care. My co-workers usually kept to themselves as they were probably tired (we worked the grave yard shift). Otherwise, though, the ones that did talk were nice enough. There wasn't any hard part of the job. The hardest it got was lifting bags of mail to sort onto the belt or simply avoiding a good ol' papercut."
good,"a typical day at work, would to achieve our assignments we where given for that day."
good,"FedEx is an excellent company to work for and has great people to work for. However, the nature of the service industry is extremely stressful. I have never worked with better people in my life....from sales, marketing, customer service, operations, HR..... everyone at HQ in Memphis are so nice and professional. I think of this company as a large family. If you want to work for this company in Memphis, then you will love it.......If you want to work in Sales or Operations then be prepared to have a thick skin b/c you will be dealing with the general public. The service industry is very demanding and never forgiving. I cannot say enough good things about FedEx as a company to work for."
good,"its very simple you come in and unload packages, after you done unloading the packages then you load up the other trucks"
good,"Es un buen trabajo servir a la gente, aclarar dudas, realizar envíos es lo que realizo día con día"
good,No way to grow as a bussiness person.When routes became available they were already taking by the people who knew each other.Other than that it was an nice experience.I didn't like the lack of help during peek season.
good,"The typical day consists of going in at 3:30-4:00a.m.sorting and unloading packages. Learned how the management wanted the overall concept efficiency set in placed. Co-workers were like anywhere else I suppose, some worked and some didn't. The hardest part of my job was working inside of the constraints of my school schedule. And the most enjoyable part of the the job had to be is yet to be determined."
good,"Typical general labor work place. Clock in, produce numbers, and don't get recognition for it."
good,I work for fed/ex under a temp agency Volt as a sesonal package delivery driver i was there for x/mas help fed/ex pays well but bad management and people not good to work with not good business to work for don't care about there people
good,"Typically i would oversee every aspect of the store and mostly worked independantly. I would assist customers in any part of the store from self service, full service and shipping. in full service i would take customer orders and either outsource them or produce them myself. I would make sure to follow up on any job that was outsourced. Co-workers tended to be a bit slow or didnt care. And management is a joke. Managers were typically promoted from within but they tend to want to prove themselves and with that comes employees not being taken care of its more about them then the teammembers"
good,great job for the salary.
good,The day starts with getting what trails need to be unloaded and where the loads needs to be loaded onto. I have learned that each freight has to be handle with care. Management was a no nosense atmosphere! My co- workers was a joy to work with. Working in the cold weather was the hardest part. Love the job
good,I work hard. I drive around. Helping coworkers get what they need.There is no hard part.
good,I like the benefits and my co-workers. It is set up so that you have to work together which for the most part is a good idea except with you are in a group where one or more guys is only thinking about themselves.
good,Warehouse was mostly productive and fast paced however during peak around Thanksgiving and Christmas it was far too overloaded.
good,"I liked working for the company, But my experience with upper Management was not good."
good,"A typical day at work is the same as any other day, you clock in go to your spot and start your job. All the co-workers were wonderful and helpful. The hardest part of the job is working in the middle of the winter just because it gets really cold in there. The most enjoyable part of the job is when the unload team is almost done, we have to help load as well."
good,"FedEx is a place to good experience in certain areas of a field, they are based on safety.Management isnot the bestbut they do try to get things done but not in the best ways possible. Co-workers are great they are very friendly and help you out with out asking when ever you need it.I guess the hardest part at FedEx is doing hand stack freight. The most enjoyable part on the job is being on a forklift moving freight to its destination door"
good,Swing shift starts 3AM unloading trucks also driving tugger through the warehouse. i also scan packages. the management is okay as well as coworkers
good,"It was one of the greatest jobs I've had, I loved my team, the customers and my responsibilities. When I began it was a ""Promote from Within"" atmosphere and since then they've hired only external managers that know little to nothing about the job."
good,"A typical day is going in around 6, help with loading while planning your day out, then executing."
good,Everyday I would load and unload trucks in an synchronized order according to city to ensure that there is no mistakes with delivery.
good,when you get to the warehouse job start non-stop.
good,"It is a great start to a young career but it is not a company you would want to look forward to retiring with. You just have to make the job comfortable for you by just doing your job well and not indulge in the behind the scene politics. Great customer relationships, great friendships, and a sense of leadership and responsibility are all attributes you gain from working as driver with FedEx."
good,"after i clock in at 8 and begin sorting mail and various packages to their designated areas to be prepared for delivery. Break and lunch were decided by the employees which included myself. and after my full 8 hour workshift i would either clock out or just stay and work overtime. i learned the skematics of how my mail was able to reach its correct destination, and also gained experience working with a large group of people from a variety of ethnic backrounds and it was fun."
good,all in all the company is ok to work for but management needs alot of work
good,Nice job to have. Keeps your moving. hard to get on full time. The money is funny...
good,FedEx is in general an excellent employer. Good benefit package and job security. The customers are always a pleasure to interact with. You really learn to schedule your time
good,"I feel the diversity and our benefits stand out the most. FedEx is very diverse in its employees and management, and provides benefits that most jobs don’t."
good,Great opportunity.... My time was cut short. I desire too be more to this job just Life happens my time at FedEx was great and positive the shifts were very early but allows you a great lifestyle balance
good,"Is a good job to learn about working in a warehouse . They have modern scanners the facility is brand new with new belts. It's a friendly environment,  safety comes first working for this company."

good,Great environment and great staff! management is ok. most enjoyable part of the job is being surrounded by positivity each and every day. I have learned a lot working here.
good,The work place is fun and management is great. They are super understanding and are willing to work with you through anything. Also you get paid to workout.
good,"It was overall fair, if you have not worked there before be ready to WORK! This job you will actually have to work for what they are paying you for a hour."
good,Management is good job is fast paced should be in good health. Do what is assigned you. Don't take to many bathroom breaks and expect to be searched when you leave
good,"Good work environment, everyone is friendly as works hard , people help when needed , the pay is good , the location is far but the hours are very much so worth it ."
good,Made sure each packages are scanned and loaded correctly in each trailer and are closed safely when done. Fast paced environment. And supervisors made sure you were doing your job correctly
good,Can be tiring at first. I recommend using elbow and knee sleeves for your joints if you have joint problems and drink plenty of water (the inside of the trailers can get very hot)
good,They are a good company to work for. They have many locations and various positions to choose from throughout the USA. Good company benefit and retirement programs.
good,FedEx is very good for Java resources. Very good Management. Good work culture. You will get a fair chance to prove yourself. Location is very good for staying long term with family.
good,FedEx was very flexible and worked with me through some difficult situations. Management was understanding and willing to listen to concerns and that was definitely appreciated.
good,"This work environment is typically fast paced and indeed friendly, self motivation is important for company advancement. Most definitely a 9 out of 10 recommended"
good,I enjoy working at FedEx I really enjoy myself working I say the management need to be work on my hours are flexible and the group work with pick up the paste hope to become the clerk international I applied for
good,"Great people, good benefits, good opportunities, ever changing working environment with new opportunities and goal. Small company feel within a large corporation."
good,"My time at Federal Express was a experience I will never forget. Even though this company had it's ups and down, I was able to get in a credit union and meet new people."
good,"Fed ex was a very high volume conditions to work in because of the heat conditions but i enjoyed every bit of it. Consequently, FedEx is a great job to take your talent to."
good,"Although it was kind of hard labor, my skills were set for this job. The pay was decent and the management treated me with respect. I would enjoy working for this job again in the future"
good,FedEx provides great diversity and supports growth. Helps with education and certification to get where you want to be in your career. Promoting woman in trucking the last few years has made woman feel supported. FedEx provides good service to customers and truly cares about their internal customers as well.
good,The best part of delivery at FedEx is;  It is only me and a truck full of packages to be delivered to customers.  Helps me maintain my self motivation and desire to do an outstanding job every day
good,If you work well alone this is the job for you. This job is physically demanding as you will be expected to move boxes that are recommended team lifts. You are compensated fairly but there is no moving up at all and for some that is good enough.
good,FedEx is a solid company with good people. They are a leading aviation company within the industry. They have a good culture and good work verses home life balance.
good,"Fast paced, hard work, different opportunities. Work hours vary through out the day. Sunrise, noon day, twilight and midnight shifts are your choices. Pick the best one for you"
good,"My job consist of packing and stacking boxes into delivery trucks, for the delivery trucks to send customers their desired orders. I learned how to use a scanner to scan orders."
good,alot of overtime fast paced company ok managers and cool co coworkers and good if you like to get alot hours and always busy and great location to work
good,It’s a good place for the younger people to work. But the pay is mediocre compared to the amount of strain they put on your body...as well as much product you touch and move I feel like you should be paid more due to the fact without the employees there would be no product reaching its customers period.
good,Working at FedEx was a great job out of high school I definitely would have taking a full time job if the pay was a little better that what they start you out at.
good,"I liked it working there was a good change of pace and I was valued, worked to get paid the money was good nothing I didn't like about the job, everything worked well."
good,"Working at FedEx was a good experience. It was a part-time position with fulltime benefits, but it did take a lot of hard work.  The process of getting hired was relatively simple."
good,Uma experiência única. Equipe diferenciada e resultados alcançados.  O trabalho exigiu praticidade e motivação.
good,"ambiente de trabalho bom, pouco beneficio, salario compativel."
good,"Throughout the whole experience it’s a great job to have you can learn a lot. Sometimes you have a lot pressure on you as a lead. It’s a fast past job, however you can learn a lot and advance."
good,The management is great. The way managers correct someone after making a mistake is very professional and are very willing to work with you. Nice atmosphere to work people are like family.
good,"It was good, I enjoyed working overnight. It was amazing pay. I got paid every week/weekly. I was on time. I also had a set time limit. It was like my first job."
good,Very easy to get a job here. But at the same time they will work you very hard most people do not last so if you’re someone who does not like hard labor reconsider uploading ur Resume.
good,"at fedex freight, the frieght is moved by forklift, the atmosphere is inviting and fast pace but serious when it comes to being safe. the potential for growth makes this a place to work"
good,I've just started here so I don't recommend listening to just my review. So  far the environment is pretty relaxed and fun. We can listen to music as long as we get what we are doing done in a timely fashion.
good,Go to the rec room before the shift starts wake up get ready for the day make sure youve got something to eat. that make sure youre getting those cubes and hitting numbers
good,At FedEx you can bid on other jobs after one year of service you can become a tug driver can go to the airplane and help load it  set up the work area learn how to do roll over
good,"Clock in. Then we stratch for about 15 min. The get our qr scanner ,and head to our area and start working we sort pakages into nine diffrent pallets."
good,Management at FedEx is all about themselves.  Don't give a d about your career or if you succeed in the Company.  Long as they are in manager positions. They don't know how to preform their duties. Look for others.
good,"Fedex was a decent place to work if you're up to it physically. New hires start either loading or unloading trucks. If you're high speed, they'll put you on the sort tower, and that's where it gets easy. Lots of memorization, fast pace, but it's not as physical. I liked it a lot better up there."
good,"FedEx was great I loved the work Because it was simple and easy, couldn’t keep it because of family issue thankfully that’s not a problem anymore and I would  like to start somewhere new."
good,Working in fedex was great management was awesome it team work oriented and its very fun and everyone pulled there weight in their roles the hours of work depend on how fast you move and deliver the packages
good,"It was good, I would have kept working there if my carpooling schedule hadn't fallen apart. The amagment was direct and on the floor at all times, there was never a time where I felt like I couldn't talk toa manager if I needed to."
good,It was a good job all together yu worked at your own pase good pay every Friday so it was good for me move boxes on or  off the truck yu got to move at your own pace
good,"Trabajo muy proactivo"
good,"in a warehouse environment part time at nights, and its alright. It's frustrating coming in, and dealing with starting on where someone one else left off, and most everything wasn't done right, so it holds you back, because you have to fix everything, and no one is held accountable."
good,"Decent place to work, fast paced environment. Pay is decent and you get raises pretty quick. Excellent job for a farmer or other seasonal type worker."
good,"Como foi um aprendizado para mim,cada um fazia oque tinha que ser feito com eficiência e rapidez"
good,"	Operated FedEx authorized vehicles"
good,"It was good working for fed ex. Delivering packages was ok for me. Some days were challenging, trying to find the correct address but was ok, with a GPS things got better."
good,It depends on your character.If your not a physical person this job isn't for you. If your not a fast paced person this job isn't for you. If your someone who likes working behind a desk this job isn't for you.
good,Awesome company. Been working here for over 6 years. I love what we do I just don't like the direction the company is heading with the introduction of 7 day operations.
good,fast paced usually every day learned to load and unload boxes to me the management was always on point and the workplace culture was pretty decent too.
good,"Es una gran empresa, estuve muy contenta de trabajar allí,"
good,"they have a high expectation for work pace physically demanding, the pay is good for the work as long as you can keep up. high endurance is a must over physical strength."
good,It was a typical day by unloading atleast 3 trucks a day in the morning but was very dangerous due to the fact that one wrong move and the entire wall can fall and hit you on your head.
good,I loved working as a same-day courier with FedEx. It was very laid back and easy! Co workers were also easy going and we helped each other out when some days were packed with deliveries.
good,In my area I may assist one of my colleagues scan freight in the containers or i may push off freight on our walkway and i also help with loading the planes too.
good,this is a comp[any I would highly like to work for again they take care of their own and all new hires. safety is big with me and they assured me it is theirs aswell
good,It will be better if was constant work all around. It's a competitive atmosphere with a quick pause following the lack of the computer systems tend to bad in connection and so far. But it's a good job in the sense theirs no abusing well for me it never happened and you can move up
good,It's not a easy job. I have to get a lot a rest beacuse you have to be at work early in the morning. What ever you do do not give up. It's going to pay off in the long run.
good,"Worked with energetic ,efficient productive minded people. Customer service and efficiency was at the top of the list. Thinking for yourself and being self driven are pluses"
good,"Good company. The money is not the best but benefits and time off is good, even for new hires. People are great and managers are very receptive and flexible."
good,"Be at work on time . Be ready to work for the customers of fedex and etc. Stay focus and hydrated during the sort. Earn pay time off , plus benefits depending how hard you work."
good,It’s was a okay experience other then working in the cold and other people not doing there job it was something new for me and I got a lot of exercise in while working there
good,"The hardest part of the Job, is Keeping up with Loading, very tiring, have to be Prepare to really work at a fast pace,to be done by certain time, and scan packages without missing is very important.,"
good,"If you dont mind being rushed around, Constantly running, very fast-paced, Dealing with Some Managers who know exactly how to run a sort..And others who have No-Idea..Also you have to work 1,000 HRS before you can receive all of your Benefits!!"
good,"I liked working at FedEx they are a good company and if you do the job according to the policy,  you will bebpaidbat a competitive rate. They offer great benefits as well."
good,"FedEx has a very fast paced work environment. There are 3 main areas to work in. There is unload, where large trailers are unloaded to be sorted in the facility. There is the van line, where the small delivery trucks are loaded for local delivers. Lastly there is outbound, where large trailers are loaded to move packages from hub to hub."
good,"Its hard work, the weather makes it difficult. But you get to be left by yourself all day, just doing your own thing. Not a terrible job, was promised a raise however never got one."
good,A typical day is usually productive. Management was some what good. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the heat. Workplace culture was diverse.
good,"Conferia os componentes, contagem por caixa, embalava com etiqueta e mandava pro estoque."
good,"come on time, do your job. Don’t give management a reason to micromanage. It’s ok to talk to other employees here and there but don’t make it a habit. No horse playing. Make your numbers and deliver packages on time, leave door tags always and fill it out correctly."
good,"Always busy, constant customer inquiry phone calls had to have thick skin because often times the customers get upset because there was something wrong with the shipment or it was late and they  take their frustration out on you. So the ability to keep calm and carry on is most essential. Nice office building the management team was usually pleasant there was plenty of opportunities to move up within the company. Strong FedEx work culture."
good,FedEx is a good place to work at . Very clean and face paced . The pay for this job is 13hr starting but they give you so much opportunity for overtime that you’ll be bringing home what someone who gets paid $18-20/hr makes .
good,Package Handler making sure we got all trucks unloaded by certain period of time  Always going at a steady pace  Helping others finish up Also on time
good,"was a good company to work for, keeps you fit, but now days it is a very stressful job as the demands are put on the driver are to much to get the work done, by driving a lot faster than you should be on the roads , made a lot of good friends in fedex for life,"
good,"Sometimes, a company will ask its employees to write their own performance reviews. Employers use these self-reviews to obtain the employee’s perspective on his or her performance. You shouldn’t be afraid of this exercise; it’s a chance to highlight what you’ve done well. It's very important that you showcase your work, achievements and performance in the best possible manner."
good,Good organization with good co-worker and a good organizational culture with work oriented boss who always think only for company profitability. but nice work environment
good,"Fed Ex was a good company to work for, it was just a bit too much of hard labor for me at the time so it wasn’t the type of employment I needed at that time"
good,Fast paced work environment where communication and staying on task is a must or you will spend much more time there than necessary. Though the turnover rate is high management does a good job at finding the right individuals for the job.
good,Very fast paced job. You have to keep yourself hydrated especially during summer. The managers there are very respectful and open if you was to have any trouble.
good,"Fast paced job with non stop moving for the entire shift. There was a lot of lifting of small, large, and heavy objects. The shift was spent loading or unloading packages."
good,Overall a really great place to work at and great people to be around. Would recommend anyone to work here that is willing to work and is able to lift packages with no problem.
good,"Typical day at work is to check schedule for Conference calls, go thru the first 300 emails,"
good,Great for benefits over time pay insurance and you can always work your way up in the company for pay increase and new job titles great discounts throughout the city and other cities
good,It is a good summer job for college students. If it's located close to your school they do provide tuition assistance. You can't be afraid to work hard though
good,"Most times reviews like this are done after someone quits or gets fired. I don’t fall into that category. The job like most others, is what you make it. It’s fast paced and dirty at times, but you know that going in. What makes it a great place to work for me, are, the people I work for and with. The environment that you help create and some of the best benefits you will ever find. This job isn’t for everyone, but, the people that last and thrive with Fedex, have OUTSTANDING experiences every day."
good,FedEx is a very fair company but they want you to work. They expect the sacrifice and it does pay off. Work and home life doesn't really have a balance. Accountability is required and improvement is expected without fail.
good,You stay busy all the time. And you work till the jobs done every day. Weather its 12 noon or 10 pm at night. You work in the heat and the in the rain
good,"good job good pay. has good benefits  along with good work environment. everyone treated good here, but have to like being on the phone. computer work also requires a lot"
good,"A typical day at work is pretty good. Go to the warehouse, get a brief on how many boxes we planned to receive, then we get straight to work. I Learned a lot about how deliveries work when it comes to ordering and receiving packages. The hardest part was trying to get all the packages out in time and the favorite part was learning a faster way to get the job done. Overall it was a good job."
good,"In spite of the bad management and pay rate, the company is a good world wide industry that do there job right and on time. Good job to work for if you willing to work more then 60hrs a week from 6am to 9pm Monday thru friday"
good,Contractor try to have you run to routes but only want to pay you for one. Great work environment. No benefits with the contractor I was working for but he's the only one that does that
good,It has helped me keep a good fit body it has made me feel offended friends and fellow co-workers that have provided inside both personal and professional however due to its non consistency I do have to move on to something that maintains it's hours under current circumstances
good,"begin your day by  coming to the station. gather all  your supplies and equipment, scan and sort all of  the documents and packages.Load your delivery truck for your route . checking with our dispatcher along the way"
good,Fast paced. Will give you all training and very important to follow the rules of that training. You can fire yourself by not showing up for work. good benefits for a part-time worker.
good,Everyone is kind to you and are great at helping out with something you don't know. A team effort job from unloading trucks and helping with packing crates.
good,"Everything goes by fast here. Depending on the area you're working in you really don't have time to look at the clock or stand around. That's what I like most about this job, considering shifts are about 4 hours long."
good,Fedex is a good company to work at. Good at promoting from within depending on your job. There are some dead end jobs in the company. Overall it is a good company. Good benefits .
good,I like working at fedex but the movement to get a promotion is slow. Have to be in with the managers to receive full time and or be there 3+ years. Pay is good but the hours arnt. So another part time job or if you’re up to it a full time.
good,"Fun place to work, good workout. The pay is better then most. It is very challenging. The hours very. Holidays off, paid time off. It is a great part time job."
good,"If you're looking to put in hard work for little pay, this is the job for you. Yes as a part time, you work only four hours for 13.75 an hour. Its not worth you're back hurting and getting beat up by boxes. To be fulltime, it's 14.75 an hour. The extra dollar wasn't worth it to me. Some section managers don't know how to manage properly."
good,"If was an opening at a teminal where I'm relocating I would not be leaving this company, My terminal manager tried all that he could to help me stay with the company"
good,I enjoyed working here and I learned a lot. I worked with wonderful people! I just feel that I need to be more challenged my next career move - and that is what I am looking for now.
good,"I had the chance to utilize my skills and grow, and gained unique experience. This job was a stepping stone for me for a greater future. I am a very hard worker and always eager to learn more."
good,It has been  honor to work for FedEx Trade. Benefits and flexible hours really worked for me and my family. Tuition for school helps a lot too. Training really keeps us up-to date in current changing technology an brokerage industry
good,It's a great place to work. The programs you need stay broken. The pay is horrible for the amount of work you have to do. It's also hard to advance. This may not be the case but I feel like some managers play favorites and of course the favorites advance quicker.
good,"I liked My job becauce I didn't have my boss looking over my shoulder. However it was long hours and jumping and running, very fast pace. I worked for various contractors, each route is owned by a contractor not by fedex."
good,Had to scan packages as they cam down the conveyor belt and load them into the correct truck to ensure customers would get their packages on time along with assisting my co-workers with their trucks.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of:"
good,"Began at the terminal at 6:30 and began to load trucks and about after an hour of doing this the truck would be loaded. At around 8:30 am left the terminal in the truck and began to deliver packages to the suburbs around Dover area.  The mangement would help load the trucks in the morning with us and would give me the itinerary of deliverance for the day.  Normally I would deliver to an area of northern new jersey for a week at a time and after a week I would deliver to a new area."
good,"UNLIMITED overtime! This place of business is No joke. It’s no secret that it’s Fast paced, it’s FedEx. Some departments are more difficult than others. Come prepared to work."
good,Good place to work out if wanting a work out! This was a quick pace environment meant for people who are willing to sweat and work really hard in hot conditions.
good,Talented group of professionals aimed at delivering business value through software development and investment in people and technology.  Working through a transition to Agile and cloud native patterns while trying to retire legacy patterns that do not meet the needs of the speed of change required by the business.
good,"Although the environment was very fast paced and a bit stressful at times, I was happy working for FedEx. They gave me as much work as I asked for, usually more."
good,"Working for FedEx really depends on your position, and what to expect for salary, culture, etc... "
good,"This job allowed me and helped me to focus on who and what is around me, and to always be aware of safety first. Me and my coworkers supported each other as if we were a family."
good,"the work is fast paced and at times frantic. It can and is unorganized a good portion of the time. They try to accommodate the work load, but it gets away from them."
good,The job requires ones to be a team worker and safety and security is very critcle to the performance of one's duties and assigned. To pay is weekly and the managers attention to detail is impeccable.
good,Working as a package handler is nice because you learn all different things about lifting packages only if you have a good time with you other wise it really hard when your trying to work alone. Management is kind of iffy.
good,its a fun place to work because its competitive place and a fast place work. the hardest part of the job is when there is a lot of packages coming in and it could get a little hectic. the most enjoyable part of the job is having a team member help you when you need it.
good,Friendly people that are willing to help train and educate you on the position you are working in. The eagerness of others to work as a team to achieve one common goal
good,"It was a OK place to work if you like that type of work.I got injured at work and now I can't do that type of work anymore. But it's not a bad job. If you can stand to be on your feet for three to five hours at a time, then it could be the job for you."
good,Fedex was pretty good place to work at. They are pretty relaxed on what you can wear. Some might say its hard work moving boxes that can be heavy but I saw it as a workout.
good,They were very lenient if you showed up late or had to call in. They were more hard on the numbers you made and the quality of work you did. Co-works age ranged very sporadically.
good,"I enjoy working at FedEx a lot, however I would enjoyed it more if they had not changed the hours due to lack of teamwork and management. The job I am required to do is very rewarding and satisfying."
good,"Great sales experience, poor management, great people within company, most likely have to move if you want to advance or get into management. Overall good experience with room to improve"
good,"Fedex was a good part time job. I know a couple people that have been there for a long time now, they are still struggling to make ends meet at their pay rate. If you need a second job or just something to help get by for a short time this is the place. They are always hiring during holidays and will pay good hours during the seasonal rush. Other than that it is a temporary job usually."
good,they are slow to respond to problems that arise the pay is really good hours varies due to business they are sympathetic when you needed to be injuries etc.
good,Use forklift to unload and load trailers. Early morning or afternoon hours. Part time mostly. Good starting pay with several raises in the first year. Hardest part of the day is having to recoop a trailer.
good,Some tasks are harder than others.  Unloading/loading  containers is heavy work. Management spends a lot of time on phone and rarely helps load/unload planes.  Whenever another crew was short staffed they would often  borrow  me.  They should rotate workers in each group weekly so that the same people aren't always doing the hard work.  Let the people pushing containers drive the tug or loader once a week.
good,Learned a lot working with them for 3yrs. The basic safety and additional training skills that helped me better myself self as an hard worker that can complete any task.
good,You are just a statistic if you make it to management. They do provide health insurance to everyone. Dependant on local management. Some service centers care and take care of their employees better than others.
good,"Even though I was a subcontractor, I had a very positive experience working with Fedex and the only reason left the company was because I had to relocate overseas."
good,"buena cultura laboral, prestaciones, ambiente de trabajo"
good,"work is very fast paced "
good,The drivers aren't given enough credit sometimes.  Getting to know them and appreciate the energy & the part they play in delivering customer satisfaction is what makes Fedex a great delivery service.
good,I really liked working here.  A typical day at work was a meeting in the morning and I would cold call and encourage customers to buy our products and organize meetings and oversee parts of the business.
good,Did not have assigned truck. Always had to show up an hour early in afternoon to wait for an am courier to arrive in order to get a truck. Very safety oriented.
good,The job is not easy and sometimes heavy but the company gives you a lot opportunities to grow. They have good benefits. It is difficult to change shifts because they give opportunities to those who have worked there longer.
good,"Fed Ex is a great job to work for a second job , the hours they keep you on average is no more than 20 hours per week about 5 hours per day.  Like the time off with family great family time."
good,FedEx was a great company to work for with plenty of advancement opportunities for hard workers!  Definitely a place to come if you have a positive can-do attitude!
good,Answering incoming calls from customers about anything Fedex. Can be very stressful with the many diverse types of people on the phone. Unrealistic management expectations.  Strict and firm policies on everything.
good,"A typical day at FedEx was very energetic and competitive , I've learned how to be more fast paced, management was pretty fair, the hardest part of the job was lifting heavy packages , and lastly what I enjoyed about the job was the opportunities I had and teamwork."
good,Fast pace physical work that requires teamwork to get the job done that day. Drivers are a blast to work with. Supervisors are understand laid back and easy to work with.
good,"Very fast paced and be prepared to be on your fight all day. Customer service and driving sales are a huge part of your daily tasks. Overall, fun place to work for a young adult."
good,l'ambiance est bonne même si le travail n'est pas toujours facile. L'équipe encadrante est souvent cool.
good,"I liked job at first, but the the compensation was not sufficient.  I worked long hours and was expected to keep adding more and more to the route, making family and workplace balance unacceptable."
good,"I did not always like the work or conditions at FedEx Smart Post but at least I knew or felt that bias was not the cause. Distribution is a rough environment and will tear you apart if you do not manage yourself. SmartPost was harsh but fair. However, due to the nature of the beast and me having a young family, I had to leave."
good,the days were short maybe 4 to 5 hours Monday through Friday. the pay wasnt all that great because of the hours. If tou can get good then the pay would probably be better.
good,You have to be a very motivated and healthy person who is willing to do whatever it takes in order to keep the customers happy and to be safe.  The days can be very long and stressful but you have to be dedicated to sacrifice your time with your family in order to complete your job every day
good,Must work fast and efficiently or you get swamped with packages. You get help occasionally or they stop the belt for you to catch up. The supervisors were great guys to work with.
good,I loved my job at FedEx. It is  very fast paced but in the long run you feel good about being able to complete your job and you do get rewarded for your hard work.
good,Management is really hit or miss. They will be your friend one minute and then the very next minute they are talking about you behind your back. No one is held accountable for the mistakes they make. Which makes the job more difficult.
good,Fedex ground in this station was an excellent experience. Team ethic was exceptional through teamwork and work load. Management was understanding and helpful.
good,Nice job to work at you get paid weekly and my hours were 4am to 8am and i got around $200-$220 per week no direct deposit though.Managers were relaxed and understood if you had a valid reason for being late or sick.
good,"The job is really great if you enjoy driving and working  by yourself. The biggest drawback is not having barely any benefits, it's really the only reason I'd quit working there."
good,"Overall i think working there for Fedex you must be a self-motivated, well fit individual and focused. The environment somedays can be stressful, but it you stay committed you can make it there. I loved the benefits."
good,"Clearing commodities through customs via input coordination"
good,"non climate controlled warehouse, worked in small packages, not very long shifts, good pay at 9.50 hourly to start"
good,"well rounded, training provided was decent , but it is a indutry where you must learn as you go. poor wok life balance as you are dealing with a international company, calls and emails at all hours"
good,good company to work for. good benefits and management.  unlimited overtime opportunities. tuition reimbursement and corporate perks. many advancement opportunities
good,Days were busy and productive. Learned a lot from the operations standpoint and met a lot of great people. Worked in all weather conditions and moved a lot of freight across the dock.
good,Working for Fed Ex I had to scan the packages in while the belt was moving. It taught me how to multi task and also different parts of Tallahassee and surrounding areas
good,"Loading at least 400 packages per hour into a cargo truck"
good,"É um empresa q gostei de trabalhar, mais como é uma prestadora d serviço a empresa onde prestavam serviço fechou. Tive q passa p outra empresa onde eles prestam serviço e nesse local não tive espaço."
good,I worked part time for 6 years for Fed Ex Freight.  Great pay and eventually I was able to get health insurance for a great price for my family.  Promotion can be tough.  The terminal manager is and odd duck.
good,This company has clearly gone down hill.  They have managers releasing employees before accessing what their contributions are.  The place is broken and Management needs to be replaced
good,I delivery to many home and government building and pick up .I love meeting new people and making the customers smile ...plus it's all hands on hands .
good,great work/life balance. this is a safety oriented company and it is always looking to improve the employee's work environment in a consistent basis very effectively.
good,"Fed Ex is an ok place to work. It has it's good and it's bad. some of the people are fine to work with. it's the type of job where if you come to work focused, you will succeed."
good,"FedEx has never been a family oriented company, they are a service driven company. They are focused on profit for the shareholders and executives, they always put profits ahead of the workforce culture. Most of the people who work at the company are great people on the non-management side, the workhorses of the company. So for as many years that I put in with the company I always thought we were under paid."
good,Tired of doing my job so well that I’m forced to do others who are lacking and nothing gets done about it. I love working here but I would love to be closer to home and somewhere that is fair.
good,Typical day have meeting about loads and where your going.  Learned how Fedex operate on getting people's items to them. Management were great and easy people to work for. Hardest part of job is fast movements on job with heavy duty items. Most enjoyable part of job is people.
good,"Mediocre work environment, sometimes with noticable effort lost. Also, very obvious signs of favortism shown to seniors from managers and supervisors."
good,Loved coming in at nights and working out for a few hours loading trucks. I enjoyed my time here and made some good friends. Management  was very respectful here unlike most places.
good,sorting parcels on a conveyor system and vehicle or trailer loading efficiently and securely. A conveyor system assists to sort parcels onto a vehicle or trailer in efficient and secure manner.
good,A competitive but slow paced work environment. Plenty of learning opportunities but they may be bit away from your profile so need to be proactive to learning new skills
good,a day starts with checking the load for accuracy and fixing any errors if any.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with the other cars on the road.
good,"I learned how to move at a fast pace to get packages delivered, while inside the federal express hub. I then transferred outside with fedex aircraft and learned how to work loaders and unload and load planes."
good,Fast paced and intense. You have to come in with the mindset of a boxer. I learned to pace myself while working quick and efficient rate. The hardest part was the total ware and tear.
good,"Fast paced, stressful, alot to learn. Wont follow the requested schedule when hired. I have not been getting a full 40 hours a week. Typical retail job"
good,"FedEx Ground involves a serious amount of physical labor, which includes but not limited to unloading and loading trailers efficiently and effectively within a time limit, sorting packages to designated areas, scanning packages and labeling them, transporting ICs via tugger certification."
good,"Quick paced, good if you like hard physical work. Room for advancement for the right candidate, work is part-time for package handlers. Tough on body, but the co- workers are nice {at least most of them)."
good,"Learned well about how to work and communicate with others, but was made to feel more stressed than I should have for such a job. They really focus a lot on your scan rates."
good,"everything you do is based on getting customers items delivered within a certain time period, must be able to manage time and be productive as to reach goals"
good,I would recommend FEDEX to anyone - however the ATW location lacks good management - always has. This is FEDEX corporation by the way - not to be confused with FEDEX Ground / Home which is a subcontracted service.
good,"its been over 10yrs since I've been with the company. My overall experience was satisfactory.  Being on the road for long periods time, I feel that the pay was not fair."
good,Very busy from start to finish. I learned a lot about transportation. Full-time supervisor great pay. Culture mostly black on the dock white in the office
good,"It's physically demand.You don't get breaks.It's ok if you can handle standing up for hours without a break.,The people there seem pretty cool.But it's only temp for me."
good,"typical day would be packing, scanning, loading trucks taping rip boxes making sure all packages are good and ready tom be ship out and deliver for customer satisfaction."
good,"Great placs to work at, you just have to be careful because it is also a dangerous place to work. You have to be aware at all times and it is very loud."
good,No real room to grow in the company. Good starting point for younger employees. Not very flexible with hours. Constant change me in the schedule. A lot of work on your feet
good,It was a great job to work at you could work and work out at the same time. The leadership was fair and offered hours often. A good place to learn new things.
good,Straightforward delivery job with decent pay and low stress most of the time. Peak season can be stressful and you have to work long hours. Job quality and pay depend on the contractor you work for.
good,Excelente empresa para trabalhar. focada no crescimento de seus funcionários.
good,Tiene buen ambiente de trabajo pero no hay muchas posibilidades de conseguir un mejor puesto dentro de esta misma.
good,I enjoyed working at FedEx. Even as it could be extremely fast paced there was a sense of team work. Managers cared about health and safety and took all precautions to ensure such safety
good,"I have a bad back so, I was moved around a lot so that I was constantly re-injured. Most employees are friendly, but there isn't much time for conversation. Shifts are 3.5-4 hours long with breaks in between. Being part-time you were required to work one shift but could return. full-time has to work at least 2 shifts. Raises were frequent at the beginning, however, they slow down pretty quickly."
good,"Fast paced. Easy work, managers leave you alone as long as you get your work done. Nobody goes home until all required paperwork for each package is completed."
good,worst place ever . managers were a pain in the butt and act like youre superman or something . they are not understanding at all . im glad and grateful i dont work there anymore .
good,I felt confident in my job duties. i did not need someone looking over my shoulder. I knew what had to be done and I did it. Fed Ex is a good company I just wish I had some form of advancement while I was there.
good,"Typical day"
good,"É uma empesa boa de se trabalhar, lá aprendi muito para a minha vida profissional."
good,"There is always new and improvements to help you do your job better. We work as teamplayers, We are will informed about your daily work load. Purple!!"
good,It is extremely fast-paced and your hours depends on their volume. The less packages that are worked in a day the less money you make. I have learned a lot while working at FedEx but I have also held different positions over the last 4 years that I have been there.
good,FedEx Freight is great place to work you just need to communicate with everyone and ask questions. Don't be lazy if your a fast pace person you can get more things finished faster.
good,"Um dos poucos pontos fracos é que usa o piso salarial para pagar os funcionários mais básicos e não existem benefícios para os funcionários, apenas as obrigações trabalhistas."
good,The department of Communications had a wonderful team environment. The most enjoyable part of a Sr. Communications Specialist position was the ability to work with Senior level executives.
good,I enjoyed working at FedEx Corps as a package handler. If you can work at a fast pace this the job for you. Although I didn't work there long do to an untold circumstance this was a good job to have. My only negative thing to say it that you may not work many hours.
good,"Buen ambiente laboral y trabajo en equipo,"
good,The fast paced work environment helped to provide me a great work out. I had no need to pay for a gym membership as long as i lifted boxes and worked with the proper and safe techniques.
good,"Overall my experience was good. However the turn-over on the management side can sometimes make it hard to keep motivated. Considering most operations require manual labor, having poor management can get hectic and time consuming."
good,I enjoyed working at Fed-Ex as an auditor.  Many of the other jobs are quite stressful and require an extremely quick pace.  You have to be able to lift and move packages quickly.
good,The environment was quick paced but with a high priority on safety and quality control. They were always looking to increase efficiency and maintain a positive moral.
good,the manager that was overseeing me hardly knew my name...so that entails... poor leadership which cause me to lose my job. for the months that I have worked there
good,"Me senti privilegiada ao trabalhar na Fedex, trouxe comigo boas experiências e pessoas com quem tive bom relacionamento de trabalho."
good,"This company is one of the best companies of its type.  While the advancement potential is very limited, the compensation is fair.  It is a great company to work at while going to school, especially since their college reimbursement covers up to $3000 in tuition expenses per year.  Just about any basic degree can be justified."
good,"A typical day consist of coming to work early before the employees to run reports from the previous day operations."
good,This was a great job fresh out of high school where the hours were good and the pay was great.  Sorting cargo off and on planes according to the zone charts.  It was fast paced and heavy lifting but it was good work.
good,FedEx can be a wonderful place to work for but customer service is a very hard and stressful job. People call and scream at you all day long. You have to also meet a call quota for the day. Very tense job.
good,"Helped people fill out shipping forms and shipped their packages for them.  I would also pack and ship items for people, and would custom make a box for larger items."
good,Great place to work and great environment . People surrounding you are happy and helpful . Team atmosphere and people friendly company policies that take care of you.
good,"Great job for many years. Unfortunately they have stopped doing performance evaluations, which has led to poor performance by employees. I experienced an unbalanced manager which led to more dominant personalities taking over our station."
good,"Overall, the job of delivery person is decent. As with any job, there are good things and bad but you learn to adjust to them. The people are generally nice and helpful. The hardest part of the job is learning to deal with the varying weather and traffic issues."
good,i worked at fedex ground in brooklyn ny started as sesanel then got hired but the hours were low and they had back brakeing work .unloading trucks is the worst
good,"Very, very stressful. Really love driving, but very low pay for the amount of time and stress you have to put up with. Very, very happy with the management(the best you'll ever find), but as i sad, the pay kind of low, for staying up to 10-11 hours a day"
good,"While it pays off handsomely to work at FedEx, you are held to very high and fast paced standards. You must have a strong work ethic and be able to work in a fast paced and always changing environment."
good,"I enjoyed FedEx very much, everyday was anew adventure. I typically would delivery over 100 stops a day. My customers and I had such a great relationship, filled with trust and loyalty. I learned to work hard and to not complain about how busy I was day to day, I would come into work and just go about my day. I loved all my customers I enjoyed their company each and every day. I left fedex to receive my CDL license which now enables me to make more money and feel more appreciated that Ive accomplished something more in life."
good,I love to work for fedex not as a temp but as company employed.Is a great place to work for  and a great company to grow at.I have applied a couple of time hoping to get a job.
good,"All your time is allocated to getting ready to work. Even when you get time off, communication problems caused issues when there were ""annual leave days"". Do not take this job unless you have reliable text and/or call services for your cellphone."
good,Great experience. I have learned a great deal of patients . It help you grow. I started there young and grew from the experience great people to work with
good,"A typical day at work would be loading trucks filled with packages from all over, i learned how to work well with others regardless if we had anything in common, the management treated the temps like they were nobodies but i learned to take it with a grain of salt, the workplace culture was kind of just quiet and monotone. The hardest part of the job was lifting heavy packages by yourself, honestly. The most enjoyable part of the job is exploring the warehouse when you have free time on your break"
good,Good job for a hard worker thats looking to work for a contractor. Hours are how fast u deliver in a safe manner (set pay/day). Applying for warehouse position would be great also.
good,"really stuffy and hot in the summer time but in the winter, recommend if they can control the weather climax then they should be ok to do this kinda of weather"
good,I get to work they tell me what I have to do for the day and I'm done before I know it and haven't really looked at the clock. Because it's very fast-paced and straight forward.
good,"Everyday is different, the company does care for its people, and has a fun culture, at least in the Pittsburgh office.  Inside Sales, so a lot of phone time and admin work."
good,"Good place to work. Employees are highly proficient at their task, honest,harmonious and pleasure to work with. The functions are quite diverse thus hardly room for monotony."
good,FedEx Is An Overall Good Place To Work If Your Looking For A Part Time Opportunity. Just Need More Workers and Better Managment To Make The Job Run Smoother.
good,"my was mainly unloading trucks i clocked in passed security  t was casual dress attire steel toe boats were definitely recommended"
good,"Fast paced company, that pays well and allows for advancement within the company. They work well with family and school schedules and if you're full time you get paid time off for holidays."
good,"there was no advancement, but definitely an easy place to work just have to do your job and thats it. you are outside all year round so you will have very hot days and very cold days."
good,"It's a very stable place of employment however job advancement in the company is commonly outsourced through external agencies. Other than that , I'd highly recommend them as great place of employment."
good,I was in charge of repackaging packages and loading trucks on occasion. It was fast-paced and I liked it because it was like getting paid to work out. You really keep yourself in shape working here. Safety is a big here. You must always be careful in how you handle packages.
good,Worked my way up through company to a regional management position. Then there was a company merger and a lot of the management was let go. Originally the work environment was great but became more adversarial towards the end.
good,"A fortune 500 company with many great things however, after being there for many years the compensation plan is not in par with the growth in ecomony. Great benefits but pay is lacking."
good,"I enjoyed working with customers to resolve issues related to their international packages. I audited United States Goods Returned, NAFTA and Federal Drug Administration cases.I learned a considerable amount about how items are classified, taxed and evaluated on their level of safety."
good,I loved being outdoors and driving my truck. I had great relationships with customers and seeing them everyday made both sides comfortable with each interaction.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is helping people.  The company overall participates in a lot of volunteer work for various non-profit organizations.  What I've learned is even after a busy day at work, you should take some time to give back to the less fortunate, therefore I make a habit of always volunteering when the opportunity presents itself."
good,"Enjoyed co workers, good environment to be in depending on position, limited advancement depending on your position and location, well know company offered fun newt working opp"
good,It was hard for opportunity to get a fulltime job. A hard fast pace workplace. Hot in the summer time and cold in the winter time. I was looking for another career. I start going back to school I finish in December of 2016. I worked multiple job a fedEx which was exciting.
good,"I informed the management at time of hire that I had 2 months of schooling/ training lined up two months after hire. I knew I would have to leave the work force to complete this. I ask if I could leave on good terms, complete training then return to the work force. I was promised to be rehired after I completed 2 months of work training. I did not get rehired."
good,Fedex is a cargo company of USA which takes the shipment for Europe country in a very short days time commitment and it charge also in low price staff of FedEx is very much cooperative
good,"Cool company"
good,"fedex is a great place to work, very easy job and easy to learn. The time i was there it was great, learned a lot there when i was there. The only thing i disliked was the weather and working outside during the seasons change."
good,It was a fast paced job. I worked in the city so it was usually crowded but I have patience and I continued to perform my duties. I delivered and picked up from many name brand stores.
good,Fedex Office was a great job for the most part. Steady work always paid on time and excellent benefits. One of the short comings was advancement and trainings. If i had to do it all over again however I probably would.
good,"It all depends on the job you have.  As long as you can get away from the back of a hot truck or warehouse, you will probably enjoy it.  I recommend working with aircraft on the ramp."
good,working for fed ex made me understand that packages being delivered should be handled with care because nobody wants their stuff harmed. if you're early to this job it benefits your energy entirely. being on your feet all day moving around keeps you healthy.
good,"I enjoyed my job at FedEx and would return if I was able to. I worked in induction and packing love my job was very good job."
good,The job as a package handler does not balance work and pay.  The opportunities for advancement seem to be misleading.  A general atmosphere of uncertainty and misinformation is apparent in management.
good,fun and fast pace work place you see a lot of the country and delivery a wide range of freight . great equipment and friendly fellow drivers out there with you
good,"A typical day would start by Sorting and scanning packages,loading your truck and preparing route."
good,"I guess this depends on which contractor you work for.  Contractors are different, pay different, and treat their employees different.  I've worked for some awesome contractors within FedEx, but then I've also worked for some contractors who don't know how to run a business.  Get to know who you're working for before you sign on."
good,"Boa cultura organizacional, diretrizes bem definidas."
good,"Foi uma ótima aprendizagem conhecer um pouco de produção,estoque,separação de produtos aprendi muito trabalhando nesta empresa.Tive a oportunidade de trabalhar um ano no recebimento de mercadorias lançando no sistema uma das coisas que mais gostei de fazer."
good,"This was a part-time position that I worked while I was looking for advancement and full-time employment.  Enjoyable working environment, nothing bad to say about my time spent working there."
good,highly fast paced job. learned a lot about organization and inventory matters. management team was pretty well organized. job got a bit tedious when the conveyor belts got jammed which slowed downed production quite a bit. enjoyed being used in the entire facility.
good,They are a great company to work for if you work for the corp. I worked for a sub contractor and we were not treated so fairly and pushed hardto be more productive so they could make more money
good,acquired great friends throughout the years...current manager is great...currently my drive is over an hour both ways so that is the only reason I'm looking for other employment.
good,una empresa donde puedes obtener mucha experiencia en las areas internacionales
good,"Empresa agradável para trabalhar , nada a reclamar "
good,"Early start, fast paced work environment, conducive to high-output in the workplace and on the road. Highly recommended for those individuals who seeking a high energy environment."
good,This job has been ok. It has always been my fall back job. It has come in handy when needed. The work is fast pace and tiring when finished. The hours are short part time but they will get the work out of you
good,Basically if you're in a management position your benefits and perks are much sweeter.  Coordinators are compensated minimally and the raises are very low every year.
good,To work at Fed X you must be up to speed. One day you may have a pile of packages and then the next you have nothing really to do much. Working here is like a gym work out everyday so if you are willing to lose a few pounds this is for you
good,"I enjoyed my time at FedEx. Upper management was great, but got worse the lower you went. They care little about you as a package handler. The job itself was not hard as long as you were able to work at pace."
good,Don't get me wrong FedEx is great but as long as you are physically up to it you get a 5 minute info meeting then are expected to toss 6 boxes per minute or 400 an hr into a trailer .. so that fedex a can get package s to people on time ... the pay is ok but don't expect to work more then 6 hrs a day..
good,Productive environment. And as a new employee I worked hard and that hard work paid off in no time. I moved up in the ranks pretty quickly and I was receiving more on my check
good,"Great Workout, Consistent Schedule, Shared Responsibility.  If you're looking for something part-time with a well known company with benefits this may be a great fit."
good,FedEx is the best company that I have worked for yet. Pay was very good for part time work. Hours were decent . FedEx worked well with my schedule. Management was good with communication as well.
good,I worked in the warehouse at night and it was rough. For 5 days a week I would unload the trailers and send the product up a conveying belt. The packages ranged from small 2 pound boxes to large motorcycle body frames.
good,"A typical was pretty easy, and hours were part time. Lots of sorting of packages. Hardest part would have been loading trailers fast enough as packages tend to come pretty quickly. Easiest part was unloading trailers and sorting packages on the sort tower."
good,"They have to work on their Database of kitting line, they have to revisit the supply of the inventory ( transfer gun system) . To make sure all initial phone are shipped before the new set no matter what the demand is."
good,"Plant manager told us 20 different things that sounded awesome . Zero of them true. High stress job but plenty of hours , to many !! My main problem was with the plant manager never speaking the truth. When Fedex supply chain took over Genco they never got rid of him and nothing changed"
good,Good training to work on the job. Salary is competitive. provision of work materials and tools are adequate. Good working environment between workforce and management.
good,"great company people service profit philosophy, a lot of  comarodarie amongst the people . good bebfits good pay.  very fast paced day moves quickly. meet a lot of people different every day"
good,"You get paid for doing cardio work out all day. Intense, fast paced, it is the only job that You are constantly moving non stop. Everyone their works as a team."
good,"●	Setting up and Dismantling tents for different events "
good,"Overall FedEx was a good work environment..majority of all employees maintain to safe work place able to work together are alone or when needed"
good,"The job was very easy, but was unable to work around a school schedule. I learned a lot dealing with locations and numbers. The management was okay, despite having some that over used their authority."
good,"Typically I would be micromanaged for the 3 hours a day I was there. We all walked in and had a sort meeting, of course I was treated the same or even worse then the people who where there late everyday."
good,it was productive and okay to work there..... The people were nice and you got paid weekly which is a decent amount of money to make per week. My manager was pretty awesome as well and i enjoyed bringing home money every week
good,HR policy not administered consistently across all subsidiaries. Very strong and strategic organization with competitive compensation packages. Benefits are competitive and above average.
good,"Work will be quite challenging at the start, but once you get into the swing of things, it's an experience. It might be over-stimulating to some people if you're coming from an independent desk job, but if you like being physically active, then you might enjoy it."
good,It was a fun and great experience to work for FedEx for the short amount of time I worked there. I wish it was longer but certain things restricted me from working there.
good,Great company but too many rules and those rules only applied to certain people. when you made a mistake you got crucified buy the shop manager unless you were his buddy that worked with him in a different company then you got awya with murder. Manager talked down to you like he was sign your pay check this is why I left.
good,There wasn't always enough work so some people were sent home. But overall the work environment is great. The only thing I didn't like is that whatever the weather is outside it's 10x's worse on he inside
good,"overall FedEx Grounds had Great benefits "
good,"This job is fast paced, very labor intensive, but also easy to do. It came along at the right time and was very convenient during this place in my life."
good,"Pretty good place to work and I loved it. I enjoyed the fast pace of things but it could get very tedious. The culture is upbeat and fun but the job can get fairly difficult. Once you get the hang of things, you don't even think about the job."
good,Good place to work. Bosses are very understanding. Very fast paced. You must be able to pick up large packages. Time flies by no matter what you are doing there.
good,"FedEx was a good company to work for over all.  You can transfer any where in the US.  Good benefits.  FedEx was built on a people philosophy, which most front line managers follow."
good,"good work, all relies on work ethic. you earn how hard you work. no complaints. That is all really!! You load early you get off early, SIMPLE AS THAT!"
good,"Each day you would show up, and load up your truck and plan your route accordingly.  Making sure you are delivering packages at the correct addresses, and making sure you arrive on time for any scheduled pick ups.  "
good,Delivery driver position working for a contractor contracted by FedEx.  You don't work for FedEx directly and you end up working long hours but great job to be out and about everyday.
good,Good work environment. Suitable for college students looking for part time work. Workplace culture is fantastic. Best part of the job is working with someone else.
good,Working for FedEx expanded my horizons and has allowed me opportunities I could not receive anywhere else. I would recommend this company to a young person starting out.
good,"empresa de alta performance de trabalho,dinâmica.."
good,"Great company to work for with competitive wages, Part time hours to start off, if that isn't an issue for some people. fast paced environment  and you develop a lot of skills as a person,"
good,A great company to work for. Wonderfull people and a great management team. Remarkable customer service. Treats employees with the utmost respect and attention to needs.
good,I enjoy working for FedEx Freight but being at the salvage center there is no opportunity to succeed or move up. The supervisors at my center could definitely make working there more enjoyable.
good,"multinacional, boa para adquirir experiencia."
good,It was fine until we were over worked. Things were going at a moderate pace then we were quickly expected to work faster than humanly possible or our hours subtracted
good,"FedEx needs to work on training the temporary people better. Its not a bad job, they need to work on mentoring and helping production get hire. Overall its pretty smooth when everyone can work together."
good,I have learned how to do a route fast and efficient. I also learned how to load and unload a truck safely. I learned a great deal since I started working with FedEx.
good,"it an ok job but not making my hours for a full time employee, easy to get hurt on the job and good work benefits but a hard job to get in to not for every body"
good,"Here also we have daily scrum meetings, and weekly sprints. Busy day with work but its always fun working in FedEx. It is the most enjoyable work area."
good,A typical work day for me would be starting my shift at 2:30 ending around 5:55pm. I learned how to deal with different attitudes from people on my route and my co-workers. The hardest part of my job is dealing with management. The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting new people.
good,"Great environment  laid back, teamwork, fast past! Business casual dress. No stress, Help is just the next cube away and it's free..."
good,Fiquei muito pouco tempo lá mas tinha uma boa amizade com meus colegas e com o meu responsavel.
good,I typically work during the day. I learn how things are done in the warehouse before it is is shipped. I enjoy the job i just wasn't able to work there for transportation issues
good,As long as you are willing to lift heavy boxes and pay attention to what zip code you are sending them to this is a fairly easy job. Management is nice and helpful.
good,"4.am until 9.am, 5hrs of just moving boxes. Easy work as long as you focus on the tasks. My group stayed at 96% we had to reach 93.5%. The people there are kind and love to get the job done."
good,"I thought this was going to be my last job. After almost 9 years, I had to leave. I was disqualified from driving for 3 years after getting 4 incidents in less then a year. The 4th incident was an actual wreck. This wreck was not my fault. I had to transfer to the dock as a part time worker because no full time was available. Because I have a mortgage, I needed to find a full time job."
good,"Responsible for the correct loading and unloading of freight for local supply chain deliveries "
good,I quit another job because I believed it would be more stable. Then I was dropped right after the New Year. The pay was good. I was advised that I should've signed paperwork with a contractor. I wish that would've happened.
good,"You must learn to handle customers who are focused on shipping and receiving their items on their schedule, in the event that their shipment is not where it is supposed to be."
good,I started off as a driver and managed to turn that experience into owning my own business as a contractor for fedex. Its a great place to work.
good,Great place to work for.  The people are nice and easy to get along with.  I've learned many things at this company.  They take a long time putting people on as a permanent employee.
good,I was a package handler at fed ex learning how to deal with all walks of life. It was very fast paced and I kept up with the pace of the environment. It was a lesson well learned
good,I liked my job and got along well with employees and co-workers. A couple of years under bad management was the deciding factor for me to change careers. But FedEx overall is a good company to work for.
good,I will Show up to work unload trailers if finished early i will help out an co-worker catch up if he slacking or do whatever the sort manager instructed me to do.
good,Its a great place to work and advance in the future. Great staff and workers to help with anything you need. Equal opportunity for everyone. Multiple eating places
good,"A very nice place to work.  Very clean, staff is friendly but not enough work. Staff is very helpful and the vehicles are new and clean and very easy to drive."
good,It was a Great and awesome experience . The work was very self explanatory and easy . All coworkers and supervisors were nice and always willing to help if you forgot how to do something.
good,"As a package handler at FedEx, I had to secure the correct packages off the conveyor belt and place it in it's designated area depending on his area code, inside its assigned truck, quickly."
good,FedEx was a great team to work with. The hours were short but it felt like a great work out every morning and was a good reason to wake up.  It was a great view behind the scenes on how they work locally.
good,Great company to work for. Great pay/benefits. Able to test your abilities in several areas. Gives you great work experience and skills that will be useful in any career
good,Great place to work part time but if you are looking to move up in a company fast this is not the job for you. The people I work with are great and I love most parts of my job
good,"The typical day at FedEx is a little tedious, but enjoyable overall. Coworkers and supervisors do a good job of trying to make things fun. Managers are very understandable and easy to talk to. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the packages that are to big or heavy to go upstairs for sorting, I usually enjoy these packages though because they offer a change of pace as well a challenge. The most enjoyable part of the job is that I can go into work for any shift to get extra money."
good,"good place to work. it has good benefits. a good job for students with part time hours. a lot of lifting involve. same job everyday, boxes and more boxes."
good,"I enjoyed this job. A typical day would be clock in and sort boxes into their assorted areas/ bins. Some days I would package, or would scan incoming and out-going packages. The hardest part for me was wrapping the pallets."
good,its a very fun and productive environment. i love the people i worked with and i loved the fact that i was always busy from the time i started to the time i got done with work
good,No Comment. I really don't have much to say other than my supervisor stays off my back. I have weekends off. And I get paid every week.
good,"i only worked here for a couple months, but in that time the experience was great.working here you get analytical and logically senses on how to work in the environment and learn to work fast but productively."
good,"Was and excellent work environment, offered benefits that were not very expensive yet had good coverage.  The fast paced work was meticulous and and at times tedious but enjoyable.  Lots of care and safety went into every day."
good,"bad"
good,"Had the pleasure of working for the freight industry and learned a lot."
good,Its an ok place to work but now that I have a wife and want a family it just doesn't pay enough and hove the hours I want to work
good,Day would start by everyone clocking in at the proper time. then we would gather around and have a safety meeting before the beginning of the day. then we would stretch and was assigned to a truck. then we began either packing the truck or loading the truck.
good,"The hours fluctuate a lot, making it hard to budget for living. As a part time job though, it pays pretty well and the benefits are decent. There is room to move up but you need a degree to get a management position."
good,I worked here during my high school days and cant really complain. They are a solid company who will work with you regarding furthering your education if that is what you desire.
good,"Spent the day loading/unloading trucks, taking inventory and keeping the warehouse clean and in order.  It was a fast paced environment, which is perfect for my work speed."
good,Overall it was a good experience. I would go back but it is hard to advance unless you are willing to relocate.  That was not in the cards for me.  Management is sold.
good,Delivered packages daily to customers. Loaded the truck each morning with packages for delivery. After the packages were delivered if there were any that needed to be picked up from residences I would pick them up.
good,"The day begins with scanning and loading packages into truck ."
good,never a down time which is great to me and love seeing my same customers daily and that their happy with my customer service
good,Hardwork but good pay.. not very many hours. the managers are really bad... you just go and throw boxes everywhere or load up a plane and go home...thats about it...not bad though
good,This a good place to work. The environment is either hot or cold based on the season. Most of the people are good to work with. They have high standard and it can be stressful if you aren't use to meeting goals.
good,I enjoyed working there. I learned how to work hard and how to help others and have others help me. Great staff and awesome coworkers.
good,The work day is tough but keeps me in shape. Coworkers are friendly and so is my boss. I get great benefits for having a part time job.
good,productive and fun environment. the most enjoyable part of the job is working outside with a team that works well together.
good,"in my time at fedex i started at 5am everyday, at this time I would load my van and plan my route for the day, when done I would set off following my planned route to deliver parcels to customers homes and businesses, though the day id receive collections I had to pick up aswell as pre booked collections, when finished I would go back to the depo for unloading of collections and other parcels I may have left over, once this is done I would be debriefed then I would finish usuall around 4.30pm"
good,The hardest part of the job is making sure the customers are happy and all their packages are their at the correct destination
good,"Great working environment. Medical benefit plans available after 90 days of employment even with the part-time positions. The hardest part of the job is during peak season, having to stack packages in T stacking. I enjoyed developing a good working relationship with managers and employees. Learned how to function in a fast pace environment, and make quick, precise, decisions."
good,"Co workers were very friendly and helpful. Good overall work environment and fast paced. The hours are what I enjoyed most, being able to work night shift and being able to have my entire day to run errands, be with family, etc."
good,was a pretty okay job didnt have enough hours to work. but other than that i liked my job for the most part. loved my manager reggie battle
good,"management was great learned  a lot with great coworkers "
good,"A typical day at work is very busy, ordering office supplies, greeting"
good,"the job was cool, they trained me on the forklift, and they cross trained me in other positions, i was able to learn a new position and able to apply for a permanent position, but unfortunately i wasn't chosen for the position with out explanation as to why i wasn't chosen."
good,"ótima empresa, sempre incentivando o funcionario a ir em frente com suas metas e disponibilizando melhoras,"
good,Fed-Ex Ground pays very well for CDL truck driving jobs. However it is completely built on a contractor system where you as a driver don’t actually work for Fed-Ex but rather for an independent contractor’s company and are only a number that is approved to haul Fed-Ex Freight. I did have very good relations and daily dealings with the dispatch and company employees. My biggest complaint of this company is the contractor system as if you are mistreated by a contractor there is zero recourse for you to through Fed-Ex but instead must take everything up through the labor board so the experiences can very from great to Horrible.
good,"Ok to work without having a manager look over your shoulders, you're on your own most of the day as a driver. Good pay and benefits"
good,"Started off loading and unloading planes to driving a tug to different inputs to dropping freight off, to tracking the times the planes lands in what area. The hardest part of the job was keeping track of the planes. Throughout my experience at FedEx I learned  to work as team and work well as team."
good,FedEx is a decent place to work. The job requires that you participate as part of team in order to reach a common goal. Job tasks require frequent lifting so it is suggested that you dress comfortably.
good,"Relance des clients"
good,I was able to meet new people that I learned a lot from. The hours were great as well as the pay. Couldn't ask for more in a company. Good benefits also. Great Insurance.
good,"I would come for role call and we would then stretch and pick up a scanner and then pick a truck. I learned how to pack a 18 wheeler truck. The management was helpful they started from our current position so they would often get in the trucks with us to help if someone needed. Co-workers were great as well everyone knew they were there to do their job and then leave. if anyone needed help it was given. The hardest part of the job was packing the trucks."
good,A typical day at work is scanning bar codes of packages then loading/unloading trucks in a very fast-paced environment. I've learned how to be a better team player.
good,"A Typical Day at Work: 3 hours of continuous lifting, bending, and making sure boxes went out on time."
good,"what I learned was good time management, my co-workers was very easy to get alone wit, the enjoyable part of the job was the people that I worked with."
good,"Would be excellent if the pay structure in different markets was more accommodating. Some markets the pay is great, some are average and some will have you in poverty such as the San Diego market. Should be comparable to the bay area or Irvine but is the same as the inland empire. Pay increases look to be heading in the right direction for the first time in a decade. Also the benefits are great but have increased a lot in cost in just a year. The hardest part of the job is during the holidays, it's very demanding. Long hours, six days, hardly any time with your loved ones. Unless your family is close by you'll never be able to travel to see them during the holidays. If you can become accustomed to those circumstances it's not a terrible place to work at all."
good,FAST PACED!! was able to do it when I was younger doubt that I can do it now. Its been awhile since I worked there. I'm sure things have changed since I was a driver.
good,"The good things"
good,Working at FedEx Smartpost was my very first job and it was a good way to make good money part time while I was in school. And during the time I worked there I found that it takes a lot of patience being in that industry.
good,decent pay.  However increesed weight of packages and unstable houres are why I am looking for employment elswhere.  They have alot of work and thus layoffs are not a worry
good,"I worked at FedEx for one year and I enjoyed working for that company, however I like to try myself on different positions and I seek everytime for new opportunities to develop myself. This is the reason why I made decision to move on."
good,"FedEx is a Package Handling, delivery, fulfillment company. They are used Globally and provide different forms of services with delivering consumer products."
good,"Great place to work if you love working with a team, and working alone.  The CEO really understands how to treat his employees, and knows that his employees are what keep his company thriving."
good,I'm a courier at FedEx Express and I load trucks and deliever time sensitave packages. I really enjoy working hands on with customers and seeing the excitement on their faces when I'm delivering a surprise package a birthday gift etc.
good,"This required commercial driver's license with ""Hazmat"" (hazardous materials) endorsement"
good,"I Love working here at FedEx everyone is pleasant caring and teachable. We all work together as a team player when in need without hesitation,"
good,"Iniciei para trabalhar em testes de decodificadores e após  (dois) meses mudei para o setor fiscal, aprendi a fazer os testes dos mesmo do inicio ao fim (pronto para enviar ao cliente), etiquetar chips, emitir nota fiscal eletrônica, distribuir notas para emissões e me comunicar melhor com clientes, na minha opinião o inicio do trabalho é o mais dificil pois ainda você não tem a confiança do que está fazendo mas, com o tempo fica tranquilo e agradável, sempre me dei bem com meu setor e com os demais também."
good,"Some times I would unload in bound trucks, some times they may have me load trucks for delivery, and other times they might have me sort in several different circumstances."
good,At this workplace I must say I've learned various valuable skills. I learned how to become a better team player and always putting in my full effort to get the job done. Also I am more responsible as an individual being to work on time and handing things on my own.
good,"This was a busy, physically active job that I enjoyed spring, summer, and fall. Winter was difficult because of the weather and road conditions, but was still overall ok. The staff were friendly and co-workers worked together as a team, often helping each other out. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the snowy/icy roads. The most enjoyable part was being able to be outside during mild weather."
good,"It is a warehouse job, but at least the higher ups are pretty nice. You mostly sort packages coming into the warehouse to send them closer to their intended destination."
good,"Fast pace work environment, great Co-workers, and the pay is not that great for the amount of work involved.  long hours and lots of monitoring."
good,I liked this job because it helped me learn about different insects and rodents and what helps get rid of them and what certain chemicals to use. Most of all it helped me reduce my fear of rodents and certain type of bugs.
good,Station and company are very good to work for. Corporate does not stand behind mid level management and does not care about individuals.
good,"A typical day at FedEx Freight would probably be long, cold, and full of challenges."
good,"Overall a good job enjoyed people and work place"
good,"the job is very physically and mentally challenging, rather like playing a giant game of Tetris. If you've got the required level of fitness to keep up I highly recommend the job"
good,"I logged in through the SAP program at my station. I made sure the customers order was in good condition before shipping. I also packed, taped, and labeled the package."
good,"It was a fun, safe  productive place to work. Time management and benefits are good. Working there was a good place to work."
good,is a good company and great personal. i've learned in all areas with very good peformance. i fell comfortable with the treatment of supervisor and maneger.
good,"On a typical day we would come and either get assigned to the trucks or floor, then we gathered our teams, and started the day loading trucks and pallets. That would last about two hours, then we go on lunch, maybe work an hour or two after lunch, and then go home. Was a temp job, so there wasn't that many hours available."
good,"Hours never secure, supervisor not around to check employees, fast pace.Seeking full time and permanent placement.But so far I would apply at company because good benefits."
good,This is for fedex express  great place if you  like fast pace work.  work there for 3 months get great benefits.  take all classes if you want to work outside with the airplanes but do not i repeat do not have a felony record like i did it wasnt on record at the time of my hiring then had my court date and the United States Postal Service sent a letter to fedex express saying they would not give me a security clearance cause the united states mail also goes through fedex and u will not even be called.  but people were nice and help you get your job done.  i do miss working for them cause im an airplane nut love airplanes
good,Day consisted of serving customers and checking stock. Would make sure food supply was not running low. Would work in different stands on different weekends depending on where I was needed.
good,"a typical day at work will be, i come in get my manifest. The manifest explains were i will be working at and also gives a description about everything having to do with that trailer. what i learned at fedex is to be safe and don't work harder, work smarter. The management was good in certain areas. Overall i loved my co-workers, everyone had good hospitality besides the people that hate there life and come to work everyday mad at the world. The hardest part of the job would have to be sometimes trying to make certain objects fit into the trailers. The most enjoyable part of the job had to be me working hard  outside spotting, moving trailers around"
good,have x amount of deliveries with x amount of time with x amount of pickups on a daily basis. Interaction with customers on a daily basis.
good,"My typical night at Fedex starts around 11 o'clock when sort starts.. My current job is Checker/Non-Conveyable handler, so that means most nights I am scanning freight & filling cans to go on plans for transport or unloading carts of freight that is either too large or odd shaped so it cannot safely be placed on the conveyor belt. The work isn't bad if you dont mind the heavy lifting, I would recommend anyone looking for quick employment & the chance to make more money & move up in a company quickly get a job at Fedex."
good,"Really great place to work part time. Good workers were recognized, strict but still enjoyable work environment. Management was not lazy, or overbearing. Only complaint is the four hour shifts. It works for some people, but for me it was not appealing."
good,"Overall Fedexground is a great company to work for, ops management could be more professional in my opinion.  They expect a lot from package handlers especially when scanning packages but will not provide us the tools to do so, ie broken scanners, scanners not working properly/"
good,This company allows you to work at your own pace. Great opportunity for someone who enjoys driving in any weather condition.
good,"Work there just for a couple of months, it was a job for when I was looking for a full time job.  Had great benefits for part time workers, and it was a night job"
good,"this job requires you to adapt to the surroundings very quickly. it will be hot , cold climate. You will do alot of hard labor but you get use to it."
good,This job is very demanding and physical job. You have to be in great shape to do it. The job was very simple but the conditions were very rough and the weather did not help.
good,Very team oriented workplace that takes very good care of its employees. They really show that they appreciate the work you put into their company.
good,delivering freight to different fedex terminals at a timely matter  and also loading an unloading freight safety securing it
good,"-management made employees feel important and truly cared "
good,While working at FedEx you'll experience steady working hours and a physical job that will keep you on your feet for hours.
good,make sure that I load and unload items on the trucks to make sure that they are going to the right company. People would tell me that I was always willing to work no matter what is going on.
good,"very fast pace work environment, capable of moving up into management, excellent health benefits, and pay. Company has Very low tolerance on attendance policy."
good,"Installed cable and internet. Troubleshoot problems, and insure top customer service. Difficult climbing poles and making sales. Great benefits and salary"
good,"Overall it was great, got to talk to other drivers while loading our trucks then listened to the radio all day while delivering till the day was done."
good,Overall a good company to work for. Come to work do your job go home. If you are looking for a company with an abundance of advancement opportunity FedEx provides that opportunity.
good,I really enjoying working at Fedex although tyhere is never new excitement there are great benefits and great relocating opportunities.
good,"Always busy, the only way to get the job done is if you work as a team. If you show leadership skills, management will offer you opportunities to further grow you career."
good,A typical day at work includes physically loading/unloading materials in an efficient manner.  I load/unload packages in a fast paced environment to deliver packages on time and with care.
good,"Working for fedex is fun and is a very fast paced environment, its a hands on job the requires a lot of physical moving. Many co-workers including myself enjoy a team work environment that helps and lets everyone advance."
good,Fed Ex Was a good job to have routine everyday and was quick past. i liked it and liked the hours i worked. the people were nice and weekly pay was nice. a great lil part time job.
good,"A day at FedEx we came in and got to work, started unloading the trucks, sometimes if someone was in the truck with us we would converse but really we just unloaded the trucks. It was very fast paced"
good,"My managers are willing to be as flexible as they can with me, helping me to balance my schedule with two other part-time jobs.  "
good,"strong growth potentials, learned management skills, great benefits, for the most part a good work place, you gain great work friendly relationships with co-workers"
good,Not a bad place to work. Management and all upper staff are easy to talk to.  The company made sure that every driver knew about the importance of safety and has weekly meetings just on this topic alone.
good,This company is a great company to work for.  They really take care of their employess with their pay structure and benefit package.  The only thing that I did not like was that it was extremely tough to get a full time position.
good,its a good part time job it is not much room to grow in the company. They have there picks on who they are going to hire. The only thing i miss about the job is the benefits.
good,"make sure no one is absent. talk to employees/drivers ask how there doing, how heavy they are, what there day looks like, etc "
good,"I enjoyed the type of work that was involved, such as helping the drivers with the needs they had, assisting customers and making sure they received their packages on time and at the correct location."
good,The only bad thing is they forget the employees that actually make a difference.. And focus all the attention on the lazy people.
good,"The FedEx station that I worked at was small (AUN out of Rocklin, CA) which I liked. Everyone seemed like family. I started as a package handler off site but within a few months, I was back at the station and doing a multitude of jobs. I enjoyed being given the opportunity to switch between package handling to administrative to miscellaneous warehouse staff. I was actually amazed that management was so open to providing these types of opportunities to their employees. Within in my first 14 months with the company, I was promoted to a courier, which was, as I was told, pretty close to impossible at this station. All job positions were based on seniority. The majority of employees at this station had a few years in with the company. "
good,"Deliver and pick up packages."
good,"Strong team, fast and efficient. Handles packages with care, and great time management. The team I work with are hard workers, competitive and proud."
good,Typical day would start with ensuring the load quality of your truck. Leave terminal drive to route begin delivery and pick ups in a very timely schedule. Learned to never become complacent or people could easily get hurt. Customer service skills were key good relationships with everyone I would come in contact with. Hardest part of job was winters in trucks with minimal heat and getting stuck in the snow.
good,I enjoyed working for the company while i was in college. They were a decent company to work for. I gained a few great friends from this business
good,Great job for a single person willing to work long hours. Job is good but the hours are long. Hard for a family person to work the hours.
good,"The hardest part of the job, was myself complaining about everything, but I am thankful that God has changed me. My managers were patient with me, though they did not need to be."
good,A typical day would begin with me clocking in and stretching with the rest of my coworkers. Then management would go over of the goals for the the day and we would begin working. The hardest part was the sheer number of trucks we got but it was worth it when you finally finished the last truck.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job, in my opinion, is getting to talk to many people on a daily basis. I love meeting people and I love helping people. This job gives me many opportunities to meet and help people daily."
good,Fedex Home Delivery taught me a little of logistics in warehouse and shipment of packages. Is hard work to deliver packages especially when the weather does not helps out. But besides the weather it keeps you busy and in shape.
good,"Upon arrival at work, loaded vehicle, plan geographical area, and inspected vehicle.  Once all items were loaded delivered to Henderson, Webster, and Hopkins Counties. Also responsible for pick up of items at certain times during the day."
good,"Three different shifts available. Night shift is best for college students. Clock in and get to work unloading freight trailers. In the beginning, unloading trailers with hand operated pallet jack, after some time. Forklift certification is achieved and then unloading with propane powered forklift."
good,"Review of productivity and safety concerns.  Reminders of safety, stretching, and staying hydrated.   I've learned to be flexible in the workplace, willing to learn new things just in case I'm called upon to substitute in someone's absence.  Management was always available to communication.  Most co-workers were willing to help out when needed. The hardest part of the job was getting use to the fast-paced environment.  The most enjoyable part of the job was learning different stations and being complimented on jobs well-done as a team and individually."
good,The company is a loyal one but at the moment the management could improve. There are some managers that try to make the difference but there is a need for more managers like them to continue to better the company.
good,Working in most departments at FedEx can be very enjoyable. Strong customer service focus. Fast paced but fun. Days at FedEx go by very quickly.
good,Overall great place to work. Had to put in long hours some weeks but had every weekend off. Benefits were second to none. Started as a package handler and got my first promotion to management after two years. Great place to start a career.
good,Really fun and exciting job. Everything moves around so fast. I loved the rush of getting down to 2 to 3 minutes of a departure time. Never had a delay.
good,"Company grew at an alarming rate that was hard to keep up with, but we did. Seemed to be on top of employee hours and maximizing productivity."
good,"A typical day at work would be show up at 3 am, and get right to work unloading trucks from back to front and top to bottom. I learned alot while working there. Management was great. My co-workers were fun to work with and be around. The hardest part of the job was the time of morning we had to be there but overall it was very manageable."
good,"The daily sort consisted of several departments working together to complete the job. The sort was managed extremely well. I was trained in the yard switcher, forklift, shipping & receiving and sorting."
good,"I enjoyed working there. the workplace was friendly, the co-workers were easy to get along with, the hard work kept me in shape and I just so happen to be a redskins fan so it was great to be in the facility on game days."
good,I have been with FedEx over 12 years. It is a good company with good benefits. I have learned a lot in my tenure here. I've always enjoyed the people I work with and their dedication to good work and ethics.
good,Always enjoyed my time at FedEx. This is a physically demanding job but the company takes care of their employees and there is plenty of opprtunity for advancement.
good,it was a fun job to have and a good work schedule not to hard of work but u have to commit yourself.I work hard and unload all my trucks take me a nice break and im going help some other workers.
good,"Completed"
good,A typical day with them was always challenging because my co-workers and I did not know how much production we were able to handle and finish. So it was always like a surprise. I learned how to scan merchandise with FeDex equipment and I think that was the best part of all because I enjoy working with computerized devices. Management did need a little more improvement and co-workers did need to learn a little more on how to work in a team. Overall this was an exciting opportunity for me.
good,"start the day off by loading my trunk with packages. everyday i learn different address everyday all day. Management stays on top the workers about right address, package counts.Co-workers are great help with preparing my truck and giving direction. hardest part is working in weather. Enjoyable part of of my job is interacting with people."
good,"I was always in and out if my truck"
good,Work was great.. I learned how to Load Trucks the proper way as well as Lifting heavy boxes appropriately. Management was pretty cool along with co-workers. Hardest part of work was the fast pace loading an unloading trucks but i will say because it was a busy environment my hours at work passed by very quick!!
good,"Error Correction System was used to correct the errors raised in shipments during billings. It handles international and domestic shipping. Error correction will provide the ability for an administrative user to view transactions and reassign one users work to another user by selecting tracking number, page search by tracking number filter by origin country code and much other functionality."
good,"There are a lot of great people who work for this company.  There are so many different branches that allows you to choose what type of job you want to do, whether it involves heavy lifting, driving, clerk or office duties."
good,": Error Correction System was used to correct the errors raised in shipments during billings. It handles international and domestic shipping.

good,i workd at fed for a long i gained a lot of skills from that place and would not mine working there again i realy lreaned what the meaning of what a team means
good,Overall i enjoyed working with Fedex because it was easy work but at times i would get fraustrated because of all the packages we had to unload.
good,"I know and understand that in life we all must work hard to get somewhere in life, and i just want an opportunity to work to show what I'm capable of. Im always ready to work, not lazy and responsible on my daily work routine. I can work with other, and i love it. For me the hardest part of the job is the protection of me and my fellow co workers, and try my best to be safe for me and everyone else. I love working security because this it the field where I've always enjoyed protecting property and i love helping people and communicating with them."
good,"Busy days"
good,"My job keeps me in shape,plenty of physical work,and the ever changing technology.Carrying the company logo everywhere you go, your level of professionalism is always on display.The right attitude,and outstanding service is whats most important."
good,"get to work do my pre trip inspection ,I learn how to work in different types of inclement weather ,management is great cause I do my job, my co workers are very good, working in the inclement weather, working for myself."
good,"A typical day at work would generally be delivery between 80 - 100 parcels within around 6 hours however this included driving to the destinations, even though I personally wasn't driving. From working within FedEx I further enhanced my customer service skills as well as improving my time management skills and understanding the basic routine of the job. I was only on a temporary role so didn't meet the management team as this wasn't necessary however the team leader for my delivery round was also my co-worker and he helped me feel comfortable to the working environment within the first few days. The hardest part of the job is probably the amount of parcels that have to be delivered within a set time, this is because they can vary but also some customers make it difficult to find their location as they don't clearly specify their address. However apart from that the most enjoyable part of the job for me personally was meeting and greeting the customers as I enjoy working with people."
good,scanned item and sorted to correct location. unloaded and loaded trucks in a fast pace environment. also assisted other workers if needed
good,"Unload truck after truck, 1000 boxer per hour. I learned to self motivate myself to finish alot of big jobs alone. Co workers mainly minded their business trying to complete their own work."
good,"Good experience, good coworkers, people are kind and helpful. company offers amazing benefits but fails to add a strategic connection to company goals. Employees seem overworked at times."
good,"Very professional, friendly and productive environment. Most enjoyable part of the job is to deal with sales, finance teams and working together to propose the best pricing solutions to the clients."
good,Fed ex isn't a bad company to work for it just is very taxing on your body and very hot or very cold there wasn't much of an inbetween. they also give you ample opportunitys to excel in the company.
good,"My daily work tasks were: Loading my vehicle with parcels of a morning, delivering goods to a vast area of London and the collection of goods from businesses of an afternoon, to be returned to the depot. I learnt the roads of south east London off by heart, and how to work in a time pressurised role. The most enjoyable part of my job was the fact that every day was different and that I got to work in a wide ranging area, and see and learn so much each day."
good,"Management Support is awesome! The work is very physical and my co-workers are very supportive and the managers are awesome!"
good,Over all its a job that I can balance with school for the time being. there are only two set shift that you can work. I think its an ok job to have  you can handle the work load.
good,"This is a good company to work for if you are a hard working person. Management is easy understanding. Its like a family, everyone knows everyone."
good,"Typical day as a courier consisted of inspecting my vehicle for road worthiness. Scanning and loading packages,and letters for delivery. Delivering and picking up packages and letters. I learned how to prioritize and manage my time. Management was supportive and helpful. My co-workers were also helpful , for the most part. The hardest part of my job was traffic and people that didn't have good driving skills. The most enjoyable part was delivering packages, like flowers, and seeing the joy that the receivers felt."
good,"I worked at FedEx in the evenings for a second job.  The work wasn't bad, just a little physical. Nice pay for a part time gig."
good,"the one here in San Antonio was ok but when your that big i belive they lost focus on the employees especially the part-timers we wouldnt get the same benefits as the full- time guys this goes for FedEx as a company they used us to complete there goals without reward or compenesation. as far as the one in Tampa Fl it was a lot smaller place but with the same treatment if not worse. there was and is still a lot of intimidation from the management, you work in fear of for your job everyday especially the part-timers We were held to a different standard then the full-timers, we all did the same job basically except drive,I understand the difference in the pay rate but at least we could have been getting the same benefits such as paid vacations, getting paid holidays.All we would get was 1 hr of P.T.O for every 50 to 100 hrs worked. even people like me who had been with them for 9 yrs who was there during the lay offs and stuck with them got pushed for aside full-time because of favoritism within the management. I could go on but my you get the picture. FedEx is a great company but it would be better if it took care of all its employees the same."
good,"Enjoy meeting and establishing new relationships with all of my customers. To be able to know customers and they know me is something I look forward to when I begin each work day. I take pride in letting them see my outgoing personality - making them feel comfortable with me to fully appreciate the short, but interactive time we have."
good,"Speed, accuracy, strength. This job requires a lot of stamina. Once ""in the swing of things"" it was a flow."
good,"I've worked with FedEx for a little over 26 years. I have worked in different customer service positions gaining experience which has been beneficial to me in not only allowing me to become one of the"
good,FedEx was an excellent work environment for me first starting out in the workforce. I learned how to work effectively on a team as well as attention to detail. The work was physically demanding so i kept in excellent shape.
good,"A typical day at work is varied but will always include contact with customers, data input, reviewing customs entries for accuracy and confirmation of licences for products being shipped in. "
good,"I load vans for distribution to customers. Learned some organizational skills, addresses and routes. Management is cut and dry, some issues but nothing serious. The system used to provide data about what trucks have had packages scanned to is decent but not perfect. Hardest part of the job is heavy lifting of 100-150 lb packages with little to no help. The easiest part is it is only a part time job 3-4hrs a day."
good,"Friendly, fun and team work environment. The most enjoyable part of the day was making sure the packages ended up in the proper areas to make it to their final destinations."
good,"It was good, alot of heavy lifting it was like i was in boot camp for a few months. It has taught me discipline, and hard working skills. the co-workers were great, and funny. The hardest thing was lifting the boxes repetitively. Due to that it cause me to have Carpal Tunnel.That was the; main reason I've resigned due to Carpal Tunnel."
good,"•	Advised clients on risk management and helped to devise new ways to mitigate risks, provided technical and analytical support based on clients’ conditions."
good,Everyday is an adventure and brings it's own set of challenges; facing them and working together as a team is critical to having a successful day. Through the 4 years I have been part of this company I have gained a lot of knowledge and have learned how to make the most success out of my own and others opportunities.
good,"Very Fast Paced, flexible schedule, great for college students looking to work part time. the added tuition programs are very helpful."
good,It is an overall fast paced job with various tasks. One day I can be palletizing parcels onto pallets as they come down the belt. The next day I could be staging pallets getting them ready to get shipped out with the drivers. Management has 2 different mangers per shift called dock managers. The logistic managers all work inside the office and deal with the more technical things. Hardest part of the job would be having to accommodate with labor command in the sense of who is in charge of keeping the flow of the freight coming down to be palletized. The most enjoyable part of the job is having the opportunity to do different tasks rather than the same one every day of the work week.
good,I enjoyed working at FedEx. It was hard work but kept me in shape and showed that hard work pays off. The toughest part was around Christmas.
good,Great job for someone young or someone who needs and extra job. You can start out as a delivery driver which is the easiest way to be hired.
good,"i loved this job also days went by pretty fast, because we were constantly moving not what i wanted to do for work but i did find joy in this job also"
good,i would go to work and do many things at once that what probably the hardest part. I also learn alot of things about the company and its very healthy products.
good,"I work Tuesday through Saturday at FedEx. I scan and label the packages at the unload.The labels i put on the boxes and used to sort the packages for the drivers. Our sort manager is very helpful with the morning sort. All the co-workers get along pretty good, we have a good crew at the moment. I think the hardest part is getting up at 3 am to start the day at FedEx."
good,"Loved the work hated the hours.  Pickup and delivered customers packages. Support to customers on any issues regarding features of services, while complying with all operational, security and safety policies, procedures and processes with the objective of meeting service commitments and maximizing customer satisfaction. I worked closely with account sales executives to increase incremental volume and create new customer accounts via the LeadON program. Streamlining processes to assist and aid in the continual improvement of operations."
good,"FedEx is a good company to work for, although it is in a difficult and challenging time in the industry.  Great people who have worked with the company for years are good resources."
good,I started my day by doing daily stand up meetings as a part of Agile. I shared my views with my other co workers. I  wrote test cases and tracked defects. I loved my co workers. The most enjoyable part of the job was i got a chance to learn a alot of things.
good,"I love working here at FedEx freight I have experienced from working with other freight companies FedEx is the best, benefits are great people here I work with are great, the only problem I see is not enough hours 40hrs a week average so if you have a job that provides more hours than that I recommend for you to stay there because hours are hard to come by due to so many drivers on board but then again I forgot to mention I  just recently started here so I'm not even at top pay yet"
good,Empresa boa de se estabilizar e adquirir conhecimentos e promocoes. Somente melhorar adm e gerencia!
good,"Ótima empresa, so precisa melhorar administração e gerencia! Com oportunidades boas e rápido crescimento pra quem tem serviço e pro atividade!"
good,Working at FedEx as a package handler requires you to work at a fast pace while maintaining a high quality of work. Working at the pace that is required is the hardest part of the job. The companies does push safety as the top concern but speed and efficiency always seem more important during work shifts.
good,"Working as a temp, they don't act like you actually work for them. Most of the time they would forget to include me in emails and I wouldn't know what was going on. But everyone is really nice here and the office is usually quiet."
good,"Very comfortable management team, accommodated needs upon request. However workplace could have been more professional and business orientated within the facility."
good,"la journée typique commence par le tri de la tournée, le classement de celle ci "
good,stressful environment. I liked my coworkers didn't agree with alot of things.Had to be good at handling various situations. Multi-tasking was very important. Understanding the needs of others.
good,"Starting at 4:a.m. Tuesday-Saturday, Learning proper placement of items being removed from one truck to another. Having a good working relationship with management and co-workers and drivers. The hardest part of the job is the physical labor that is involved but /the of pride of a job well done."
good,"Fed Ex Ground warehouse is a fun place to work. As it goes with any job at first it is a little hard to begin with but it's nothing one can't handle. Within the first 3 weeks you already feel like a part of the family. "
good,This was a great company to work for. I gained a lot of knowledge and experience which have left me with numerous tools under my belt. Their training techniques were head on as far as our import department was concerned. I also had the opportunity to meet some very talented and wonderful people from here.
good,"As a package handler, I loaded and unloaded trucks, bagged small packages and preformed quality assurance. Although this company often showed favortism toward some employees, it is certainly a great job if you are looking to drop a few pounds."
good,"this is a good company to work in however, you need tough skin as management force numbers and asking personnel to do impossible tasks such as take 20 to 30 to get back to station with traffic etc."
good,"Ship packages, work on traces"
good,I had a great time working for them and enjoyed working with my co-workers.
good,My day as a delivery driver. I would load my truck according to how I want to work my route. Head out on the road and start delivering and interacting with customers.
good,"Everyday six days a week I would get to the warehouse with everybody else 2am sharp and we would be there until all the packages were loaded onto trucks/trailers. I learned how to improve my organization skills and get things done as quickly as possible. Management was nice overall and treated everybody equally, and made sure we were always working at our best. I loved my co workers because they were all there to do the same thing, and we leveled with one another and were able to maintain positive attitudes throughout the morning regardless of how stressful or hard the work was. The hardest part about the job was how physically demanding it was, if you had a hard time lifting things and be quick about, the job was probably not for you."
good,"Arrive at the terminal around 6:30am to organize and load truck by order of stop. Boxes weighing anywhere from 1-120+ lbs. Ever box is accounted for via my electronic scanner. Driver and I then leave to deliver. I navigate and run packages to the door ensuring the information correctly corresponds. Talking with customers and making sure they are happy with their service. Hardest part of the job is the seasonal hours, and weather. The most enjoyable part is every day is different. I learned to work more fast paced with paperwork and electronics in a work environment."
good,Provided customer services to clients in a proper timely manner. Long hours and worked in all weather conditions
good,"Never a shortage of work, and very fast paced.  Great co-workers and management team."
good,"Lots of driving."
good,seeing fellow drivers in terminal in a.m. (brothers and sisters in arms so to speak) resorting load dispatching adhering to all safety regulations and executing all tasks in compliance with d.o.t. requirements. Providing quality customer service and engaging with customer base. maintaining rigorous pace to ensure delivery and pick up schedule requirements are met. Most difficult part of job mechanical failures and inclement weather. Most enjoyable is ability to work independent of supervision and being successful and of course the people the large customer base and many personalities and characters you encounter on the daily basis
good,A typical day at fedex clock-in get to your station/door stack packages as fast &neat as possible. At fedex i learned how to organize &build walls using boxs.
good,I have been with FedEx for over 20 years.  Very good company to work for.
good,"A typical day at work for me is sorting packages from the belt to the trucks. The hardest part of the job is it not being a full time position, and not having a set time to get off. The most enjoyable part of the job is my co-workers."
good,"Meeting clients"
good,I would say the reason I most enjoy about working at FedEx Smart Post is the amount of moving around I get to do. Staying on my toes.
good,"My job duties: Complete cash discrepancy and document Trends Reports that detail cash discrepancies at over 700 FedEx locations.  Receive, process, post and research company for revenue and refunds. Update and upload reports to the company intranet. Maintain A/R, A/P and billing for over 200 accounts and assisted with payroll for up to 25 employee.  Billed vendors, vouched and reconciled monthly bank statement. "
good,Enthusiastic work place that offered great work place ethics
good,"Only hired for part time. Lots of workers have been there well over a year, never being offered full time."
good,"I enjoy it somewhat, the employees there are alright I've never had a problem"
good,great company to grow in. there are many different position where yo can learn new skills.
good,"I drove forklift, loaded and unloaded freight. If freight was damaged then i would recoup and restock the skids in order for them to be acceptable for delivery."
good,"Go to work about 21:30.  Pick up my bills.  Take my trailers to the destination. Work the dock for about 4-5 hours.  Get called by dispatch, collect my bills & head back home."
good,"While I was working at fedEx ground, I went from being a package Handler to being lead package handler, then being trained as a manager all within a few months. I had a few accidents while working there and was taken care of. It wasn't until it became a hostile work place that I decided to leave. For the benefits, i can't really say much considering i didn't use them, I don't even remember what they were honestly. But it was a great paying job for the hours I put in, less than 30 hours. It's fast paced and gives you a great workout!"
good,I would handle packages by scanning them and placing them in a package wall.
good,"Everyday was constant work, stress, and meeting a lot of goals. I learned how to work under pressure and keep cool in those tough moments."
good,Management absolutely made sure that workers stayed on task and moved people to different locations on the docks as necessary
good,Come to work ready to get a job done. the people were cool the packages were many.
good,Enjoyed working here. Lots of opportunities to learn and grow your career
good,"This job payed really well, had great benefits. But the only things were the overnight hours and the supervisors tried their hardest to stay in the office and let the workers maintain each other."
good,"lifting and loading and unloading.  Learned nothing for the job,  Management is okay.  Hard bending over ."
good,I learned about the FedEx packaging/delivery process during the rush holiday season.
good,Learned great leadership with company. I learned most of my management skills with a lot of employees underneath me. Great company to grow with.
good,The freedom of small business ownership with the opportunity for expansion.
good,Physical and face pace work. Focus was place on safety and speed !
good,"Was managing package handlers to load vans to go out for delivery in the am. The best part of my job was the drivers, the hardest was the hours."
good,I learned a lot about business from fed ex. great compamy.  Enjoyed dealing with the customers.
good,the hardest part of my job is the fast pasted environment and getting things done fast and safe
good,"A typical day at FedEx Ground consists of climbing in and out of the company freight truck scanning and lifting packages weighting around 50 to 150 lbs. I've learned that not everyone can do this kind of job because certain people are required to move at a pace that's fast yet accurate the hardest part of the job was having to scan at a load rate of 300 everyday, but if you think your up for this type of job than suit yourself."
good,Although the work isn't easy because it is very physical the job is fun. I enjoy pleasing customers. Interactions with co-workers is good and we often resemble a close knit family.
good,ok but not great badly run terminal days can be long but overall is not a hard job must pay attention to details
good,Great place to work.  Very physical and very cold in the winter.
good,Managed 5 people. Worked on very critical issues. Very good culture in the offices where I worked. I enjoyed on each and every issue. I got an award for my critical tasks which I worked on.
good,It was an ok job until they started cutting me down to two hours.
good,"The Consumer is what drives every aspect of business, and every day the main goal is to service and maintain the Customer Base"
good,Here at FedEx I learn so much about properly loading and unloading trucks. Plus they have great benefits and opportunity to move up.
good,"Pull reports from prior day and analyze"
good,Fast Paced and sometimes stressful environment. I did not learn much there other than how to do my job. The management was nice and easy to talk to. The co-workers were interactive and for the most part easy to get along with. Most of them were previous military veterans. The hardest part of the job was the heavy lifting that was involved. The most enjoyable part was that the fast pace made the day go fast as well.
good,At Fedex I was able to sharpen my customer service and telephone skils.  Management was very supportive and encouraging of all their employees.
good,"Get to work, some people would get sent home because there wasn't enough work. I would unload trucks usually for around 4 hours then the day would be done. The only thing i didn't like about this job is the fact that you weren't guaranteed to work everyday, and the very few hours."
good,I would clock in stand in line to get my scanner than listen to what my shift manager told us we had to do the day than get straight to work. Take boxes off the vendor than load them on the truck. Make sure there werent any back ups coming from the vendor
good,This job is all about speed and efficiency they want you to unload these trucks as fast as reasonably possible and they want you to do the correct and safest way possible. its isn't a bad place to work but the hours are minimum only about 4 to 6 hours a night. the hardest part of this job is repletion you will find yourself doing the same thing for hours. management will generally let you alone unless you strait to show decline in productivity and the co workers are good with team work
good,"Fast paced"
good,Not a bad place to work but must be willing to move every two to five years in order to advance.
good,"FedEx completed a restructure of their Linehaul department in the Ground company. This restructure moved all management positions to nonexempt hourly jobs.  While maintaining base pay levels, all job expectations remained from the management position to the hourly position without the authority to ensure completion of the expectations. The remaining management did not know the linehaul department enough to properly manage and would not accept training , instruction or advice from personnel that were now hourly coordinators or clerks.  This location talks a good game but does not follow through the corporate philosophies of safety and people first. They only play the numbers games."
good,A typical day at work is great i learn how to work with other people
good,"Unloaded boxes from trailers by hand. Plenty of work, nice cardio workout. Everything was as expected. Typical entry level people, no surprises there."
good,It was a good job to me for 5 years then it went down hill because of my lower back problems.
good,"Loading and unloading box trucks"
good,Very organized. Very big company with great benefits. Hours are ok to manage.
good,Loved working with aircraft & the people. Enjoyed learning to work with new equipment & different computer programs.
good,"Great place to work for the workout factor, but if you are looking to move up in life, its difficult. Wide Variety of ethnic backgrounds, all different walks of life. Management was lacking in communication."
good,I would go back if they gave more hours land if I was still living in the area
good,not enough hours for a full time job but great working environment
good,"Managing 14 employees, servicing customers with fast and efficient service. The job never gets boring, its non stop round the clock moving."
good,Business to Business sales at the C-level. Sophisticated sales to many different industries and services.
good,A typical day starts out with me assigning counts to our inventory team.I learn a new task everyday from my supervisor. The management here is very good. The co-workers are okay most of the time.Thats the hardest part of the job. Some people don't like authority.
good,This was an interesting job and it was also a nice company to work for.
good,A typical day includes waking up at odd hours of the night to begin handling packages for customers. Followed by offloading a cargo plane as quickly and efficiently as possible to deliver the Purple Promise to customers. Over the past 5 years here I have learned to critically solve issues myself without much involvement with management as they allow me to do so. Management treat their employees well and allow employees to feel that they are just as important as management.
good,"fast pace, unload trucks and coworkers make the day go by fast because they make it fun."
good,overall a good company to start a career with but the management need to communicate more only pt positions to start
good,This was a summer job I took before going to Chicago.  It was a nice place to work with a good esprit de corps.  It has fast paced and difficult physical labor.
good,Working at FedEx requires you to be mentally and physically prepared to work hard. sometimes working alone for periods of time and sometimes working with others. but if you don't mind hard work and working the night shift then mybe this is the place for you.
good,"sending and reciving packages"
good,"Worked here for 6 years as a City Driver performing P&D operations and doing my best to bring the 'purple promise' to the customer"
good,Loading and unloading trucks.  It would be a great job if it was full time.
good,"Map out daily route"
good,"As a daily dispatcher, FedEx gives me free reign to creatively set up freight to travel an infinite numbers of ways across the country to the final destination. This allows me to find the most cost-effective way to move freight"
good,"wash cars, vacuum cars, take out tires/trash and marked tires"
good,No matter what your position is with FedEx Ground - you will be expected to push yourself and your team to ever increasing goals.  This however - is not a bad thing.  I have found this to be an incredibly stable company that believes in a great deal of transparency when it comes to decision making.
good,You could build the team of your choice and if good work with a ggod group of employees
good,Good company to work for.  Fast paced environment that makes the day go by fast.
good,"-	Unloading and/or sorting of packages by hand, including lifting, pushing, pulling, carrying and placing, in a safe and efficient manner."
good,A typical day at work is picking up shipments palletize/shrink-wrap and load/unload into my truck.
good,"fast paced"
good,My career with fedex ground has been one where I have learned leadership skills and built on a number of skills.  At work I review dispatches and schedules from the previous morning across Canada.  I walk through the warehouse to make a determination of what schedules will need to be put in place to move freight across the country.  During my time with fedex I have learned how to communicate with other members of management and how to delegate and inspire others to take pride in their duties.  The hardest part of the job is that I make myself available 24 hours a day and 7 days a week.  This is also rewarding because my commitment has led to excellent results in terms of service measures.
good,"A typical day at FedEx consisted of moving boxes or other items from a truck to a conveyer belt."
good,Just your typical data entry job in a fast paced transportation industry setting.
good,A great company to work for as a whole. A fast pace job; always moving.

good,"Very good company to work for. A lot of opportunity to be had,"
good,"Motivate employees to maximize productivity and potential through reward & recognition programs."
good,Labor Intensive position as a Courier. Work hours can dramatically change withint the year.
good,FedEx is hard job. But it is fast paced and keeps you on your toes.  After a while you just become a number and all management cares about is whether you deliver on time and do it the least amount of hours. Did not really feel like part of team anymore.
good,I would come in at 6 A.M. every morning and review my route for the day and the routes of 5 other drivers. I was the team leader so I was authorized to make any changes as needed to obtain maximum efficiency and customer service quality. After adjusting the routes I would meet with management to address any problems or performance reviews then proceed to load my truck and begin my route.
good,"My day typical consist of loading & unloading trailors, also sorting merchandise."
good,"Every day I was eager to learn, study, and understand a new aspect of the job. I started simply down piling pallets. Then progressed into pacing which was challenging at first, but with the help of some of my co-workers and upper management team I was able to effectively complete daily tasks."
good,"My co-workers are great, my team finds ways to help each other and improve our account daily."
good,I Like the fact that work was simple and easy to handle there would be times where things would get tedious but for the most part everything was ok paid every week great benefits but i didnt get many hours 21 a week there werent opportunities to advance in the company too much drama on the dock and work hours were inconsistent for the most part i enjoyed the job just wish there was more growth as a employee i was there for 3 years and i held the same title with only 2 chances to change positions great part time job but you wouldnt be able to financial be stable
good,delivered air packages and picked up air packages.  management was great.  its an employee committed company.
good,"Faire des livraisons au clients dans la région de bruxelles."
good,To lead and educate employees.  Make sure freight is loaded in a safe and timely manner in order to satisfy our customers.
good,"Overall, FedEx is a great company, but it's back-breaking work.  There's opportunity for growth and the benefits are good."
good,Start with group meeting about what needed to be done that given day. I learned strong team building skills and how to manage my time and responsibilities wisely. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people i worked with along with the managers. They made it a fun environment that you would want to work for.
good,"Unload/Load, Organization boxes, Label, Restock/Stock, ID Tag, and Stamp"
good,"A typical work day starts with getting all of your equipment needed for the day and a stretch. Then you would inspect your vehicle and then get ready for some fast moving. I didnt learn uch besides the area. Management was good, they (one in particular) took care of their employees. The hardest part of the job was dealing with traffic and the most enjoyable was the customer smiles."
good,Fast paced a lot of the time but that work will get you in shape and in my opinion is actually really fun.
good,"Overall it was a good place to work. The trucks are in dire need of repair as are the dollies. Working the dock in the winter in Iowa is very rough, you have to be very tolerant of the cold.There really is no advancement and they still use paper logs.."
good,"a typical day at work: to load the truck and deliver packages."
good,"Hardest part of the job was the long hours."
good,Good company just needs a little more work with job security. I don't feel it is there unless you are open to moving across the country. Theres not much opportunity for a person who wants stability
good,"een drukke werkdag waarbij flexibiliteit voorop staat"
good,As a package handler at FedEx Ground I loaded the delivery trucks and unloaded the trailers. I also fixed incorrect addresses on the package labels as needed and repackaged damaged packages. The hardest part of the job was that it was physically demanding. The most enjoyable part of the job was working as a team with people from several different cultures.
good,"I clock, hop on a forklift and get to work. Its pretty straight forward. after hot time (trailer cut offs) we are allowed a breakm but most people work through it because its so busy. Ive learned patience and communication skills go hand in hand. the management shows you they care and are willing to work with you.Very good trait for higher ups. Co workers are easy to work with and nice and will guide you in the right direction. Its fun working with a team when everyone knows you and helps you out when they see you struggling and try to give you tips. FedEx is a good company to work for."
good,"good day overall"
good,"I have learned how to Unload trailers, scan and conduct."
good,This is a fast pace environment with fun and friendly people to work with.
good,This job allowed me a chance to work with others after my wreck. This job is usually given to individuals with disabilities. I was able to help others learn how to utilize the computer as needed.
good,scan packages for shipping worldwide and met some good people
good,"Day to Day operations was to load/unload Fed-Ex freight trucks. U learn how to load and stack effectively, as well as keep your load rate up. Hard part is the strenuous labor, but the easy part is u have multiple breaks wit the option of continuing."
good,Id go in go to my spot get told which truck to unload and how soon to get it done and id work til the shift was over switching trucks when needed
good,Intresting and very productive work place. Working at FedEx I have learned alot and have challege myself to different things
good,"Tell days were always different knowing that I would drive a new route everyday, the job was a team effort. Sometimes you would need to help a route around your area or you might need help to complete your route in a timely fashion. Hardest part was loading and unloading packages in the range of 150lbs, working different routes challenged your mental skills....The job was a great one and paid well and benefits"
good,"I'd go in early in the morning, load up my packages in a timely manner and go out and deliver to surrounding towns. It was a very independent job that got busy around christmas time, that tended to get a little stressful here and there. My co-workers and bosses were all great. Pay was just fine, but the job had 0 benefits which really hurt."
good,"When i first started at FedEx Freight i was a dock supplemental moving freight from trailer to trailer. I loved it best four hours of the day after school. When i was done with school i wanted to pursue with in the company so i decided to take the supervisor class they offered. When i completed the course i was transferred to Madison, WI where i started as the outbound supervisor. The first part of my day was to meet with the inbound supervisor to go over what drivers routes are and what freight was left over from morning shift so i could bring a driver in to deliver. I also was the dispatcher for most of my shift, this was very challenging because it would set up how my night would go to get freight out on time. I also did customer service answering the phones taking pickups from customers and also dealing with lost or damaged freight. probably the least favorite part of the job but a great challenging experience that helped me over time to talk to angry customers in a more professional manner and try to find a solution in where the customer is still happy to use our company. After getting done with dispatch i then managed 5 employees to get freight moved as quickly and damaged free to get out on time to the different hubs we load to. Then about after a year and a half i transferred to inbound supervisor. First part of my job was to check incoming freight from the hubs and organize routes to maximize stops per hour. After setting up all the routes i then managed 10 employees to make sure freight looks presentable and damage free for the customers and get the drivers out on"
good,It was a fun place to work because it kept me active.  It is a physically demanding job with friendly management.
good,I had 2 jobs at FedEx.  One on the phone in a call center and the other behind the counter at a station.   Both had their drawbacks.
good,"Bem começamos o dia de trabalho com uma bela reunião com conferentes e operadores,logo em seguida juntamos todos os afazeres e dividimos todo o serviço com a equipe de digitadores,emissões de ctrs, logo depois da emissões vem os MA's emitimos todos os MA's,ligamos para o motoristas colocamos os dados dele e interagimos com o gris da empresa atraves de email e telefone para liberar o motorista para rota.                                       A fedex e uma boa empresa pra se trabalhar ,mas deixa a desejar quando entra na parte de promoções e desenvolvimentos do funcionarios.Aparte mas agradeavel do trabalho e que a equipe e uma equipe unida e descontraida eu e meu lider tinhamos a facilidade de envolver toda equipe na operação com entusiasmos e sempre com competencia."

The hardest part of the job would be holidays where we would have to work double the work and double the time."

The co-workers were kind and hardworking.  Everyone at FedEx had to go through an extensive federal background check which made you feel good about the people you worked with.  The management was good and seemed to care about their employees while at work.  The only problem was the staff did not care if you had to leave at closing to pick up your child from daycare.

All of the managers are very knowledgeable about FedEx and its policies. Just like every job you have some co-workers who really work, and some who don't want to work. The hardest part about my job is at night usually around 9:30 pm, when the last five trucks come in and everything has to be out of the truck by 10:18 pm, or the flights will be delayed. The most enjoyable part of the job is doing the yard check. A yard check is when a co-worker and myself go outside and check every truck to make sure no packages were left behind. It gives me a nice break and when it's hot in the sort I can go get some fresh air."
good,"Fed Ex is a very good experience for me here in Western Oklahoma as a full time college student. They work around my school schedule and work is always available. Co-workers are kind, generous, and hard working. The hardest part of the job is finding a delivery out in the middle of nowhere. Fighting inclement weather can be challenging, but growing up in Western Oklahoma you learn to deal with it. The most enjoyable part would be a clean, healthy work environment."
good,I really enjoyed working here. Everyone was detail oriented and cared about specific tasks.
good,"hard work, fast paced, but fun. Pay was great but hours were very short."
good,"Another one that depended a lot on the volume of work that was coming in especially during the peak season, Christmas. Overall the company did not offer much but the fellow employees made the long and hard nights easier to get through."
good,"The work enviorment varies from day to day, you have to be a person that can adapt to the continuos change. I learned that there are alot of different areas of growth in a large company like this, and that you have to be ontop in order to make it. The management are grouped and you had few that would take the time out to assist in growth,so you basiclly had to learn on you own most of the time by trial and error. The hardest was the adavancment rate, this location is one of the better loactions in the district which meant that there really wasn't any room for advancment because no one was moving or relocating. The most enjoyabke part of the job was the co-worker we always were able to have fun and get the job done together no matter what may occur throughout the day, night or week."
good,My typical day starts with a scanner. we have to palletize package tfor shipping
good,I have been working with this company for 16 years. It has good benefits and room for growth.
good,"go in at night, have a meeting with your manager about the night before or any new business you need to know. the work for 3 hours and leave."
good,leanred how to do maintaince check on jocky truck and all forklifts also how to use scanner gun and software for shipments and how to drive and operate forklift safley
good,Moving packages gives me a good workout. This job also allows me to see how shipping companies work on the inside.
good,a very good work out job. and thats what i like about it. Very good company to work for
good,"A typical day at work for me consists of retrieving and delivering packages to various locations, in the city. I learned how important it is to be a safe and efficient driver. Management works good with constant communication.I had no problem with my co-workers because I got along with everyone. The hardest part of the job is being on time and being a safe driver at the same time. The most enjoyable part of the job is completing a task without an incident."
good,Liked the fast pace environment. the people all had great energy. Loved going out on the filed to recruit at job fairs.
good,The hours were long and you started really early in the morning. By time you closk out you still have the whole day ahead of you for you to be able to get a few errands done.
good,Night consists of the following:
good,Excellent place to work when in need of a part-time job with excellent benefits.
good,"FedEx Office is a great place to work, like every job it has it's ups and downs but it balances out. I am just getting out of school and is looking for something in my field but if wasn't I wouldn't mind staying. Overall I would re-apply if I was to find employment else where and I wasn't happy."
good,A company where you have the opportunity to grow from the bottom to the top with hard work.
good,Learn that in order to survive in the workforce you need to show your supervisor that you can perform above requirement level and kept a constant degree of dedication for the work.
good,Weekly Pay
good,Great management and pay for a part-time job. Perfect for a student.
good,"Delivery and pickup of time sensitive packages on the move all day long.I learned to be safe,orderly and efficient with my pickups and deliveries.My co-worker were great teammates we all worked as one.Hardest part of the job was the time sensitive nature of everything .I enjoyed the challenge everyday of getting everything done on time over and over."
good,it was always fast paced and never stopped working.management was good.
good,"Ahead of their time when it came to training, benefits, pay and opportunities for advancement."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of loading my truck in the morning in an order to which I will deliver the packages. I would drive to households and businesses to deliver or pick up packages. I learned how the fedex business does the job they do. I also learned more locations around Tucson, Az. My co-workers were very fun to talk with and work with. The hardest part of the job was Christmas time. The most enjoyable part of the job was driving around town and doing the job on my own and the way I want to get it done."
good,I am proud to say I work for a company like Fedex. They treat you well and take care of you too.
good,"inspect my truck,pick packages off the belt, put them on truck, delive them to people house, and bussiness, and doing pick up.My co-worker help me alot."
good,"I took orders, assisted customers, prepared food, handled money, and cleaned"
good,"Good company to work,fun and good business opp. Going to Georgia and Florida most days, pay is great, good co-workers, long hours.. management is great,runs by the clock!"
good,"im working for fedex its a seasonal job.duties loading and unloading the truck,delivery packages door by door"
good,A typical day at work i had to unload arriving trucks and sort the merchandise for desired location. I learned how to work at a much faster pace then previous jobs and withstand harsh ware on the body.
good,"My typical day at work would consist of production of jobs and work flow management. My co-workers did not all get along but came together as a team. Hardest pat of my job would be communication between shifts. The constant work flow and productivity of my position, I would say was the most enjoyable part of my job."
good,When working at fedex ground you have to be careful because you can get easy hurt in a warehouse. The pay was good as well. Also some of the people you work with is fun too.
good,"It's a very laid back job. A lot of lifting, but not a lot of thinking involved"
good,"I was only part time not too much to say , overall good company."
good,The work environment is very positive. The management team helps a lot in maturing team members and providing them with all the tools needed to excel at their work.
good,"a good work environment with great management, rough hours, 4:00 AM to 9:00 AM good hourly rate, but not enough hours."
good,Very nice place to work with a great atmosphere.Supervisors are on top of everything.
good,"Worked well with the crew. We were all great team players, getting the truckes loaded in a timely manner to get the driver out on the field as soon as possible."
good,"Working at Fed-Ex was very challenging and taught me the value of hard work, It was also a place where you were noticed and recognized for the work that you done, management was very supportive of you."
good,Great health benefits. I am proud to have been a FedEx employee.
good,Good place I enjoyed it there they were nice people I just had to move on with my life I could not be a package handler forever love the management and everything
good,it can be a great job depending on what you do.the managers are pretty cool and arent always breathing down your back. if you are full time youll make a good amount of money
good,"Overall it is a really good job. Good pay, good hours. Internal employee relationships are not the best, definitely room for improvement. Basically get from the company whatever you put into the company."
good,"good workplace just feel like its a dead end and cant progress anymore in the job, and the hours are unsociable hours working from 4pm to 10pm with very little opportunity for overtime"
good,This a pyshical job. Fast pace. I have seen people come and gone. You have to look at the job has a customer. We order and we to deliver. It's a easy job but it can be rough some days. Especially during the holiday season.
good,"E uma uma empresa que vem crescendo de mas no mercado de trabalho mas a alguns pontos que precisa ser melhorado como salário, gerência e coordenação..."
good,"Ensure employees have safe work environment. "
good,FedEx is fast paced and safety is above all. Just know when you hit that dock you are there to work. I wish that there was more full time dock opportunities but the pay is good for part time.
good,My experience here at FedEx has shown me how a company promotes it's work through quality to reach the customer working side by side with dock workers and drivers alike.
good,"Depending on the manager at the location it can be ok. Average transportation company.alot of politics and favoritism. Not alot of diversity 80% Hispanic, 15% Caucasian, 4% Black,1% other. Can make good money and get alot of hours. Stay under the radar.  Alot of haters"
good,it was a pleasure working for frdrx as the company offered their employees to grow with in the company and to further educate themselves by helping them study further
good,"Handling packages, loading and unloading packages, maintain an organized facility. I excelled in a work environment where you were obligated to work in groups."
good,Get to work early so that you could sort and load packages in the order that you would need to unload. The employees were friendly and fun to work around. Most days were good unless there was a late cargo truck. That would pretty much slow your whole day.
good,"This job I loved. The only problem I ever had is that, you're a 1099 contractor. There's no benefits and sometimes there's heavy workloads and no organization.  I started as a temp years ago and became a contractor working under a 1099. Sometimes you can find yourself feeling like you're  not part of the company.with all  said I loved what I did and we'll still consider doing it again."
good,"Uma empresa boa para se trabalhar, tem maneiras de operar que são favoráveis para as operações."
good,"This is a temporary position that was to lead to full time.   While FedX is a great company to work for, this position is with FedX Freight and they hire a large number of people to meet peak demand for loading and unloading trucks.  There are very few full time positions.  I cannot continue to work part time.  I need a full time job."
good,I was hired to work 6:00 AM to 2:30 PM but when I started I found out they had mandatory overtime that made me work 6AM-6:30PM.  The money was good but the hours are exhausting. Then after 6 months I was going to be placed on night shift 2PM-2:30AM. I couldn’t do it due to oss of family time.
good,The work is simple and strait forward but the other employees attitudes (if they have worked there for a while) can be detrimental to your mood because it is usually negative and infectious.
good,The hardest part of working at FedEx is keeping up with your energy you left hundreds of box that are all different sizes and you have to keep a fast pace
good,Bem tranquilo. Lugar respeitoso super para trabalho
good,"excelente ambiente, compañerismo y oportunidad de crecimiento y aprendizaje."
good,"Not a bad place to work for if you’re able to handke the stress of it all, very hot in the warehouse during the summer and very cold in the winter but if you’re able to handle working in intense conditions not bad."
good,You will enjoy the culture of the environment. The hardest part of the job is staying consistent with making sure you stay in line with the saftey guidelines.
good,"Its a decent job but it is hard work. Of the managers like you you will be fine as long as you show up daily and on time. However, hard workers pick up the slack for others and are often asked to do more then their share of the work."
good,FedEx is a really great job. It is the perfect job for someone who is trying to get back on their feet. There's a lot of respectful managers. Although it is very demanding it was one of the best jobs that I've had.
good,"A typical day of work at FedEx starts early in the morning were need to make sure every box is in the right place, loaded in the truck by someone else, making sure you have enough space to walk in and find packages for delivery in every stop, while at the route we need to make sure every package or packages are delivered in the right address, need to learn how to use a digital scanner to scan all packages. The hardest part of the job is to get used to the area you are working, and the pickups at the end of shift which most of the times consists in pick up a lot of packages by hand or with dolly to the truck and go back to the terminal, doing all that in a rush because all employers want to deliver all packages quickly in order to get the job done and go home."
good,Great place to work a little physical nice people nice new building they are honest people an willing to help along the ways job hours could be better timing tho
good,"its a fast past work eviroment, need to be fast friendly, be able to interact with customers. be safety aware, need to be willing to do what ever it takes to get the job done"
good,Alguns ótimos gestores. Bons salarios e beneficios!
good,I wish they had more benefits for the drivers that are working as sub contractors that would help with workers staying there in case of injuries and emergency time off
good,Strategic selling has slowly been dissolving to daily transactions.  FedEx still a great company but not what it used to be.  Middle management and leadership has faltered.
good,"Fast paced, not enough hours, and not worth the pay...  uniform shirt available other tha not enough hors ar eprovmided yo come in for about 3-4 hours 3x a week..."
good,Job was ok I like some the people the ones that care...it got me in shape and was very fast pace...I would recommend people to go and work at FedEx it's a good job
good,"I’ve been working here since September 2015 and been part time this whole time. I got pregnant before I started working here and tried to advance to full time after I had my son and still to this day, I can’t get part time because we are on a “freeze”. Corporate in Memphis controls everything we do and that’s keeping me from moving up."
good,"Fed Ex is a place you can grow and advance fairly quickly!  The people I have worked with have been fun and work together as a team!  It is very fast paced and we must work together to get the drivers out in a timely manner!  There are always new things to learn and changes come all the time.  Fed Ex is ever growing with the changes in the culture, keeping up with and excelling with their competition.  "
good,"Federal Express is a great place to work. They take care of their employees when and where they can. Benefits are provided for even the part time personnel. If you work your scheduled day off, you are paid OT for that shift. It is definitely a great place to work for someone that is interested in beginning with part time employment as it takes a while to become FT."
good,Hard labor and your body becomes overworked during festive season you work overtime or managers ask for you to stay longer even though you are only part-time.
good,"I go in about 7-7:30 normally off around 1500-1600. The job is laid back, you move at your own pace. You have package handlers that load your trucks for you."
good,I did city dispatch and also billed and did alot of answering phones and dealing with customers some things require alot more attention and you learn something new every day
good,self driven get it done and go home.  good people to work for. I loved my route and met many friendly customers.  good place to work. need to have a get it done attitude to succeed.
good,"FedEx for me, in the Memphis Hub area, was a great place to work. I loved everyone there, including my manager. He was a great guy."
good,"Ling story short it started out really nice, they give you raises quickly, I bought a new car had to make payments, they cut my hours after I bought my car. I was making 300 a week with an hourly pay of 19.01. Not good had to find something else."
good,Great company but i think starting fulltime would be better than starting your staff at only part time.. that would be my only rant other than that no complaints and management was not as helpfull.
good,"Great place to work and advance. There was the chance to advance which I look foreword to in any job. The people were great to work for and with. The manager was a very understanding person, and you could take your cares and concerns to him at any time."
good,"My manager was great, clean good place to work if you like customer service, perfection was is important to get all items delivered on time, good driving record required and safety first is always instilled to everyone daily!"
good,the management was good at the same time when there no work your work house will be cut very short. what i learn about the company that no mater day or time and weather they keep on shipping to the number one people is you
good,My shift manager is/was excellent.  As a crew of 4 on the Outgoing sort (afternoon/evening) we worked well collaboratively.  Facility manager not very responsive to our equipment needs for smoother more efficient task completion.
good,Good work place great team good paced work scene hardly no breaks as non stop rush i found it high demand on the lifting but i was glad i had a good team around
good,depending on how much packages and how many customers you have you still do not get enough hours. The pay will not help you survive without the help of someone else.
good,It wasn't a bad place to work but at time it was hard and in the summer time it was hot and in the winter it was cold but for the most part it was ok !!
good,Fast paced environment that involved heavy labor with little mistakes causing bigger problems overall. easy for one or more people to slow down the entire operation.
good,"A typial day at work will stressful. the manager I had was not good the hardest part will probly the heavy liting n pace. really don't have to ,uch full time position avalible I wish"
good,"FedEx is a great company to work for however, due to unprofessional ism and a great deal of poor management skills it became less about the work and more about the negative things"
good,"I have worked here for several years and it's time to move on. I had plans to move up and I could, but with a lot of the run around I have gotten, I don't think FedEx freight is the place for me. At Knoxville they don't offer much work in the day, so if you plan to work full time be prepared to work at night, unless you try to become a driver. If you do apply to become a driver, then you can't have any prior accidents."
good,Recomendo excelente empresa bons profissionais princípios
good,Overall good company. I liked interaction with customers the most. Always went out of my way to help people get their packages. Worked well with business customers to provide the tools they needed to ship out packages.
good,They worked with my class schedule.Were willing to cross train employees in roles they deemed need more coverage and the employees were willing to work in those areas.
good,i worked part time so a typical day was 5 to 6 hours of loading trucks with boxes at a fast paced speed and environment . nothing to advance your career besides the college tuition help thing they can help with
good,"Okay job . Night work . Not for everyone . I don't have anything else to say about FedEx , good or bad . Not my cup of tea . I don't like working nights and their road equipment is subpar for winter driving in this part of the country ."
good,Great place to work and enjoyed my experience.  Benefits good and met a lot of friends I remain in contact with today. Was hard to advance. Long commute to work.
good,it was just business as usual on a regular day. cover sating and working until the shift was up. nothing special but nothing bad either. overall it was a goof job i enjoyed the people there.
good,"I was fired for a broken curb,total joke and to boot they fired me when I was on vacation,needless to say but my vacation was no longer fin anymore,I had 19 years with the company but that didn't seem to mean anything"
good,"They promote from with in, very fast pace job, physical, demanding job. What else you need to know about this company. I've told you everything I know."
good,"All the employees worked as a team and were very responsible in their positions."
good,Management could be better. I loved working with the people there. Fun environment and fast paced. Fun to drive around on the lifts. Enjoyed my co-workers.
good,"Typically, working at FedEx is fairly easy and time flies by. The biggest downfall has to be working in freezing temperatures and FedEx not affording to insulate the building. The people are great and enjoyable but the management is poor and rude."
good,"load and organized packages"
good,"A good place to work with a lot of good people. You could do a lot worse. Finding the proper work-life balance has its challenges, but most managers are very flexible."
good,Opportunity to manage your account list and weekly schedule to balance work/life...calling on c-level executives to shipping managers which offers a broad sales chain connection with each account....many changing solutions and offerings to help add value to your customers businesses.
good,"You have to be strong minded. Patient, safe, and provide great customer service. Have to have to sharp mind set so you know have be prepared to solve a situation."
good,"Morning meeting."
good,Fast pace environment safety zone requirements and lots of movement have to be able to lift above 50 pounds and transfer product from different locations.
good,Buenas prestaciones . uniforme el problema que no cuentan con las unidades para el servicio
good,Every place has there pros and con but FedEx is a great place to work depending on if u coming there to work and not bs but overall it's a good job to be apart of
good,"I worked at the FedEx Smart Post, which is the small packaging building. I worked with conveyer belts, sort packages when they come down the line, put them in proper boxes after scanning the item. also, worked inbound which is when trucks come in, we unload them, I take the packages in the bags and distribute them on a conveyer belt, working inbound made the time go fast.  the work place is a relaxed environment."
good,"Overall FedEx is a great company to work for with opportunities for promotion. FedEx offers great benefits, sick time, vacation time, and tuition reimbursement. Unfortunately I was unhappy with management and felt there was sexism in the work place. Overall this has been an enjoyable job and I have appreciated my time and all I have learned, I am just stuck in a position that makes me unhappy."
good,Great Job but there is a lot of communication lacking everywhere. Benefits. They need to add incentives to motivate individuals to meet the requirements of damages to freight.
good,Every day is different. Hands on training. Network with customers. Learn all products and services offered. Opportunity for advancement. Great benefits and perks.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of waiting to clock in, going to our respective station/work area, pre-sort exercise/debrief, working hard then clocking out.  Rarely did we work long enough for a break, let alone for a lunch."
good,I worked brutal work hours. Management was clueless a lot of the time and not much help if needed. They never cared how well you were doing and if you had any problems at all.
good,I was having a hard time to find a career job after my university degree. SO i choose this job as Fedex Driver. I learned the location and driving around. I never being late always arrived on time. I work very hard and never give up I decided going back to my career after 10 years to finish from what I started.
good,"Low pay good benefits. A lot of favoritism "
good,I got very familiar with other neighborhoods and other facilities .community is very nice . I did packaging and handling at FedEx ground and I have to say it's a pretty amazing job
good,Working as a Material Handler for FedEx was a good learning experience. It taught me how to work under pressure and fast paced. The pay is decent but the working conditions aren't the best.
good,It was a good learning experience. I got to drive a bix van around town and deliver packages. Its definitely quite hectic around the holidays but that calms down in January.
good,"I really enjoyed the unload, you get a fan in your truck, it is hard work, you unload packages up to 50 pounds alone or more than that someone helps you. you get a 19 minute break then an hour for lunch. My only complaint was that I had two girl harrassing me, so I eventually was moved somewhere else because of it. Then one became manager three months later and was made manager of my area and so they wanted to move me again. I felt things shouldve been planned better in my opinion. Pay was pretty good."
good,Exceptional PEOPLE company for the hourly employees. Very good benefits. The founder of FedEx and top tier leadership are exceptional with their forward thinking being the reason FedEx is the FORTUNE 500 company it is. The focus on the customer experience by this great company exemplifies what any and all companies should strive to provide to their customers. I have developed many long lasting relationships with members of the FedEx team.
good,"FedEx Corp. provides customers and businesses worldwide with a broad portfolio of transportation, e-commerce and business services."
good,"Love the pay, but with it being contracted work we're not offered benefits and you work most holidays with the exception of the major ones. The people you work with (management/coworkers) can make or break you depending on how stressed out you get."
good,"During my short time in this facility I saw multiple new hires quit after only a few days. Pacing yourself, drinking water, and developing a loading method that works for you is essential."
good,"I enjoyed working at Fedex and if had the opportunity I would work for the again, the place is a cool place to work, and I enjoyed my job, the pay was pretty good, always room for improvement."
good,"Good pace and keeps you moving unloading trucks."
good,Nothing fancy just a decent paying job. You get to meet a lot of people and build relationships with those people you deliver to. Meeting the warehouse guy at Directv through delivering to him is how I ended up getting an even better job.
good,"Fed Ex is an excellent company to work for. Your co-workers are like family and majority of the time, everyone gets along."
good,Routine work unloading trucks and placing stickers on them for later sorting.  Management walks around routinely making sure all workers are equiped and makes sure that help is obtained in the appropriate areas.
good,This is not a bad company overall to work for. My main issue is the pay rate. I have so many responsibilities and do not get well compensated. They are flexible with scheduling and my co workers are not that bad.
good,I never at FedEx but I work at the Redskin stadium FedEx Field.. working at a stadium job was fun..greetings the fan watching the game with the fan getting to know the fan checking their tickets guiding the fan to their seat..
good,Good job great benefits. Long hours and I was tied to a desk. Could only leave the desk 3 times a day.   only writing a review because this website makes me.
good,fedex is a nice place to work for considering the have no union they are working on there pay scale to get the employees up to par with u.p.s .over all it is a nice company to work for.
good,Muito boa de trabalhar só sai para aprender em outras áreas
good,"FedEx is a great place to work. They offer decent compensation and benefits packages. Each day offered something new so it wasn't the same, monotonous job from day to day."
good,Good place to get tractor trailer driving experience. Also you will be running at nights dealing with fast paced terminals especially Charlotte NC it gets scary sometimes due to un experienced drivers around you. No benefits driving for a contractor
good,management there was great but with it being an overnight job no one was really to thrilled to actually be there. It was stressful and fast paced. but good job nonetheless
good,"The ramp is a good place to get started and see how the operations work.  You usually start off as a package handler unloading trucks and pallets then sorting into containers and stacking them so they can be loaded onto the airplanes.  There are various jobs available at the lower levels you can go outside and work directly on the aircraft or you can stay inside and work the sort operations.  You can become Dangerous goods trained or trained in various mechanical use.  Forklift, Belt loader, Tug driver, Loader for containers. Past that going up in management or anything beyond the sort is difficult.  Other opportunities are usually only in Memphis, maybe Oakland or Indianapolis.  You can make a living with being a driver at the stations or some of the team lead positions.  Also heavy weight operations."
good,FedEx will be a great career to retire in once you have moved up from the package handler level. Only you can screw a job a FedEx up and there are some in upper management that will take out their frustrations on you if you allow it.
good,when being at fedex on a typical it is very stressful and demanding and also very hot because there is no air in the building only fans when you get in a truck it sometimes already has packages in them and when your loading them sometimes the truck get a lot of flow instead of the manager putting the flow in another truck he will walk by and acts like he doesn't see u struggling and that the hardest part of my job trying to keep the truck from over flowing
good,"I was a courier at FedEx Express delivering packages on time.  Loaded trucks in the morning and unloaded the pickups at night.  Great company with great benefits, but my daughter got sick and they said they had to let me go.  I collected Unemployment"
good,Lots of rules and regulations to follow. Heavy lifting unloading airline cans and reloading them at night plus loading and unloading your delivery vehicle. Work 11 hour shifts at least 4 days a week. You are on a tight timeline while delivering and picking up packages. Missing or being late for work is not tolerated.
good,FedEx Culture is incredible and the people fantastic. Every day is a great day working with the people in FedEx. The people make this company run. You will love working here.
good,Fedex was a great place to work at. Very fast pace and exciting. Great team environment. Learned great team work skills and time management skills. Expectations were clear and they always got done. Management was great and would always talk to you if you had any issues. The hardest part of my job was also my most enjoyable part.
good,I spent work days selling international services to outside customers and coaching/training domestic sales executives in the international selling process.
good,A fast pace environment with a very important attention to detail requirement. This job has taught me how to supervise twenty plus employees while multi tasking with other responsibilities.
good,I only worked there for the Holiday season. It was crazy trying to get all the packages delivered in a timely manner. I did enjoy working for FedEx just wished i could have been hired in full time.
good,Route owners are amazing. You work more during peak. Halloween to Easter. fun fast work environment. Good equipment and routes are fun. Summer work is hot
good,"FedEx is a great place to work, interface with others and learn a lot about the package movement industry.  Employees are motivated and often stay positive.  I would recommend FedEx as a place to work."
good,Uma empresa na qual você consegue ter conato com diversas atividades.
good,fedex freight is a high paced competitive work enviorment. on the dock you operate a forklift to load and unload trailers. As a Hostler in the yard you park trailers. keeping up with deadlines requires teamwork and communication.
good,"Great benefits, no worklife balance, female managers are still not seen as equal to males, investigations and accusations with no evidence are commonplace when someone does not like a manager"
good,It’s a great part time job if you are looking for extra money or even a career change. They have plenty of opportunities and ways to move up in the company.
good,"-started every day on forklift or electric pallet jack. responsible for flagging and transporting pallets of packages to loading bay. after pallets were moved I was in charge of making sure all the pallets went with the right driver"
good,"Fedex is a great place to work if you need to supplement your income or in need of health benefits. The company just admitted a policy which pays every employee the equivalent to working 25 hours. I would highly recommend Fedex to any individual who is: coming out of retirement, going to college (because they do provide tuition reimbursement), or just graduating high school. "
good,There is no career advancement being that I work for a contractor and my sole job is to deliver. I will always be a driver and most managers make less than drivers. It is a great work environment when its not peak season and my mangers are awesome but I cant speak for the other contractor employers with Fed Ex.
good,Its a mostly Part time job but they have excellent benefits. However like any job if you demonstrate you want growth within the company there are oportunites for advancement. Work life balance is completely dependent on the daily volume so it really fluctuates so its really hard to make any plans. Overall this is a good first job to go into as they have good standards and practices that will carry over to any other job out in the employment world.
good,"Fun and enjoyable team; however, the pay was very low for the amount of work put out and the hours were short. The harder and faster you work, the less hours you get. Very counterproductive."
good,"This company is a logistics atmosphere, so one can expect to come into work, on-time without being late or otherwise you'll lose out on your minimum hours for the week. Assist where the operational need is needed, and stay away from negative, drama-causing, pushy individuals way and you can get through the rest of the part time day. Simple work areas, and simple managers"
good,Les opportunités de développement ne sont pas toujours mis en oeuvre ou peu. le management dans certains service reste quasi nul.
good,This job you work with a lot of different people. It’s very welcoming and you make the best out of the job itself. I enjoyed working here and will continue to
good,fedex grounds was ok but once again it was consider temp and it had a set salary it was know room for advancement you work long hour pending on the route you were on and no benefits was offered
good,Overall it's a good company to work for. They are flexible with your school or other work schedule but lack of hours so don't depend on this as your only job if you have bills to pay.
good,"FedEx is a leading LTL carrier.  Its fast paced customer friendly service orientated.  Driving newer equipment, latest technology based on safety.  Pay is among highest in the industry."
good,"Nerve consistent hours in the week, each day is different. One day is decent and the next is nearly impossible to complete. Very good pay and you have job security. No boss over your shoulder."
good,Productive and hard-working place. I would go and unload the trailers and put them on the conveyor belt. Sometimes I would also sort out the mail. Not to complicated.
good,Working here is nices move but the hours are lil off for me I had lots oh fun and good times when I worked at FedEx I love working with my coworker they knew how keep each other's up even in bad day.
good,"Good place to work.  Advancement is good at lower levels, but once you reach the higher levels advancement is slow or stops.   Management is average, just like any other place you have some great managers and you have some micro managers.   Everyone is friendly and works as a team most of the time."
good,I enjoyed working at Fedex because it was a relaxed setting job. Worked at your own pace. The job wasn't hard . No heavy lifting and bending. The supervisors were very nice.
good,"I started on split shifts 3am start till 7am then 4 pm till 8 pm but forget about sticking to the morning finishing time more like 8.30 finish, learn to sleep during the day, it will save your life because you are getting next to nothing during the night, job and life balance is basically non existent you sleep to go to work, if you try to do something other then sleep during the day you are going to regret it for the next 2 days at least while you try to catch up on sleep, this is the part of the job that I hated the most, you don't exist to the world any more. Side note before I go any further other shifts are available which I moved onto and the remainder of my time there was a lot better."
good,"Buen ambiente laboral con gran dinamismo y busqueda de mejoras constante."
good,"Good Working Culture in Fedex and Lot of new things to learn"
good,A productive learning experience that is healthy for all ages. A understandable job that works with you during and off work. I recommend this job to any of my associates.
good,Fair place to work. Good job Finding your assigned equipment. FedEx educates you well. Managers lil rough. Senior means everything. Gating out safely in 30 minutes. Pay Day!
good,"Fed Ex is a fast paced operation, requiring constant movement and handling of packages.  This job being part time takes a long time to qualify for medical, dental, and vision benefits (1000 hrs)."
good,"Great place to work at but it would be much better and productive without so much favoritism. Somewhat team players, supervision looks the other way when it comes to disciplining workers for consistently damaging freight and not doing what is expected and asked from them. Benefits and pay is great compared to many local jobs."
good,make sure to be ready. very comeptetive job. always look to improve. make sure you have a great boss cause if you dont you wil not get work at all. good luck.
good,"Fast paced work environment, great group of lads. Deliverying over 100 parcels a day whilst ensuring time deliveries make it on time, everytime whilst remaining polite and proffesional"
good,"A good job for a guy in his 20s, the weather is not fun at times. Some times you leave late. Other than that it is a decent job. Tuesday through Saturday."
good,Like the job but worked until 3:00 am and had to be at school at 8:00 am. Could not juggle my work schedule with my school schedule and studies. Good job but felt school was top priority at the time.
good,"Not having come from a freight and logistics background, I learned a lot about the business while working at FedEx Freight.  My supervisor was patient and willing to explain all that is involved with the business.  I also learned to be flexible with my work duties and schedule, depending on the needs of the business.  "
good,"Guaranteed job, long hours, leaves just a little room for social life, good for working on getting in shape. Best to find safety caring contractors, some are far more then others."
good,I learned all about commercial trucks with this company good training great bosses working the holiday season is always stressful but its good money for the kinda job your doing.
good,"Better leadership, no initiative with managers. There is a big lack of training and someone to give direction. Our managers never did lead by example and that was a big disappointment."
good,"I was responsible to unload trailers. I also had to scan packages and  bag them. I worked from Monday to Friday from 1.30 pm - 6.30 pm."
good,"The managers can be pretty gas lighting toward you and project a culture onto you based on their opinion of your value to the company. I hate to open with that because that is the harshest thing, but I did because I think it is the thing that will cause the most frustration; at other times they are nice, funny people. The job will cause you soreness at least temporarily, but you can make the hours and pay work perfectly for you since your typically off before 9:00 A.M."
good,"Recommend for College Graduates"
good,Working in the sales department you become very familiar with many people within the company and outside of the company.  Building both personal and business relations is a big plus working at FedEx
good,I started as a handler and became a courier then management so I did a lot of different things and learned a lot.  It is an advancing company that is very current.
good,"- Cultura organizacional de Federal Express es amplia y bien  definida lo que contribuye a reducción de tiempos y diligencias"
good,FedEx is a awesome company for what I can tell. The only thing that is a struggle right now is working part-time hours trying to provide for a family. If they offer me full time I would love to make this out of a career because I believe it pays great and offer unlimited benefits.
good,I had to multitask when i worked there. i loved the benefits for this company but i didnt think i was paid enough for all the work I did. i have nothing else to say
good,"Great place to work, lots of opportunity for growth. Fast paced. FedEx Express isn't just a job, it's a lifestyle! Good Benefits. Great 401k package. I loved working for FedEx"
good,"Work Life Balance is not the best as a supervisor "
good,good company as long as your body holds up. I enjoyed my time there. It was always busy and challenging. Pay was an issue with the amount of work done. I think that has since changed
good,you load your truck at 5am and your out the door by 7am. all your priority packages have to be delivered by 10am. then you should have the rest of your 80 to 150 stops done by 5pm. then you do your pick ups and take everything back to your station or the ramp at the airport.
good,Days can be easy or stressful.  The management there is mostly easy going.  There is much culture in the workplace. The hardest part of the job is when winter comes and you're working at night on an open dock.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the pay.
good,Management needs to take consideration of employees personal lives. One manager asked me to get an Uber to work even though I had no one to watch my 13 month old son in those hours of work. I felt as if that was rude and disrespectful!!!! Other than him everyone else was good until it came to needing help in trailers...
good,FedEx is a great place to work. management is very vigil . Work place is very diverse. Hardest part of the job is keeping up with the constant change in IT.... The most enjoyable part is been apart of a company that believes in charity.
good,I prefer not to answer or give my opinion.  Upper management needs to review what is going on in their respective areas.  Not all employees pull their weight as while others work very hard.
good,"Our KPI's are split for each day ,and since its service industry there is a lot to learn in terms of system issues, Providing Good Customer Experience both internal and External customers and the most enjoyable is the independence to work"
good,"I get in at 7 am and my truck is loaded for me to go through and add where I am going on my map.  Then I go delivery my packages to all businesses and residentials all over Reynoldsburg, Ohio.  I am on my own through out the day and can be done when I deliver my last package."
good,"Working at Federal Express requires you to be able to drive efficiently, lifting heavy loads at least 75 pds by yourself and the ability sort according to the astra labels on the packages. Also when it comes to the delivery side you have to be able to know how to locate different destinations to achieve the proper delivery time."
good,"My task at FedEx was to unload and load trailers, also I was a packet handler (a person who scan and palate boxes and put them in the right place to be shipped out.)"
good,"I worked at FedEx on a temporary assignment, but they were so welcoming and made me feel like part of the team.  My favorite part of the job was all of the community service events we participated in."
good,"Fedex provided me a career which allowed me to take care of my Family.  In my 23 years with Fedex I grew as a person and a leader.  I take pride in giving back and being a role model and mentor to my peers and employees.  During my 17 years in Management with Fedex my greatest challenge was trying to improve the culture within our work environment.  I believe as Managers we set the example and have the ability to incorporate a positive work atmosphere.  With that said, I find working with people and seeing positive change and success for the company most enjoyable for me."
good,"I loved this job.  The problem was, they didn't always love me.  I was an excellent employee but management wasn't always capable.  I gave them 3 stars but if it wasn't for one manager in particular, they would have received 1 star.  Contractor work was a bummer.  Buying gas, insurance, tires, etc wasn't cool.  Remember to save money back for your taxes! But there was definite job security with just the name being so recognizable."
good,Large corporation with clear procedures and structured work environment. Manual labor required. Reliable job with consistent hours in a fast paced workplace.
good,"Great workplace to be in, great people and staff save for maybe one or two people."
good,"Some days are extremely short, very cold and very hot at times, but loved most employees and had a good time overall.  It was a temporary position so unfortunately I was let go when the season slowed down"
good,"I enjoy the job itself especially because Im athletic. I love the fact  that Im getting paid for a practical work out session! Thats the best part of the job, also you can really zone out , its not necessary or an obligation to make 'small talk' with you co workers (in  which you will see that the people who work at this place esp. for years and years are  a""particular"" kind). I love its just a few hour of the day and quick money! The hardest part of the job is the political aspects, but isnt that at most places of labors especially billion dollar industries?! You can learn a lot working here, I know I have, it CAN be a great networking place also. Again its all about perspective, 50% who you are, 35% of the work you do, and the rest I'd rather you see for yourself; Management is (again) particular. Most dont last because of the work itSelf, ironic right! If youre lazy or looking for something easy , this is not the job for you."
good,"The work can be very tedious, which creates a high employee turnover rate. The work itself is very basic since you are just loading or unloading trailers. Sometimes management works too hard to meet the numbers set by corporate, which causes long hours and creates an excessive amount of work for the average employee."
good,Load and unload freight very fast pace right bills with the right Freight very nice pay very good benefits overall a nice job just a bad environment to work in
good,"After working for some years in different fortune 500 companies, FedEx is an OK place to work. We have been through some management changes, a bit of turnover. New facility and multicultural work environment, I think is great, it only makes stronger. Life work balance is not good, we as supervisors they makes work tons of extra hours, definitely not recommended for people with small children. Good benefits and days off, HR is always involved in activities for the employees, good christmas presents."
good,this job is hard manual labor. You can lose weight and gain muscle though. Your enitre shift you are unloading boxes from a semi or box type truck. If its holt outside its even hotter in there.
good,"I have worked in FedEx less than one year, so dont have much to add.  So far FedEx is a great company to work, but I need more growth in my profession as a Quality professional"
good,"Typical work day is mainly like everyday just sorting and moving packages from one area to another. I learned basically leadership skills and how to prioritize the handling of the freight. How to train people to work safely in a fast paced environment with a lot of moving parts. Hardest part of the job is mainly being short handed. No matter how much freight there is, it is always hard to work being short handed. The most enjoyable part of the day is leaving to go home but that's for any job."
good,Fast paced environment with opportunities to grow. Being on your own for the whole day is a positive. Management allows you to make your own decisions.
good,Good hard working people that are willing too help you with problem that you have or a place that you need too find. Need to find a better building then this one.
good,Management overall doesn't communicate with each other. Once your in it is pretty hard to get fired if you follow the rules (even loosely)............
good,Tough job that requires a lot of physical stamina. Wouldn't recommend just anyone for the job. Need to be quick on your feet and have good organization.
good,"Hard job both physically and mentally. The overall cons over do the pros. It is a job which demands everything from you, start to finish."
good,fed ex was cool . supply load and unload. build the truck. learned how to stay busy and keep busy. the hardest park was making sure you get that truck build.
good,Easy going workplace environment as long as you stay on the move. Also an easy environment to face injury. Most enjoyable part of the job was the feeling of receiving a good workout and gouging in the ice cold water provided in-between loadings.
good,"loved the job itself, this particular locations managment team needs to be evaluated by thier higher ups. Brand new equipment with the latest technology. automatic transmissions and electronic logs are in use"
good,"FedEx Ground is a very fast paced working environment. If you like physical work, cardio, and meeting people from all walks of life then this is the place for you."
good,"Typically, I would arrive at work, discuss the day's plans with my boss and begin loading the truck. I enjoyed working for Fed Ex. The hardest part of my job was never knowing what time I would get off. I worked alone and was responsible for myself. I learned how to properly plan a day around a route, business hours, and efficiency. I enjoyed being unsupervised and being trusted to properly complete tasks."
good,"A good place to work with great people, but would not recommend it as a long term career. It can be very stressful, especially at first as there is a lot to learn, including route memorization and how to load your delivery truck so that packages are placed in order of delivery,"
good,"El trabajo se realiza en tiempo y forma, con un alto rendimiento, con el fin de lograr la misión y visión de la empresa, reduciendo tiempos muertos en el desarrollo del trabajo, para alcanzar los estándares de"
good,I unloaded freight from inbound trailer to outbound trailer on a forklift. Had to make sure the right freight got onto the right outbound trailer. The hardest part of the job was the weather.
good,I enjoyed working for Fed Ex during my time there. The night went by fast and it was unload the trucks and load the trucks and some days I sorted packages. I learned new techniques to load/unload. Management was fair and upfront with me. The culture was normal for a warehouse job. The hardest part of the job was being ready to work 3rd shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was the workout from loading and unloading trucks.
good,Its a great place to work. You meet all types of people. The environment is different and quick. There are time when things become overwhelming and difficult. I tend to maintain a focus mind frame and complete the task at hand.
good,"A job that let you meet a lot of customers, and it keeps you in shape..."
good,"Perfect job for a college student. Benefits are GREAT, especially the dental. A typical day starts busy and caps off the last hour or so, Mondays are especially hard. They are ready to teach about leadership and encourage it! Management is definitely 50/50 when it comes to who's a good manager and who's not. But if you ever have a problem with any management it's not hard to get moved to another part of the building. Not to say that the job isn't hard, but if you work hard and have a good attitude about how freakishly hot it is inside then you can probably just be moved to another package handler position. Lifting heavy packages is probably the hardest part. Easiest part is ""high school"" work drama, just avoid it. Most enjoyable part is making that $$$."
good,"Excellent company with a great benefits. I enjoyed meeting our customers and that I represented them proudly."
good,"A typical work day was very long at FedEx, there was always work to do and never a dull moment. Sometimes you would be in charge of more than expected. They defiantly keep you on your feet."
good,"Empresa boa, porém com pensamentos pequenos."
good,I don't have anything to share about the company at this time. If I have further information I will share at a later time. Everything is good with my employment at FedEx.
good,Was a fun up beat working environment. Enjoyed working there. The management was very understanding and was fun to work with. Very nice people. Delayed planes ended up being fun to do. Over time seemed very easy.
good,"Good benefits, tuition reimbursement, they cook out most holidays.There  are plenty of hours for the most part if willing to work.Stay hydrated, there are no breaks."
good,It is a good place to work I like my co-workers and we all get along very well. I have learned how to work as a team player and how to handle a fast passed work place.  The hardest part of the job right now is I am not getting enough hours that is why I am looking for a new job.
good,A typical day at work is organized chaos. There is always a lot going on. As a manager I always have to be on my toes and know whats going on all the time. I enjoy working with my employees the most.
good,"FedEx is a great place to work if you like the challenge of a fast paced environment.  Not only sorting in the morning, but with the loading of the truck and then driving from location to location to make sure you are delivering packages as quickly as possible makes the entire day a bit of a challenge.  Had to learn logistics when making sure you are not back-tracking during the day.  FedEx is a great environment and great people."
good,"Great place for a first job. Great pay , just high pace work but its part time. There are chances for growth in the company and the hours are good and over time"
good,Fed Ex is a great place to work especially part time. Benefits are offered for part time employees. Working nights is the main downside. It is also is hard to get on full time.
good,"A typical night at work for me consist of driving my tug to different flights in order to assist in off loading freight that I will take back to a designated area for processing. "
good,"Good part-time job, decent benefits, management needs work. The culture is basically who can benefit from being buddy, buddy with a manager will get the position they want no matter how hard you work. "
good,"Very fast paced.  Strong organization and quick decision making skills are necessary.  Overall it was a fun job to have.  It was a lot of activity early in the morning that wakes up the body and the brain.  Plus, by 8:00 work is done."
good,Uma empresa muito agradável de trabalhar pena que veio a crise e dispensaram os funcionários.
good,"They hire a lot of part-time workers for the bottom of the rung type stuff. Hard to get in as a full timer. Good company to work for. They have it where you can have so much of your check go toward buying stock. A good investment to say the least. "
good,"- Gestion des retours de livraison"
good,As a driver for them for 13 years I enjoyed my job very much. The pay compensation was the top of industries. In management I felt the pay was average for the stress and work load placed on us!
good,"FedEx is okay place to work. You get great exercise, that is pretty much it. You will have to bring your A game and be ready to work because they will work you. Maybe build some work ethic."
good,"Great pay for work done. Ex; (PT Dock starts at $16.08 per hour) Everything else depends on your position, who your co-workers are, who your boss is, etc."
good,"enjoyed working there but opportunity to advance is very slow. management is very old fashioned. a lot of work, little pay. benefits are ok. bonuses are not. worked with a lot of older people. learned a lot. flexibility was good. its a great place to work if you are not looking to progress."
good,The starting pay here is great and the benefits are the best I've seen for a part-time job. I've been working here for years and there are always opportunities opening up for their employees. I hope to be an engineer for this company in the future.
good,"Fast pace work flow from 2am to 7am. Continuous separation of box for various locations across the South Jersey area.  Carefully placing packages in their  appropriate areas for drivers to load their trucks."
good,It's good for exercise compared to visiting a gym. Ideal for people young in their twenties although not for those in their forties. Unfortunately they offer part-time work in such positions ranging barely twenty hours per week. Pay is weekly although depending upon lifestyle a paycheck easily disappears due to bills arriving each week during the month.
good,If you have a set run you do the same thing regularly and are able to form habits. Working different runs each day is hard. Demanding an you have to be safe on the roads all the time.
good,"FedEx is a place to pick up some extra cash. It is a fast paced environment and can be a little annoying if u aren't fast enough on your 1st day. Packages can weigh anywhere from .10 oz to 100 lbs +. Scanning shipping label and making sure to put the packages in the assigned delivery trucks. Should the hand held scanning machine power off, and reboot, no one tells you that the labels are now off course but you continue to scan and place the packages in the assigned truck. Thinking you've mastered the problem. Next morning you come in only to find out that most of the mistakes where done by you on your 2nd day on the job. Overall I liked the early morning hours,"
good,"I enjoy working for FedEx, I just wish they had more hours to give to employees. That is my only complaint. The managers and other staffing is great. I would recommend FedEx to anyone looking for a job."
good,"A typical day at work included manual work customer consultation, customer service and an ability to efficiently time manage projects. Downtime went to cleaning and merchandising."
good,"it was reasonable hard work , the pay and benefits were great."
good,FedEx was a good company to work for with room for growth and rapid pay increases. Unfortunately it didn't work out for me because of the hours I was working.
good,"I learned how to sort parcel for further inspection with CBSA. Worked in a warehouse environment with CBSA and Fed Ex employees, loaded and unloaded freight planes."
good,The job was fun if you enjoyed staying busy. Only down fall for me is I never got to see my family and the hours are crazy. Hours are not really set and you are not guaranteed hours.
good,fast paced. driver delivers throughout the day to residential and non residential properties until all parcels are delivered.
good,The RPS culture was a close knit group but when FEDEX bought out the company the culture changed and the older workers were run out.  Imagine having half the trucks of the local FEDEX terminal and required to meet the same production goals.
good,Long days at work with specific expectations. Some of the expectations are a little unrealistic but if you worked hard and put in the effort you fit in and are rewarded.
good,"If you enjoy being out and about all day, this is a job for you.  Depending on your locality this job can be a dead end job.  So if advancement is your plan, be mobile."
good,"In a connected world, the power of technology, transportation, information, and ideas compounds and multiplies. Businesses big and small create jobs that lift their communities. For people who are hungry for the education, goods, services and jobs that can improve their lives, a connected world is a better world. We are consistently ranked among the world’s most admired brands and employers. More than 400,000 FedEx team members are absolutely, positively focused on safety, the highest ethical and professional standards, and the needs of our customers and communities. I enjoy every bit of it."
good,Its very good company for me lots of experience its very fun for work with team i was working on five year on this company and its very good  experience for me..
good,"It was a good job required a lot of physical work the pay was good and managers were decent the environment was either hot or cold, but overall besides transportation and being there at 3 am it was fine!"
good,"Very physically demanding and inconsistent hours, but enjoy my co-workers. Always on the go which is great for those seeking to stay active, and typically can get lots of hours if you show you are competent and hardworking. "
good,"Used to be a good company but the push for greater returns by the owners specifically the Board of Directors has put a lot of stress on management and the workforce. The introduction of productivity measures, one after the other, has dampened the heretofore great enthusiasm and pride of the workforce in the company. "
good,"As with anything the people make the work place. The environment could have been much more organized and management was in obvious need of assistance, but the work experience was average. You could feel secure if you did it well and there were opportunities to learn new skills often."
good,"As a athletic person, I'd say that the purpose of this job was to do your task in a constant pace where your stamina was a key factor. lifting more than 80 Lbs was challenging sometimes but in the end of the day "" it was a good sweat"". nice experience so far."
good,"At FedEx Ground we usually just our day by stretching and having fellowship interactions with each other before we would get to work.I learned how to unload and load trailers. I've learn how to scan, assist, and direct several areas in an assembly line fashion or group. Management at FedEx 95% of the time are well trained, disciplined, and are very understanding. They are flexible and will work with in many ways than 1 whether its about availability or workplace conduct and policy. My Co-workers are pretty much like family to me. Sure there a few that we may clash a little here and there; but for the most part we get along and work as unified team to get the job at hand done. The hardest part of the job for me; probably is unloading. The Managers really like to push there product at a rapid pace and that can be rough myself and my other co-workers who unload. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with a handful of my co-workers and singing hymns while I work. That's helped me get through and weather many storms up there."
good,I worked a seasonal package handler position. By the Time the holidays were over  they asked me if I wanted a more permeate position. I declined to go back to college. a mo later they asked again if I wanted to  come back . I should of but  life happens and I couldn't. I would recommend working for them if you don't mind busting you butt. It pays off  the only draw back is it is PT work.
good,My job at fed ex consist of me coming in the morning around seven. once I get there I scan all the boxes stacked where I park my truck. then I organized the boxes in the truck and go deliver them.
good,"Will most definitely give you a workout. "
good,The typical day is intense and busy. I learned that hard work pays off and that people reward hard work. The co-workers felt like family and the hardest part of the job was the injuries .
good,"Working the early morning takes drive and time management. The management made work fair and flexible to you schedule. Co-works were nice people. The hardest part of this job was staying focus in the early morning hours, but the people around you would make your day a little better each day."
good,FedEx is a good place to work where I have learned to champion the customer. By taking a customer first mentality we build solutions that satisfy the customer need and drive revenue.
good,"Fedex is a solid job, if you do your job you will have  a place to work Its fast pace and exciting. it keeps you on your toes. Managenent is always changing. great co-worker make it easy to go to work each day."
good,"Got to meet a lot of people and build relationships with. Typical day at work, I would arrive to work around 7:00am to load my truck. Deliver to multiple locations and also did some pickups. I learned how to keep calm under pressure and the management made it easy for me to communicate with them if I had any questions."
good,The hardest part of the job is when one has to stand in the cold for over eight hrs everyday with zero heat. It makes the job very challenging and cumbersome.
good,"The hours wasn't too great, but FedEx was up to PAR on technology in logistics."
good,"throwing boxes and stacking, building palettes, "
good,"Fed Ex Ground is a large facility.I am currently employed in the international facility which is separate from the main hub.In the course of a nights work I will either unload , load' or prepare packages and verify their readiness to ship.All of these functions are done with scanners.We are a small crew in this facility and we work well together as a team.Being a part time position I get 18 hours a week ."
good,Great company to work for with a lot of possibility to advance your self. Great part time possibility. Don't know about the the benefits.
good,Fed Ex is a good job for extra holiday pay. Upper management isn't very good but the floor supervisor is great to work with. Package assembly line is on top of things and loading is fairly easy.
good,"fun place to work love the outside work .driving trucks going place to place this job keeps u fit,learn to use a scanner,learn to read a map better"
good,I work a part time position 2-4.5 hours a day. I have learned the Fedex Freight internal procedures and software. I enjoy working in a team environment and with engaged management.  The hardest part would be working evening hours and not having set hours per day.  I enjoy working with the drivers and office staff and  being able to utilize my abilities to help others.
good,I delivered packages for FedEx while maintaining a friendly demeanor to always make the company look good. I learned to be a team player for my boss taking more packages at times to help other drivers out.
good,"Many managers cover large areas of the country and are under paid,"
good,"As a package handler you have to be on que. Having to scan and load was very difficult at first but you have to get a groove going. I personally think it can be fun and stressful at the same time. Fun because when you're loading your truck correctly without error you feel good about your position but when things are hectic and you can't keep up with the moving belt full of packages then it becomes very complicated. So with that being said being a package handler is'nt the worst thing but I probably would'nt do it again."
good,great company to work for. Best way seem to grow within the company was to come from the outside...not many opportunities to grow from within. Slow building your way to better positions
good,"I volunteered at the FedEx Forum for my church.  The profits from the FedEx Forum  helped fund the children's department at the church I attend. I am the director of children's church. This was an opportunity for me to help.  I was the group leader.  We worked events that included U of M games, Grizzlies game, concerts, and many other events.  There was a lot involved in being the group leader.  I was responsible for getting a crew for each event in place, making sure customer orders were taken and filled, counting money, collecting receipts, and many other duties. This is the hardest job I ever had but one of the most rewarding"
good,Fun place to work managment not to supportive and they where all about numbers not so much aboout drivers there not to much rules just for centain people the best part was been able to talk to people that meet every day.
good,"It's a good place to work and grow as a repair technician, a very interactive environment. It's lot of hands on and parts verification and very little overtime."
good,I unloaded and loaded 55 ft. trailers with assets that where no bigger there 75 pounds .I also sorted out labels for different destination's manually on conveyor belts and scanned and scaled in and out package's .
good,"Nice place to work if you're looking to make quick cash! Ideal place to learn several processes that take place before, during, and after a package is delivered. Just like any other workplace, there are days that are better than others but good days outweigh the bad. If one is interested in attending college, FedEx is the employer that should be taken into consideration."
good,You hit the ground running as soon as you clock in.  At Fedex Express you are an Industrial Athlete.  Be prepared to work hard and steady.  Great place for a person to work that is looking for great retirement
good,"This was a pretty decent job. Great for first timers and college students. Convenient work hours during the week and depending on shift, may have weekends off."
good,You start the day at 6am . show up to terminal to start scanning in all packages assigned to you for the day. a good day is 100-150 packages .  after scanning you have to load them in to your assigned truck. then wait for all remaining packages assigned to you to show up to your rout space to complete your scanning and loading.  between 8am and 830am they will run a delete for all packages that you will not have to deliver. then you can get your paper work and start your route for the day. depending on the zip code you have been assigned you have 8-10 of delivery time left for the day
good,I would begin work at 3am every morning. It was vary fast pace past but worth it. It teaches you quick paced working style with a Tetris feel. I was responsible for loading 50+ pound boxes at a rate of 750 boxes per hour.
good,"I scan and load boxes onto a box truck, and aid the driver to deliver them. I deliver packages door to door to peoples houses and businesses."
good,"This is a very good company to work for as long as you are not at the bottom of their list of extra board road drivers. If you like doing city deliveries, then this is an excellent place to work. City drivers have the most secure position with this company. They always stay busy and always get overtime."
good,I enjoy the physical part of the job it keeps me mentally focused and healthy. I've learned how team work is necessary to maintain less stress and tension. I've learned to focus on the job regardless of the environment. My co-workers were dedicated to the job as well. The hardest part of the job is the weather conditions.
good,Good company with good benefits.  Your life is not your own.  Management will try and squeeze everything out of you in order to be productive.  If you are very productive they will try and over work you.
good,"Worked the midnight shift and unloaded the boxes that were delivered to the warehouse. I was responsible to unload 3 to 5 trailers a night within a 30-45 given time limit. I was one of the best at this task, and could perform this without sustaining any injuries or harming any packages. I was later promoted into a part-time Warehouse Manager position in which I later trained new employees."
good,Built some good relationships and never had issues with my Shift Manager. Hours were not great. I enjoy getting overtime but don't like going home early or at least not 30 min in to shift or after I've just arrived.
good,"Fast paced workplace that is HOT in the summer. This position is advertised as a part-time job, but there seems to be little opportunity for advancement or additional hours. Good people to work with, but it seems like a dead end position."
good,"It's okay for such a large company, the mass hiring process can be somewhat of a pain if you're the type who actually wants to work. I have had to address coworkers who sleep on the job, show up 1-5 hours late on a daily basis, inexperienced coworkers who give themselves supervisory positions that are not offered to them, inexperienced coworkers who try to get supervisors in trouble so they can somehow ""take"" their job, former and current drug addicts, people who have others take their skills assessments for them but when it comes down to actual work, they don't know how to log into their computer."
good,Can be a challenge to locate delivery addresses and to insure that ALL deliveries are made daily while providing excellent customer service.
good,"always lifting "
good,"A empresa em si é otima de se trabalhar, o periodo em que passei, aprendi muito com o pessoal, encarregados e supervisores, o pessoal operacional pode contar para o que precisar, apesar do pouco tempo para montar carga e despachar raros momentos de erro."
good,"Fast moving and high tempo work with little to no down time. It's very physical work needing you to pick up at least 50-75 lbs. The team as a whole there is a great one that if your positive and, willing to learn and listen they will guild and protect you as one of them. Management as a whole is OK and, they give room to work without letting everyone run free."
good,"A typical day at fedex is quick,fast paced and staying on your toes sort of speak. Management is always thinking of new ways of increasing the organization."
good,"This job is very well paced.  Many ""regulars"" come in and get their work done.  You can advance quickly if you work hard.  All co-workers are easy to get along with.  So far I haven't really had anything that is the ""Hardest"" part of the job.  But I must say I've enjoyed the great team work and help that my manager has provided me with."
good,I worked as a delivery driver helper. Running packages to high rise buildings. Meeting customers clients everyday. It was on call. I would of like more steady hours. The hardest part working at FedEx is being on call. What I enjoyed was meeting new people.
good,"Good company to work for, work life balance, moving to new technologies, need to hire more people instead of offshoring all the work."
good,"Constant contact with operations business partners, providing HR advice for real-world scenarios. Great job stability."
good,"Many opportunities for growth and overtime.  Starting pay is good and there are opportunities for mobility in the company,  Professional atmosphere and approachable managers."
good,"A typical day would consistent of several meetings, colleagues that stop by to follow up on tasks or just to say hi, and managing several projects. Management is supportive, and co-workers are pleasant to work with. The company has a great culture. "
good,"typical day was hard, and fast paced. There was a lot of running around and it was hard work. However the fast pace and phyiscal demands were a great plus it allowed me to be out in the world. Coworkers were great, it was a great teamwork atmosphere."
good,"Pleasant working environment, if only there were more hours. The company is always willing to teach and advance anyone who is willing to put in the effort. They try to ensure the best balance of life and work with their yearly surveys. These survey allows employees to state what is good, needs improving or suggestions on what need to be added to make employee's lives more balanced."
good,work starts the same day everyday Monday-Friday going through security and you open the warehouse door and you feel the rush of warm air so you know you're in the right place. management gives you the pre shift pep-talk and off to your first trailer to unload you go. if you are good at what you're doing the management leaves you alone just reminds you what time it is when it comes to overnight cut off times. On a goo day when you are all finished in your area the manager will let you go but sometimes you get unlucky and have to stay extra late to help out even if you had a valid reason to leave on time they have no problem paying overtime. There were a lot of nice people there and since you're pretty much working inside of an oven its a good way to sweat off a few pounds a week!
good,"I would get up before the sun, show up at work, clock in, and head over to unload some trucks. After about three or four trucks, I would get a different assignment, like sorting packages for the delivers to pick them up or helping to sort packages on the conveyor belts. I learned how to unload a truck properly, I learned how to sort on a conveyor belt; I learn that very heavy packages are sent to FedEx and humans have to lift them. The management was good: no complaints. My co-workers were fine, profane at times, but pretty alright. The hardest part of the job was simply not giving up after a few hours because the monotony and arduousness of the job can get to you. Like most things I do, the most enjoyable part is the people you go through the day with: my co-workers; them and getting to see the sun come up through the big bay doors."
good,Make orders for people that place orders. Management is good they work with you. co workers are great they help when needed help. Hardest part is when you left by yourself with the wieght on your shoulders. Enjoyable day at work is when everyone shows up to work and doin they job.
good,The typical day at work was to action the e-mails that need urgent attention by the individual team members. After which the team would arrive and the work team would commence doing their work.  I would oversee the progress and help to get the work done so that when the cut off for the different locations happens that all parcels are sent out.  I would then create a problem list of all the parcels kept back as well as the reasons for this.  I would then balance the parcel weights and volumetric to ensure that the amounts specified during induction is correct. After this I would ensure that all notification mails are sent to the various locations.
good,"A typical day is from 8 am to 3 pm"
good,"This is a very enjoyable place to work. The co-workers, management and the environment were immaculate. I learned several aeas in Charlotte, NC. The most enjoyable part about this job I can say would be the environment."
good,"Nice work environment, kind people. gave good working hours and shifts. my coworkers were all nice everyday i experienced the same type of work, my days were pretty steady and manageable."
good,It was a great fun job also hard work wonderful workers most days its a very high pace place to work a very early work out if you may.

good,Responsible for the inbound and outbound operations making sure all employee's worked safe and that any packages that came through the building where scanned and going to the correct location.
good,Very busy non stop work. Not good pay for the amount of work that is done in a day. Not enough workers for shifts. Lack of communication.
good,Having a fixed route that is ran Tuesday-Saturday is good and bad. It gets repetitive but pay is decent. It is bad on your personal life though.
good,Great place to grow and expand career. Excellent training opportunity and chance for career growth. Enjoyed working with customers.
good,"Grande empresa, ótima para trabalhar, profissionais que nela trabalham são totalmente capacitados para as funções, mas por se tratar se uma filial ainda muito nova as oportunidades de crescimento ainda são poucas.."
good,"Every day is a challenging day."
good,FedEx Office is a good entry level employer. You get to complete a variety of tasks and gain valuable experience. Sr. Management can be turbulent and there can be a lot of hypocritical actions.

good,"Typical night at work starts at 10 30 ends @ 5"
good,"Fedex has a lot of opportunity to move up in the company and gives several benefits.  However, I had a short experience with the company due to being a holiday temporary worker."
good,The hours were so-so but if you're going to be up at 4:30 to lift boxes at least get full time hours to do so.
good,"Christmas can be a challenge especially the first few years, but if you can make it through that season and you don't mind driving in the snow sometimes then it's a good place to work."
good,Its a great job for someone in good shape. The managers are fun and very involved. They also cater food for us when we dont have any misloads.
good,"depending on the day, I would be unloading, or sorting , or inducting, or fixing boxes. I learned alot about how to pack a box and it not get damaged. And the different zip codes and where they go. Management was always stressed out and not really good at listening but then again there was really good ones that cared and would find a way to help you. As for the coworks, many came and went in the same amount of time it took to train them. Although the ones that did stay were so cool people. the hardest part about working at fedex was just the pure physical labor and all the bruises you got. and the most enjoyable part of the job was the physical labor and the work out, no need to go to the gym."
good,FedEx is a great company to start any career. The opportunities for students to begin with this company is great. The opportunity to learn and succeed is based on each department and the management or individuals within each department. Job security is based on how successful the company is doing.
good,"I liked working there. I made some good friends there."

good,"Fed Ex is a fast pace industry to work in especially during the holidays. A typical day at work for me would be a lot of things I was usually all over the place, but usually I would include scanning a lot of boxes and loading them into trucks. There wasn't really any hard part about the job as long as you mesmerized the numbers on the box regarding which city or state it goes to."

I also, enjoyed the follow ship and family environment that existed at the company."

good,"I was proud to be employed by a Fortune 500 Company such as Federal Express. If you like physical labor, being employed by Federal Express is the job for you. With any job these days, there is no job security; it is what you bring to the table as an employee."
good,When I was an employee at Fed Ex our manager would offer prizes and other little awards to the forklift operator who would have the fastest but safest load or unload time on each trailer. It kept the employees interested and it gave us something to work towards. I learned how to be an efficient and safe forklift operator at the same time handle a forklift with safety. My co-workers were some of the best people I have worked with since I worked at six flags when I was 17. The most enjoyable part of my job was the awards.
good,"clock in, pull containers clock out. cool managers, some cool coworkers, no breaks, no hours though."
good,"Typical big company confusion. this all I can say I have nothing else to say my statement about big companies speaks for itself. Busy work for appearances. Promotions for select few ""Golf playing "" employees. The most enjoyable part of the job was sense of accomplishment when something was fixed."

good,It was a good place to work. You are always busy so time goes by real fast. The pay was not bad but the lack of benefits was a discouragement. The hardest part of the job was making sure I had all of the packages. Once I was moving the job was easy.

good,"A typical day at work is interacting with ground service equipment, freight and airplanes.  I have learned many lessons in life from working at FedEx. I have learned about leadership, teamwork, personal accountability, and hard work.  In my opinion, management could be a lot better, but there are still some good managers out there.  The hardest part of the job is the weather to me.  We are out in the elements year round.  We are outside during the coldest part of winter to the hottest part of summer.  The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people."
good,Overall I have a great work experience and i love going to work and being treated with a lot of respect and just seeing everyone happy.
good,"Typical day at work is full of emails, calls and walk in customers. Helps one to maintain the level of productivity even under pressure. "
good,"A typical day at FedEx can vary depending your position. I was in three different positions. Typical can be going through screening going to meeting, hard labor which includes walking all night picking up heavy packages and putting them in baggage carts or on to the belt, and getting something to stay hydrated in between. In another area you may be standing in one spot pushing off packages ranging from really big to very small, making sure they are in the right spot, and making sure the belt doesn't stop. You could also be taking packages of the slide, scanning, and stacking in the can properly all night. In my other area we had a meeting every night, sit and stand around until we get a plane, either operate machinery, be manually pushing cans into the plane, driving cans to proper area, filling out paper work, or be taking packages out of the belly of the plane. We repeated that process all night, for the most part sitting waiting until we got a plane. There is no typical weather at FedEx. We work rain, sleet, or snow. "
good,"Currently processing payroll for over 260K employees. Daily interact with Human Resources concerning employees who are on Leave of Abscence, Terminated, FMLA, etc. We process checks for employees who has either lost checks or missing hours.

good,"I would start my day setting up the packages in my truck in order to make my delivery route as efficient as possible. I would deliver the packages to the given addresses.

Dispatchers also must be able to multitask by viewing multiple screens and answering the phone at the same time.
good,A typical day at work was cool only because I worked along. The hardest part about the job was getting the packages to the customers house due to traffic.
good,"a typical day at work is pretty difficult, lifting packages everyday and making sure they get to the correct destination. the co workers at the job are very friendly and helpful. the hardest part of the job is probably the hours I work. and the most enjoy part would have to be being able to be myself in the line of work that I do"
good,"the pay rate for this job was good , the downside to the job was no benefits, no room to advance and not able to show my talent except driving talent. the work day varied  due to the weather and number of packages but manageble"
good,"2008-2012 I work for FedEx Ground Hub 305..."
good,"A typical evening at work for me usually consisted of me running the small package area, while also maintaining the cleanliness of each belt line which was making sure all packages that were not found on file, to be put on file. Management was for the most part laid back and didn't have too many issues with them, other than the common trials and tribulations of employee vs management. Co-workers were always fun and tolerable. Very much a team work enviroment, once the turn over slow down on new hires. Hardest part of the job, was standing on the concrete floor or even the weather had a harsh effect on you because there's little heat in a warehouse and no air conditioning. The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing that I could do it by myself and recognized every now and then for my hard work, especially because I worked all the way up to 8 1/2 months pregnant!"
good,"a typical work day was pretty busy, i learned how to work at a face pase,the hardest part was not really having a break"

good,"A typical day at work is fast paced. there are many different things you can things you can learn as long as you show you want to learn them. Majority of the workers palletize and wrap pallets while others are scanning, splitting lines, helping with returns, unloading or loading trucks. I learned how to use a Pallet Scanner, HRSA tag printer, how to load trailers and unload trailers full of boxes. I've learned I need to put myself ""out there"" if I want to learn more and move up in the company. The management I believe are really good and know what they are doing. I feel that some of my co-workers misunderstand them and their reasoning for what they do or say."

good,"Loaded and unloaded planes, had a decent manager, she promised alot of movement, but never happened. Passed all the required tests for advancement."
good,"A typical day at work was entering employees time cards.  Each data entry keeper had a certain amount of time cards each day they had to eat with in a limited time.  The faster the work gets done the earlier one can go home.  That was the best part.  It was a part time job, if a time keeper works under 17 hours, they will get their guarantee of 17 1/2 hours.  The hardest part of the job is making sure there were no mistakes.  Any mistype one can count against the time keeper.  The management was okay, there were times when he did not want to listen what the time keepers had to say because he seem to always have to delegate majority of what he want to be done.  Over all, the aura in the office was very good energy and it was filled with woman.  Everyone got along GREAT."
good,"when i was currently working at fedex it was  fast pace environment with alot of dangers example: chemicals,heavy lifting,machinery at times was abit frustrating when work colleueges expected me to put more effort into my role then they did management was really good with orders an time management controls the hardest part was keeping up the pace to ensure deadlines was met if co-workers was not pulling there own weight i enojoyed unloading an loading of vans and lorries"

Also I Learned How To Load A Trucks And The Proper Way To Deal With Damages. My Co-Workers Weren't All The Same Some Hard Workers And Respectful Some Irresponsible And Disrespectful. The Hardest Part Of The Job I Say Would Be Completing The Task In The Given Time Because Of The Complication Of The Workers Who Barely Work.  The Most Enjoyable Part Of The Job Would Have Been The Meals And Benefits We Received Working There."
good,My typical day at work consist of me making sure the customers boxes got to the customer on time and not damage. At the same time of making sure it gets to them on time i had to get out all rejecting lights if i had any and get the light out. When a light rejects that means the productivity of that trailer is going down. Also i had to go and break jams if the shoot was backed up. The management their was fair. If you had a promblem or needed help usually the manager will be reasonable and work with you. Co- workers were great because i never had a promblem with anyone and i get along with anyone. The hardest part of the job will have to be peak-season. Whick occurs around christmas due to everyone shipping through them. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that your doing your job on time and right.
good,sort and load packages onto trucks marked accordingly.  Unjam belt.  Try not to hurt myself.
good,Physically demanding job with good pay. Sometimes requires long hours especially during the holidays. Good job to have that helps one learn the city better. Amazingly quick workdays cause you are usually real busy
good,"This was a fast paced time sensitive position, you almost need to be an athlete for this job.  Management was good, but under pressure constantly to cut costs, which left the employees looking for supplies that were not available, but needed to do the job successfully.  Good training, not much area for advancement."
good,"Pressão , correria e muitas cobranças são rotina.Tenho muitas informações diversas diariamente , o que é bom por que me trás varias novas experiencias  aprendizados pra vida.

Just as how there are opportunities to learn new skills, FedEx also helps to promote your education through their student reimbursement program. There are several other benefits that help the employees at FedEx, be it health benefits or discounts from several brand companies. Overall, FedEx is a good place to work at."
good,We would offload aircraft and then on-load different aircraft ready for take off. We would need to work in all weather conditions as well as work safely.

good,"Typical day starts at 6:45am you do a daily walk around your truck, organize your truck for you day, and then you get sheet of pickups for the day. Then you start your day. You can make between 65 and 150 stops a day on average. My favori.te thing is that you meet a lot of people and it can be a lot of fun u build friendships over a period of time. Because your customers actually become your co-workers you see them everyday.  The hardest part of delivers is time schedule, weather, and you can't make everyone happy."
good,"hard work"
good,the most enjoyed about my job where my customers and drove a nice rig had a route that was fun
good,The best part of working here is that you stay busy constantly and you get to excersise at the same time. The hardest part of the job is having over 200 packages a day to deliver by your self with out a helper.

good,Great place to work if you want to go to school. No tuition but decent pay and cool co-workers to make the shift fly by.
good,"A typical day at FedEx ground would be coming in around 3am for an overnight shift.  The process would be to unload trucks that would come in throughout the early morning.  The trucks would be unloaded and separated to other various delivery trucks before the drivers would come in.  Management and co workers worked together as a unit to complete the tasks and to ensure that all drivers would be able to get out in a timely fashion to start their deliveries.  The hardest part of the job was coming in at 3am.  During holidays can be the most difficult due to volume of packages.  Being that it was a part time position, there were no benefits.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being apart of a team oriented group.  I enjoyed making things easier for the drivers once they came in.  Whether it was loading a truck or working the split tower to ensure accurate service for time."
good,"Large Dock, a lot of room to grow within the company, they promote hiring within the company"
good,Great retirement benefits. This is all that I care to share.
good,"Working for FedEx Ground, you are allowed to run your route in any way you feel best. I have a route in Holland and as long as I make my scheduled pickups, I can deliver the packages in any order. I start at 7:30am and am usually done by 5:00pm. It is a lot of physical work but also enjoyable. "
good,Loved the customers that I was delivering the packages to. Loved how the customers used to asked other drivers about me and where I was when I didn't delivered their packages because I had to help another driver on his/her route. 
good,"a day as an FedEx Home Delivery driver would consist of, first you get to the terminal(warehouse), where you would scan and load all packages that belonged to your route on your truck. Then you would do a simple inspection of your vehicle, by checking tires, fluids, lights, and etc. Once that was done you would get your delivery manifest and turn-by-turn directions, then you drive to your first delivery stop and from there on its safety, safety, safety. You have to be alert scanning the road ahead and listening for people or other motorist. Just like any other job FedEx has its days, some are easy and some are horrible, for me rainy days in the winter is the worst;  cause not only are cold but also wet, but to counter that spring days are the best and getting to be outside the office and actually meeting people and talking to them."
good,"i learned how to work independently "
good,"The lines of communication are not always clear between upper management and front line employees. Work groups try to work together, but at times fall into the idea of separate work responsibilities between shifts. I learned a lot about the value of teamwork and time management. Without question the best part of the job is the feeling of actually helping your customer and the relationships you develop between co-workers. "
good,fast pace work environment good team work but bad communication with management and between supervisors...
good,"After clocking in for the night shift we would have a team meeting going over productivity from the day before or the whole week before if it's a Monday. Once the buzzer sounds it's time to work. I worked the loading side mainly where we packed boxes onto trucks making sure to scan everyone before doing so in a timely manner. Sometimes I worked the unloading side which is simple, removing boxes from trucks and moving them down the line."
good,"You begin the day by a morning meeting then the morning sort begins and your duties may include offloading boxes or scanning in the inbound freight. Then you get to your truck and organize your deliveries and leave the station to begin your delivery cycle/pickup cycles. Management is available to assist in balancing your workload or any other concerns that you may have about your day. You work closely with your neighboring routes to cover any outlying deliveries that lay between the routes or to assist if you can. The people your working with in most cases makes the situation manageable. This is the key here. In many cases the mandates and policies that roll down and are intermittently enforced by a management team that has its priorities changed on a weekly basis can hinder your ability to be truly effective. Now the customer can dictate when they would like a delivery or a reattempted delivery, regardless of your situation. This is a big con now. If you have a high mileage rural route you may be asked to go back and get a delivery off at the end of your day. "
good,it fast paced very stressful but fun in a way but with suck up managements
good,"Handled stock inventory for various locations and served as driver."
good,"Hard hours, very repetitive tasks.  A typical warehouse stacking job."
good,Es una buena empresa para labrar lamentablemente sus salarios dejan mucho por esperar.
good,"Lots of busy work. No matter how well we did, we would be required to push a little bit higher everyday. "
good,I like the company's overall policy. It considers the safety and practical needs of the people balance with the company. Locally the upper management doesn't follow the overall company policy to the extent it should.
good,"its a job,you can work part time or full time and make 350-415 a week"
good,"My day starts off by picking up our non cons(non conveyable) products and i unload them from baggage carts. Then load them into our cans we ship the freight in. Later in the day i drive to go pick up our heavy weights and take them to plan, then go to pick up lives if we have them and take them to plane. Basicly i drive and run earins for whatever managment needs from me. The most injoyable part of the job is responcibility. Ive learned how to drive carfuly in crazy surroundings and how to do paper work."
good,"A typical day at work was constantly busy, although, there were slow days. The managers were helpful when it came to a very busy morning. The co-workers were strong-minded, some were very weak. The hardest part of the job was having a trailer full of packages and your partner is slow and very weak. I really enjoyed unloading trailers and sorting packages oppose to loading the trailers."
good,Truck driver in a team operation for Custom Critcal. Good Company.
good,"Nothing excited, went in did what you had to do until the next shift."
good,"Customer service and sales focused workplace. A place where you can learn multitasking, troubleshooting and the latest software technology. Management is not the best, the standards need to go up. Hiring standards and educational requirements need to be increased to a higher level. The hardest part of the job is lifting heavy weights. The most enjoyable part of it is the different daily challenges."
good,"What I have learned is how to be a leader and lead other people as well as manager costumer products in and out of the warehouse. I am also incharge of making sure my employees are paid correctly and also doing their job correctly. I learn more and more about teamwork each and every day and also learn how to value our employees that report to me on a day to day basis. I work constantly with 3rd party vendors such as the post office and temp staffing agency. I take and handle costumer calls and request. I have traveled numerous times for FedEx around the U.s to help other hubs and also take management classes and trainings. the mosy enjoyable part is my co-managers, We have built a family like bond from working together so long. The hardest part is the work life balance."
good,This job was hard labor but the pay and employees were good. It was an in and out type of job and there was a lot of discipline involved.
good,"It was hard-labor, slave-like work for a few hours a day. They won't provide you with back braces or gloves to work with, and they won't provide water or give you a break to get water. You're working in an environment that can go from 20 degrees to 120 degrees, depending on the season obviously. And there's no room for moving up. They won't allow progression. At least that's what I was told."
good,ok company to work for. they have great benefits.the management is ok. my coworkers are great. the is very easy and the enjoyable part is my coworkers.
good,"A day at Fedex Ground in Columbia started with the unloading of trucks. The packages unloaded were sent down conveyers and sorted to their appropriate belts. They were then scanned and loaded onto the right delivery trucks. I learned how to think and act fast and be accurate at the same time. Management was good and the employees were hard workers and fun to be around. The hardest part is learning how each driver likes his truck loaded. The most enjoyable was the banter between co-workers, they do a good job keeping the mood light in the warehouse."
good,"I worked from 11pm until we got off, usually between 2 and 4am. Work was fast paced, little talking or socializing. Constant repetitive movement. Scanned packages, sorted packages, inducted packages, relabeled packages."
good,My shift is not so great because sometimes I'm the only person there and I could be getting a lot of calls all at once.
good,through my experience from working there i can honestly say i love working there because there was quite a bit to do and the salary was bad either.
good,Fed ex was a descent company to work for. They were pretty flexible with me with my schedule as I was attending school full time. It was physical labor which I did not mind. It forced me to learn how to get around the city of South Bend.
good,love everything about the job dealing with the best coworkers
good,FEDEX is a great place to work if you enjoy working with a diverse crowd. Work is very physical but can be rewarding. Some policyies and procedures need to be updated.
good,very vast pace intence workplace but very exciting place to work
good,"Going off my most recent memory, the job teaches you alot and provides advancement in various skill sets. the hardest part is the favoritism i experienced where i wasn't always trained properly or helped in times of need compared to my coworkers. the advancement is based on your bosses opinion on you."
good,"This is a company that has the ability to produce great and talented leaders. They promote education, communication, and gratification."
good,I mainly dealt with customers trying to resolve any and all problems. Did help with the dispatching with the drivers
good,once you leave building you get to run your day by your own way ...get to enjoy meeting new people ..work outside when weather is good but not fun in bad weather ..stressful having to drive with all other drivers on the road that dont pay attention
good,"It's a typical night at the sort operations, you get physical and of course learn the services and knowledge from FedEx."
good,Very productive and fast pace environment. Job security is a plus as well as job advancements.
good,Great place for individuals who are focused on one specific career
good,"Fun environment with great people always working safe, oppurtunities to see the world."
good,"High paced office environment, professional, small sized office with about ten full time office employees."
good,Lovely place of employment! Alternative Dispute Resolution cases are exciting to read and follow up on. There is simply never a dull day here in Human Resources.
good,"A Typical Shift At Work Is- It's Guarenteed To Be A Long And Busy Shift , There Is Never A Night Shift That We Can Call Easy,"
good,being on time daily working at a fast steady paste managers sat back and observed co-worked together to finish in time loading trucks was the hardest part but i didn't mind because the other co-workers was there to help if anyone got behind i enjoyed my surroundings the most at this job
good,Come in in late afternoon find truck to use and pre-trip before getting handheld devices from office.Then sign on to route and check how many pick-ups for that day before leaving the building.The hardest part of job is making time commit while driving safe on the route.But when picking up at customer building or house the best part of job is the happy reaction from the customer when arrived on time.When returning back to building and working sort had so much fun with co-workers while unloading and loading trucks.My manager was understanding and fun to work for.If I was full-time would still be working for FedExpress.
good,A typical day at work is a visit to one of my FedEx Office locations. Where I will perform a normal center visit and check on all things technologically related.
good,"I work indirectly for FedEx. I work for a subcontractor. The benefits, stock options and other perks that comes with the title of working for FedEx does not apply to the employees of subcontractors."
good,i work very hard every day. the most part that i enjoy is that i know peolple everyday and enjoy that every day is different. the hardest part of the work is that i am a partime and i need another job..
good,"Fedex Office is a fast paced enviroment where you have to perform all the tasks in the center, from your duties as a customer service to managers duties doing the daily financials. It is a place where you learn to multitask and acquire more and more responsibilities."
good,"Ive learned alot about the transportation field but they say you can work your way up, but i have yet too and my boss always denies me transferring to a different location because he knows i do everything the way it supposed to be done! My coworkers range in age from 19 to 45."
good,Goals and initiatives continually change. I have been exposed to several organizations and functions throughout the company. I work with a fantastic team of individuals.
good,"Day at fedex hard work little hours but if you have a good work group management its ok because sometime the management will help u out if u need help now the hardest part is the wheather working in heavy rain,snow and wind and the fun at work is the team."
good,A typical day at work would be helping customers with their needs. Depending on the area or the city you work in customer situation vary. Over the years I have learned a lot about computers and software. The higher corporate management is not very good. They implement a lot of changes all the time that don't work. On the center level it depends on the person running the store. Co-workers are okay. The hardest part of my job was dealing with my co-workers complaints and adversity with each other. Most enjoyable part was working with people and solving their problems.
good,a typical day at work: Hard work and stress for not enough hours.
good,"- Everyday is different, deal with new and different issues on a daily basis."
good,"Very physical need to be in good shape, very stressfull at times a lot of walking, you get to meet alot of people very good pay"
good,This job was fast-paced and it gave me skills for future oppurtunities. The hardest part of the job was maintaining my work speed for several hours. I am thankful for the talents and knowledge i have picked from this place
good,Busy
good,long day. Great job for anyone that does not minebeingout in the elements.
good,"It's a great company to work for if you are a single person, long hours are usually required. The office politics are awful, the only way you can move up is if you're well liked by others. If you are not, then you are forced out by being treated badly. If you bring it up to upper management, you are ignored and HR does not do anything about it. The only thing they care about is if the work gets done."
good,"I enjoyed working for Fedex. I resigned because I was promoted to full time, which in return mandated me to a split shift. The required my travel over 100 miles a day."
good,Overall it is a job for someone who can handle hard labor. Packer handler must also acquire a good sense of spacial thought in loading packages in trailers.
good,"Produced high value-added logistics, transportation and related business services through focused operating companies and met in the highest quality manner appropriate to each market segment served."
good,Paid more and hire full time quicker. Environment is ok. Management picks favorites. Workers are friendly and helpful. Needs heat. Haven’t gave me a raise in a whole year no cost of living raise like promised in interviews
good,"Many packages to sort. Hardest part is waking up at midnight. Other than that, it was a decent job. Great for people who want a second job to get more money."
good,"very decent, gave the opportunity to meet others and travel. brought upon new opportunities and experiences. learned new things everyday, and helped to expand my horizon."
good,"At FedEx you can move up quickly and advance the skills you just have to have the time.  The work is fast pace just stay positive, stay away from negativity be strong you can make it and be safe at all times."
good,Not a bad place to work but the weather and some managers are not making employees want to stay....employees needs to be carried along by the top managements.
good,Good job easy to do just got have to learn to stay strong when Under pressure. Great benefits and suitable job . I like how simple is it once I got the hang of the job
good,A typical day at fed ex was sweaty and hard work. Its almost like your getting paid to workout. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep up with the other experienced workers.
good,I enjoy the job just looking for something better I learned a lot im just ready to find something bigger that pays more. FedEx is a good company to work for the raises are just slow..
good,"bien, je fais une navette Blagnac-rodez  tous les jours"
good,"I like the work if it wasn't so demanding from the peers around you. Some safety things need to be looked at, if I were the hub manager I would baby-proof the hub because everything will hurt you if your not careful or not"
good,"El trabajo no es pesado sin embargo no existe organización y debido a ello se pierde tiempo y se retrazo el trabajo, es necesario implementar mejoras"
good,"Good company to work for. Great people. The pay is just not there to live on"
good,very company to work for the management team is very good and they help you whenever they can. there is a lot of team work involved oportunities for career pr=ogression vary
good,"FedEx is a very cool place to work for, most likely your gonna get along with your coworkers and most managers! I didn’t mind the work however it does take a toll on your body, and 15 minutes is not enough time to recoup, lifting packages, tires, refrigerators, carpets, air conditioners, etc requires a well needed break."
good,"FedEx Express is a great place to work, it's work policy are in relation to everyday safe and care environment in the workplace"
good,I pack box’s in the trailer that came off the belt I had to work by myself it was fast working I had to lift a little heavy box’s and stack the box’s good
good,Fed ex taught me the value of teamwork and hard work it taught me how to lead and be better everyday. Fed ex taught me how to ask for help when needed and get things done in a fast opportune time. Fed ex also taught me how to work with other people and bd appreciative of them
good,The work  was fast paced and tough. Constant deadlines and they had to be adhered to if you were to be considered for anything else in terms of advancement.
good,I like the way that the harder you work the more you are compensated. This allows for you to increase or decrease your workload and pay fairly easily.
good,"a typical day would be around 8 hours "
good,I worked  at FedEx for over 20 years. It was a good job with good pay. I enjoy working  with people .I also enjoy working indoors as well as outdoors.
good,A empresa e top mas o que mata são os gestores dela
good,Great place to work with the right management. great pay and hours. Also if the management was better the work place wouldn't be so confusing. Also would make things a lot better.
good,Fedex was a very fast pace job that required you to reach new goal every week. I learned that if you work hard enough you can make it a career. hardest part about this job is getting used the work. But if you put in the hard work you can do great things with the company.
good,"Decent place to work. They work with you if you have anything come up. Open door policy. Good work schedule until peak season starts. There are two shifts, outboad and inbound. You get cross trained in different areas."
good,"Pros: "
good,"Working at FedEx was both challenging and satisfying.  Over the years, it took patience and an ability to continually reinvent yourself to remain a viable contributor.  Excellent workplace culture and work/life balance made it a pleasure to come to work each day."
good,FedEx Freight used to be Viking Freight System but Fedex bought the company it was a excellent company before Fedex took over and it’s a good company now .
good,"Work in Progress, with lots of areas for improvement. Great place to learn and also improve your skills and better yourself. Diverse workforce. Great melting pot."
good,"FedEx Corporation is a holding company, which engages in the provision of a portfolio of transportation, e-commerce, and business services.  It is a high intensity work environment which is exciting and poses unique challenges at times."
good,I love to work at FedEx ground i really enjoyed the time time that i work for FedEx it was challenging and comparative i love challenges and hard work
good,"very advanced work place, very friendly workers "
good,"Fast paced, demanding work environment, particularly for rural routes.  The most rewarding aspect was building relationships and meeting customer service goals."
good,"Was better b4 they took tnt on.. All in all was good crack job was easy got paid on time every week, lorries could do with being earlier in to tip so th drivers can get out on the road but im sure the big wigs will b working on it somehow."
good,"I enjoyed the fast paced environment, which always kept me on my toes. Adapting to the weather was difficult at times, but I was able to work through it and meet my requirements."
good,"Being a package handler at FedEx can be a very fast paced job. Requires a substantial amount of labor work. I do not recommend this job if you are not physically able to lift, push, and pull heavy or light objects."
good,"É uma boa empresa igual a todas que tem seus prós e contras,deixa a desejar na infraestrutura no ambiente de trabalho"
good,"No day is ever the same. Busy with minimal supervision. Must be able to multitask between phones and emails. Problem solving is a must.Hardest part is locating missing freight at the airlines, but it's rewarding to solve issues for customers and reassure them that everything will work out."
good,Fedex was a very good company to work for would still be working for them had I not made a mistake. The pay is good the workers you work with are even better if only the service center manager was actually decent at his job
good,you are kept constantly busy . I enjoyed helping the customers. Hardest part was to keep your head when you have an irate customer on the phone. I learned that patience is a virtue. the most enjoyable part is when you can give the customer everything that they need in one call.
good,"This is a great company.  The job training is lacking though, which makes the first six months unnecessarily stressful.  However, there is a lot of opportunity to advance, especially if you are willing to relocate."
good,"The company is way to strict, like being back m in the military. They use you as a machine.Not concerned about your home life just do your job. Company is so big they lost contact with important issues and dwell on petty unproductive issues,aka cloths , beat the clock, minor protical infractions, instead of really focusing on customer, and worker issues."
good,"Overall, FedEx has been a great place to work. As with most companies, things have changed over the years, but all in all, I would recommend it to anyone."
good,i actually like this company you can make great money  the people are very fun to work with and the environment is good as well just life balance might be off a lil but great overall
good,It was a great company to work at I made many friends and I lost a lot of weight and made enough money to get into school at Santa Fe and to move into a apartment.
good,"Good place to work, fast paced and pay was fair. Had good health insurance. If you work had you can get promoted. I started as a package handler and work you to quality assurance."
good,"It’s a great company, it all depends on who your manager. Beside that you can move up in the company. Great benefits. Transfer around the the world. Great people."
good,It is a very good career with many opportunities for advancement. The only thing consistent about this job is it is always changing so being comfortable in that environment is key for success.
good,FedEx was a great job however no one with bills can make it with 200 dollars a week. I feel as if it should be more but overtime was time in a half and it still was not good money.
good,I loved my job as a package handler and loved my co workers. Always had fun and a lot of laughs every night. Also got a good workout every night.  Just not enough hours and the job takes a toll on your body after awhile
good,I have enjoyed working at FedEx. I am a temp so that makes my experience a little more negative than I believe it usually is. The actual FedEx employees seem to be treated very well. I feel a little overlooked as a temp. We don't get the same amenities and because of security we also don't get a lot of clearance.
good,"FedEx is a good p/t or second job. Package handlers work hard, the pay is fair and the only expectations are that you show up, keep up, work safely and do your job. Some benefits are available to p/t employees too."
good,Work is demanding and work/life balance is not the best.  This will vary from location to location.  The company is very safety and people oriented.  The most satisfying aspect of the job is providing great customer service.
good,"It's a good job, however their isn't much room for growth as far as subcontractors go. I would consider it a job and not so much a career. That being said it pays decent for the work that is required."
good,"It's the same thing all day, everyday.  I worked at FedEx Trade Networks and it's simply a call center...inbound and outbound.  You call on shipments arriving in the US and get the missing information for the US Customs entry."
good,"It is a high stress, fast paced environment.  You must be able to adapt to last minute changes.  Must be thick skinned, again, things are hectic on the sort.  Once you are out on the road,if you are a delivery driver, you are, for the most part, in charge of your day."
good,"I was always busy and that was good-people worked to help each other however, the hard part is the management did not talk to each other, so there was often confusion."
good,"It’s a good job, just wasn’t for me I didn’t just want to be moving boxes everyday all day I’d rather be in a place like Walmart or the Airport not that hot warehouse."
good,I was excited to work for such a company. I had my doubts about how they were hiring me and they were warranted. If you can be a part of this kind of job then I highly suggest that you do whatever you can to maintain the status quot.
good,Has it's flaws but overall a decent place to work. They took good care of me when I was injured on the job. Some parts of the job are fast paced because of shipping deadlines but I was prepped well where I was working
good,I love working for fedex. They are not a perfect company but they pay well and give you the adequate training you need. They try to maintain a positive work environment at all times.
good,Very physically demanding labor job that consisted of long days that were fast paced and your performance was judged very carefully. Pay was alright but paid time off build up was extremely slow.
good,The job was typical manual labor for a warehouse of package delivery. Most people tend to keep to themselves and do not focus on any other task but work.
good,"In general it's good. Depends on which station you work out of. All stations aren't the same as far as productivity and how it's managed. For the most part you clock in, report to belt sort on time, load your truck, and leave when the sort is over. You interact with your customers everyday and have a sense of independence on the road. When finished you head back to the station....get gas if needed....do your paperwork....clock out and go home."
good,Loading and unloading boxes scanning packages to go onto trucks Fast paced work environment a lot Heavy lifting Decent place to work for The pay is not that well People are friendly and Really nice
good,"As a truck unloader, I can say that this was definitely a hard job. Very fast past working with heavy boxes. If your looking to lose some weight while you work this is the job for you"
good,"Overall, I really enjoyed working for FedEx. I worked for 2 separate divisions of FedEx and did some travel/on-site work as a contractor at a 3rd division. "
good,"Fast paced and dirty work environment. Other co-workers were very helping, often more than someone in a leadership position. overall was a pretty good place, just have to be mentally ready to do the same challenging work every day."
good,"Some good and bad days but overall management was great and helpful. Everyday we were required to call in to see what time sort start being, instead of having a set schedule."
good,Not a bad place to work at all. Co-workers and managers are friendly and approachable. An open door concept is encouraged and maintained. Very decent work environment.
good,"•	Managed daily operations making changes to achieve long and short term metrics/goals. "
good,"i would recommend. To a hard working  individual meet new people work steady.gain experience through new challenges. friendly staff understandable workers.how to communicate with others.most "
good,"hard labor job but overall the pay and benefits are really great. you start off in the sort where they sort the mail and freight, then they train you to do flights after."
good,FedEx is a good place to work but they will micromanage you all day. They like for it to be a quiet environment so very little talking. They think their employees are robots.
good,great working alone and great customers you load your own truck  great people to work with the package handlers are great to work with      it is also in a good and safe area
good,"Some days the work place would be rough and last for ever, but there are some days where you would end up standing in your work area and do nothing, so it was chill."
good,"Typical work week fast pace, stressful, unpredictable, weather conditions, and customer interaction."
good,"The company has gone through changes as well as other companies. The company has grown over the years around the world    and is still growing. A typical day at work is moving trailers around the work area. The workplace culture has changed with young people that do not have the drive as older ones. The hardest part of the job is adjusting to my change of assignments each day. The most enjoyable part of the job is, when management has gone. The time then is when I will not be micro managed."
good,Great place to work especially if you are just starting out in the working world or re-entering the work place. Full-time benefits for all personnel whether you are part-time or full time. Paid vacation and discounts. Flight benefits as well.
good,At FedEx it would be 5 hour shift but in those 5 hours it would be fast paced and stressful. There would be tons of packages at times. It would seem impossible to keep up but honestly it was good. With fast paced work ethics it’s possible. I made tons of friends which was definitely a plus.
good,"Management could be better, everything else was not so bad. I appreciate the experience I gained from working at Fed-Ex and still recommend this to most people who ask about it"
good,"You learn how to work with those around you because you will need their help early on to build routines. Most people, at least those that I encountered, were very willing to answer all questions ad even take their time to lend a hand. Yes more often than  not they might be helping you due to the fact that you are in their way but then they would offer up some advice. With that job you must learn efficiency and quickly because its a lot of money you are moving and one late or  broken shipment can cost the come a lot of money. Truly the more difficult part of the job is the weather. Be prepared because whatever the weather outside, it can be ten times worse. Yet with that being said, for me there is no better feeling than knowing that when you clock out, it was a jib well done."
good,"FedEx had its run during the e-commerce boom of the late 90's and early 2000's. Before the financial crisis of 2008, there was so much overtime available that I nearly doubled my salary from 2004 to 2007, making almost 6-figures as a Courier for about 3 years! That all changed in 2009 and from then on, FedEx has just gone downhill. Bring in Amazon and the announcement of their logistics and transportation plans for the future and that made things even worse for FedEx. Today, it is hard to even get a full-time position at FedEx. Shipping volume has declined tremendously that employees go to work in the morning only to be told to go home 2 hours later because there are no packages to deliver. The planes are always arriving late and for this reason, managers tell those couriers who haven't been told to go home, to take their lunch breaks, as early as 8am! Any overtime is available on a seniority basis but even that isn't available anymore. Favoritism is a huge problem corporate wide. Every station I have worked in has issues with favoritism and employee morale just tanks! The most enjoyable part of the job for me was working at the RAMP (Airport hub). There you would see how the supply chain worked and at times, talk to the flight crew and I was just proud to be in that type of environment. What I disliked was how FedEx did not believe in lay-offs. Simply, they would begin to terminate employees for whatever reason they deemed necessary to make year-end budget."
good,"Working at FedEx is fast, energetic and physically taxing.  It is a three hour job and it is fast paced.  Managers are on the floor at all time to answer quesbtions and keep pace going."
good,I love the fact that it a job that you work as a team and you get to learn the business of shipping and receive. They teach you how to not only packages and scan and order picker
good,Very good job to work for if you don't have children. It is fast paced. Great benefits. You will usually work between 8-12 hours per day. Poor management. They are only looking out for themselves. It's hard to move up to the next step. If they give you a letter it is impossible.
good,You can move around and up quickly but not as quickly as they intially tell you. You'll probably have to be there for 6 months to a year and even then depending on your location is hard.
good,"I love fed ex as a whole , i just want more myself and to progress up the ladder . I work at a location where it’s only 3 people including me and hours are limited"
good,exciting fast-paced employment. the management was fair and helpful. a great place to meet people and deliver a good service and be helpful to customers.
good,Good coworkers in a fast work paced environment. Some supervisors are okay. Some of the older guys will not pick every single thing they see whiether it’s over time or anything at all. Overall good job though.
good,"My typical workday is just that. I start my day at 9:30 and either I'm driving the Raymond swing lift, Or I'm helping my team pull the warehouse packages. The most enjoyable part of my day is when I'm going home."
good,It was a great company until I got laid off due to the rising cost of gasoline at the time.Security is always a non revenue department and the first to get cut. I was making double the salary of anew co-worker so I was laid off.
good,"Good job, hot in the summer and cold in the winter. pay starts out good but hours are not guaranteed. Ive personally never been in the drama but have seen it first hand"
good,The only thing I didn't like about working in the warehouse was that when it was cold outside it was the same inside and the summer was the same very hot outside and very hot inside but if you worked in the office you had nothing to worry about  but the money was ok at the time but I had to find other employment when I got pregnant not for pregnant women
good,"FedEx's culture is open to allow individuals explore, learn and grow. "
good,FedEx Custom Critical is a wonderful place to work.  They treat the employees very well.  There is a lot of different situations and problem solving that we do that makes the job interesting.
good,I would recommend this type of work to anyone that likes to drive and meet new people. It teaches how to interact with the public and residential areas.
good,The benefits are unmatched. Plenty of room for advancement in the next 5-10 years. The safety culture is improving everyday but more can be done as with any company.
good,"Going to work at FedEx wasn't the typical drab affair as it was at all my other jobs.Walking in and saying hello to the team in the morning was a pleasant experience. Everyone was very welcoming and friendly. The monotony of work was often broken up by some playful office banter, it was was an overall enjoyable experience."
good,"FedEx is a $50 billion dollar company so expect there to be lots of processes and procedures that seem unnecessary to individual contributors or first level management.  FedEx also likes to re-engineer software tools to match their environment but when the updated tool doesn't work to expectations then the general reply is to blame the tool even if not designed to be customized."
good,"Regards struggling how hard work this opportunity and cooperate each of time has to respect almost of the priority. Sometime, not provided any accommodation depend how it is. I enjoyed to effort work as hard and understanding any instructions at work. I worked almost in 3 years and half. I received the employee of the month last month ago this excellent."
good,Highly competitive and stressful job that kept you moving.  I had a conversation with the Human Resource manager and told her that the wages for the workers there were too low for the type of work they were doing.  Hopefully they listened.  Good part time work for a college student.
good,"Work was stressful and harsh. Sometimes had to work more than others because they worked slowly. Managers varied, some where good others didn’t really pay attention."
good,Good management in my time working at FedEx.  There was a sense of comradery with people you hadn't even known for very long.  Overall good work environment/ culture with numerous opportunities in career advancement.
good,Great company to work for. They could have a better managing team to assure that part time workers get a fair chance at ful time after a certain amount of time.
good,It was a ok place to work at it’s just the time they had me working was not balancing with my life also paychecks were not where I needed it to be . But the do have great Benefits.
good,Good place to expose to world class business but the company have to complete with low cost competitors in the industry which cause very tight control on expenditure (both OPS and CAP).
good,Great place to work. Great job security. Hardest part of the job is no level 1 on-call support. Learned new concepts of information security. Great Management.
good,"Great people and fun place to work.  It would be very helpful for management to be more accessible and communicative."
good,"I loved my job in this field, great job with great benefits package. Would still be there if it were not for one bad manager. Fed ex kinkos is a great company to work for"
good,"In my time working at FedEx, I had not worked at a more hard working and competitive job before. But the competition actually made the job so much more complicated. Multiple times a day the job would actually take longer than it needed due to the Unloading crew would hammer out things faster than the loading crews could, or the tower could handle, and we would have multiple stops. Communication was a huge flaw in the operation, yet once that was fixed, the job was fine...for a time."
good,"If you have a family to support it's not really the job to have since you have to be free a half hour before, and after the job just to get in and out of the place and you don't get paid on the clock till your all the way into the building, but it's nice for insurance and some extra money."
good,Long mornings  fast pace responsible busy non stop hardest part of the job is packing the truck most enjoyable time is riding in the truck Jamming eating
good,"A progressive employee based company with good benefits, bonuses and employee seen as an assist. Well managed and helps out in disaster stricken areas."
good,FedEx was a job to have to help pay on a bill or two i was something to do it was not a friendly job everybody was looking out for self  Manager did want you talking anyone's just do your job
good,"wasn't great, not a lot of hours, paid for about 20 hours a week. good for a high school student. if your older and just looking to make a few bucks you could work there as well"
good,It was pretty low pay for how much work was involved.  You were trained on equipment and for other jobs but there was so much going on that it was hard to pick a day to get trained on stuff.  It was good experience for the most part I just wish there was more opportunity to get paid more or other positions that paid you more.
good,"Ambiente dedito alla formazione, sia pratica che cognitiva, offre possibilità di crescita, quanto dedizione alle proprie mansioni."
good,"typical workday started with loading my truck, charting my route for the day and getting a cup of coffee. Each day was different and very interesting."
good,"Excellent people to work with, job stability, consistency and environment.  So many good people and opportunities to advance or learn new jobs.  Definitely promote from within"
good,"I really enjoy working at Fedex. I would change a few things if i were a contractor first , i would pay more according to job experience and try and get some kind of health benefits for the workers."
good,"as an ops agent i have experience a lot, i believe for the work we all do in the office and the stress we face everyday the staff is being underpaid. however its a good experience to have."
good,"I enjoy working at the location that I'm at and I have a great manager. I also have coworkers that are willing to collaborate to get the job done the best possible way. My pay is decent enough to manage my bills with smart money decisions. The cost of living is constantly on the rise, the average decent and SAFE two bedroom apartment is at least $1,100. When it comes to work life balance, I am a single mom with a teenager that has four years left in high school. I have to work way too many hours to live comfortably and provide for his needs. I'm exhausted mentally and physically when I come home from work. I don't have the energy to do as many activities with him. The weekly pay is good when you work long hours but it's at the expense of sacrificing family time. I can only hope that FedEx would pay us an hourly wage closer to our competitor so that single parents like myself don't have to trade as much time as we do for wages. I've worked at several locations and different positions, I have built a family here for over 13 years with the people I've encountered. Overall good company, I would still choose to work here if I was looking for a job all over again."
good,"I have worked customer service for years and enjoy interacting with customers. I was excited to learn logistics it kept the job interesting and gave a new challenge to every call. The hardest part was being moved from a brick and mortar building to work from home. I had a hard time separating work from home, I prefer face to face one on one interactions with my superiors."
good,"Trabalhei no momento de transição da Rapidão Cometa para a Fedex, foi um período conturbado, mas vemos a seriedade e o respeito que a empresa tem por seus colaboradores."
good,"its a typical day at work, get up and work from 6 get off around 3. really repetitious work, some days it can be easy some days it can be a pain but I worked through both."
good,"My experience as a Operations Manager at Fed Ex has prepared me for the next level of management to come.  The days were very busy and filled with a lot of problem solving and numbers crunching.  Many issues arise throughout a typical day. Call outs were very frequent, so we were always rearranging/ improvising the work schedule.  Another major part of the beginning of the day was editing time card error, to ensure that the employees get paid accurately.  Handling customer complaints was another daily issue that needed addressed.  Monitoring courier performances was very important in keeping the operation running efficiently.  The best part of the job is when my employees recognize the effort you make to help them be successful."
good,"They can do better the manager ,because  we stay busy n time go by fast  n it always  something  thing to n room for advancement m room for growth,  benefit  very good . Hour  nerd more,  and it always team work everybody works together  n it a problem  we all get together n work it out do the over all fedxsmart post was a good place to work  I am one of the ones help that help open the plant n southaven Mississippi."
good,"Fed Ex is a high paced, competitive environment. It is can be difficult to obtain full time employment with this company. Ultimately Fed Ex is a good job to have. They offer outstanding benefits to committed employees."
good,"Empresa boa de se trabalhar, porém não valoriza seu trabalhador."
good,"This was my first real job, learned a great deal and was able to get 3 promotions in 9 years. Would still be working their if they had not downsized my job."
good,"Fast paced work can be physically stressful, plenty of opportunity for advancement, great benefits, decent pay for time worked, slightly overwhelming when starting"
good,Working for FedEx is a great experience and is great for someone who loves to travel and work on their own. Its a contracted job which include investing in the equipment to be successful. You can make the money you need if you are willing to work hard and be consistent.
good,"A typical day at work would go smooth if everybody was there and ready to work. Teamwork is a big part of working for Fedex and I learned how to work through different situations with other people there. Management at Fedex was slightly confusing, they would change where you primarily work so that you can help someone else area but then never help on their own or send the right amount of help. The hardest part of the job was lifting heavy items without proper help. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting paid each week."
good,"We have great customers at FedEx Custom Critical. I love the work that I do.  Since all shipments are expedite in nature, someone on the delivering end is always looking for you and usually glad to see you.  Many of my deliveries are emergencies, and those folks are waiting for you at the dock door! We strive for on time deliveries, typically 15 minutes or more ahead of the scheduled delivery time.  "
good,I was able to work my way through school. The managers were easy to communicate with whenever I needed something. It was easy to request time off as long as I communicated properly.
good,"Not single parent friendly, overall ok place to work if that is the only thing you have going on in life. hudrbtjkehgeroibngjkehd 9rgeio urae j90rae ioruea90 ougaer9 opuer90"
good,Enjoy working with the company was great. Work hours was in the mornings 4am-7am sometimes later if aircraft is late. I believe they help pay for school if it helps you can advance within the company.
good,Empresa dinâmica de forte cultura orgânico ao com grandes desafios para o Brasil.
good,Work nights and long hours. Work docks with fork lifts. Work in ask weather conditions. When it's cold or hot you know it. Alright culture to work in. Management doesn't bother you a long a you do your job. Content policies will be followed no matter what the circumstance.
good,"It's FedEx. it's a fine place to work. But it's a corporation, at it's core and does not truly care about its employees. I would recommend you don't take it personal when you feel taken for granted."
good,Job was good but security was for personal that only wanted to make sure they did what did to be done to get where they wanted to be. People who wanted to advance wasn't given to chance too.
good,This is great company at the time i was currently employed there..Know these locations have been combined with other shipping industries....Times have changed since i was working there
good,"It was pretty nice job while it lasted. It was fast paced, your constantly  moving delivering/picking up packages. You interact with public daily.You also work in all weather conditions."
good,"Really fast paced environment. Pay is decent however, the benefits package is awesome. A good place to work at if you're physically fit and active. Management is good and can be fair if you're a good hard worker."
good,"1.this is a great job to have if you are not going to school."
good,"FedEx is a good company that overall takes good care of its people. However, organization struggles with innovation and adopting not just agile processes but an agile culture."
good,The training is very through. The environment in which you train is one that you can gain the knowledge to thrive in your role. Very busy!! You learn so much about printing that will amaze you.
good,"At FedEx Office there are many daily tasks. The daily tasks include printing basic copies to printing oversize files, like blueprints. A typical day at work consists of printing material for customers and packing gifts or returns for a shipment that you will process and create a label for."
good,A typical day at work is working at a fast pace unloading trucks. I learned how to work fast and how to work on production. The hardest part was working on production. The most enjoyable part was a slow day at work.
good,"The work day was very structured and time oriented."
good,"the job is pretty simple help unload then ,help upload the ride and deliver the packages.get there at 6-7 work till 7-8. get one break. wasn't a bad job everyone really friendly"
good,It's like going from a dead stop or idle to top fuel dragster speed at times. They are quite demanding and no room for error. Sometimes feel like the act where you have to juggle and spin plates on top of sticks. They'll pull you in 3 different directions at once. O.K. that's the down side. The up side is the pay is great for what is in the area. No other companies offer any benefits at all especially for part-time workers. The pay is good enough to be competitive with other jobs working harder for 40hrs. a week. Hours are 25-30hrs. a week. Expect to come home filthy and sometimes exhausted. Can be physically demanding at times. There is also required education skills that you are required to pass before moving on. Once completed other areas open up for you to move forward or to end up behind the 8 ball answering questions from management.
good,placing packages in designated area sometimes a bit difficult. Would like more hours a week but in order to do that you have to be able to work 3 to 4 hours and then wait 2 or more hours to start next shift. would be better if made 8 hour shifts
good,"Good workplace"
good,"FedEx was a very large facility, Handling a lot of incoming packages. The environment always changed and you would never have the same thing everyday. Although the work would usually stay the same you would meet new employees."
good,Depending on where you end up when you start you may find that you got really lucky or will toil away in the hardest jobs until you can bid out.  FedEx is extremely fast paced and you are always under a deadline regardless of what job you have at the Hub.  You will be working in all weather environments which can be hard on you if you can't handle heat or cold environments.  The benefits are good but the work required is difficult.  As a Dangerous Goods Agent you will be tasked with handling the most dangerous freight that FedEx ships.  This can be hard to handle when you realize that if you make a mistake the ramifications can be vast.  It's a great company if you are in shape and looking for a part time job with great full time benefits.
good,Fedex is a job for everyone to work.When i worked there i met a lot of folks and worked hard in a short amount of time.My time was spent on a single little walkway.
good,"I worked for this company while I was putting myself through college and did not learn much from them.  As a matter of fact, I gave more to them than they gave to me."
good,Good company...fast pace...sometimes stressful...hard for work/life....shifts vary...a lot of multi tasking and learning new things...only 30 min lunch break no 2 15 min breaks on 8.5 hr shift
good,it has been years since I worked here but from what I remember it was a cool job although stressful on the back from unloading trucks. The hardest part was unloading a trailer for the first time ever and it made my back hurt. The easiest part is scanning the packages while they were being unloaded. I really enjoyed that part. We made it fun when working with another person that was scanning.
good,"Secteur Isère.  Grenoble. Société ou il fait bon d'y travailler.  Tournée de livraison ""campagne"". 20 a 25 livraison + 8 a 15 points de ramasse par jour. 3/4 d'heure 1 heure de route de ma station a mon 1er client du matin . .. début du tri (arrivée navette de Lyon) 8h30 départ station 9h/9h15 . Pause (en général) 12h/ 13h45 retour station 17h . Fin de service 17h45 . "
good,what you learn the most enjoyable part of the job meeting people learning different jobs in the company easy going great company to work for good management
good,"Trabalhei numa filial e apesar das limitações que isto traz, foi bom e importante trabalhar lá."
good,"This place was really fun.  I enjoyed the employees because everyone helped each other.  It was high-paced, but also relaxing.  This company would be a great place to work if given the opportunity."
good,"A fair place to work, great people, good management. great benefits.the hardest part of the jobIs weather conditions, the most enjoyable part of the job is meeting and satisfying your customer relations"
good,I learned a lot at fed ex ground had two other bosses before I meet my last boss which was the best cared about his workers I feel like for a work environment to really work the boss and the workers need to be happy I feel like it goes 50 50 in understanding each other
good,"Productivity based only.  If you don't meet numbers, youre out the door.  CDL must maintain medical card or your gone.  All they care about is numbers, your only a spreadsheet away from Termination."
good,Early hours and work at the airport.  Good work if you like to work around aircraft and outdoors.  Management was very helpful and supportive.  Co-workers worked well together.
good,"loading and unloading of truck, delivering a set route, talking to costumers. working unsupervised. carrying boxes up to 140lbs being able to run my route at the most efficient way."
good,"Worked here as a student and made life far easier. Schedule is flexible to an extent, good hours, it get cold sometimes though and really busy. Good job overall."
good,"Stressful at times, but overall a good sense of accomplishment. Every day different tasks to tackle while managing two of the support operations. TM morale is good."
good,"It all depends on the manager and department you work for.  I had the pleasure of working for some great managers.  However, there is a culture which encourages a feeling of self entitlement because a person has sat in the same chair for over 15 or 20 years.    The ""Purple Promise"" gets lost and anyone with fresh ideas and actually has a passion for their work stir up insecurities among those..."
good,Working as contractor for many years and got stuck in catch 22. FedEx business wanted to continue the contract but FedEx legal department has a rule against contractors staying too long. Requires one year away from the company before eligible for contract again.
good,"I wasn't sure what to expect when becoming a FedEx employee. If you wish to work out and get paid at the same time, this could be the job for you. Do not count on that though as the pace of the factory is more important than form. Know your limits as you do not want to overwork yourself."
good,I worked there in my late teens and early twentys. I wish i would have taken more advantage of the perks of Federal Express; managers were great but no job advancement unless  you had a degree or knew someone high up the ladder.
good,"this is a very fast paced job, they expect one to be constantly moving and working. pay is not bad depending on the job. very little chance for job advancement."
good,"Was a company that offered very good pay and perks."
good,Fedex was a very competitive business which made it a stressful working environment especially in the peak season around the holidays. Overall it was an ok job until they begin cutting hours.
good,"Early morning work hours."
good,"Job located in Albany, GA.  The work wasn't hard to do. Some heavy lifting but the hours were very short.  It is warehouse work so during the summer months it was hot on some days."
good,workers are lazy and there are not enough of them. supervisiors don't know what's going on half of the time. the work does not equal the pay. the hours are too early.
good,Great way get your feet off the ground and begin a career.  Lots of benefits working for this company. The work atmosphere is great and the team always works together.
good,les ressource humaine ne sont pas a lecoute de leur travailleur
good,They moved everyone around to see what they were best at but also depending on what areas needed help. I ended up unloading the trailers because I was the fastest at it but that became an issue when I found out that the length of the shift was determined by how many packages were processed. I then realized that by working harder I was losing money which is ironic. It almost creates an incentive to be lazy. I eventually had to leave because I was earning $100 a week which was not enough to take care of me and my son.
good,"Typical day: Fast paced, busy and challenging, depending on the hours."
good,Un buen trabajo con prestaciones de ley y bono de pualidad
good,"The job is great if you want to get in shape, but it's so demanding I had no time for hobbies or anything else besides FedEx.  It's a tough culture too but if you're fit enough that shouldn't be an issue."
good,"A typical day was manageable as long as you stayed productive. I learned how to operate a RF scanner and WMS. The management could be better with interacting with all employees. The hardest part of the job was not having enough work to last throughout the day, but the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help others if I had nothing else to do in my area"
good,"the general atmosphere in the shop was we dont care its not dot. the manager coudlnt care less that people cut corners to ""fix"" equipment  approaching the manager with ideas based on real world facts would more often than not earn you a write up or a long drawn out screaming at by the FMM.  the level of incompetence in the shop techs is honestly unbearable people running regens for active codes with bad wiring and ordering parts worth multiple thousands of dollars that it did not need.  working with other techs meant you had to watch what you did because a single slip up ended you on the receiving end of a lashing loud enough you can hear it 2 business over."
good,"company gives important to its employees "
good,"Work was grueling, but my manager made my time there fun and enjoyable for the most part. As a seasonal worker I would recommend the job and position I was working. For a full time job I would consider applying for a less dangerous position."
good,"I enjoy working at FedEx, working with the public is fun and the customers are what drive me to strive in my daily activities at the job."
good,"I enjoyed working at this company. They were very organized and well lead. Also, they not only cared for themselves, but their employees as well. They made sure we were able to work and that we were prepared before we had begun our tasks."
good,"In all honesty this is a starter job, no one is expected to spend their whole life or make a career from here its to get you going and to put easy quick money in your pocket so long as you comply with the rules and work."
good,I learnt to deal with customer queries and complaints related to the collection and delivery of parcels. It was efficient and well run. Enjoyable work environment with friendly staff and regular team activities. The work was phone and computer based and involved multiple computer systems.
good,Very interesting job and always on the move. I created a lot of overall great experience. Always had support from management and cant complain about much.
good,Work was fast paces but rewarding. The people you work with are team players and they genuinely care about each other. Management changes seemed to be the biggest issue. They would rotate managers that had no experience in a department and they would fail.
good,Overall FedEx is a great company to work for overall. I have been an employee for over 12 years. I had an opportunity to transfer to another area in another city but have found out there is no where to advance in the current area I am in. The area is treated like another part of the company that has its own set of rules.
good,"Fedex is one of those jobs to get some money to save up until you get the job you want. They will have you work early hours to start but once you have been there for awhile you might be able to change your times. The job is not too hard, if you semi fit. You will sweat at this job but you are free to get water and such if you need to. The employs do seem friendly, just have to initiate with them first. As they don't seem to have that ability. But once you get them to see you as a good person they will help you."
good,Good work place its a job you are there to do a service to the people the customers. Fedex served a purpose did what I had to do to support my family time and patience which you need.
good,Go to ups if you are going into this line of work.It would be a union shop more affect on your job it would be a carrier. All the staff was great office personal I did feel a family bond at FedEx
good,"it.s ok for part time people...it,s a fun place to work for tho. maybe I should go back soon if I can. for more money. but hey who know what gone happed."
good,"Great place accept loading your truck in the morning for your routes. That was the biggest hassle for me, but other than that it was a very laid back job. Not too much work."
good,"I recommend FedEx as a great place to work. The workplace culture is laid back and it is a relatively easy going experience. Whether this be a temporary job or long-term, a person can make this a great job to work a long time at while the benefits are exemplary and cheap too."
good,Be prepared to work weekends during peak seasons and summers. Pay is great. One doesn't have to worry about not being able to  overtime. Approximately %50 of the year you will be working more than 8 hours a day
good,Good Experience overall.  FedEx does a good job for its customers.  Became less customer focused over the course of my 28 years of employment. Hardest part of job is dealing with managements demand for meeting stops per hour in an urban setting.
good,"Forklift certification will be provided upon hiring, as well as hazmat training. Loading and unloading of freight using forklifts in trailers within DOT regulations and standards. Management needs improvement as most are novice to the company and seem to not care much about personal lives of employees. With that being said, it is very hard to move up into a higher position as the hiring managers will pick and choose regardless of management skill or experience and many times will hire outside the company first. Most employees are very easy to get along with and very helpful to new hires. Hardest part of the job is working in the elements as the dock is not closed and is not temperature controlled and the lack of responsibility management has when it comes to doing their jobs and enforcing loading quality."
good,My experience with management has been great. The work is fairly simple however I do believe my compensation is in order because of the fact that it is a part time job.
good,"Working for FedEx was vary stressful and time consuming. We would start at 5:00 am, Presort and loading. Than deliver in a timely manner. Arrive back at terminal to unload around 4:00 PM. When finished with paperwork, return home to map out next days route."
good,Fedex is a awesome place to work. they have great benefit and a great reputation for there hard work and commitment. this job is a great place to start your future!
good,I got to the terminal at 6:00 a.m. most mornings and loaded my truck from the floor. I loaded the truck in order from my last stop of the day to my first stop of the day. It was a demanding job but I really enjoyed the atmosphere and culture. I got burnt out and mad some critical mistakes because of it; which eventually cost me my job.
good,"You get paid a decent wage working at FedEx Ground, but its like the bare minimum living salary despite it being a management position. If you live in an area with a high cost of living, though they provide adjustment if you move into one its not much. The benefits are pretty good though."
good,The work environment was great. The hours was good. The work was very fast paced in which I enjoyed. I had to lift up to 75lbs per package. I was able to always keep up and at times I was ahead of other people.
good,"I getting quite hard experience at fedEx,but overall it is nice.Management is nice.Team work is a main factor."
good,"Fast pace environment, manageable hours, good  benefits, respectable managers and co-workers, great pay, hard working job, reward diners and trophies for great workers"
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time at FedEx, working with excellent people. The company maintained a good people, service, profit philosophy, but at the end, they were out-sourcing a lot of work."
good,"- a typical day at work involves a short meeting followed by 4 hours of fast paced physical work."
good,"I enjoy working here part time and don't intend to leave once I begin working full time during the day. It's faced pace and I enjoy what I do there, it gives me a great workout without having to go to the gym!"
good,"This is a well suited job for hardworking people."
good,If you are in the buddy system the. You will have opportunities to advance. But once you go the other direction you are hung out to dry. Really a cuthroat business at level one facilities.
good,"This job was smooth sailing, it was great that I was up on my feet steady working and moving. There was a balance throughout the workday, there was never a dull moment, and I learned so much."
good,"show up 4am  warehouse meeting with all package handlers.  "
good,"fast pace,good money, paid weekly kept me in good shape,i would have like to stay and work for fedex but there were no full time positions open at that time"
good,Unload trucks by hand and with a scanner and labeler. Sort boxes and place on the right conveyor for delivery Move over-sized boxes with a Tugger to location.  Re-sort products from a conveyor to delivery trucks.
good,FedEx is a fast past environment.  Being accurate is your key. They have great benefits even for part-time employees.  One of the biggest down side is that it is hard to move from part-time to full time.
good,It was an incredibly fast paced environment with not much in the way patience for errors. This was understandable because they had an incredible drive to delivery packages on time.
good,"Breaks are few.  The supervisor is supposed to come around to allow bathroom breaks, or rest period breaks but they do not usually."
good,overall it was a good job but I had a opportunity to sell me route and wanted to find a job that would challenge me more. I'm looking for but overall was a great learning experence
good,"Overall, this is a fantastic place to work. It is extremely culturally diverse and accepting of people from all backgrounds. The work is challenging and you must be tech savvy, but you will be trained if there is no experience. Sometimes, the overtime can be a bit overwhelming in certain departments, requiring 50+ hours of work plus Saturdays, but the work is plentiful if that's what you're needing. Overtime does not occur very often, but when it does, it can last for a few months. The employees are treated fairly and they are appreciated. The company shows gratitude by employee appreciation days where there is catering, games (human foosball, human hungry hippo, badmitten, bingo, corn hole, video games), and chances to win prizes. If you need a job, apply here. The people are great, the management is great, and the work is great."
good,"Nice place, inadequate upper leadership"
good,"I worked there a long time, and wanted to become a manager. It is difficult to get into management. Also if you want full time, it seems near impossible to get full time hours where I worked. If you are looking for part time with great benefits, this might be the place for you."
good,It was a ok place to work at for the time being but i was looking for a career advancement so i decided to leave to seek higher advancement. I'm ok with my decision.
good,"Fast pace environment, unloading freight off truck on to conveyor belt so the associates on the dock scan, sort and load in containers. Great team work at the warehouse."
good,"Got really close to the workgroup, formed a family more than co workers. Great starting pay, competitive, every day is something new to expect. Schedule hours work great for a second job or going to school."
good,"I work as a part time evening letter/package sorter, I worked from the time I arrived(6pm) to 10pm at fast paced environment.  I could not wait 3 or 4 years to get promoted from part time to full time."
good,Working for fedex was quite stressful at times. Being a driver you have to handle a lot of packages. Sometimes you can be on the road all day or have a very short day.
good,Your day will start between 2am-3am work for about three or four hours. I learned how to drive a tug and forklift. Management was straightforward. The Hardest part of the job was to not hurt and be safe. Is a very fast past job.
good,"It's been year since I worked there but, I enjoyed it. the environment changed often and that kept my interest. The people were nice and my manager  really cared"
good,"Competitive, extremely busy workday. Fast pace, never stop, great benefits, long work days. Great advancements, quick promotions for ambitious go getters"
good,"lots of driving, loading and unloading, Have to keep up with schedules and time frames allowed.  Fun place to work.  Have to be motivated and be sincere about your job and job duties"
good,"I work as a part-time package handler.  Good company to work for but it is very physically demanding.  If you hate standing and moving for over 4 hours at a time, do not take this job.  There are many opportunities for advancement.  Part timers do not get health insurance until working for at least 12 months.  However, there is overtime and several raises per year.  The best part is Monday to Friday schedule."
good,"Can be stressful at times but rewarding. You spend a good chunk of your time on the road being your boss."
good,If not going to school FedEx is a great place to start a career with no school education. Moving up the ladder some education is needed for upper management.
good,"Full of different culture which allows everyone to be able to learn from one another, benefits are truly amazing, teammates are like a family, and is a safe place to work. I am rarely sitting behind a desk, always on a constant move to get orders out. We take pride in customer service. The hardest part of my job is dealing with the stress that arises, which usually is from one person adding more to my plate than i can handle without giving me help. The most enjoyable part of my job is being around my teammates and knowing that the atmosphere is steady yet relaxing. Break room has a air hockey table and two Foosball tables so teammates can enjoy themselves on our breaks."
good,FedEx is a great place to work if you aren't physically disable. It's very fast paste friendly environment depending on your manager. Everyone in HR are nice. The training Staff are also amazing they work with you. It's very flexible. Just not for everyone.
good,It was a good team inspired environment. If we didn't work together it wouldn't work. Everyone was motivated and had a par to play. Managers threw cookouts and gave out fed ex clothing
good,Great place to work. Even though phycally demanding . i have a great wotk group that i wouldnt trade for the world i would realt recommend this job for anyone looking for work.
good,"He estado en la empresa por más de 10 años, me gustaría cambiar. Y ganar un poco más."
good,"FedEx is a good company to work for but even more so if you are willing to relocate (multiple times).  However, if you like where you currently live, own your home, have kids in school, married (basically have a life outside of work) then FedEx might not be the best place to work."
good,"Once I arrived at the dock I checked my truck and went over the load of packages that were to be delivered that day. Driving in traffic was the downside of the job, making sure packages arrived to the recipient on time is important to me. Meeting new people everyday and seeing the same people everyday was a plus."
good,"I love the fact that I have been with FedEx for years & many co-works are like work family, we know each others families & ups & downs."
good,"Fedex shop is a great place to work and learn, benfits are not great and attendance policy is strict, you will be working 2 shift or 3 shift for quite some time does not have family life balance"
good,Job has good benefits but not many hours offered. Management is good. The job is over all great but will not supply all of your financial needs due to only giving part time positions.
good,"Although management has changed drastically since starting, the people in charge have generally been pleasant, and understanding of certain circumstances at work that are out of peoples control, which are about the only things that can make a workday terrible."
good,"Team work for the most part, but need improvement "
good,"Appreciates their employees hard work, great company to work for and decent benefit package. Very serious about pleasing the customers, for repeat business."
good,There is a premium on Seniority. If your on the bottom of the driving board. Be prepared to work the dock for long hours (4-8) and driving very short miles(35-120) miles. You are home every morning but it's overrated. If your able to jump up the board to where you ONLY drive this job is awesome. Take the good with bad.
good,"Overall, the job was fast pace which makes the time go fast. the manager was very professional and understanding. a typical day consist of scanning and lifting items"
good,"Great company, great job, just not enough hours to support my family. They have a low turn over rate so more hours were not in my future any times soon."
good,The atmustfare was go they show there appreciation from time to time. A typical work day you would start you know early to make sure that you have a productive day
good,you will have to unload and load trailers and make sure everything is ready to ride for the driver taking the trailer to its next destination. easy job
good,"We get paid for 3 and a half hours every day, and generally only work about 2 hours. Good crew to work with. Very fast paced. Equipment constantly breaking down."
good,I like that the work hours are flexible and sessional. The job required to be physically fit be able to lift up to 70 pounds. I learned how to drive and park the delivery truck's. I also gained a better way to multi task during Christmas season. Safe and clean working environment.
good,"Its a clean place to work. At this time in FedEx, the contractors are those who hired to the drivers. The management at FedEx is not that good as it used to be 5 years ago."
good,"FedEx is a very interesting place to work. It's a lot going on and interesting people to meet. I learned a lot around the Hub, and experienced most of the pros and cons. Management is a little all over the place, unstructured, and confused on rules and procedures. The culture is great, so many different people. The hardest thing about working at FedEx is the early morning call- ins to check on what time to come in to work and make it on time. The most enjoyable part is not getting bored and bonding with your co-workers to get a job done, and learning more about them in the process."
good,"This is a position to start as a young adult. Very physical, Was a daily workout! It also taught me about running my own business as running a route was like running a business."
good,Great place to work. The managers and the colleagues are good but not when you deal with some people in different dept. Fedex has an enjoyable working environment. Just one thing pay is NOT great.
good,"Very up to date with the technology, made planning and getting a game plan set for each day simple. Always a new challenge to overcome with the daily routine, never two days the same."
good,The sort is very faced paced. And you have to be in physical shape to work there. There are no breaks during the sort unless you have to use the bathroom.
good,work was easy your on your own al day no one standing over your shoulder it gives you a chance to show your dependable and trustworthy. you could actually work on your own schedule
good,"The job is amazing when we are not on mandatory overtime. The structure could be more together. The security is topnotch and superb, never open to leaving workers exposed or unsafe."
good,This job has given me numerous opportunities to use bleeding edge technology to accomplish business objectives in a timely manner at the same time along with efficient use of time.
good,It's A Great Job  With Great Benefits And People. I just Disagree With Management. Some Are Very Unprofessional.............................................
good,Great place to work offers lots of training. Requires a lot of dedication and long hours. Have to have to ability to with stand weather conditions and shift work.
good,"Good place to learn the essentials of warehouse work. Clean warehouse, steady shifts and hours, opportunity to learn other positions, lots of cross training,"
good,"Tough work environment, but lots of encouragement along with me being in the best shape of my life. I enjoyed the work, but the coworker relationship was not clearly defined, so i often felt uncomfortable"
good,Aprendi muito em relação ao trabalho em equipe e aos conhecimentos que nos eram passados no dia a dia de trabalho .
good,"A company that constantly improves, but often stumbles over bad decisions by corporate management that does not understand the industry. Often takes 2 steps forward, one step back, when rolling out new administrative programs. They tend to listen to contractors paid to make improvements to FedEx who do not know the industry, with devastating consequences to drivers and retention. But, at least they are trying, however ill-advised the effort."
good,Job's easy once you learned the basics of what you need to do but someday's its slow. Work becomes really repetitive after awhile. Good place to work at though.
good,the job itself was enjoyable to me. the only problem i had with the whole situation was the temporary placement of the warehouse. i had to find a new job because the facility was moved to far to commute.
good,I worked with a small group of people who I got along with and communicated very closely with. Job responsibilities were very clearly defined. My day was very busy because we had to get the trucks loaded and out of the building
good,"Working at FedEx was the most competitive work place, fast pace ,environment and it was challenging and I enjoyed it. I learned alot as well and you Can be independent."
good,"Good work place - nice people. We get to work very independently  and have good work hours!"
good,Great people and were very sensitive to being flexible for my school schedule. I tried to find a position that fit my new line of expertise with willingness to relocate so I could retain my job there.
good,"working at Fedex was a good experience. and moving up is not hard as long as your work ethic is high, also they have flexible hours if a person studying."
good,"The work is hard, but for a factory job that was to be expected. The benefits are great. Some of the people you meet there are also great. Always beware of your surroundings. Safety is always top priority."
good,Work load isn't too bad but the conditions aren't great.  theres a lot of dust and other dangerous things to your health.  this is a good place to work but wouldn't recomend a career.
good,"If you're going into FedEx as a sales representative, expect to advance your career in sales. It is extremely hard to transition to another department at the company, no matter how much you network. If you want to continue a career in sales, and you're able to move anywhere, the possibilities are endless. The philosophy of the company is ""people, service, profit"", but the profit seems to come before the people (its employees)."
good,"The job itself is pretty much straight forward, you strap on your boats and scanner and start moving some boxes. Safety there is stressed but they also expect you to go 110% when it comes to scan rates, if your in load side. if your unloading they also expect you to go 110% at what you do. Management is decent but there are a few that most people wouldn't work for. Hardest part of the job is keeping your energy up for a long period of time, if you go full time. Snacks are a must. 6 day work weeks may be mandatory depending on the extra work flow coming in."
good,Has it's ups and downs. Uncertain future for this location. GM is secretive about the actual state of the campus. No investment from a multi-billion dollar company into this facility.
good,"Fed ex was a fun experience because its a company that thrives on productivity where everyone worked as a unit. Packages had to be delivered in a timely matter by the drivers so our job was to unload the trucks, scan the packages then sort them accordingly."
good,Overall a great place to work.  Excellent benefits for employees.  The company culture is good.  Salaries are very competitive with other jobs in the area.
good,It is a fast paced environment that requires good attention to detail and excellent time management skill. You require excellent organizational skills so that you are able to deliver all your packages in a timely manner.
good,Management is good most mostly everybody is pretty nice very friendly environment the job itself is pretty easy the only thing that is needed for to be a great job is more hours
good,Very nice place to work but slow in the advancement opportunities.  It is such a large company that it is easy to get lost.  FedEx has a great culture and product service offering for their customers.
good,The FedEx hub is a massive operating system.  The company offers many opportunities to their part-time employees that many companies would not.  It's up to the working individual to learn about what FedEx has to offer.
good,"easy job once you learn to use forklift, good pay and good benefits the worst part about this job is waking up early in the mourning"
good,This company offers excellent benefits and advancement opportunities.  The leadership strives to develop an enjoyable work culture through training and employee development.  The hardest part of the job is to maintain a good job work/ life balance.
good,"I learned how to operate a forklift. The management could be better in regards to communication and approving the workers of their hard work. The hardest part of the job would be the temperature on the dock. The most enjoyable part would be the flexible shifts, hours, and pay, along with healthcare for part time and full time employees."
good,The review has not changed from the first review that was done on fedex. so please check the review that was done on the first review that was about fedex and the shift schedule did not change on this job title because of the seniority number I was.
good,"Great company to work for not much room for advancement at this location "
good,The seasonal positions are very fast paced and a good way to pick up extra hours during the holiday and new year season. The management is always available when needed.
good,"trabajo relajado,presion solo cuando hay envio agrado en el trato con el cliente y union con los compañeros."
good,This company is very good and is very large.  There is alot of upside with this company but once someone starts there is a probationary period before all the benefits start.
good,Just not much shift flexibility or work life balance depending on your management level. Pay is good the benefits are stellar. Good work place culture everyone is willing to help out.
good,"Belle expérience "
good,"Crazy work hours, Immediate supervisors were great, payed well. I liked having a pool table, i always got the time off i wanted, and now id like to be done with this.  i hope it was twenty words"
good,"Average work day consist of working 10-12 hrs daily and hub is open 24hrs most of the work is night time . I learned everything there from safety in the workplace, driving a forklift and being an executive assistant"
good,FedEx was a really easy job for me not much of a challenge. The people are great I learn a lot of my management skills with FedEx. Working as a team was the key with this company.
good,"É uma boa empresa , claro sempre falta algo. Porem nao tenho o que reclamar."
good,"Great Place to work. The job gets tough around peak season, but that is to be expected. Other than that the job is laid back and a fun atmosphere"
good,"Fedex is a great company for job security. This company is not so great in the advancement process. There are not too many full time jobs at this company, anymore. The benefits here are fantastic. Full time benefits for part time work and school reimbursement is very good"
good,"Great company to work for Sucks for part time workers wanting more hours, have to wait till holidaytime or when theres time enough to srpead around. But great company"
good,A typical day at Fed Ex Ground was delivering packages to customers in all sorts of different weather environments.  Most days were very long and cold during the peak season.  The customers were all polite and I enjoyed meeting new clients everyday.
good,Long and tiresome place to work but it is extremely beneficial. The benefits fit my needs and the 401k plan is excellent. Great place for job growth.
good,"You will work with packages in all different types of weather job will put strain on your body, but it isn't necessarily the hardest job ever. Just be ready to work."
good,"learning new things about the job. I learn how to communicate with people through the warehouse. "
good,"busy, some customers stop receiving by 15:30 so it can be stressful"
good,Good hours 8.30 to 17.30 if you get finished before your shift still get paid full hours. Very friendly Co workers that are always willing to help each other out. Management could be better. Most enjoyable part of day is when you get out on the road and knowing that your making customers happy. Hardest part of job is busy periods coming up to Xmas. I learned that I was able push myself to get better to ensure the job was always done in a good and professional manner.
good,I enjoy working at Fed Ex Ground and the people that I work with are helpful. Team work is the best tactic and we all have to have fast pace working mind to unload/load customers packages into Fed Ex trailers
good,"Fantastic company to launch your career."
good,"Come to work sign in. pass through two metal detectors. no phones on field. stretch. be assigned a convator belt, and begin the hardest part which is handling boxes according to numbers and letters."
good,"Great company, always seems to be growing, good potential sometimes lacking in pay advancements. Needs to do better with providing their contracted drivers with benefits."
good,"Fed-ex is a fast paced job, with good benefits. But, lacks a team atmosphere. Lacks good quality leadership. "
good,Part time show up work to the best of your ability by yourself help out others if you can and move on till the next task short five hour shifts
good,FedEx ground is a excellent company to work for the people are very easy going and believe in team work. I am seeking a company that I can grow into and have many experiences.
good,I worked an early morning shift at a station that offloaded and sorted the freight coming off the semi from the airport. I also worked at the ramp at the airport. This job was very physical and hard on the body. Rolling large aircraft cans alone was hard on the knees.
good,Working for FedEx is very dangerous. No matter what happens its always your fault. It is very face pace lots of traffic and congestion.
good,Conseguir agregar valor com minhas atividades exercidas e convivência com meus coelgas.
good,From a management perspective Work/Life Balance will continually be a challenge given the operational expectations of the job.
good,"FedEx Freight is a great opportunity for a variety of careers.  My experience there throughout the years has given me the chance to become diverse, teach others as I learn, but also put me in the  understanding that I need to pursue a career in a skilled trade.  Although there are a multitude of reasons I am looking to pursue elsewhere, an enormous factor is the constant nightshift, which can not be blamed on FedEx due to the fact that logistics operates primarily at night.  Managers at FedEx Freight were supportive yet demanded what was required to uphold the high standard.  Easily, the most enjoyable times at FedEx were accomplishing the challenges it provided to me and my peers as a team.  FedEx Freight is a great avenue to explore if interested in dockworking, driving, or becoming leadership.  That being said, shifts can be demanding and you subject to the weather."
good,"Managed daily operation including equipment, outside transportation and daily safety needs. Learned the LTL industry from the ground up.  The company was much smaller then FedEx was so go to learn all the in and outs of Transportation."
good,It was ok to talk to the fans and guide them to the right spot so they could have fun. I learned patience. Management was cool they made sure I did everything right and if I didn't know something they were able to help me. My co workers was fun and made sure we was on the same page. The hardest part was just standing in the same spot from 8am - 6pm until every fan is off the floor. The most enjoyable part was the fans
good,A typical day at work was busy and challenging. I learned to manage my work load daily. Most co-workers were great and we worked together.
good,"if you can get on one of the daytime load/unloads (very unlikely) you should 1000% jump on this job if you are healthy and can handle some heavy lifting. other than that they are usually only hiring for the grave yard shift. and its extremely hard to pull off if your not a night owl. "
good,"Each day I would have to pray that all of my employees would show up. Then I had to make sure that they were ABLE to work...sober, wearing proper clothes, footwear, etc. I would base how my operation and assignments would given out contingent on what ending results were. On most days, when all were there, we'd usually have 5 trailers that had to be unloaded, sorted, and loaded into various package cars for same day local deliveries. It is a fast-paced,intense operation withj no room for lolly-gagging. Each day is a new adventure. You work hard and at the end of the day you have the sweat to prove it!"
good,"I enjoyed this position because it required me to be detail oriented and see a project from start to finish. Day to day, I worked with a high profile Pharmaceutical Company and moved their life-saving medicines all over the world."
good,"The job isn't for everyone but if it is for you then i would suggest working there. The only thing i don't really like is the way the work is distributed. The managers will put the best workers on the heaviest truck, which is understandable. But here's my problem. They release the not so good employees first and keep the rest to finish their work plus clean up the rest of everyone else's truck."
good,Its very productive and very fast pace. Also easy to do and understand the job definition. The workers are nice and so is the pay. Very flexible with time start or your work schedule.
good,"There is lots of work to do...."
good,"great employees at this company.everyone believes in the company mission and wants to provide great service. lots of opportunity to transfer, not much opportunity to advance."
good,"The job can keep you motivated with the constant moving. Good job and good way to get in shape. But only down fall is, if you don't use proper lifting ,it can cause serious pain for life. So follow the rules and be smart."
good,I learned how to lift big boxes to another place. the management was good. the co-worker was good to communicate with. there was not a hardest part of the job. the most enjoyable part of the job was lifting products.
good,"We will have roll call, afterwards everyone would report to their stations and the we would start to unload, sort, and load packages back onto a truck."
good,A typical day at work is unloading trucks in fast matter. My manager is good for giving me more responsible. What I learn the most is being focus everyday.
good,"Reviewing all payment  received, and imputing in system.  Keeping track of late payments,and payment not received.  managing corporate accounts that are due, or not paid.  Doing follow-ups with customer on any changes they desire to make."
good,"I enjoy my current position as a software developer / engineer, specializing in multiple platforms and object oriented design, analysis with extensive experience in the full life cycle of the software design process including agile, requirements definition, prototyping, and proof of concept, design interface implementation, testing, and maintenance.Managing the project from beginning to end is a fulfilling and exciting job."
good,Loved working for them as a driver. As an operation Admin i was at work at 1-2am. So that became old and tiresome with a young family. Great environment to work in and lots to learn. If you are willing to re-locate then there are great opportunities for advancement.
good,"During the 28 years that I worked for FedEx Express the company evolved a great deal.  FedEx Express was fun to work for during the early years.  As with any business, competition made changes necessary on an ongoing basis.  Changes in the economy had a big impact on FedEx.  There were many more advancement opportunities in the early days as well.  The work environment is very fast paced and high stress as you probably would expect."
good,"I enjoyed working at fedex, everything was great. co worker was best to work around ...I enjoyed it. ran my route did my job everyday day in day out"
good,"I enjoyed working at this company. It was fast paced, and usually always busy ! The energy was always high, and there was good team work in the establishment. Managers and supervisors tried to make the environment enjoyable to work in while still keeping respect of the employees."
good,"entente au sein de l'équipe et de l'entreprise"
good,"While it certainly helps to work for a company with leading edge technology, products, services, management, and compensation, the real reward is in developing and maintaining client relationships with decision-makers such as CEOs, COOS, CFOs, CIOs, and the like.  Achieving a true win-win environment that helps meet the mutual objectives of your company and your client company is what separates average accomplishment with exceptional accomplishment."
good,Was een leerzame tijd. Tis een leuk beroep met veel verantwoordelijkheid. Ben trots dat ik bij Fedex heb mogen werken.
good,Like the job but not enough hours but I had a problem with harrasment with one of the workers. Told the management but was still put in the same work area with them.
good,"I like the people, I worked with, and also the management. If the events leading up,  to my Grandma death never happened. I would still be there. Only bad part was the hours."
good,Payscale is better than average. Freight flow process is not very good which spills over to the dock workers. Fedex Frieght ovaerall is a good company with limited opportunities for advancement.
good,"first day there was interesting, since this was my first job. i got used to it quickly and i learned the job quickly. i had to process, re-wrap, scan, load and unload packages and freight from trucks and the cans. some co-workers were easy to get along with."
good,its a job and management needs to get employees on one level when you bust your but off your the one who gets bothered but your other co-workers who lack get treated with royalty.
good,"This is a fast paced, physically challenging job. Strict time restraints. Long 12 hour days. Lots of overtime. Lifting up to 150 lbs."
good,"Very fast paced job"
good,Its a great environment and business for helping many with their packages and a great place for learning how the business operates. Its a good place also for Growth and Development in Communication Skills.
good,management is a lil sketchy and the pay is below standard for salary analysts jobs. benefits are outstanding. there is a hub mentality present that allows management to get outside of themselves
good,"Company is stable, provide job security. However, pays less considerable to its rival company. free to reach management. Transparent policy."
good,"It was a great company to work for, it help progress my leadership skills, and all areas of understanding how to run a company."
good,My management was very supportive and my co-workers was very friendly. I also got offered a higher paying position within two months of working there.
good,You either assist in production or shipping. There are some crazy people that come in. Great group of people to work with depending on the store. Hardest part of the job are the demanding customers and building custom boxes which could take hours. Most enjoyable part of the job is leaving for the day.
good,"A typical day at work is normally steady. We clock in, we have our five minute stretches, then we start the belt. Most days all planes and trucks are on time to be unloaded, organized and then ready to be loaded again with the right fright. I have learned time management because time is very important in order for everything to be shipped out and on time to be delivered."
good,The ours are reasonable however a split shift is taxing on your body. But the management is great when trying to finish a college degree but is lacking when it comes to actually doing managerial work.
good,A typical day at work is overseeing daily shipments for differnent accounts or companies. These shipments contain various items being shipped into the country.
good,typical day working at fedex is crazy. management are not always on the same page the part I enjoy most is meeting new customers and making them feel special
good,I normally worked in a position which I was by myself.  Work was done to the company's expectations.   The company supplied all equipment needed to perform my duties and when I had problems I had an assistant manager I could go to that helped me complete the task.  I enjoyed everyone I worked with on the shift I was assigned.
good,"Fun and very productive at the same time always busy i learned to be very efficient, my co workers where very great to work with the hardest part of my job was working with people that try to put all the work load on you.The most enjoyable part of he job is when i clocked out and go home after a long working day."
good,at the beginning of the day it was slow then the loads of boxes started to increase during the duration of the shift. Had groups of workers broken into teams to completed the truck loads. Co-workers was fun and productive. most enjoyable part of the job is finishing.
good,Heavy lifting while standing for hours minimum breaks high morale with great team members slow start to day but work passes time easily
good,"Good place to work, great benefits and a lot of growth opportunities.  A very strong and growing company to work for.  Most departments are flexible with hours."
good,Working for Fedex Express was a terrific experience. I dealt with different people daily. Also management provided support for any situation that was above my duties.
good,"I enjoy being employed at Federal Express.  It is physically demanding, but worth it.  You don't need a gym membership at all working here.  Everyone is to themselves, but if you have a good working attitude, you will be respected."
good,Sixflags is a good Summer job to earn a weekly check as a housekeeper. Being in the heat is just what makes the job longer and tough
good,"Good place to work, FedEx treats their employees pretty well.  Hardest part of the job is being able to sit all day, and getting over the boredom.  A big problem in the WNY locations is that you are expected to show up to work no matter the weather, but other locations through out the US always close for bad weather.  Sometimes req'd to work holidays.  The pay WAS fair for the work, but recently multiple responsibilities have been added without compensation.  Benefits are decent."
good,"FedEx is a good company to work for. They give a lot of good benefits to their workers to make sure that they stay safe and have money for the future. Also it's a really good company to move up and advance in such as, becoming a courier from being a material handler. The work environment there was decent a lot of fast pace, the workers were friendly but the workers there had short tempers based on how well and how fast you completed the job. The management at FedEx could have been better by giving the workers raises and taking there criticism and trying to make a change that the workers see as something important."
good,At Fed Ex I used to unload boxes onto the comveyer from the truck. Sometimes I scanned the boxes and sort them as well as look packages up.
good,The company was great to work for while I lived in the Chicagoland area and serviced the Midwest.When I relocated to the Phoenix area the work was not there to keep me busy.
good,decent job with no college experience required.  will get you started into a supervisor/management roll for future position or new career.
good,"I liked it there, I moved up pretty fast from being a parcel assistant. Would recommend this job to people finding an entry level job."
good,"Typical day come in clock in load boxes left to right NEATLY and SAFELY there big on safety here at FedEx then clock out after 4 maybe 4 1/2 hours . I learned how to work as a team is a person is overloaded with boxes in their trailer stop what your doing when your not so busy and help the person get cleared because there going to do the same to you management are cool taught us alot about safety.Hardest part is staying up to flow always be on your toes one minute you may barely have any boxes next minute it's like a sea of boxes. Most enjoyable is talking with the co workers about everything plans for weekend,school etc.. even talking with the managers about life their really down to earth people as well."
good,"Handling the Daily Inbound and Shipping Reports"
good,"Great place to work. Great training.  Great benefits.  Strong management. Best drivers and equipment in the industry, Highly competitive pay."
good,"All dock work is done during night shifts on forklifts. Majority of coworkers are helpful and great to work with. Managers and supervisors varied and were often being shuffled around."
good,"good benefit job to work at, once knowledge is gained and experience good job to move up in. Everyone knows everyone so its kind of a family orientated place."
good,Love working there. No need to elaborate. Will to rate in person if you would like more in detailed review. Have worked there for 7 years now and wouldnt want to work anywhere else.
good,"FedEx is extremely fast paced and physically demanding which also wears on a persons emotions.  This is the hardest part of the job especially if you are warehouse, air cargo personnel or a courier.  Other assignments are less vigorous physically and maybe more suitable for employees of the company.  Because the company is a world wide company providing deliveries it has a large selection of locations geographically.  Although needed, there are problems that can arise at a location and that do not get resolved.  Continued direction and bridging is a necessity to the healthiness of a FedEx location.  The most enjoyable part of my job at FedEx, no matter the role, was knowing that I provided the customer with the best customer service that could be delivered."
good,Being in good and healthy shape is a benefit for job duties. Don't let overwhelm work intimidate your able to finish your job duty.
good,I check to see if any inspections are due on the forklifts. If there are any dropped off over night I check the reason and create a repair order for them. I scan in on the repair order and conduct timely repairs.
good,"Working at FedEx has its own benefits, but when it comes to life with kids outside of FedEx it is hard to balance. Working third shift is easy because most times kids sleep while I am at work. However, the stress accumulated during the morning hours at FedEx plays a big roll into how the rest of your day goes. The work load can vary from under 9,000 packages up to 13,000 packages. Depending on the crew that we have could be a short shift or a long shift. Not knowing the amount of crew we will be working with can vary on a persons pay check week to week. I have learned that most places that dont have set hours will cut people just to save them money but make the rest of the work day harder on others. Managers at FedEx can be ""iffy"" some care others dont. I personally had an HR issue because they let me work in an area with boxes that could fall on my foot that wasnt covered by steel toe and nothing was done after I was in pain. FedEx is a great place to work after you make it over the minor speed bumps and get used to the work flow."
good,The job is hard work the hours can harsh and the company is  numbers based but is very rewarding. It's an awesome part time job with great benefits package.
good,My time working a seasonal position at Fedex during the graveyard shift did not interfere with my personal life and I would work it again. The management was exceptionally nice and very fair.
good,Management at the hub in memphis is a very stressful position.  Be prepared to work long hours and come in on your day off to finish administrative tasks.
good,Fedex is a very fast past job. They demand us to build really great walls with boxes and to do it fast and safely. We work at 4:30 in the afternoon and usually get done around 11 if not earlier. I have been there for a year and I like it a lot. The managers are great and the people I work with are great. Everyone helps everyone out.
good,"Typical day starts at 2/3am depending on freight! Depending on either of 5 stations you could be assigned to, a new Handler starts unloading incoming freight from Memphis or overseas. Bend,stoop and be careful of injuries or you'll get your first write up. Following schedule can be difficult as no one can take schedules home. High turn over due to scheduling,grunt work, injuries etc. Management is a small group of maybe 4 at one location. All report to specific manager and any concerns or issues he/she is your only way in or out! Favoritism is high but not loyal. Co-workers can be cool and fun to work with but after a while you will notice mood swings and foul attitudes. Hardest part is the schedule and tough managers. Most enjoyable part is walking out and feeling you belong to a great company although you knew the job was ruthless. Benefits!"
good,"My typical day at FedEx is arriving around 3:45am. Go and clock in when time allows me to. I grab a scanner and have a seat on a bench to await the meeting we have every morning. The managers tell us about what to expect with the number of packages we will handle, how we did on the precious day, and what we need to work. After the meeting, a group of us get together to stretch so that we don't pull a muscle while we handle the packages. Then I go to my designated spot get my scanner ready to scan packages. The packages come down the conveyor belt and I look at the label to see where the package goes. Then I put the package on the correct truck pallet for the delivery guy to put in the truck when he arrives. I scan packages to the correct truck. Hopefully the delivery guy gets all the packages he is supposed to have for his/her day, if not I help locate them. "
good,starting learning more in depth about diesel engines and its components through co workers and experience. enjoyed my job except for management...
good,To the point I left their employ I had been working for 13 years at night and felt a change was needed and there is not much room for advancement so me wife and I chose to start a business
good,"Training,"
good,"Very productive place to be employed. Interesting experience. Not a career choice for me, but there is money to be made."
good,"FedEx is a great temp job, the hours are held to a minimum but the benefits are a premium.  If your looking for some extra cash on top of your full time job or trying to get better benefits then FedEx is a great place to start."
good,"Get to work on scheduled time, scan, load, and  deliver packages in professional procedure. my hardest part working there is the labor with out a dolly i struggled. I learned how to adapt to all weather conditions.What i enjoyed most about work is that it keeps you busy from beginning to end of work day."
good,Great culture. Steady growing and progressing as a company. Co-workers were very helpful and motivating. Manager was new and unexperienced at leadership position so that caused minor rifts here and there.
good,Fed Ex Ground rushed you while working. You got the minimum amount of hours every week & got overworked for it. Management was good though.
good,I have to load 2 or 3 trailers every single day and it is very face pace. I get help from co workers sometimes and that really helps.
good,"I need to work closer to home.  Great co-wokers, continue education."
good,"My typical day consists of taking packages off the belt, scanning packages and loading trucks. Loading packages on the trucks according to routing number and address."
good,"time went fast, was a monday thru friday job had time to do other stuff with your personal life not like other jobs. enjoyed working there but i was young and dumb when i quited"
good,Loved working here. The Hardest part for me was the weight and size of packages to deliver I just could not handle them my back just couldn't take the strain without a possible injury
good,"Start times vary day to day, a steady work schedule would greatly change the moral of employees. Advancement is hard to do."
good,"At 7am everyday, I clock in and start my day. I first start, by gathering the correct packages to be delivered before 8am. Those packages are called First OVERNIGHTS. Once I finish delivering those, I head back to the station, park my van, and gather the packages I have to deliver by 10:30am. Those are called Priority Overnights, Or P1's. I normally finish my day by 11am. Sometimes, I stay later to help the fulltime couriers."
good,"FedEx doesn't hire full time employees unless you become a driver, even then the routs you will get are lousy. Getting with a good manager will make all the difference."
good,"Good job if you are a college student. However, beware, a lot of your co-workers will be older folks and this is their dead-end job."
good,"show up, clock in and start loading boxes."
good,"FedEx overall is an okay place to work not great and not terrible just okay. They offer health insurance which is a wonderful benefit, but it can be strenuous at times especially during peak season. Some of the management are really nice people, but like any other job there can be those who take it too far. Talking to people like children is one thing I didn't like and the constant yelling. If you want to go to a company where you can advance FedEx definitely offers that."
good,"Well Working At FedEx Is A Good Place To Work Getting To Know People Helping Them. Sometimes You have A Good Day Sometimes You Not, But The Only Way You Have A Good Day Is How You Come To Work With a good attitude good positive thinking."
good,pretty straight forward job. very cool job. deliver throughout all bay area. great team. get to work with great people. great company.
good,"Depending on your shift, your day can begin with hopping into a busy, slow or even up and down day, depending on the day of the week and month. FedEx office scheduling can be a bit frustrating, do to their computer scheduling system. You will be required to work 3 - 4 hours alone if your an opener or closer on the shift. Team members are typically trained to do this but, sometimes if there is an emergency call out or a team member is sick and has to go home, you could end up getting a quick lesson in closing, opening or even running the store alone. Your required to lift at least 55lbs, be able to great customers your entire shift, sell products and know how to use a computer. "
good,i unloaded packages and sorted packages. scanning was also a big part of it. i learned to work in a fast environment. A typical day would consist of communicating with your co-workers being able to handle all the incoming of the material. Also knowing when to ask for help.
good,FedEx Freight is a great company to work for. They offer good benefits and have competitive pay. The work schedule can be difficult at times to balance with life outside of FedEx.
good,"A typical work day began at 2am until 9am, fast paced? well that a understatement , we have the most busy fedex freight facility in our country. with about ten 50 foot trailers to fill between asix man team it was hectic but we worked as one and got in done, actually setting a record my second month there."
good,"Was a fun job at times, Very fast-paced, Well organized, Learned to load and unload trucks in a very fast pace, The Co-workers was very easy to get along with, great management."
good,"I would always start my day racing my the guy across me and see who could get more scans by the end of the shift, and the one that losses has to buy lunch on or we would have to pay in exercise."
good,"Overall I enjoy working for this company. I do not wish to leave, but I need a more flexible work schedule, and I am looking for something part time."
good,"Empresa com muitas oportunidades com muitos colegas e principal com nome uma das maiores do mundo."
good,scanning in packages and taking them to they're rightful owners
good,"At this job we always have fun  we work as a team "
good,typical day is picking up envelopes and packages from local businesses and drop boxes.
good,"very time basis job time is of the essence with this job"
good,"a typical day would be loading and unloading cans all day, or making labels, or processing and reprocessing. I mostly enjoyed sortation at FedEx. My managers were friendly but also strict. My coworkers showed a lot of teamwork and were very helpful when needed to be. the hardest part of the job would be bad weather made conflict. I enjoyed my hours and days off."
good,"i really dont have any complaints. The culture at fedex is very inviting and the opprotunity is aplenty, job security shouldnt be a problem either."
good,"A delivery driver job is very fast paced and often requires long hours of work. It is fun driving, being out on the road and meeting customers."
good,"A typical day was usually in and out, ha-ha! We went in clocked into work around 4:30 a.m, discussed the volume or flow of packages to basically self estimate how long we would be at work. Do our jobs to the best of our abilities, clocked out between 6:30-7 a.m, 8 to 9 a.m on a good day. I've learned many things from FedEx. Sorting mail and packages, proper ways to stack or organization all while working in a very fast past environment. My past co-workers are like my brothers other co-workers were pretty cool too, timely!, but cool. The hardest part of my job was maintaining thousands of packages weighing 50+ pounds to ounces, from items as small as IPhone boxes to 20 foot metal pipes and other odd shaped packages. Getting up at 2 in the morning wasn't a walk in the park when i started but i got use to it. Lastly, the most enjoyable part of the job was seeing my team honestly, and the sweet paychecks."
good,"I really enjoy this company, the people I work with and the hours worked. "
good,"load and unload trailers by hand, pallet jack, or forklift"
good,"Typical work day consisted of loading and unloading freight from company trailers which usually taught us how to work at an appropriate work pace while being safe. Management was very sociable and relating. Co workers had great team work and were always willing to help you when you needed it. The hardest part of the job would be unloading trailers that were loaded incorrectly, which made it a safety issue. The most enjoyable part of the job was always being busy which made the day go buy quick."
good,Assiting the supervisor with the helping out the coworkers.
good,Best thing about Fedex is sense of community and family which one can perceive and appreciate.
good,"will have a great future"
good,"*Generate damaged packages claim reports"
good,"Each day starts with a yard inspection, followed by cross checking with an inventory spreadsheet on which trailers need to be processed first, and then assign each to a specific sort.(day, twilight or midnight) Once every other month, there are teleconferences that need to be attended in which corporate discusses new procedures and technologies that will be implemented in the coming months. Every so often, you are assigned a new person to train and eventually become your back-up in case of emergencies. Communication is always key with management and your co-workers. This is to ensure that all of you are on the same page, and whatever work is not completed due to time constraints, can be finished by your co-worker. There will be days when weather can cause severe delays on freight, which are beyond your control, and then there are days where you will have completed all the day's work in half the time you're there."
good,os dias de trabalho são atribulados mais muito proveitosos.
good,"very fast paced, friendly, great team cohesion, great work environment"
good,A typical day usually consist of non-stop bagged freight coming down a slide. Protocol is to scan and transfer to correct can. I learned how to be more proactive when it comes to helping others.
good,"Constant change."
good,"driving a vehicle on a route , meeting new people all the time , learning new areas constantly"
good,Loading and unloading of trucks and trailers. reading load numbers and getting them to the right trailers. dirty when it comes to dusty environments.
good,"fun work, keeps you moving, day flies. if they paid more it would have been awesome. they relay on temp workers."
good,"Scan , sort & load the freight according to time commitments. Del the freight, then make the scheduled pick ups."
good,"Hard work with excellent team building"
good,"Tuesday - Saturday 3am - 8am, Working in a warehouse with 20 or 30 other people. Work is very physical and non-stop. Rewarded with raises through out the first year."
good,"Fedex Hub can be good or bad. Depends on the areas you work in. Always have to be prepared for anything. Be aware of the weather at at all times. "
good,"kinda wierd hours "
good,My experience within FedEx Ground was like no other. A typical day would consist of loading one truck after another until management needed me to unload other trucks. The work would sometimes be difficult as far as overwhelming packages being jammed on the van lines causing an over flow once it reached my truck or others. The other employees were very helpful and some were energetic. What I've learned and consumed is that once people start to work as a team anything can be done.
good,"There is no hard part about Fed Ex from my perspective. After learning their computer software and what management is looking for, I was capable of fulling their needs. Everyone has an assigned time to clock in and must be back at the building at a certain time. Managing time while on road delivering and picking up packages is important to ensure the task is completed. "
good,"great company to work for, specially  if your a young person  wanting a career."
good,"A typical work day at FedEx is unloading and loading about 80,000 packages a day. Lots of sweat and stress on the body. Its a very physical job. At FedEx i have learned that once you do your job and do it correct, an opportunity will arise. In my opinion, its a well managed company but there are some goods and some bad. Like every other company, there are going to be the co-workers that come to work and then there are going to be the ones that doesn't want to work. You just got to learn to live with it but co-workers make the job more fun.  Hardest part of the job is unloading. The most enjoyable part of the job is loading."
good,"If you can deal with warehouse enviroments this is it, and probably one of the hardest and fast paced warehouse jobs out there. If you don't want to use your muscle or break a sweat not the place for you. If you're willing to work a very physical job for about 4 or more hours straight for good pay and benefits go here. you will be tired and you will be soar."
good,I really enjoyed the experience. It made me a better and diversed person.
good,"Learned that we work as a team no matter what the situation is. Busy, fast pace work environment. Enjoy working with the team and for Fedex. Hardest part of the job is learning to keep up with the fast pace at first and only down fall is when you do slow down, someone is yelling at ya to hurry up. Got to pick up the pace back up as quickly as you can."
good,"There are many great people and opportunities at Fedex Services.  However, I saw the company change a lot during my time there and it just was no longer the company I went to work for."
good,Sin duda una de las mejores empresas para trabajar por las ventajas y condiciones laborables que tienes
good,it was great working here learned a lot of new skills co workers were great
good,Short shifts with the chance to work extra on top of one's schedule. Back breaking work but it was appreciated/motivated
good,Last resort type job. Everybody works here atleast once in their lives. Best benefits & insurance!
good,"FedEx is a great company to work for with great benefits. In my experience  in working with them, I've gained abilities both tangible as well as intangible.  A typical employee for this company must first possess the character trait of ""integrity"".  You must treat every package like it's ""golden"" because you don't know how much that package means to the consumer your delivering/picking up from.  So there must immediately be a level of passion for doing this job.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with outlying factors that you have no control over when trying to achieve your goal of timely deliveries/pickups.  Those factors may be, traffic, accidents, slow customers, etc.  The most enjoyable part of this job to me is providing the consistent satisfaction to customers on a daily basis.  Over time, that relationship that was immediately built through great service works in your favor during situations when your affected by those unfair ""outlying factors"" that affect your making service."
good,"Clock into work and received paper work to unload trailers and work with other to load where the freight is going. The goal at FedEx Freight is to use every bit of space in a trailer. Hardest part of the job is having to re-work a trailer to make sure that all the space can be use(putting taller freight in the front of the trailer) doing this safely but fast paste to make the cut-times. another thing is making sure the trailer scales if it has over 20,000lbs for pubs and 40,000 for vans. Management make sure everyone doing there part to get the job done. A lot of my co-workers come in to work with a good attitude ready to work and knock out another day at the office this makes the job fun to work at and happy to work for this company."
good,Fast past work with hard working employees.  Good place to work.
good,I have enjoyed working for FedEx Express. FedEx does it best to improve the customer delivery experience.
good,".good job to work at"
good,"Hours were variable, from 11:30 pm to finish."
good,Physical and fast-paced work environment with extreme working conditions depending on weather.
good,Fedex is a great company to work. The enviroment is productive and fun.
good,"Account Executive.  Sales and Marketing within, assigned territory."
good,"A typical day could be only up to 6 hours or little as 3, I haven't learned really anything about the job seeing as ive loaded freight before on hilos, management is respectful and helps if need be."
good,"Working as a package handler is truly a tough job. It is demanding, and exhausting, but it is also fast-paced and interesting. This is a good job for somebody who has just started working or for an undergraduate home from school."
good,"Great bennifit package, fair ammount of pay considering economy. keeps you in shape, customers gennerally happy to see you everyday."
good,Fedex is a good fit for those comfortable working on their feet and moving quickly. It is generally a positive environment and can be fun. A lack of training for new hires is readily apparent.
good,"The workplace was a workout!! When the shift was over, you wanted just a little more!!"
good,"A empresa me agradou muito na entrevista eu havia acabado de ser registrado quando ela foi vendida para a multinacional FedEx(antiga Rapidão Cometa), com muitos funcionários. Mesmo com tantas pessoas a organização era visível e controlada.O trabalho não era difícil e Logística foi uma área onde me interessei muito e me identifiquei."
good,I typically worked 9 hours a day Monday- Friday. I managed 25 to 30 employees on a daily basis. I learned that multi-tasking is a must to be successful. My fellow managers were a vital part of our teams success. We planned out our day based on the amount of people we had on each load side. I ran the unload and I had to plan the amount of volume I could feed the laod sides based on the plan. The hardest part of my job was the work/home balance. My job was very time consuming and demanding. I enjoyed training and retaining my team of employees and we built long lasting relationships. There is nothing wrong with having employees that will give you their all and lay it all on the line when it is crunch time.
good,I enjoy working with FedEx Ground and have learned a lot of new skills to improve my knowledge.
good,"I like working at FedEx, I love my job. I just wish that it would have benefits and possibly hourly pay. We are paid by the day finish early or finish late it is the same pay. Its nice when you finish early but that rarely happens."
good,a fun place to work with very nice co-wokers and decent pay its a lot of hard work and very early hours but if u can manage it its well worth it
good,High paste and physical with customer service experience. Fun to work outdoors with challenges in time management skills
good,good job environment once you get to know the people you work with
good,FedEx is a great place to work in most regards.  Definitely a place that offers job security and a chance to move up the corporate ladder.
good,"Good fast paced environment, very physical so you can stay in shape."
good,"A typical day at work involves singing in, packing or unpacking a truck (whichever i am needed to do) in a fast pace."
good,"Delivered packages to customers at local business and private residences.  "
good,"-I do the daily cash flows to see if we request cash for payments "
good,"- ótima equipe de Trabalho."
good,"-I have learned to work smart and safe in this type of industry"
good,"During my employment at FedEx, I had the privilege of working with 35 wonderful men.  They watch out for me constantly, as well as each other. It was like having 35 big brothers!"
good,"I've learned to scan, and organize packages according to sequence numbers"
good,Overall a great company to work for. The hardest part is the standing in one spot all day.
good,Good place to work if you dont mind having half a life. Work is consumed alot by this place.
good,"Great place to work!"
good,I enjoyed the friendly atmosphere.  Everyone was very helpful when I had questions
good,"A typical day at FedEx Ground, working on a conveyor belt scanning packages to their assigned trucks and loading them into 1 of 3 different trucks that i load"
good,"Good place to work for fast pace and high expectations.  Management is great and co-workers are polite. Hardest part of the job is changing work conditions, but overall manageable."
good,"At Night I would come in and enter the data from the freight bills before the trucks would take off to the hubs.  There were a few of us there, we managed to get the work done and have a good time."
good,"Your everyday hustle and bustle work environment. Lively atmosphere, good teamwork, good managers and they keep a good ear to the concerns of the boots on the ground. Must say dress accordingly as to your position. Good rewards for a job well done are always in reach. Team work is a crucial factor."
good,"good place to work , learn lot of things about international and domestics courrier."
good,"i enjoy my job at fed ex ground more than some do i am sure."
good,Facilitate the deployment of large scale enterprise IT Service to meet customer needs.
good,"My job usually starts with a audit of work from the previous night, making sure all those documents are cleared and ready to be exported. Afterward I begin processing the documents that were assigned to me, which can be as few as 4 up 50 documents a night. Making sure these documents have the correct departure date as well as the correct sender and recipient information, overall making sure all the information is being keyed into the system properly. My primary job is making sure the customer receives their package on time and to their expectations. I've learned that staying focused and being accountable for your work takes you a lot of places. What I enjoy most about my job is the people I work with."
good,"A typical day at work is being tugged in several directions for all different kinds of tasks. Ive learned alot here from proper business discussion edicut, usage of AS-400/DALL system, How to use our companies mapping system. 75% of the time there is an absent of the upper management group. A lot of the station decisions as well as it being run is left to the middle management/ low level management groups. Most of the co-workers are a great group to work with there are a few problem children. The hardest part of this job is the lack of comunication between upper management and the lower level employees which leaves a lot of improvisation room on the rest of the group. The most enjoyable part is hereing all the different delivery stories from the drivers throught the day."
good,I load cans & unload trucks for 2-3 hours straight. I got along with my co-workers & my manager.
good,"I enjoyed my position as a ramp agent. However, management really sucks at IAD. A lot of micromanaging, favoritism was a constant thing there. I'd go back if it was under different management."
good,A fast pacing environment is a typical day at work. I learned how to move faster with heavy objects and how to lift them accordingly to the weight and height. My co-workers was generous and helpful as they could be to help each other with work. The hardest part of the job is consistently lifting heavy objects at a quick pace. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you can sort the packages to the area they are getting sent.
good,I enjoy working at FedEx its a new experience though. I'm new to it but i'm learning a lot and the men help out a lot.
good,It is a great part time job with good benefits. Company progression depends on seniority.
good,"Loved being out in the world and not just in an office all day."
good,"Employees are expected to perform and meet expectations as well as ""do the right thing"" on the job and in the way they treat FedEx customers."
good,"if you work hard, you advance--the company takes care of the hard working."
good,"Report for work by 330 am finish by 730 at the latest and rarely worked that late unless during peak seasons."
good,I always like working at a steady pace and Fedex Ground does exactly that
good,"Tres acces sur l'humain, Bonne politique salariale, tres bonne culture d'entreprise"
good,i clock in and go to my assigned trailor and i start loading the packages into the trailors. i learned to be observant and follow specific instruction. The hardest part of the job was trying to get more hours
good,"Everyday was the same, but different in the sense of details. I learned that this company really gave a lot to this country by changing the way freight is moved in the world as we see it today. Management can be good but bad at times but again it was a lot of pressure trying to do the impossible but making it happen. At this company i met the greatest friends i have ever had in my life, and wouldn't change that for the world. It was really a life changing time of my life employed with this company. The hardest part was leaving, and now to regret ever leaving. The enjoyable time I had with this company were when i had the pleasure to go to Memphis,Tn for the C.D.L. Tractor trailer driving course for three weeks, Unreal !!!"
good,a typical day of work was fun and fast paced. my co workers were great people to work with nice team work they offered. My manager was very understanding and strict. I loved working with him the hardest part of the job was meeting quota but we made it a game and inside competition against each other so everyone made it just to out do the other it was great
good,it was a hard labor job with tough hours. This job is more ideal for single young man compared to a family man who as other responsibilities and needs to have some energy after work.
good,I really like working for FedEx. I'm very good at what I do and I regularly get recognized for that. They make it easy to have a balance of life and work. During my time there I have had to have a few surgeries and I also lost my father but it was never a big deal. I have fairly clear expectations and as long as those expectations are met and exceeded I am free to do as I need for myself so that I can do more for my company.
good,"·Typical day was very fast-moving and productive. I how to read receiving codes, load trucks and the inventory accountability process. The management was very strict. My co-workers were hardworking and focused. The hardest part of the job was the heavy lifting. Most enjoyable part was accounting for the merchandise."
good,"FedEx Ground is one of the best companies that I have worked for.  My only problem is the long commute from my home in Crossfield to close to the Calgary Airport.  "
good,"A great job for those that bring a high energy to work everyday. Those that can focus on the tasks, while moving at a fast pace will enjoy this work. The downside is that the senior employees always get their choice of vacation slots and any possible overtime or new route bids."
good,I had the opportunity to learn how to fuel and service all types of aircraft.
good,"A typical work day is spent meeting with customers, presenting Customer Business Review, Pricing Proposals and Implementation of Sales Agreements.  The transportation industry is quite interesting and fascinating.  There are always new things on the horizon and changes in the way the company operates.  Technology is key to the success of the organization.  There is quite a hierarchy in management.  I am on a team of 10, 8 Account Executives, 1 Administrative Assistance and 1 District Sales Manager.  We are a very cohesive group that shares information and Best Practices.  The best part of this job is the success of finding, getting and keeping the business I have procured.  It is our FIND, GET, KEEP initiative.  I enjoy cold calling and the follow-up it takes to secure profitable business."
good,Only worked seasonal but during that time it was a good place to work. :)
good,Every moment of your time is accounted for as a customer service representative with this company.
good,"I currently work at the guard shack/gate and moniter incoming and departing routes. I build their route and hand them paperwork to sign and give back and the driver keeps a copy. I answer the phone when drivers call in their arrival or departing times and if bring back product I input the information and print to that location so the driver can leave with the load. "
good,I loved working for Fedex for the benefits and pay. As I have gotten older the hours have decreased and I need more financial stability. I've worked in several areas and have learned a lot about the way the operation works. The hardest part of the job is working in the weather no matter what good or bad. The most enjoyable thing about the job is meeting new people and learning the operation
good,Retirement benefits are among the best. That is all that I care to share.
good,Retirement benefits were among the best.  This is all that I care to share.
good,I worked part time during night hours. The work environment was extremely soothing. I enjoyed the hours and the pay. The job has given me and advantage to push myself. I learned alot working at FedEx.
good,"My job consists of route planning and customer contacts then travel to customer sites and make repairs or replace equipment. I assist customers on a dailey basis with software and desktop use. I assist co-workers with projects of difficulty to assure we complete the task as a team. Hardest part is long road trips, 3 hours one way then back. The most enjoyable part is the satisfaction I get from knowing that I did a good job and my customers are happy, even if they do not acknowledge it to me I can see that they enjoyed my service."
good,This job allowed me insight on shipping and receiving. For the most part it was a very productive and positive work place.
good,checked and sorted packages. easy to get along with co workers. most enjoyable part of job was the benefits even though you were a part time worker
good,"FED EX FREIGHT is a very enjoyable place to work, everyone works as a team to get the job done. The job is not really that difficult but there are times when you can be overwhelmed with the amount of freight that comes you're way. The most enjoyable part of the job is how they reward you for your efforts."
good,Its good work with Fed Ex because they give you good benefits and payment but the management its not good especialy the main man of the terminal.
good,"Leuk bedrijf om te werken, met zeer leuke collega,s."
good,Steady work flow and interesting work.  At times hectic and there were emergencies .
good,This place is great for students and those who are going to college or other schools. They offer part time work and offer different shifts so you can work around your school schedule. The only con is you need to be ready to work hard and very fast. it isnt an easy job to work at.
good,"A typical day at FedEx is very fast paced during the morning, because you have to deal with a lot of address verification and package handling before 8am. Once the drivers are gone for their daily deliveries, the second half of the morning into the day is handling a high volume of phone calls from customers and customer reps who calling to verify either the address or the status of their package."
good,"On a typical day, I come in and first check the trailers on the yard and reconcile with Excel sheet to ensure that all freight is accounted for. My job is to keep track of inbound and outbound freight. Management is easy to get along with as well as co-workers. The hardest part of the job is just having to go through everything with a fine toothed comb to ensure that no freight is overlooked. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with initiative unsupervised and the interaction with the drivers and customers."
good,"dealing with FMCSA meeting guildlines, p/u & delivering time sensitive frieght 24/7 365 days /year. plus all the various state regs"
good,Is a good job for those who can rise early and handle a fast paced work environment.  Manage others to do the job to the best of their abilities.  Learn how to effectively and efficiently manage labor in an environment that changes daily.
good,Pick up work bring to desired place. How Fedex Tech Connect receives their product and how they ship it out. Great management team. Good co-workers. Nothing hard about the job. To see my co-workers everyday 
good,On a typical you will be loading trailers making sure to load them left to right with tight walls and good visual appeal.
good,FedEx is a good company with good benefits. The amount of employees at your station can change your thoughts on how the company works. A small station with only one manager will have a tighter work group and relationship with management. A bigger station with multiple managers may not. I always find it more comforting to get the know the co-workers the best. The employees are the ones that know the ins and outs of the company from a different aspect. The hardest part of the job would be mastering your job requirements. This company changes so much its hard to stay on top of things. I enjoy have relationships with my co-workers off the clock. People are different while they are on the clock.
good,"A typical day at work requires patience and being able to keep up with other employees and maintaining a proffesional attitude at all times. i learned to be a team player and to have a positive attitude. Management is very aware and cares about their employees and does what is required to run the company efficiently. there is no hard part about working at fedex, and the most enjoyable part about working at fedex is the diversity and the enjoyment of being able to work with others"
good,I work from 3pm to 11pm Monday through Friday. Hardest part of my job our my hours.
good,My days at work is very busy. Management there make sure all employees learn everything it is to learn about Fed Ex workplace. The co-workers are fun and team players. The enjoyable part is that we get the job done.
good,overall great experience and built some good relationships wouldnt change that for the world.
good,"Fedex Office requires a lot of variety of work environments. We are expected to be experts at FEDEX Shipping, general FEDEX Office order taking, production order fulfillment, coordination of staffing requirements, general help to customers in our self service departments,and general trouble shooting skills come into play on a daily basis. I've learned many valuable skills over my tenure at FEDEX Office. Being part of a team, working to get the job accomplished on a day to day basis, whether that be a FEDEX issue, consulting on order taking from the customers, or helping out customers with limited experience with the copying/printing industry. Multitasking is the name of the game, and often that is the biggest issue. Often it feels as if we are making a u-turn in our processes on a daily basis, based on the customer need and the requirements of the day. The most enjoyable part of the business is the people. Whether it be the customer interactions that are made, or the team members working together for a common goal, the people are the key to our positive work environment."
good,"The shift would consist of unloading/loading boxes on a moving belt. I enjoyed the people, but had and accident where my ears needed medical attention."
good,Responsible for account maintenance within the largest logistics company in the world. Upgraded services as needed to better customize the clients experience. Ended working offline support to fulfill corporate initiatives.
good,Loved working for the company. It was hectic but still fun. It kept me on my toes. You had to be very organized and know how to handle customers.
good,Fast paced work environment with room to improve and move up in the company. Hard working employees.
good,Read and analyze flight data to make sure that proper weights are being adhered to for mail and packages.
good,Good place to work overall but the hours don't support an adult that has to support a family
good,Load truck and deliver packages and customer service. Driving all day in the heat. The customers.
good,"good job,good hours. nice coworkers, but the managers dont communicate enough."
good,• Load delivery vehicles
good,Very fast paced while learning every detail on a daily basis. the hardest part of the job was working on the 18 wheelers but it was worth the experience.
good,"When the group was hired, we were told only 1/3 would make it. Usually most of those quitting because they couldn't handle the about of physical work required."
good,"associates and managers are very friendly and helpful, no room to move up in company."
good,"I operated a forklift and loaded and unloaded freight from inbound and outbound trailers, separated freight according to load type and manually decked freight to maximize trailer space. Great pay and good benefits even for part time employees."
good,"I worked there for almost four years. Started as a package handler, and was promoted after two years, to QA Clerk."
good,• Properly place received materials in correct and secure locations
good,• Evaluated incoming and outgoing packages
good,It was a good job. i liked it. i was in good position there and it was good environment as well.
good,"Great seasonal job, good pay and benefits. It a very fast pace job that require a lot of physical strength."
good,A typical day at work was fun. Had a great team on my belt. We believed in eachother and we all did our job successfully. I learned how to be a team player and leader.
good,"Overall, it was a very fast paced enviroment that indulged in making customer satisfied with food service and being a leader."
good,The one thing that stand out most that I have carried out into my everyday is being able manage my time so much better and communication skill has definitely enhance. You really don't get to spend alot time with your co workers because majority of your work we as couriers are on the road by ourselves.
good,Basically my job was to download truck beds and scan packages.
good,"I have worn many hats in my tenure with FedEx: developer, linux/unix/windows admin, storage admin, business continuity architect, project manager, data center migration architect, Documentum admin, ISO/PCI/SOX audit point of contact and remediation lead, and the list goes on. My current focus involves, technical design, planning, build, and execution of a large scale data center migration for the enterprise document management systems. In the course of this work I meet routinely with the officer board, vendors (both onsite and offshore), and OEMs to review SLAs."
good,"• The position required very good navigator skills, an uncanny sense of direction and exceptional map reading capabilities"
good,"Everyday is basically the same, we come in and perform our usual tasks and go home, but on the other hand, you do get to have communication challenges with different package handlers that work under your supervision. Daily we work with handheld devices that work on windows and a computer that determine how well we work or basically telling you how much longer we have to run the building to perform our task and completing our work for the rest of the week, compared to other jobs, I believe this one is the best because it changed my life on different aspects on viewing things in general, and help me understand that the most fun thing to do at work is the help people."
good,A typicla day at work is when you have your heavy days and light days and trying to get all packages delivered on time.Ive learned to drive much more cordal and safer. Co-workers are fun to work with maybe not all but I choose to work alone.
good,My co workers made working for FedEx the most enjoying postition working there.
good,simple work day in all....no difficult moments....there isnt really a good part of the job since its only part time
good,"Working for FedEx was an overall great experience for me! Very fast paced! great pay, every week!"
good,I work there and its highly unpredictable and strenous but rewarding as well
good,"Part time fast past working. I learned to multitask and work dilligently.Hardest part is working fast in a hot factory, The enjoyable part is working with different people and having teamwork to get the job done."
good,Great company although there should be same adjustments.
good,"FedEx Office is a an environment where you truly have to be able to multitask. At any time you may be in the process of running a print job on one copier, fixing another, assisting someone to fax or make their own copies in the self service area, and have someone waiting on you to come and assist them with a computer issue, and another waiting to ship a package. I enjoy working at FedEx Office because no two days are ever the same. Each day presents a new challenge but this is also the most difficult part of the job."
good,Worked as a sub contractor. Hours were very long and no matter what the weather conditions are you still have to go out and deliver packages. Pay was good but no benefits. Advancement opportunities did not exist.
good,come in and talk to employes before work start and everyone starts talking about how they day went the day before.Your boss would come around and talk to everyone about what is going on that day.
good,Was Working OverNight Loading Two Trailers n Scanning Box All At The Same Time Thats Hard Work But Loved It Tho!!
good,"check the slide for container availability and condition of containers, check out scanning equipment and astra label printers, move uld's (unit loading devices) to appropriate city id locations on the slide, set up checker station and no-con areas, pick up driving equipment ( tugs or people movers) as needed,open Ramp office and open my Pc Weight and Balance software , scan check, load, close, and weigh uld's for transport on specific aircraft.

Keep detailed ppwk retention and files , Physical and verbal confirmation of freight left over ( piece count and weight of combined freight) to ensure expeditious movement of said freight."
good,"Busy breaking down freight and moving freight to locations and driving forklift to load out trucks. Making sure drivers leave the building on schedule. Then turning my attention on dock coverage to wait on customers in shipping and receiving. Checking warehouse for any over look freight. Processing freight for customs clearance. ( What I've learned) I've learned to drive a forklift with great skills and all type of GSE ( Ground support equipment) To pay attention to details.*(Management )has a lot of discretion in decision making. Some good, some bad.(Co-workers) Most of my co-workers are dedicated employees. (Hardest thing about my job is) Getting drivers out on schedule. ( Most enjoyable part of the job). The people I work with and the those I meet."
good,FedEx has great job security and pays well for the type of jobs they hire for and qualifications needed.
good,"Physically demanding job, which works for me as I am active. Early morning hours are rough sometimes. For the most part everyone works as a good team helping others when necessary."
good,"Mucha investigacion analisis de procesos. Aprendí mucho sobre branding, manejo de estrategias de marketing y apertura de nuevos mercados"
good,"My co-workers and I worked together as a team to complete projects on time and helped each other with our customers to ensure they received the best customer service. I worked out of a 24 hour Fedex location and there wasn't a moment we weren't busy, but as a team we made it work."
good,a little political with moving up but after you figure in all what they do for you it is a good company
good,"I managed the OB Sort and learned much in the shipping and receiving industry. Most co-workers were great, management was not. Depending on location (each location has it's own Sr. Manager for the most part) the job could be great or just plain he**. The hardest part of the job was working in a toxic environment caused by the particular Sr. Manager at this particular location. The most enjoyable part of the job was all the rest of it. It kept you on your toes and kept you engaged but was still fun and laid back at times. Most employess are blue collar down to earth people."
good,Liked the fast pace and continuos work out through work time.
good,A typical day at work would be any normal day were we would go ahead and do our routine and work early in the morning. We would check for any damage tools and test them before we would start our work. I would say that safety is first at all times. Management was great they wore very helpful they would help you with anything that you didn't understand they would teach you the procedure step by step. The co-workers wore very helpful also it's about team work everyone has to help everyone who is in need of help. The hardest part of the job was the condition of the weather if it was rainy or windy it would really make hard for us to do our job it made it twice as hard to get the job done.
good,"Scan pkgs in truck,deliver & pod with scans....Safety,customer service and being organized.Tought,needs perfection,must meet set goal....Some are team players...Very physical.....Working unsupervised.."
good,This was a great job as the world was changing to more modern forms of telecommunications. We helped manage Telephone systems and Data for companies. Installing and provishioning T1 lines as well as setting up systems as very fun and exciting. Our custmoers were nationwide so things like weather would somtimes come into play.
good,Love Fedex fast paced keep you on your toes. Good company to work for. Amen
good,been a road driver for freight for alot of years
good,"No two days are the same. The company's culture is a fast paced, deadline and process driven company. This is a double edged sword in that it fosters perfection with every client to increase business and set the standard for other businesses; however, it can sometimes cause employees to become burnt out and discouraged when rewards and recognition do not occur. The pace never slows down and the bar is always moving to a higher rung. I admire that in FedEx as a company. This is the main reason they are industry leaders and gives their employees a sense of pride and purpose in what they do. The best part about the job is the sense of team work and commaraderie amongst the employees in order to get the job done accurately and on time every time. The hardest part of the job is not having a set schedule. Your personal life can take a back seat in order to meet the demands of the business. So working nights and weekends in addition to your regular day schedule can tire you out quickly. The company does offer fantastic healthcare benefits and 401k packages; however, they do not compensate very well on a salary level and bonuses are rare. It is very easy to advance within the company which not only drives loyalty with the employees but also proves that management does take interest in their suboordinates. FedEx's values include people, community, integrity, teamwork, excellent customer service, etc. I have learned so much from FedEx that I could not learn in a college classroom. The company has taught me how to lead people versus manage, communicate effectively, be solution minded,"
good,I loved my job here there just wasn't enough hours to make ends meet since it was a part time position.
good,The best part of driving for FEDEX was the independence and freedom to do the job as well as meeting and interacting with the public.
good,"5 stars, its a cool place to work. Fedex offers benefits alot of jobsdont offer. I like working for the company, i get the opportunity to see the inside and out. I like to meet some of the people that make it happen. Hopeflly I get the chance to meet Fred Smith."
good,Fast paced environment.Learned how packaging of parcels and sensitve data is shipped.Co-workers has to work as team period.The hardest part of the job was the heat issues.
good,"It was a new experience for me, and met alot of interesting people."
good,Everyone is there to help you advance and learn everything about the company. They have great medical benefits.
good,"very high speed job.required alot of focus and will powers.learning how to stack freight & compact freight.management was good,good motivators"
good,A typical day at work is busy. You work 3-4 hours a day and do a lot. Learned how to do everything a manager know how to do. Benefits are great the pay should be more. Co-workers are friendly.
good,Fast pace environment with safety being one of the primary goals. My co-workers are fun and work hard to complete all assignments. Getting paid and staying in shape.
good,Learned how to be efficient with time management and how to work
good,"My day consists of helping customers pack and ship packages, scanning and copying documents, creating business proposals and invitations. I also assist customers with faxing, creating and printing business cards, postcards, and mailing lists; among a long list of other things."
good,"At FedEx Freight, we deliver! The customer takes precedence and we work hard to meet their needs."
good,"All the work is done around the same time everyday. Although the work is done at the same time everyday, I'm sure more hours would be appreciated among employees."
good,"I never thought I'd like clerical and office work as much as I do after working at FedEx. The customers were hostile sometimes, but that's understood. I love paperwork, data entry, answering phones, helping people, helping co workers. The benefits are great if you can get out of package handling, and into management or clerical."
good,"As a seasonal driver, it was a fast paced job that keeps you on your towes."
good,I have worked at FedEx for over a year now and they have taught me many things about the job world. If you work hard enough and consult with your manager you will move up in position fairly rapidly. Each new position up gives more responsibility as well. As long as you do your job show up on time it is a descent place to work. This is not a place however for those who can not push through tough manual labor.
good,FedEx boast of their benefits as if they are the only company that still offers such great benefits when in fact their benefits are average. Not the exceptional benefits that they try to make you believe. Also FedEx is very political. If you want to play the corporate game one will do fine. Pay is not as great as one would think unless one is in the upper echelons.
good,Overall this is a good and friendly company to work for however it is very difficult to advance in. Depending on your manager some with listen to you while others will ignore you so it is hard to say. I had three while I worked hear two where great the last was a nightmare.
good,Road drivers are treated very well at FedEx Freight.  Good company to work for and willing to work with all types of scheduling needs. Good pay and also good insurance and retirement benefits.
good,Fast paced environment that helps the world receive packages that are sent across the globe. Great team work to organize and send out everything that has to get sent out.
good,Days here are started by having a group stretch before we get to work. I’ve learned how to properly carry and move with a heavy package. Management here always helps the employees when they need it.
good,Training is not a strong suit and processes are broken down so you don't learn anything.  People are good and friendly but not the best workers or the easiest to work with.
good,You should have other job when working at here because it’s a part time job. It’s only 4 hours and 6 hours max. I recommend you have a second job or don’t work here at all
good,Det var ibland stressigt men samarbetsförmågan mellan kollegerna var bra. Bra atmosfär.
good,Fast passed you have to get your delivery's and pick ups done no mater the traffic or weather. You have to plan your time off once a year for the next year.
good,My fellow employees were very friendlly and helpfull! The managers were incredibly helpful and would give advice to make the job easier. Also it was a very clean place.
good,"A great place to work ,but Management needs to be a little more flexible. Also the company needs to hire more supplemental resources so that more of the city and road drivers can get some time off"
good,When you first walk in its a loud environment.They provide you with equipment to do your job where ever you are place. Its a fast pace and physically demanding environment if you have restrictions they will work with you.
good,High Energy work place which is on going from start to finish. High level of customer service interaction. Great benefits for family and students continuing education.
good,The culture at the workplace was good and moreover I enjoyed doing that job as its longlasting.The management was very careful about the workers and their needs so I like the place very much
good,Good work place  to be if you like to work and hours I had fun working here for the time I was there anyone looking for employment should apply to here
good,"Good place to work but you must love the transportation, logistics industry. Must really care about customer service and be flexible and tolerant of cchange."
good,"Very physically demanding,great excercise from the packages varying in different weights and lengths. Teamwork is usually very helpful and necessary most times"
good,"Eat, sleep, work.  Long hours. 10-12 hour night shifts.  Good pay and benefits.  Little work life balance if any.  You try and sacrifice a couple hours of sleep to try and have a life outside of work."
good,If you work hard and be there on time they are great with you. If you get seasonal and do a good job they will offer you a part time position. From there you work your way up to full time and can can move up to management etc.
good,"FedEx was a great job, only 1 bad thing is peak season. You can work 12 to 14 hours and only get your days pay for 8hrs."
good,pay Is good for the type of job you are doing. Nice work place. Good environment. Amount of hours is great. Friendly helpful employees great managers that help you succeed.
good,The position as a delivery driver includes loading packages into a vehicle and delivering them to the customers.  It is a position that can be quite demanding physically especially during the Christmas holiday season.
good,This is a good solid job for someone who needs a steady income. The work is not difficult and there is room for improvement and career progression. If you would like to have a full career here they are willing to help you with their ASPIRE program. The ASPIRE program is a leadership mentorship to help you move up in the career ladder. If that is not your interest they have other departments that you can eventually move to after applying and successfully completing the internal interview. You can also stay in the operations field if you are not interested in moving departments. I would highly recommend FedEx Custom Critical as a place to work.
good,I enjoyed FedEx but wasn't a fan of working overnight. I always felt tired and would rest until i had to be at work again. Co workers and team were great people.
good,"Worked on the dock, loading and off loading trailers. Hardest part about working here is during winter months because it is freezing on the dock. dress warm."
good,Real franchise and the lie of yours that I support you to have language with supervisors I felt comfortable.
good,"Besides having to drive to a lot and park, only to have to wait on a bus to pick you up to drive you to another building to walk through security to then have to walk all the way to you respective work station and not get paid for any of this time no matter how long it may take. Work can be fast paced, but that's just the average morning."
good,"You must be fast.  I was slow when I started and they did not have a problem telling me.  It takes time, but once you get good, your individual production score will go up.  Production is the most important part of the business.  Obviously safety above all; take your time, but hurry up."
good,I worked at FedEx for approximately 4 months. I was employed initially as a truck driver but eventually became a courier driver mainly due to high demand at the time. I enjoyed the role and preformed well but the distance from where I lived made it a very difficult commute to and from work plus the start wages at FedEx are very low. It's probably a role more suitable for younger people.
good,"It was a great working environment and the friendly coworkers to make your experience worth it "
good,"Great company to work for even though you will start off part time. May take a few years to become full time on the dock only downside. Once you’re foot is in though , only company I know who gives part time employees full benefits. Starting pay is around $17.51 (FedEx Freight)!..after a year will be topped out around $20.26. All about who you know and who’s your friend at this place."
good,"the drivers start in the morning and do not have to load their own truck but should organize base on delivery schedule. you leave the depot and make your deliveries and pick ups (only if you have any). you finish your route, return to the depot, park your truck, scan remaining packages in truck (the packages you did not deliver) and go home."
good,They have flexible hours and very nice benefits after probation period. Direct deposit is also a big plus and it starts after one or two pay cycles. This saves time by not having to deal with paper checks.
good,Its hard work but the overtime will take your mind of the physical work that you do. No benefit for FedEx ground. Good pay? But depend on the contract you work for?
good,Great place to advance if you are willing to relocate. Starting salary is competitive but it is really what you make of it. You must be career driven and focused to advance.
good,"This job is good to work at, even though it’s tiring and stressful. The manager is cool and will work with you and guide you on certain things that you may need help with."
good,"Was not bad on nice days they treated employees to cook outs and Free promotional items, sometimes even cash depending on the event. worked at own pace."
good,Although it can be difficult work lifting and moving boxes for at least 7 hours it is still worth the benefits and the weekly pay in the long run. A good job for college students to take.
good,"The job required an attention to detail, driving skills and people skills. It was a great way to connect with people outside of an office. Organizing your own work flow was a great way to build self time management."
good,"A typical day at work required you to multi-task while assisting the customer with the delayed shipment for customs. "
good,"always a good time.  pay and benefits could have been better.  really enjoyed the P&D staff and other employees,  being outside running deliveries was always fun"
good,It is a fast paced job with lots of alone time in a trail. Winters are cold and the summers are hot but the opportunity for more hours is always there
good,"If you push through the crucible of training and exhibit any competency, you'll only be limited by the will of your convictions. "
good,At the time I started working for FedEx I just needed a little extra income. The benefits were a plus! The job served it's purpose. I wasn't in the best area but I had a decent manager so it worked out.
good,I feel that Fedx is a fast moving and productive workplace which is not only good for the company but it also is like a workout and makes it good for the employee as well.Another good thing is the chance for advancement.
good,"I liked the job but could no longer peruse this career because of health issues , good management and good work environment , not so great hours, but they make up for that with a 35 hr guarantee"
good,"A normal day as a handler varies, depending on a number of variables. Moving boxes from containers to its respective belt, is the focus of the day-to-day handler position. As a handler, you may move boxes or bags up to 100 lbs.  Some containers are filled with heavy boxes, and others may not have anything over 30 lbs.  The management were kind and understanding. Although, I do not think it was their fault, the managers seemed not to be as organized as one would expect them to be. Luckily, after 90 days in your position, you can bid on a different position. There are a lot of job opportunities while working there. The hardest part about working as a handler for me, was the non-stop work for however many hours I worked for that day. It would never be over 6 hours, but being a handler for six hours can take its toll on the body. I did enjoy the people that I worked with though. Every manger I had, was very professional and inspiring."
good,"The security at this company is top notched. It is the biggest company that I have worked for. Everyday is a new and exciting experience. I have had the pleasure of meeting and interacting with many helpful and caring Managers, Directors, Vice President's, working professionals and Vendors. The facility is the best that I have ever worked for. Only negative is everything is compartmentalized and sometimes getting needed access can be slow.. Other than that it is a joy working here."
good,Company is a good place to work for.  Provide  nice work/life balance.  There is no traffic jam to work.  Chairman Fred Smith is a great leader and visionary.
good,"Its a good company when your fresh out of high school or in college , I loved the job . Depends on management many come across sexist , no woman management in office or smart post ."
good,"The environment is productive and fun with kind co-workers who don't mind helping when asked a question, good training on how to preform the work duties assigned to employers, the hardest part of the job is at he end of the day you have to stop and go home when you like what you do and the people you work with some days you just want stay"
good,A typical night in Fedex is working hard. I learned different activities inside the company like work giving support to Fedex. In the culture they are very demanding to do the job.  the hardest part is ensuring successful delivery and transfer of goods to its intended destination on time when the plane is late.
good,"Almost everyone you talk to at FedEx considers the job a step on their way somewhere else, they use it to supplement their other income, or only work seasonally."
good,"I was a Seasonal hire, I never had any problems with management or co-workers. The work environment was friendly and light. A typical morning is fast paced (as with any logistics company), you load up as fast as you can so, you could get the route started. To someone unfamiliar with the city of Chicago and having 300+ packages a day, it’s a bit overwhelming at first. But, I have been witness to some unfair behavior from management to company employees."
good,"The company pays good , but how the system is set up in unprofessional. If u want to work full time their is a gap in between your next shift . About 1- 1 /2 hours give or take ."
good,You would clock in. Have a small team meeting on the requirements that were needed for that day and then you  start working by scanning boxes and loading them into the truck as fast as you can.
good,I was only there for a short period of time due to car problems. I was a loader and it was another pretty easy job. Packages would come down a conveyor line and i would have to load them properly according to size and shape. I was then moved to the unloading section which was just the opposite.l
good,"I love FedEx, it's a place to get you motivated to move up in life. It can be strenuous at times but I believe if you can make it there, you can make it anywhere. Oops managers are the best there."
good,A a part-time job this is a great place to work but it is quite physically demanding. With my experience playing football this wasn't anything new to me however doing this work for a lifetime doesn't seem worth it.
good,"I actually enjoyed working at FedEx. Your work day goes by quickly. Management is friendly. And they are willing to work with you if you had any issues. They would provide breakfast for us sometimes. In the summer, they would give us free Gatorade. The pay is good but not enough hours. You would def need another job while working here. My other issue is I have a very bad back and can't load trucks or do any physical work anymore. I kept having to call out of work because work was hurting my back. Other than that, I enjoyed FedEx. Unfortunately, I had to quit due to my back problems."
good,"Good Place to work to gain experience to continue to other opportunities. Great benefits, great work atmosphere, money is well worth the short shift. paid weekly."
good,"Data entry in a warehouse setting to record shipments that come to the facility lost. Accurately putting in information and categorizing items in packages to the computer (Navi) database. Capture barcode images, upload photos to the database or forward to the assigned departments for further handling or research.  On occasion, I assisted in the fraud department in imaging fraud checks.  Identify sensitive matter pertaining to security documents per HIPPA laws.  Completion of Fedex courses such as Workplace Violence, Safety Procedures, Overgoods Training"
good,"Its important to note that this job does require a lot of energy and you will feel tired after working. We average 15-17,000 packages per day and hours are usually 3AM-7/8AM. Management does their best to accommodate hard workers and reward them. All benefits are available to part time employees (also tuition reimbursement!)."
good,"I love my job unfortunately it’s less than 20 hours a week after deductions ( ins, Benifits etc)  is not sufficient to live on. Unload rate 1040 pkg per hour."
good,They would literally hire way too many people. Even though people quit often but then the people who did stay were not getting hours and then after peak season was over the pay decreased and it just wasn't worth it anymore.
good,Productive job for anyone that likes to work hard and don't mind working in any type of weather. Have to be concious of your time when out on the road.
good,Worked here 22 years...micro managed...great coworkers...VERY politically correct....decent pay....reviews every year with pay raises based on review....good travel benefits.
good,"I worked a 4/10 shift which means I worked Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday with a 10-hour shift.  Occasionally, I would be asked to work on my day off.  The work required the drivers to optimize their routes to ensure that packages were delivered on time."
good,"Must brave hot/cold weather depending on facility. Must be able to breathe dust in all day as well. Unless you wear a syrgical mask all day. Decent people, decent job advancement."
good,"Fedex is a ok company to work for depending on your living situation. I strongly recommend anyone in college students who are  still living at home or on campus to purse a job here. They are great with working with your school schedule and also they have tuition reimbursement as well. The insurance is great and not to mention you get a huge discount on plane tickets, hotels etc as well. But the down side is the hours are very inconsistent holiday season is where you can get a lot of hours but the in the summertime you will barely get 35 hrs per week."
good,Work was easy. A bunch of roles to play there so you could fit in somewhere and love it. 12 am - 4 am wasn’t my cup of tea and in the winter it’s freezing in the warehouse. (Fedex Indianapolis airport)
good,It was a great work place over the 18 years I've worked there. Only thing was the recent  store manager I had was rude and very unfair  when it came to me . Other than that I loved working there!
good,A lot of stress involved in day to day operations any mishaps is detrimental to your position and career you’re only as good as your last mistake they are free to reprimand
good,The job is very is I can say that but its just the stairs and that you have to wait and run to catch the bus to and from the work area. They even try to put you in a different area when you done in your area
good,"This job is not for the average joe you have to get up during the night and work from 5am to 8am yea I thought the same 3 hours not that bad, until I started working there. You are constantly lifting 50-100 pound packages and tring to stack them nicely and after 50 packages that way over 60 pounds you won’t be able to lift another one but you have to find the strength to do it. So basically your going to a gym and getting paid for it"
good,A fast pace loading and unloading job. you must learn how to keep a fast paced and utilize all space in a semi trailer when loading and must follow all safety methods when loading and unloading. management is relatively good at there job in comparison to other management from previous jobs.
good,Overall not the worst place to work. Fast paced and it's definitely a workout. Only problem is that if you're a good worker they expect you to pick up everyone else's slack
good,"My day would start with me routing and loading my truck in a organized order based on what stops I would begin with, while factoring in my appointment stops and businesses that may have time restrictions."
good,"I love working here. It's a very busy place, but they make the work worth it. Good pay, and really good benefits. I just wish there were more opportunities to advance."
good,"Constant lifting, pushing, and pulling. Unload boxes onto conveyor belts. Work as fast but as safe as possible. Unload more than one truck in your shift."
good,Loading trucks and organizing. Scan every box and make place them carefully inside the truck. Ask for help when needed and finish your daily tasks. Strech and stay hydrated
good,It is very important to have a partner who work well with you. Have fun be safe but if you lose don't be so hard on yourself start a new game and win.
good,"I love it at FedEx, super easy job. But, supervisors are pretty much push overs for drivers they are afraid of, and they push extra work on the bottom drivers. There is no real support when accused of anything happening in the outside world. & safety personnel doesn't seem to work for drivers, yet against them. Depot manager is great. Great and positive attitude, but his supervisors can not be trusted."
good,Would really consider working with Fedex again. Would plan to retire with them. Great benefits and work environment. Equipment was up to date and hours were good.
good,"quick paced"
good,I love my job at Fedex. There are a lot of opportunities to grow. The work is very easy to understand. You get trained on any job you apply for before you start the position.
good,"Load and unload packages quickly and efficiently."
good,"Sweaty gonna have to put in some serious effort to move up and out of the trailers."
good,"I was hired as FedEx bought Kinko's. I learned all store operations, and am an expert with print and digital design, though untrained. As FedEx was phased in, I took over all technology assets for 18 busy branches in downtown Boston and Cambridge. All of these branches had unique management styles. The entire network system was modernized and all equipment changed vendors, and I managed it all. I received a Beacon Award for the example I showed to other team members, and honorable mention for the Purple Promise, the highest award in the corporation."
good,"Fed Ex is a good place to work if you are looking for high paced, fun, and above average wages.  Management lacks in some areas, but overall are a good team when working together."
good,making sure you daily plan is ran to perfection. Run all reports to forcast the daily inbound to plan for the day. Make sure you run your plan or thing and go sideways
good,"FedEx provides strong support for employees, especially in their primary locations.  If you are unwilling to live in Memphis, Pittsburgh or Dallas, your options are severely limited."
good,I loved working at FedEx! I had personal things happening beyond my control after I was hired and slowly my work ethic was not as it should have been.
good,This job usually starts everyone off as part-time worker but you receive  benefits and vacation paid time off. This is a fast pace environment.  This job was great.
good,"Worked here part time for years. Flexible hours and great co workers. Friendly environment as well as much room to advance. Only hang up is, it’s hard to get hired without knowing someone on the inside."
good,"It is a good place to work. Great benefits, with outstanding people. The environment is real relaxed and family orientated. No micromangement or whip cracking."
good,"Fast paced work environment"
good,"People Service Profit is the mission and all activities within the corporation tend to follow that model. A focus on leadership over management is preferred. The salaries are competitive for the market (Memphis, TN) but perceived as low across the industry. This is a very, relational company. Who you know and who knows you is important. The people are great. Most have very long tenures."
good,"Great Company to work for, at this time I am looking for more money and career advancements.The Company just took over for DHL back in May 2017.  People are wonderful but I am ready to do something different yet the same,"
good,"Many opportunities to get extra hours. Need to be focused  and detail oriented. Very physical job. The people who work there are very dedicated. End work times are not set as you constantly deal with weather, sick calls and mechanical issues."
good,Fed Ex is very fast paced environment its non climate  controlled. You have to where steel toed boots and no cell phones are permitted inside the warehouse.Its part-time only or you have to work a split shift to be full time. The work can be very extreme.
good,"It's a good place to work. Full benefits for both part time and full time. When you become an employee here, I noticed how introverted a person is, or how angry of a person someone seems to be, they all become someone you can depend on to help you out when you need it. Not once have I ever seen anybody be denied help without a good reason not to. FedEx Freight also isn't just all about their numbers. They take pride in their quality of work so their goal isn't to deliver the highest volume of freight, but instead the highest quality of freight. It shows in their strict loading procedures to ensure safe transportation of freight to minimize damages. And where else are you going to work driving a forklift around a dock for $24 an hour?"
good,"It was a great job with limited hours "
good,"Load of work to do there's no much  time get socialise with your office mate."
good,"Working in a fast-pace environment makes your work-shift go by quickly.Most of the people I had the pleasure of working with,were AWESOME...FEDEX encourage innovation to improve delivery to aircraft and WE(my team)DELIVERED!!!"
good,"Express is great, you are an appreciated asset, only part time."
good,Fedex is a great place to work if you like do things by yourself and not much communication with others. I would work there again to become a driver because they are more appreciated and wanted.
good,"I regular work day was nice and relaxing . not to stressful and I loved what I did. I learned more in detail about troubleshooting devices .for about 3 weeks we didn't have work so they were finding little projects for us to do but it was well worth my time . the enviorment was nice and calming . everybody was so nice and loving . their was no drama , very clean areas  , and it made you wanna come in for work. the hardest part for me was that I was their threw a temp service and I could loose my job at any time . the most enjoyable was the pay . im only 18 and this helped me and my son a lot ."
good,The CEO has a lot of values that are positive. There is a lot of pressure on the employees to meet the terminals standard. The training courses are dry and boring. Hard to truly grasp any information out of them. Work days go by fast.
good,"They pay more because you work less hours than normally. You unload the planes and load the material into containers and once that is finished you leave. This can be anywhere from 2 hours to 4, possibly more."
good,I would go back once the weather changes I was having a hard time with the heat I continued having asthma attacks because of the dust and fuels. So I had to resign because I was at risk to the company
good,"I enjoy my work environment, and my coworkers/managers. I just wish I had medical benefits, vacation/sick days, and paid vacation. National holidays are given off, but not paid."
good,"FedEx has good job security, since there is a high turnover rate due to people quitting so much. As long as you don't quit or steal and you do your job you get to keep your job."
good,"gotta be there on time and ready to work and stay on task for 4 hours, thats not counting ur breaks. Over all, FedEx is a good place to work for ,again , a young adult who needs money fast and steady for summer or before college in the fall."
good,"This job was a necessity at the time, and turned into a positive experience. It requires physical labor for the first few hours, then a slower paced task of researching addresses for drivers for the last few. Not really room for advancement but positive nevertheless."
good,get there and make sure you have all of your cans or you'll be searching for most of the night. make sure everything is correct before pulling any UED's. if not most of anything that goes wrong is your fault as a driver. Do not drop any UED cans or you will get a letter. Make sure equipment if not broken or you will be held responsible if anything wrong happens. its very fast paste and stressful but if your good at it then maybe it would not be so bad for you.
good,Fed Ex Freight is a good place to work that provided adequate pay and very good benefits.  Truck driving is a very stressful job and it takes a toll on you.
good,FedEx is a good company to work for overall. It is a stable and competitive company. The culture can be a little challenging in specific areas. There are opportunities for growth if you are willing to put in the work!
good,Benefits for the workplace are the main factor. The workplace itself is casual and just about the same everyday but if you like having a set schedule and a basic idea of what to expect everyday it'd be perfect for you.
good,"You are your own boss most of day, as long as you get your work done everyone is happy. Must be organized and good with directions.  Time management is a must."
good,"Fedex Ground is a great job for those who love to be active. You will work muscles in your body that you didn't know existed. HOWEVER, if this is something you can tolerate, the benefits are fantastic and the ability to pick up extra hours when needed is outstanding."
good,collecting files came from other country. inputting airwaybills by batch date. retrieving airwaybills. co worker are good and i learn a lot that time.
good,"Great pay for part timers, flexible hours, 401k, twice a year bonuses, annual raises, health insurance. Anonymous surveys for employee's to complete on management is probably the greatest thing about the company."
good,Was an honest workplace fast  pace and friendly staff we had no air conditioning but it was alright . Pay was good everything else was very well kept.
good,It was very fun working along with the team that I had at the location. Most of the employees were team oriented and alway willing to help finish and meet deadlines. Working in a team setting was my favorite part of the job.
good,"This place is fast paced however once you get down the routine is pretty easy but it can be very exhausting.  The major downside is low hours, sometimes only working 15-20 hours."
good,"The work was hard, I had to life a lot of heavy things in a fast-paced environment. My co-workers were helpful and nice to work with. The hours were part time only and the pay was decent."
good,"A good company overall, they care about the employees. Pay doesn't match the demand of the job.            jjj                     j                    jj"
good,"working for fedex was one of my better time in operations. was able to transfer if needed and they were always looking to promote from "
good,I really enjoyed my time at FedEx Freight. Through several mergers the company is still growing. It has a great plan in place to adapt to this growth.
good,"Busy, stressful and a lot of walking. Poor management, and no room for advancement, no annual raises, hard job and not compensated for the the duties you have to perform everyday."
good,"Not bad at all, but sometimes it could it could be better. Some of the managers are lazy and it could be a little overwhelming but it's not terrible. The pay is good and some of the workers are cool."
good,"The company prides itself on providing a work-life balance.  Many professional employees maintain a nine-to-five schedule with few deviations.  However, the nature of the business is changing at a quickening pace which provides opportunities for innovative solutions."
good,"I overall like working for Fedex just wish that things weren’t so fast but it also makes the time go by faster, overall can’t complain. The dock work is easy to do on a forklift, supervisors are good."
good,"The manager of each department helps out on the floor when there is more volume than the employees can handle at any given time. The midnight shift only runs for about 2 hours and is scheduled for 4 so if you live more than 20 minutes away it is not worth only going in for 2 hours. I would strongly suggest for anyone who wants the most amount of hours in a week to do 2 shifts per day. There are 3 shifts, and they only work Monday thru Friday."
good,Staff was very nice and resourceful. They were always willing to help in a fast paced environment. There was always an opportunity to grow and travel.
good,The job was ok for what i needed while i was in school. i worked overnight and it was a little stressful but it was good money for the time being.Would be a goodjob forsomeonegoing to school.
good,I enjoyed working there it was a cool job didn't have any problems or issues beside getting pregnant.That why i no longer work there the work was to hard
good,"if you thrive in a constantly changing environment, with fast pace and micromanagement, the FedEx is for you. Due to the large corporate status your every move is under criticism so if you just do what your told and follow the book on everything youll be fine. the work is physically strenuous and sometimes quite stressful as time management is crucially important. the benefits and pay are competitive."
good,In assisting recruiters with reference verification and applicant packets for new hires.  Workplace culture was friendly and helpful. Most enjoyable was new friends that one made.
good,Offload about 5 planes and load 2 planes a day.  Hardest part is the being in the weather. I have been trained to operate around 5 different aircrafts.
good,Learned new programs and how to talk to customers with out meeting them and sell them freight rates.  Flexible and if you were there long enough and hit quota every month you were able to work from a home based office.
good,Need to be fast and physically fit for you to like this job. And you should love to drive.Holiday season is so busy so expext to be home late and be very very tired
good,"Good work place, stable hours and very strict on work place security."
good,"Otima empresa de trabalhar, alimentação na empresa, otimos gerentes, empresa com muitas operação por todo estado e no Brasil e mundial, tem uma solução para qualquer tipo de empresa."
good,"a typical day at work is heavy lifting at a very fast pace. I learned how to multi-task at a fast pace. I learned how to stack boxes in a manner in which the driver can access packages in order. The hardest part of the job is being rushed because the manager thinks youre  moving too slow, then I have to remember my count. The enjoyable part is the praise from managers that make you feel like they appreciate your work. I leave there tired but I feel accomplished."
good,This is a very fast paced and very time demanding job.  It is a cool place to work in that you are consistently on the move and it makes the day go by fast.
good,"Nesta empresa foi onde conheci pela primeira vez a área de logística, pois entrei sem nenhuma experiencia e adquiri muitos conhecimentos sobre logística e como funciona cada departamento da cadeia de logística."
good,The average day will consist with arriving at 7:00 am and loading ruffly around 150 - 200 packages into a van or box truck. After that leaving the terminal and delivering the packages. depending on home delivery or ground after finishing delivering most of the packages we'd have to get pickups if I was ground or finish the rest and then drop the truck off and go home whenever we finished delivering the packages.
good,Good place to work for. But need growth hence need to move. It’s a great courier company. Fun and amazing place to work. Good work timings too. Great place
good,I loved the fast paced work and being able to deal the public everyday. I loved meeting new people and being able to brighten someones day with a smile
good,"its a easy ,fast pace job, and anybody can move up kind of fast if you put your mind to it. I love the environment its  just a little dangerous. its very nice to make a career"
good,Working for FedEx is slavery because of the high volume in packages and the low effort in team work with the employees.  As long as planes depart on time management dont care about the well being of their workers.
good,FedEx is a good place to work at but in the long run it will cause issues to your body so I really don't recommend for females to do a lot of heavy lifting.
good,You have to find something to keep your drive or else the work part if the job will stress you. Always stay focus on your task. Also pace yourself or else you will wear yourself out.
good,"This is a good place to work...as long as you are a dock worker or a truck driver. While FedEx will help and pay for your training in these areas, they want you to stay there, at least it feels that way at the Fremont facility. If one wants to climb the corporate ladder you either need to be A) extremely qualified (so qualified it is a no contest to hire you) or B) be a part of the upper management's inner circle. The pay is great for the area with benefits to match, however if you are an ambitious person you are at a disadvantage if you do not either learn every little bit you can for different positions or butter up the managers of the facility. Tip: Do NOT get roped into a office support position, it is a dead end spot."
good,Manager at the store was great understanding. Great coworker team work is key in the store for everything to go smoothly. On busy days did have time to sit lost track of time.
good,"worked as a package handler, it was a pretty simple job as i was a casual worker. The permanent part time workers were picked on a little bit more by the managers,"
good,I wish this company was like it used to be it used to be like family they need to know money is not everything. All employees contractors drivers everybody should know everybody's job more training should be done and more communication
good,The people and managers are not the best and there is a high turn-over rate. The facility is not to good for your health or safety. Very cold winters and extreme hot summers.The benefits and the pay are really the only good things about the job.
good,"At times fast paced"
good,Your job enjoyment is very dependent on your location and your managers. If you are in a good area you like and know well and have competent managers it is an enjoyable position. Yearly pay raises as well as a 401k and pension are very nice for longevity.
good,"Great place to work, hardest part about the job is working on an open dock. Have the chance to move up and learn new things. Many opportunities. Management isn't the greatest."
good,"What I've learned when I was working at Fed Ex is, it gave me the ability to achieve the optimal level of performance for the company's achievement in percentage of their reputation. Also having leadership skills working in a diversity environment with other employees. As a package/scanner employee, it was not a hard job at all, I enjoyed working their as an employee with other's as a team."
good,Mostly it is a good place to work.  Very fast paced.  Constant lifting. Promotions are encouraged. Everyone there is on a first name basis. Co-workers are friendly.
good,"Review Summary of FedEx"
good,"Because of my disability, the work team especially the lead sometimes the manager made fun of me."
good,"Working at FEDEX is definitely a high paced,heavy,stressful job. You are faced with a challenge everyday, but even with challenges, the job can be beneficial when applied to real life situations. Overall, it’s a challenge, but beneficial in the long run."
good,Hours are scarce but if you really look for em you might squeeze in an extra 5-6 a week promotion is easy as they are always looking for people in different roles overall not a bad place to work.
good,It is a good company to work for. i was only seasonal however i did enjoy working for this company. i would return if i needed to and worked within my schedule. it could have very long days and few short days. i would recommend this company to anyone who enjoy this type of work.
good,Working here has taught me valuable life lessons. The staff are efficient and push their employees to always do better. I learned to set high goals and never waver.
good,empresa que sempre coloca o funcionário em primeiro lugar.
good,Es una institución con buenas formas de trabajo e ideologías muy funcionales no solo para el trabajo si no para la vida diaria.
good,"This job is not for the faint-hearted. You have to be willing to stand, walk, and go up and down steps 4-5 hours straight without a break. You may use the bathroom or get a drink of water but you must be willing to work hard, lift heavy packages and meet the demands of the drivers."
good,I use to work my hours and go home. The benefits was the reason that I need this job and the tuition reimbursement for school.  I stay for those two reason. Now I am strive for something better like management trainee or a manager position.
good,"Great pay /Management needs some polishing up / workers young but are willing to listen to the vets.  work at a steady pace, supervision wont ride you"
good,"loading trucks at a fast paced rate,ensuring accurate stacking and proper location. some very heavy to light boxes,made for interesting job skills. ok"
good,"Fast paste, and always had a deadline.I was training to drive truck before I left. Had to be forklift certified and also need to know how to tie up freight."
good,"work early in the morning. scan and drop boxes in the truck, also organize the truck. move fast work hard. get things done so the drivers are happy with the work you did."
good,"working your way onto a route or up in seniority can take a while."
good,"This was an amazing job experience. The ability to help customers, make people happy, and to do it all in a safety focused company. My coworkers and managers were great but there was no room for advancement in the area because those in full time positions loved it so much they never seemed to retire."
good,Good Job but which they had more spots for full-time and if they had better shift time the job seem to apply more to drivers and supervisors . But other than that it a good job to work for to build a career
good,"Typical day consisted of reviewing pick up manifest & planning out my route, making it to each stop on time & providing the best customer service as possible. I learned how to read a map.. Management was great.. Culture of the workplace upbeat & friendly..The hardest part of the job was sometimes being overwhelmed with too many pick ups allotted for a certain period of time... the most enjoyable part of the job was the comradery of the other couriers"
good,"a typical day was fast pasted and i learned alot and my management was fair. My workplace was always busy and the hardest part of my job was getting use to the route i was on. Once i got use to the route it was pretty cool , the people were nice and very friendly"
good,"Demanding work with good pay and very good benefits package. "
good,go in the morning load your truck and then you go out and deliver your packages the hardest part of the job was delivering in bad weather like snow but when its nice out easy job to do
good,Delivering packages to correct address and on time: Good driving record needed and ability to work long hours in all types of weather: Ability to read a map and not get lost:
good,FedEx was a very good company to work for.. You got your packages loaded behind your truck everyday. Then you would scan and load your truck the way you wanted to go. You would then proceed to deliver the packages to the customer's house. The good thing was if it took you 4 hours or 8 hours it did not matter.
good,As long as you are a hard worker you will be fine. The job is pretty simple and you get the hang of it pretty quick. Thousands of boxes a day is rough but over all a pretty sweet place to work.
good,"Enjoy my time at Federal Express Ground. Very fast pace environment, some times long hours around Christmas, but great people, good health, dental, and vacation."
good,Solid culture with many great leaders. There are varying roles but generally a flat organization with no upward mobility. Day to day work is repetitive depending on the position.
good,"As a courier I would start my day getting tracker/scanner paperwork, and route schedule go to my route truck, make sure for supplies and extra document buckets. Then look to the package conveyor for route packages and sort them by route and service( priority, standard,2-day). After that out the doors to deliver and pick up packages all day."
good,The best part about working at Fedex was the relationships built with the people and the drivers. The actual work could be stressful and busy.  There is not a real opportunity for advancement.  Once you are in your position you are planted for life.
good,"Early start (3:30am)"
good,"Work as a team to move packages throughout the company and on to the customers using safe, efficient, and necessary workplace practices."
good,"Overall, coworkers were very good and the company culture is respectable. The work was very redundant and somewhat stressful. This sector of the company would benefit from much automation."
good,If you are interested in the field then there is no limit to your development potential. FedEx fosters a culture of continuous development and they provide the support via mentoring and education.
good,Enjoy working with a great crew on a daily bases to achieve company goals. I helped to meet tough deadlines in a timely manner. Management was good in providing guidance .
good,"FedEx is a great place for employment. One of the few that still offer a retirement package. it is not as good as the package from 20 years  ago,but I don't think you could find a better company."
good,i loved working at fedex. I liked the people i worked with and for. it was a fast paced job that kept you busy. and you always knew what you was going to get at the beginning of every shift.
good,time flys learns something new every day If you like being left alone to works this is the place for you. Just get over the weather. You can make it for
good,"It was a ok place to work just need more money.It was very clean and a nice workout. They were kind and respectful of everybody, just need the pay to be more. They only work a couple of hours too."
good,"Empresa boa para si trabalhar, benefícios ótimos"
good,"This was a great cultural organization and work load was feasible, only complaint would be compensation. They could pay more and have larger bonuses. Overall ok"
good,Good people to work with on a daily bases. I enjoyed my time here.Very good for a part time job. Stand on your feet all and activity is going on from start to finish.
good,It was money. That is all i can say. The benefits is why most people work for this company. They have very good benefits. Also 401k plan they will match.
good,"Boa para trabalhar, dificuldade no reconhecimento do técnico em segurança do trabalho."
good,This was a very fast paced working environment. Everything was done according to a schedule it was production focused and customer satisfaction orientated.
good,Scanning and sorting packages and wrapping for delivery. Team work and positve attitude helps to get the job done. The management is great with working with you if you have a family or need to have emergency days. If you are willing to work they are willing to let you!!
good,was a great place to work for the year that I did. I was grave yard shift but was a great way for me to learn leadership roles. great raises .50 cents!
good,"FedEx is a decent place to work.  Depending upon the position, each day can be a new learning experience.  I do feel, however, that management needs to consider the opinions of those who do the work when they make decisions that affect the organization, that some of the processes and procedures need to be streamlined, and that the communication needs to be improved between the departments."
good,"I was a seasonal Truck Loader, who worked very hard.  I would fill 3 or more trucks organized correctly and would always be asked to help out other seasonal employees.  Was an overnight shift so I didnt mind the hours too much 3-8am."
good,It was  job and  very fast paced -I learned I was not in as good of shape as I thought I was--Management was great!! workplace culture was positive--hardest part of the job was the bigger packages and tires but the most enjoyable part of the hard part was the help and comoradery that was shared by all there
good,Very professional they treat there employees well and give opertunities to learn more and progress. The pay is decent and they offer you a range of Benefits.
good,I came in early and started on the sort then went to my assigned truck roar the day.I would deliver and pick up packages throughout the day and when done back to stating tounload trucks.
good,communication between management and employees is inconsistent.Employees are not treated fairly. There is a lot favoritism when it comes to advancement.
good,Good starting Times.Get informed on the day activities and go and start loading TRK. I learned how to interact with people. either helping them answering questions or providing info on delivering options.
good,hard working. really great for students. great benefits. management is some what ok. everyone is different. but overall fedex is a great company to work for
good,It was a very fast pace and busy environment especially around holidays and weekends. My fellow co-workers were all willing to help each other out especially if the workload was a little too much that day or shift.
good,Fast pace job and  always  on the move. You're on the road a lot and by yourself. The people you work with are great and fun. They have great benefits.
good,working at fed ex is fast paced. the job would be perfect if you don't mind manual labor the only issue is that its only part time.THe managers are kind and understanding. i originated at the fed ex in Virginia and the company was good enough to transfer me to colorado.
good,"Good place to work. The various positions I held were always"
good,"A challenging experience, offloading and reloading airplanes. It involves, physical strength, as well as proper use of equipment such as cargo loaders, belt loaders, and towing vehicles. The size of the plane varies, from propellered feeders to working on a Boeing 777. The hardest part of the job can vary also. On some days, the weather can make the work more challenging. I have been able to utilize my experience to work in a team environment, which is very enjoyable."
good,"I highly recommend this part time job as quick income shot in the arm for college students."
good,Great job.  Great benefits.  The pay is not high enough.  The pay is too low for all that we do there.  If they paid more then you could make a decent living.
good,"Enjoy working there,  nothing bad to speak of."
good,"Our day usually busy day ."
good,This job requires you to be able 30 lb work was very hard but it was also fun being able to work with all different types of people job hours was early morning was required to work over when needed during the holiday season pay was great and benefits was great also.
good,Worked part time at Fed Ex Loading pup trucks from top to bottom five days a week and I also was a yard jockey it was a great working experience at Fed Ex
good,"You definitely get more done before 10:30am than most people do all day!!! By far the best training, benefits, and the people you meet along the way is a added bonus to working for this company. After years of working your body will feel it, but it's also like working out at a gym for free. Very challenging and responsible place to work."
good,long hours no benefits. pay is good. some heavy lifting.Check as many packages before leaving to start route package may not belong on the truck. Management changes alot and polices changes have to attend meets to stay in compliance.
good,"A typical work day for me is very simple. You get in and get a good stretch before you bein your lift. I load two trucks. its typically a 250 to 300 package per truck. Which comes down a conver. belt at a steady pace. It can get over whelming at times, when you have 50 package come down right after the other. but it a 3am to 7am job."
good,You can move fast up in the company depending on your work ethic. It is fast pace but it has great employers. You can be yourself and chat with people at the job. If you needed a job and it is hard for you to find one.They are always hiring and even have great benefits.
good,I loved working for Fedex and would transfer but there are no positions available. The management was excellent though at times I felt that my concerns were not being heard
good,"In the end the most gratifying part of working at fed ex was being able to interact with so many different people. There was never a dull moment , made many professional friendships ."
good,The work isn't hard hard at all and everything is repetitive but the pay is great and worth it and the energy from other employees is sometimes great  and it can be your motivation on slow nights
good,"The job is easy enough to learn, but you don't find out the hours until the day before in an e-mail. If you like a social work setting, this isn;t a good job. Until break comes around, you don;t have time to talk to coworkers. You need to focus on your work."
good,"Great benefits"
good,A typical day would include me visiting my normal customers as well as opening new accounts. I would also work with couriers in efforts to make sure our current customers base was happy as well as generate future leads.
good,"Working as a package handler, obviously it was labor intensive but fun and good benefits."
good,"I have spent three years at FedEx. It was Genco when I start, but later, FedEx bought. It was a great experience beside some of the managerial weakness."
good,It's an ok job . The area I work in is not al all hard to me. It varies by the day. Holidays are mostly when there is a whole lot of work to. It's not as hard as people say it is.
good,This job was Awesome! The management was great as well as the team work and incentives given! They are very driven to making sure that the customers are always satisfied!
good,"Decent place to work, ability for advancement. A lot to learn, although training is not always available have to learn on the job.  Physical job, keeps you in shape."
good,"Days at work varies. Somedays, we have more packages to ship and somedays less. the hard part is when we have to get things done quick for shipment and not enough employee showed up. The good things is that the environment is very diverse."
good,My boss was wonderful and I really enjoyed working there. Flexible  work hours and the fact that the boss cares enough to check on you daily.  I would really suggest this company to anyone.
good,"Great company to work for..but  when your capped, it's hard to get a head with the benefits that went up & everyday living.  Management is great..listen to your needs."
good,"Great work Place, Fast pace.   I have been working there for 18 years.   Its been a great sold place to work. Fed EX is a fortune 500 company and i am a proud member of their work force."
good,Good place to work. Coworkers all get alone and management can play favorites a lot but other then that this is one of the best company's I have worked for.
good,"FedEx was a good place to work.I enjoyed the people and the work culture, though towards the end there wasn't encouragement for doing a good job.  Good benefits but the hours were getting less and less."
good,Although this was a part time position it was draining. But it paid the bills! The hours they expected can easily take a toll on you. Challenging!!!!!
good,"fast paced, alot of bending, walking, and commucating. Think of it as a excercise, because your most likely to sweat also stay hydrated. Alot of hardwork."
good,"This is a good company to work for, but advancement can be limited. Some people have worked there for 15 years and have not been able to be a supervisor. This company is just not for me."
good,"FedEx was a good company to work with, especially if you have a second job or schooling. Great pay and many different shifts that work well for your schedule. Also kept me busy so hours went by quickly."
good,Love working here atmosphere is great and most of the people are great. Small center not much room for advancement. Management could use some work also
good,Nice place to work for. The environment is good but sometimes stressful. Holidays off with pay. Benefits are good. Have to work some Saturdays. Vacation pay.
good,If you enjoy driving this is the perfect job.  Once you learn your route it's a piece of cake.  There is a lot of lifting but no more then 150lbs.  I didn't like working doing bad whether but was easy when it was good whether.
good,"Packing and shipping daily. I ran daily reports for manager. "
good,I enjoy working at FedEx. Very good benefits and work environment. Very demanding but fair work. A great workout and a place to move up in management if you felt the need to.
good,Getting the planes unloaded and loaded within a certain time frame and making sure that our customers  get there packages on time every day using handheld trackers and scanners to make sure shipments get to and from the right destination
good,Long hours hard work be prepared. Job security is a plus. Must be alert at all times on the road. Safety is a must. Money is ok but long hours can take a toll.
good,Working at fed ex you had to be very active. Typical day consist of sorting through thousands of packages and loading trucks.I didn't like the lack of hours my shift was usually only 3-4 hours.
good,"Aprendi muitas coisas em tão pouco tempo, é um local que transmite expectativa de aprender com agilidade e esforço."
good,Great job for part time work. fast paced. tough if you don't condition and stay hydrated. management treat you well. Hours do not last long. tough on your body after a couple of months.
good,"My time at FedEx was for about 5 years and I had the opportunity to grow and work with all departments at FedEx, it is a fast paced environment that will challenge your abilities."
good,"FedEx Trade Networks Provides Great pay, Fantastic wonderful benefits, However there a lot of office politics, and you are not allowed breaks other than 30 min. lunch, very strict environment."
good,Fun place to work people are friendly. The management could be a little better but it's a company right . The jobs a little back breaking but that's what you call Manuel labor over call loved working there but it's time for a change.
good,Fun but dirty place to work. come in get fork lift. Get assigned trailer to unload and move the freight to assigned trailer. Summer was very hot and winter had to dress correct to stay warm
good,You rarely make the whole 20 hours a day but the benefits are some of the best out there. Overall its basically just lifting boxes or unloading trailers through 3 and a half hours.
good,"As a part time employee moving boxes I was offered well over minimum wage, training and certification of hazardous materials and forklifts, tuition reimbursement and good medical coverage. The offered much more than I had expected for a entry level job loading boxes into containers. Grate job to start with at a great company with good internal promotion track and good benefits."
good,Very productive and fun workplace. Learned a lot of different areas around different cities and towns. I most definitely loved management at the company.
good,fed ex is a cool laid back type of job but you will bust a couple of sweats and to me thats no problem. fed ex is filled with all kinds of people so thats gives u an opportunity to learn from all
good,"A typical day consist of loading my truck for delivery, making deliveries, greeting customers with their packages."
good,"For part time and full time, it is well worth it. Many different positions and different ways to Advance. A good place to start or make a career, and another is that all training is paid. Different options for 401k and and healthcare benefits."
good,"Review shipments that have to be unloaded then loaded onto trailers for delivery. Safety is very important and having open communication with Supervisors and co-workers is vital. The enjoyable part of my job is building trailers with freight,keeping safety number one."
good,Uma boa empresa para o desenvolvimento profissional na área de logística.
good,Good benefits package and room for advancement in the company a lot of strict rules and time for work attendance. Can get boring after work there for a
good,Great place to work but hard to advance.  There are no benefits. I worked there for seven years. I loved the job with communication between co workers and customers.
good,"I was responsible for pickups in Crestview, FL, deliveries/drop offs for my route in Pensacola.  I would help with other routes from time to time when co-workers were running behind with deliveries."
good,"I worked for FedEx Home Delivery, which is a contracted position under someone who owns the individual route.  The pay is great (if you deliver a lot of packages) but unfortunately there were no benefits provided by the owner of the route."
good,"My normal day is working noon to 10 pm at night which, in my opinion, are the worst hours available. I would much rather work 9-5 somewhere. So you'll work around 50 hours a week year-round. Your week is consumed by work. However, you can't beat the benefits the company has to offer. Working at FedEx also allows you to receive discounts at many different locations. It's a well-paying job for both part-time and full-time employees. The work-life balance is the only real downside."
good,"working for this large company made it hard to improve on noticeable issues, but the compensation is fair and the time will fly by due to the strenuous work load."
good,It's fast paced with a maximum of 6 hours a night. Depending on your manager you can easily move up. There is favoritism there. It's pretty prejudice. It is a descent job for those who are in school or have second jobs. The benefits are nice.
good,Buena empresa buenas prestaciones y buen ambiente de trabajo
good,Fed Ex is a good place to work for permanent part time as they offer great benefits for part time staff.  There are different departments which allow job diversity.  There are not many full time opportunities.
good,Downpile packages from spurs into pallets or load and nload packages from or to trucks. Different workplace culture and hitting exceptions is difficult.
good,"Your co-workers on the line are friendly, and willing to lend you a hand. The management staff is very courteous and outgoing. Don't hesitate to ask them a question."
good,"Making sure the trucks were unloaded and loaded as fast possible."
good,"Always working hard,A lot of lifting of boxes and loading trucks for delivery. Awesome people to work with,very helpful and willing to give you an hand whenever you need it"
good,"Trabalho dinâmico envolvendo toda a equipe frente aos objetivos e na busca constante da melhoria contínua."
good,At fedex I was trying to start my career at a good company with lots of benefits. I enjoyed working there although it was very hard work in the hub. I wanted to join the entry level management program and hopefully work my way up to corporate.
good,Fed Ex is a very interesting company to work for. They are very technologically advanced and expect professional work from their contractors. I was part of a very successful project that had high visibility from management.
good,The hardest part of the job is being able to adjust to schedule changes regarding less working hours.What i like most is that it is a early morning shift.
good,Pay is BASED on education and training is a big part of the job. It is sometimes hard to get your foot in the door but once you do you should be good. You need to be able to work with computers and have minimal typing skills.
good,"FedEx was a cool place to work, the work was up and down year round because of holiday season and not around the holiday season. FedEx gave every race an opportunity to work and fulfill their work goals."
good,"Good place to, but watch out for the contractors. some will sell you the dream, give you ratings once they don't need you anymore, they will not even tell you. they will just replace you."
good,"A typical day working at fedex is busy, but fulfilling. The pay is great with good energy, and great people. Anyone who works at fedex will have a pretty decent experience."
good,"There really isn't anything to say about the company as I did not work directly for them, I worked for a contractor that had bought routes from Fed Ex."
good,"Wonderful treatment of employees, I love the atmosphere that we worked in it was always exciting and i learned something new evertday"
good,Fedex is a great place to work just need to spend a little more time grooming management on how to be a little more professional when it comes to employee communication.
good,Fedex is a fast pace work environment. where you stack packages into semis and delivery trucks. you must scan every box before it gets loaded in the truck.
good,"Good place to work, great benefits and people just did not like the night shift wanted something on days, jobs can be hard to obtain in certain cities, good down to earth supervisors, liked all my co workers"
good,Demanding hours. The customs brokerage portion of FedEx requires memory retention. The rules and regulations are extremely important to ensure packages get delivered in a timely manner.
good,"was an okay job.  it served its purpose for the time.  Okay people, management was ok.  Haven't been there is quite a few years, so I'm not sure how things are run their anymore."
good,"Not environmentally friendly but very good work"
good,the position is perfect for someone seeking part time work. the overnight shifts are perfect if you have the availibility. compensation is fair for work load.
good,"fast learning quick shifts easy learning "
good,Scanning of ground packages for walmart freight also loading them i do any where from 500 peices to 1200 in a 4hr period. The people are fun to work with because we are all in togrther to get the job done. I enjoy staying busy the whole time that im there. There is no low.
good,"I enjoy doing warehouse work . Over the years I've dealt with picking , packing, material handler and working with an RF scan gun. Overall I think warehouse work is for me."
good,"Work consisted of arriving around 11 PM, going through security, clocking in, hoping they'd ordered new scanners due to lack of, and moving boxes ranging from 1 lb to 150 lbs into a container neatly as possible. Not the easiest job."
good,Fed was alright. Benefits was the best thing. Worked about 5 hours 6 at the most.  Co workers were cool. They all made work do-able.  Hit a stand still and couldn't move up in the company or become full time. I feel like that's more about the manager than the company.
good,"I enjoy what I do, and I appreciate the fact that I am paid weekly. I also have confidence that my job will not be going anywhere. There will always be delivery jobs because people will always be ordering things  I do not like that I cannot really grow with the company and that the company itself has long since contracted out all of the routes, so benefits are hard to come by."
good,"FedEx is a good place to work when their peak season is in. After peak season, hours are cut down but benefits stay the same. Most co-worker barely pull there weight and management is barely around."
good,Great part time work.  Especially if your going to college.  They will reimburse you for your classes. Well and can be Great or Bad it all depends your management.  What sucks is Great Management is always rotating or either getting cut or moving position.
good,"A typical day at FedEx was nothing short of typical.  Late freight, sick calls, downed equipment, bulk freight was the standard everyday.  The most important aspect was to work hand in hand with my fellow managers as a team, if another work group failed we all failed as a team. I learned early on that every employee has something to bring to the table, find their strong points and push them in that direction.  The hardest part of the job was the start of the day, ensuring all freight gets unloaded, scanned into the proper routes, and the drivers met with goals especially with premium service.  That in itself was not hard it was the problems that arose during the sort, learn to handle them efficiently and always have some backup plans and the morning goes smoother.  The most enjoyable part of my job was looking for ways to improve the process. I was responsible for over 35 quarterly audits. I kept refining my methods and educating drivers on the importance until other stations started to implement my procedures"
good,Enjoyable environment and a good company to work for with great benefits and salary. Very understanding of needing time off and/or vacation. Management is always there to help you with whatever needs attention.
good,"Not a bad job, just no benefits. Work very hard, not for the weak. Learned how to operate a big truck and how to manage my time wisely."
good,"Great manager loved my co-workers. Went in for 4 maybe 5 hrs overnight, time went very fast.  Great benefits, the hardest part of my job was parking. Needed more hours so i had to relocate."
good,"Great place to work if your hard-working. A typical day would consist of load 1,000-1,500 packages on to a delivery truck. What I learned most is the importance of team work. Having to load that high volume of packages, required most of the time everybody pitching in to successful complete to sort. The most enjoyable part about being a Package Handler at FedEx was looking back on you work and seeing how you where successful at loading your truck as well as your co-workers truck"
good,"Very open space dealing with boxes .. "
good,"This company gave me opportunity grow my skills."
good,"Recommends"
good,"very easygoing, set goals for myself everyday, help out co-workers if needed finish work in timely manner. the hardest part is working with a oversize loaded truck. I enjoy building up chemistry with teammates, so we can learn from each others strengths."
good,Good company to work for if you are getting your first job. Simple job. Its a very repetitive but its not hard at all if you can handle the physical part.
good,"great place to work, they treat you like a person and not a number . i would put fed ex as one of the best companies to work for in the world. great pay friendly people"
good,"Great company overall, provided great benefits. A typical day at work includes receiving orders and picking orders with an RF scan gun. Inventory is vital to the operations. The Sr. Managers are great and easy to work for. The hardest part of this job was the long hours and dependence on temporary employees. The most enjoyable part of this job was building relationships with customers and employees."
good,"In my opinion FedEx is a good company to work for. There are many things that do need work. The best positions belong to the drivers. They are the best compensated. My position is decent pay, but it does not nearly compensate for the amount of money that we have to invest in our tools for the job. The company offers no actual training for the jobs that are required.  You learn as you go in most cases.For the most part management is easy going and very friendly as long as the work is getting done."
good,"Hours can be difficult for dock as it takes many years to build up seniority to get first shift hours. "
good,"For the past 15 years, my assignment has been to help with streamlining processes, create and maintain metrics to track performance and quality, help my peers and support upper management. I have enjoyed these responsibilities and I have learned to adapt to various management styles and personalities. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to understand the roles and responsibilities of both and being able to help both the bottom line employees as well as upper management."
good,"Want to get paid while working out? This is the job for you, always moving, running and picking up and down boxes.  Time goes by very quickly and the people around you are fun to work with."
good,"Work a morning sort"
good,I truly enjoyed this position but I relocated. I would say that if you do not finish your minimum time then you will never be supported for advancement. For me it was 18 months in my role. It is a great place to start if you are looking for a long term career. I only wish I could have kept this job.
good,It's nothing like getting paid to workout and burn calories while you're on the clock and also learning how to work well with others like a unity or crew in such fashion.
good,"Hard working environment with room to grow"
good,"start by splitting and manifesting waybills . then scanning and filing the waybills followed by invoicing both cash and account customers for the day. Running credit checks on new clients typing petty cash."
good,"I have been working in this company for 26 years, is a good work place and has a good environment...... Awesome coworkers and safety place to work."
good,A typical day at work is fun with my team. The most enjoyable part of the job is learning new things. I work with a wonderful group of people.
good,A typical day at work consisted of delivering and picking up freight from different locations. Face to Face and over the phone customer interaction was a daily task.
good,"Plenty of cookouts and breakfast , great family day too,,, working with little supervision and being responsible for one self,,,Be creative,,"
good,"Overall, a great place to work. Easy, friendly staff and coworkers. Learned a great deal on how packages arrive and are handles to protect the customers purchases to ensure perfect delivery."
good,"The job was great. Unfortunately, the retention there is terrible and it got to the point where it was no longer worth it to stay on board because of low compensation for experience/workload."
good,great people to work around. everyone greets each other in the morning with a good morning very positive atmosphere. I get to interact with all customers and their all nice and friendly.
good,Really enjoy working here great environment. Managers and Supervisor are easy to get along with. There not watching you all he time. If you do your job you won't have any complaints from them.
good,Work at Fedex is great! keeps everyone moving. Management is also good. co-workers are always nice and willing to help. And most enjoyable is everyone gets along and makes time go faster.
good,Currently I train new Customers on how to ship with FedEx to help them avoid costly mistakes. I have learned how to handle difficult customer issues.
good,"I would sort packages, load trucks. Inspected packages. Drove a forklift. Inspected trucks and the warehouse for misplaced packages, or envelopes. The management was very helpful, easy to communicate with. The hardest part of the job was the physical part from lifting heavy packages."
good,FedEx is a great part-time job. The problem is turning that part-time job into a full-time career. The benefits at FedEx are pretty good. 401k and college tuition reimbursement. There is some disconnect between senior management and rank and file employees. Senior management and operations managers are sometimes at odds with one another.
good,"typical work day would be, clock in load my truck with frieght. Do a walk around of vehicle for the motor vehicle report. chat with my neighboring routes, to see if our packages cross into our borders and swap those with packages that are actually in our area to avoid unnecessary driving."
good,Good part time job for anyone looking for a little bit of extra money just working 15-20 hours a week. Also very good benefits after about a year or so when eligible.
good,Excellent Job with great Pay. Very hard work that. Managers really do not care about pushing you to your limits as long as you get the job done.
good,"empresa dinâmica, aprendir a sistema SAP, Gerente boa compreensiva"
good,Had a great work life balance and formed lasting relationship while employed at FedEx.  Great relationship with my coworkers and my manager gave me the opportunity to manage and lead the team. Hardest part about my job was getting people to sometimes understand the urgency of items needed on short notice by the executive team.
good,"Warehouse operations, deliveries and pick-up, also team job but mainly you can take decisions on your own and decide how to run your job daily"
good,This is a great company to work for. This is very faced paced and very time demanding. You work about 10 hour days either M-F or T-Sat
good,fun work environment great managers and open door policy works with schedule. Very hands on training its not about hitting your numbers. The warehouse when its hot its really hot and when its cold its really cold.
good,"Health and Insurance benefits were amazing. The swing shift is kind of tough to work with especially if you have more than one job, but it's a great place to work."
good,"A typical day at work was very long for me. I've learned how to clean, buffer floors, and also polish floors. My co-workers were very helpful and organized. The hardest part of the job for me was trying to clean when there were a lot of people around. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning new things because I like learning new skills to help me better myself in life."
good,I was an Independent contractor so i would go threw my truck in the a.m. Do my route delivering my packages until my truck was empty.
good,"La società per la cui lavoro, è una multinazionale, presente in 211 paesi. Lavorare nell' European HQ significa relazionarsi quotidianamente con colleghi situati in luoghi differenti. Una tipica giornata di lavoro si divide fra le necessita di adattare la reportistica e approfondire l'analisi degli scostamenti, per rispondere alle richieste del Regional President o del CFO, ed il  ruolo di  coordinazione di progetti portati avanti con virtual teams."
good,"This is a very fast paced industry and you must be willing to work hard, get dirty, and think on your feet. Its a labor job that requires a lot of heavy lifting and repetitious movement up and down stairs and walk-ways all over various routes and for long hours. It is also a fun job where you meet new people ever day, establish good relationships with customers, and work independently without a manager."
good,"Enjoyed the work and the people, however, corporate expectations were not realistic when comparing a rural route with an urban route."
good,"A typical FedEx workday was a fast-paced environment where efficiency, attention to detail, and timeliness were key. From the moment we clocked in, employees were expected to be ready to work, and work hard with their assigned team. Teams were comprised of roughly 30 employees, and would be spaced around on different parts of the job site. The number of employees working a given station changed from hour to hour as the volume of work changed, with more people coming over to help at busier spots. Packages being handled ranged in size from goods roughly the size of a softball, to long rolls of carpet about 7 feet in length; In terms of weight, these packages could weigh as little as 1 pound, or as much as 100 pounds - anything heavier than that required assistance from another employee or specialized equipment to move."
