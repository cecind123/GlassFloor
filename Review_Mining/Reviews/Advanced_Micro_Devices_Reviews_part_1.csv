rating,review
bad,"Not what was expected. Company needs help, superiors are not available, customers are second. Expectation is to lie to the customer in order to make AMD not look bad"
bad,"They use and abuse...offer no career building but yet demand 12+hr working days."
bad,"I am surprise that company is still in existence. Terrible leadership from C-level to Sr management. The most awful global culture and work environment. As a consequence, and of course, AMD has a really bad product in the market; which is why Intel has more than 80% of the global market."
bad,"In the four years I worked at AMD, the company never turned a significant profit. Hence we were never really paid a bonus. The expectation was that I would have to work at least 70 hour weeks quite frequently"
bad,Had good technological breakthroughs but lost its battle to Goliath of the semiconductor industry. Leadership made this company lose its relevance
bad,"AMD is a culture of paranoia and security, caught up in the hype of corporate security. After giving my particulars to an investigation firm in Fort Worth, Texas, for a background check, my gmail reported that someone had tried to access it from, wait for it, you guessed it, Fort Worth, Texas. As a contractor I was assigned a cubicle on my first day but no computer. After a week or so they cobbled together a workstation from an old computer and tiny monitor, which makes technical writing and diagrams very difficult. Another thing I noticed is that they retain some of the longest employee relationships in the software business. I met a number of engineers (non-management) who had been there 15 years or longer. That is highly unusual for an industry that thrives on cross-pollination of experience by both work and work culture, and the people who seem to stay have that same sort of disposition you find in career civil servants, burned out, no creativity, no passion, and a broken spirit, like house trained animals. This is the worst company I have ever worked for in 17 years experience in software and telecommunications. I would not wish it on anyone."
bad,"This is the company you go to when you want to do a bunch of nothing and take home a paycheck for all your non-work. The list of things they don't have or do wrong is too long to type out. The company is not poised to take advantage of technology, markets or talent."
bad,"The engineers working here are good, smart, and productive. The first level managers are pretty decent. However, the upper management has recently started a very dishonest process of laying people off without a severance package by blatantly misusing the ""Performance Improvement Plan"" process. I know of three good engineers who were let go due to bogus PIPs. In all three cases, there was no prior indication or warning of poor performance - it came out of the blue, after a good performance review. The PIP goals were not realistic, and even when they were met, management came up with excuses to justify termination. The blatant dishonesty used here tarnishes what used to be a decent company."
bad,"AMD is a good company who has fallen on hard times.  With little momentum, it will be a difficult climb to get back to where they were in the past.  "
bad,"In the last three years, AMD went through four or five lay-offs (losing count). While your job duties and responsibilities are constantly increasing, you will never see a bonus or pay increase... and forget about job security. Most importantly, you need to make sure you can survive in the AMD's culture.  Leadership is the term that not only is not understood but also actively replaced with brutal brick-and-mortar management. If you don't have any other job and this is your only job offer, then take it. Otherwise, for your own benefit, please stay away from this swamp at 7171 Southwest Parkway..."
bad,"Good people but poor leadership, strategy and execution. Inter-office politics and one-upmanship stunt business performance."
bad,"On my first day nobody said a (f ing)  word, no body; nothing.  This company exemplifies as one that is so big they don't give a rip about treating a new employee with dignity.   Pathetic.  YouTube ""toxic workplace"" AMD is everything on the list!  Nice.  Remember, YOU ARE WHO YOU ASSOCIATE WITH!"
bad,there is a reason the president of the company and his little lackey under him and hr all got fired along with the warehouse coordinator   and the inventory supervisor
bad,"Promised training was never provided, computer based classes were never set up. Recruiter promised perks that were never made available. Manger never provided support or instruction when needed. When I was injured on the job I was ignored for almost a month before I was contacted by the insurance company (not by AMD)."
bad,Personal a cargo es muy grosera con la gente de producción
bad,"A typical day at AMD began with my understanding that it might be my last. After the experience I learned that if a company wants to get rid of you it will find a reason to do so, even if you're a high-performer; worrying is a useless emotion. There are strong managers there, but I only met a small number of them. The good ones have probably already left. Most of my coworkers had families - much more to lose than I did - and this motivated them to work ridiculous hours, reacting to failures like wounded wild animals. What once was a thriving rainforest of growth and innovation is now a boneyard of vultures and hyenas, with the occasional bald-eagle passing through (who they laid off five people to bring in). The hardest part of the job was not quitting prematurely. The most enjoyable part of the job was reminiscing about the time before the company began its downward spiral."
bad,AMD has changed for the worse over the last 8 years. Toxic would be a good one word description.
bad,The hiring process within my team was terrible. Candidates have really no idea what position they'll get. We just went by buzz words and gut feeling when deciding to hire somebody or not. To get promoted is all about the politics rather than the work done.
bad,Challenging but a very unstable working environment. Lack of consistent leadership. The technology I was responsible for selling was could not keep up with the competition- this was the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part of of the job was my relationship with customers.
bad,"Unless you are expert in something at PhD level, and you need to work in this company, dont! There are far better venues to build a career."
bad,Upper management unable to come to terms with what is needed to be developed for improving revenue targets.  There is a constant churn through frequent layoffs and the morale is low.
bad,"AMD is a company that is struggling to recover, and it’s doing itself no favors by consistently laying off its employees. The culture has become one of desperation. Whether you’re new, or have been there for years, you never know when you department might be “consolidated” and your position eliminated."
bad,There is no career path and very rutinary tasks at least in admin field. Maybe is not related to the company itself and it has to do more with the economy of the region I was working in.
bad,Management is working hard to cut operational expenses and transform to more value creation.
bad,Lost at sea. I see at least 3 years of bad times.
bad,"This is the place for you if you like a disorganized, spontaneous culture with extremely limited resources.  Confirm carefully anything you are told at your interview as they'll tell you anything to get you in the door."
bad,"The products are very interesting to work on, a fun culture around gaming, but not very visible in the Markham office. Work/life balance is non-existent - many 11-12 hour days every week, some 12-13 hour days. Many consecutive weekends spent working from home or in office or on call. This lasts months at a time, with very little break in between. Lots of knowledgeable engineers and developers, but project management makes it hard to build products effectively. Overall, what could be a fun and rewarding workplace is made unpleasant because employees don't receive breaks or rewards for the hard work they do."
bad,"A lot of people got retrenched for the past few years, work very boring although relaxed."
bad,"Appearing near rock bottom in many ways including loss of company idenity, cultural, and motivation to succeed."
bad,Been here for 5 years. Great talent but struggling to survive
bad,"With the amount of turnover it makes for a rough place to work. AMD hires and then fires, so attracting top talent is extremely hard to do and when they can’t even fund bonuses people are jumping off the ship"
bad,Nice people. Unfortunately the technology industry is a very challenging environment to hold a secure position.
bad,"This company is not suitable for young graduates or anyone wanting to launch their career in a stable environment. I worked in FP&A and we were especially busy during month-end and quarter end. The culture was fast paced and priorities changed constantly. Management was strong, hard-working and was under a lot of pressure."
bad,"It was a good experience, but the team I worked with was terrible. They constantly had me waste the companies time and money because they didn't have work for me to preform."
bad,"I had a good paying job and worked with some great people. But AMD just can't get enough revenue to pay for the enormous expenses needed to properly fund the development of X86 CPU's and GPU's, and so AMD gets smaller and smaller."
bad,"Excellent co workers and management team"
good,"Micromanagers, promote isolation, a dont care attitude for the individual. Had to reverse engineer almost everything to come up to speed, and complete goal.."
good,worked at both Sunnyvale and Austin sites
good,Great opportunity for experience in high tech machinery. Prototype product processing required good deal of thinkering and imagination. Resolution power of machine tools was in the angstrom range.
good,"Day to Day Operations Support for IT Security Department"
good,Good team to work with. Sharing my skill with team followed by documentation for my team. Travel to Data Center and work with other team to resolve issues.
good,"AMD is the only alternative to Intel when it come to consumer PC microprocessors. Without AMD, there will be a monopoly in the CPU business which is not good for the consumers. The presence of AMD maintains the balance of CPU pricing in the PC market."
good,"AMD is very unstable to work for as a employer. AMD hires Marketing Professionals and then a year later lays them off since they can't compete against Intel. Not a place where you can have any stability, despite stellar employee performance"
good,"Highly driven team but given little overall strategic opportunity.  A great group of engineers and teams.  Unfortunately, they haven't been market leaders."
good,"There is no future with this company, go some where else."
good,Pues lo que se realiza en un día de trabajo es verificar todo el producto que esta en piso  y identificarlo según corresponda para que sea con su etiqueta correspondiente para darle seguimiento ya sea para almacén o para área de cuarentena -aprendí como se debe de utilizar cada una uno de los métodos de medición y como tener una buena comunicación con el operador lo mas dificíl es cuando hay un rechazo por cualquier motivo ya se por la maquina o por el operador o por el área de almacén
good,"Good, hardworking people for the most part. Company transitioning to a different value prop within the market place. Much hard work ahead for those who stick it out."
good,"When working for AMD my experience was a bit different as i was working for the contractor company.  There was no regular Management as they were based out of the USA,  The managers were .consistently changing and things were not always accomplished"
good,"You will learn a lot on your own "
good,Too many managers.  No one leads. People with good ideas and enthusiasm are marginalized and pushed out. They are more concerned with how they look to the rest of the world than how they can make products better.
good,Chaotic decision making. Work life balance a challenge. Very young work population. LOTS of conference calls. Not enough time to do the work. Great people.
good,"i got training & experience"
good,"Company is in the middle of transition."
good,Work is challenging hence exciting
good,"AMD is paying employee pretty low, and the stock compensation is very low. When I was in AMD, AMD is not doing very well, so the working experience is not very good to me. But, overall, this company is very good at management and motivating people."
good,"A typical day could include working issues."
good,"AMD was a great place when I started, but then everything went south. There was no enthusiasm at work and the kind of work became too monotonous. This was in 2012. I hear things are lot better now."
good,"Great people to work with and a beautiful eco friendly campus.  On-site cafe, Starbucks, gym, game systems.  Work from home capabilities."
good,"In the days when we beat the competitor (very few), everything is great.  Every other day you're waiting for the next layoff."
good,The company is going through major changes in the market place and as a result layoffs are a constant.
good,"AMD is a decent company to work for, however, as with any company in technology, layoffs are frequent."
good,Still banking on some luck for +ve turnaround.
good,It is a good company to work for but unfortunately the company is not doing well financially so job security is not guaranteed.
good,"AMD could be so much more. Talented engineers around (although a lot of them are leaving and not getting replaced.) But management is thick, with SEVEN layers of management. I have two directors, two VP's, and everyone who shows up on LinkedIn seems to be a VP of something. We can't even settle on one CTO."
good,"Overall the work culture devolves into a few people doing all the work, while everyone else does very little work. Team member son my team were very co operative and insightful when help was required, but meeting often ended up very political with very little progression"
good,"As an intern I had no salary, no compensation, no official title so I was nearly anonymous in the company. Anyway it's a big company with international partnerships."
good,"- Readily accessible knowledge for career growth in semiconductors (courses/classes)"
good,this company is all politics.  you only get promotions by who you know and not about your performance.  they downsize too frequently so you cant view this company as being long term for an employee.  best if used as a pilar to learn from and move on
good,"AMD could be a great company, but it is really going through a rough time. People do want to succeed here. Work-life balance is really valued here."
good,"The constant layoffs have gotten the organization to the bone, with a lot of good people leaving voluntarily for greener pastures.  The people are good, but the constant lack of resources makes it hard to get things done are priorities keep changing and budgets are cut.   Hope the new CEO will turn things around, as at least she should be more suited to really grow the company more than the the previous one."
good,"The semiconductor industry in the US is dying.  The employees that are left are doing the work of 3 or 4 people to help control labor costs, so work life balance is poor.  Salary is not competitive compared to other major semiconductor companies, but is well above most other technology companies in the area.  There is almost always a layoff in Q4 each year.  You will learn a great deal about technology and work in the forefront of high-tech."
good,"AMD is constantly re-inventing itself. The top executives and bottom knowledge workers continue to churn in and out of the organization while middle management remains largely the same. All in all AMD is a great place to work, where work-life balance and respect are valued pillars to the culture. However if you desire to grow and get different opportunities from within an organization AMD might not be the place for you. There's simply too much uncertainty and change for the organization to focus any meaningful resources on fostering employee career development."
good,"Pros:"
good,Have enjoyed my time at AMD for the past 20 years. Would like to experience a new fresh engagement and opportunity.                                                                                                                            
good,Only thing you need to bother about is the lay off which they usually do very 2-3 quarters. Apart from it everything else is fine.
good,"Technical growth, project management skills, muti tasking between different projects and priorities. Meeting hardcore deadlines , great supportive co-workers."
good,"Deadlines, Deadlines, Deadlines and always behind on them."
good,"I worked there more than 25 years ago. Things are totally different now. Completely different management, different focus. different mindset. location was convenient."
good,"Pros:"
good,It has been too long since I've worked there.   I do remember the team being great.  Compensation was great.  This was a fun place to work as they strive to catch the competition.
good,Hands on engineering company. Opportunities exist for a engineer to grow technically.  Uncertain Business Environment. Often not fair while grading technical abilities
good,"They were a good company to work for, just was there when lay offs are occurring. great beneifits, great people, nice place to work at, always clean, Staff was awesome"
good,AMD's products did not live up to the metrics that were advertised to customers.  Onsite testing of processors demonstrated that the competitive products were far superior.
good,For the short time I was there I got to be with some great people and was able to utilize some of my undergraduate degree knowledge in the position that I held before the drastic cuts.
good,I was there for a year as an intern so my feedback is based on my observation during that short span. Employee is highly specialized and cross training is fairly minimal.
good,"I'm not really an expert on the hardware business, but this company has really made it against a lot of odds. The business continues to stand up to the challenges by its competitors."
good,"Working at the individual contributor level can be a lot of fun at AMD, with almost unlimited options to grow your skills on some of the most interesting, advanced technology in the world.  Coworkers are generally smart and capable, and there's plenty of low-hanging fruit for development projects.  "
good,"AMD is a great workplace with talented colleagues, and getting to work on innovative projects."
good,"Good teamwork, but some managers treat younger engineers and contractors like dirt.  That could be just the few I worked under, but that's how it was."
good,"Good overall culture.  Work hours were shifted, stated late, ended late, possibly due to the manufacturing sites time zones.  Lay-off occurred on a regular basis with each cycle of the semi-conduct market."
good,Great work culture with good opportunities.  Work/life balance seems to be weighted more towards work though.  Job security is ok but tends to be volatile do to the industry.
good,"Being such a large company the first and second level managers easy to work with, higher management not so much."
good,"I worked at an R&D site in Austin. The company offers flexible schedule and a fun environment. "
good,"If you had a great manager and worked in the right department, your work day would be great.  Flexibility of hours and working at home were important to me and I had a great manager who understood this and trusted me to get the job done when I said I would."
good,There are a lot of smart people with great ideas but this is offset by the constant concern of pending layoffs.
good,"A typical day consists of:"
good,Good hard working talented co-workers but very little to no advancement.  Constant re-orgs and layoffs.
good,"Drive to a satellite location set up laptop access the main computer. Learned how to sell a dream , management is not to stable. My co-workers are very friendly and intelligent . Hardest part of my day is dealing with traffic to and from work. Meeting new people on the phone getting them to go on a vacation."
good,"Friendly people and work environment"
good,Blah Blah Blah - I can not give any more details than this. Giving any more detail than mentioned will give away who I am.
good,"Worked in the networking group for 802.11b/a product lines, 10/100/1000 Ethernet Controllers and embedded microprocessors"
good,AMD is experiencing a transformation and transition in strategy.
good,"I worked in a small team of engineers responsible for testing RDK platforms. Day to day operations were normally, executing verification test on platforms focusing on your immediate area of responsibility. The challenge in this was prioritizing time well enough to prepare for new platforms incorporating new chipsets and new family of processors while maintaining a high level service for products currently in development. All the this does pay off in readings the next days reviews after a each release of a product."
good,Team working environment
good,"Good company, but compensation isn't up to par."
good,"I've been with AMD for quite awhile now, and because of poor executive management, AMD cannot get ahead. Hopefully, the new line of executives will see those problem areas and resolve the issues. Otherwise, AMD will continue to struggle onward."
good,"Wok life balance is  dependent on role and quarterly goals."
good,Very talented and experienced engineers to work with. One can get to work on latest technology. But the downside there is no easy training one has to struggle and fine the right resources to learn and grow. Workplace culture varies from team to team. Hardest part is attrition and management changes so career advancement gets difficult.
good,AMD was a company that understood its position with Intel and work diligently toward changing that narrative. That effort is reflective in the intense focus on weekly goals.  You really have to love the spirit to appreciate the work requested.
good,The company had a purpose while under the control of Jerry Sanders.  The company worked as a team and grew.  Under later management the commitment to the employees faded.
good,Las operaciones de procesos críticos están integradas en forma vertical para garantizar la calidad
good,I worked with some of the most talented HR people and engineers ever. The CEO cared about performance of the company and the organizational culture that would drive performance.
good,"Great Technology... old school culture. Great work-life balance, great office location in south Austin.. long uphill battle to regain industry leadership."
good,"Enjoyed daily life with coworkers."
good,"AMD is a great place to work and the company truly cares about people. If it wasnt bleeding so much cash, I would love to work there long term."
good,"Friendly place to work.  Good atmosphere. Lots of smart people. Flexible work environment."
good,"AMD's focus is shifting from PCs to semicustom silicon based on their IP developed for PCs and servers.  PC area has downsized steadily over last 4 - 5 years with more of it going offshore.  But even the semicustom division is losing US employees as cost continue to be cut.  AMD employees in the US have to endure frequent RIFs and concern over where management will cut next.  Meanwhile, some future products for server and ultraportable clients hold promise of reviving departments other than semicustom.  For now the SOCs for the PS4 and Xbox One are keeping the doors open."
good,"AMD has been a good place to work with a decent work/life balance.  The work has been very interesting and I have grown professionally while here."
good,"AMD offers plenty of opportunities for every level of employee, but is understaffed and over worked.  A lack of leadership causes VP/Director level management to overwork employees in attempt to drive the initiatives.  This causes a substantial amount of overlap and re-work between orgs."
good,"People there were really cool, you pretty much had a job to do and management wouldn't care too much what you did as long as you got it done and got it right."
good,"Co workers are good and helpful in nature."
good,"Great place to work, but the economy is hurting the PC industry"
good,Great culture and talented super smart people
good,"Had a great experience to work with highly ""knowledged"" co-workers."
good,"Can be a bit hectic at first, the fast pace will continue even after the understanding settles in. The campus in Austin has a lot of nice features such as gym and cafeteria."
good,"There is scope for machine learning development, but being part of specific QA team and isolated will not help to implement solutions that add value to organisation."
good,"workers are smart and work life balance good culture, product is competitive but pay is so so. Good for people that want work life balance. Located in Austin living cost is low"
good,Hi-tech organization with strong teamwork culture. Fast paced environment requiring agility. Graphics and immersive computing products company. Locations world-wide.
good,"Exciting to work with such advanced technology, get to work with some of the most intelligent people in the industry, employees compensated more than fairly,.  However, a lot of management change over the years has created uncertainty and the path to profitability is not clear currently."
good,"worked for a short time but a good experience."
good,Poor and inconsistent high level management created a stressful working envoronment
good,AMD was a challenging company to work for. The messaging for sales and marketing was never coesive which made it challenging to sell there product. Marketing dollars were also limited which made it challenging to sell product.
good,"AMD is a very engineering-driven company and can be a great place to work if senior management is effective, which unfortunately has not been the case in recent years. Currently AMD seems lost and cannot escape its consumer client past. AMD needs help becoming a real enterprise competitor."
good,"AMD is a good place with a lot of potential. Howevever, it is a highly competitive market and AMD is facing stiff competition on muliple fronts."
good,"AMD is a great company to work for and has many wonderful people and things going for it if it can weather the latest storm. My typical day at work includes meeting with subject matter experts and stakeholders to define, develop, and deliver server training for sales folks in multiple formats for a global audience. My co-workers are brilliant and dedicated to what they do. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to work with brilliant, dedicated people from all over the world right from my home office or at the Austin Lone-star Campus. The most difficult part of my job is learning how to cope with the insecurity related to whether the company is going to be able to turnaround."
good,"I have worked for AMD for 1.5 years now including 2.5 months during internship. From Day 1, I have been excited about being the small player against a Goliath competitor. I respect the company for it's being nice culture, work life balance and constantly changing environment. There is no dearth of opportunity to learn, work on exciting things, given things change a lot here (Org. structure, strategy). The company is nimble and agile, always on it's feet. However, I think being too nice and constant change also has a price and that is evident in it's executional misses."
good,"Entreprise très correct , personnel également correct au sein de l'entreprise , entreprise un peu petite mais dans l'ensemble très bonne expérience"
good,"One of the oldest high tech companies in the world, of the same vintage as Intel, but still seems like a work in progress. "
good,Overall a really good place to work.  Good people.  Good team dynamics.  Interesting assignments.  Challenges with the macro environment of the company and opportunities to grow.
good,"AMD offers a fun work environment and a history of innovation and cutting edge products.  Some engineering mis-steps caused the company to become unstable in the past few years, but hopefully the expertise in engineering and the strong graphics lineup will reverse this trend soon.  "
good,AMD was a place where the people were very knowledgeable in there respected fields.
good,Excellent company to work for during the good times. Excellent pay and benefits. Very contractor heavy
good,"CEO copied what was implemented at the last company he worked at; while he and the last company he worked at were both successful, it is not working here. Most people at the coporate office couldnt survive at Dell, due to networking and cronyism they have a stranglehold on innovation and progress (need Blue Ocean Strategy). All-in-all the company is good, the leadership in the C-Suite is pretty rich, and if they stopped paying the best consultants in the world to give them advice and instead spent the money on implementing something... they might be successful! Fantastic campus in southwest Austin, plus 30 other global locations."
good,"Great place to have good work-life balance. Good pay, helpful co-workers, lots of opportunity to work."
good,"Healthy work live style."
good,"this was a good place to work to find dedicated, creative employees.  Unfortunately the mindset of management is not long-term, but from failed project to failed project, which led to repeated layoffs."
good,Great place to learn and work on many different things but work-life balance can take a backseat with often aggressive deadlines and sometimes understaffed and overworked teams.
good,"Quality of work is great but there is too much business volatility."
good,AMD is filled with engineers. These people want to be friendly and often are.
good,"Typical work day is from 9am to 6pm ...more often after 7pm. Great company to work for. Good management , I learnt to be more confident and goal oriented."
good,"alot of opportunity if you are willing to work hard!"
good,"As a Quality Engineer, my current responsibilities encompass entire testing life cycle, which includes, Enhancing Automation test scripts, review of test cases, execution of test cases, and reporting of bugs."
good,"It was a good job. I was given a lot of responsibility, and was appreciated for my work."
good,"AMD was a pretty good place to work, Sadly, like so many other American ""Manufacturers,"" AMD no longer actually makes anything in the US and so this job is really and truly a Dream Job today."
good,"Short staffed and lots of turnover, due to people moving on or due to layoffs and reorganization.  I left before it was profitable so I think it's better now.  I did like the organization because there were a lot of great people."
good,Fortune 500 company that has enough room to grow quickly and make a great career. Environment is highly competitive and can be challenging at time but has many opportunities to grow and shine
good,Worked there for numerous years -- dating back to the ATI Technologies days.  Learned a lot from original management to grow from a clerical position to SME of Product Data Management
good,"It's the best place to learn, Work life balance.AMD works on cutting-edge technologies and it's a good place for those people who love to play with processors internals and graphics card. Here you can work independently."
good,Fast paced as new products are always being introduced.  I worked in the processor and chipset bring-up side of things.  Cube environment with plenty of space.
good,AMD was a very fun place to work. The staff there is very friendly and supportive. Everyone enjoys there job and it reflects on their work. I have learned a great deal about the inner workings of the graphics industry.
good,"very Good company to work. Good management."
good,"A proximité de mon domicile, entreprise familiale. Horaires de travail flexibles. Bonne relation entre les employés."
good,"Good work place with supportive management.  There were many challenging projects but very satisfying once they are completed.  Organizational changes were plenty during my time so in that period, it can be difficult to focus."
good,"Great place to work.  The people are smart and outgoing.  Very interesting projects as AMD competes against some of the largest and most well funded competitors in the market.  With that said, the products need to be revolutionary and the current product generation has not resonated with customers as expected.  This makes it a bigger challenge to succeed in the market but leads to the very interesting and cerebral work environment in determining next actions."
good,"Typical day at work;"
good,"New Technologies, Good Corporate Environment, Very friendly Co-workers. Flex Hours, Cafeteria, GYM on site."
good,"Very helpful colleagues."
good,The semiconductor business is tough.  AMD is trying to carve a niche in an increasingly challenging market.
good,"I have some good friends here."
good,AMD is a strong competitor and strives to innovate.  Very nice culture. Austin centric however.
good,"a typical day at work: "
good,Was able to get practical knowledge in Accounts and Taxation.
good,"Talary is pretty good and a lot to learn, but layoff is too often."
good,Nice people and cool environment to work. Learned a lot of new thing & new technology.
good,The people were nice and the hours went fast. Gave a 15 minute Break for a 4 hours shift sometimes would stay later.. Worked Four days a week and had weekends and holidays off
good,I enjoyed working at AMD - the people are great and the facility is very pleasant.
good,Highly innovative. Gives independence to come up with creative solutions to problems. Focused on people development
good,a typical day at work
good,"I really enjoyed the people I worked with. My supervisors were always very encouraging, approachable and helpful. The work life balance was very manageable. One of the main reasons I say this is because many worked from home or were at least given the option to be able to do so. In addition, we could work the hours we chose as long as we were in the office between 10AM and 2PM and made our hourly total for the week."
good,"Company : Advanced Micro Device (AMD) R&D, Hyderabad."
good,"I have enjoyed my time with AMD as a products, and as management."
good,- IP Lead for mulit-generation Clock Synthesis PLL
good,"it very good to work at AMD. i enjoy while working in AMD, i enjoy working with my co-workers."
good,Involved in several graphics ASIC products to [repare test hardware
good,"Great Working Environment, More Customer Centric, Innovative."
good,Good work environment with occasional flip of plans. Distributed management and sometime confused too and too much dependent on the competitor's move.
good,"I enjoyed working at AMD for 7 1/2 years. I was recruited to lead and manage the NA Channel events and tech tours. Very successful to the point I was promoted to manage the NA Channel Marketing team. After 3 years in this role, I had the opportunity to move to the WW team and manage the World-wide Partner Program. Had great success developing global programs."
good,Great technology and industry standards going here with good opportunity to learn and experience growth. The product innovations are world class and if allowed to grow would change the computing industry for the better.
good,"I miss working Retirement is the withdrawal from one's position or occupation or from one's active working life. I am may also semi-retire by reducing work hours. An increasing number of individuals are choosing to put off this point of total retirement, by selecting to exist in the emerging state of pre-tirement."
good,Typical IT job. Long hours and little room for advancement. Management team has had a lot of churn and AMD has had a number of bad years financially. Very competitive industry and layoffs have been common place at AMD over the years.
good,"Best part of the job was the teamwork atmosphere, all questions were welcome and indeed encouraged. "
good,"Ahuge variety of work learned from writing books to auditing to handling incometax querries , scrutines, to company law compliance. Majority of the co workers including the partner are very helpful and coperative. the most enjoyable part of the job is working uder stress."
good,Lack of company culture and long term strategy. It is great company to set yourself in Austin. But I would not see it as a company to make a career or retire from
good,Good opportunity to learn stuffs. Pay is pretty good. But lay-off is too often.
good,"A typical day at work involved interacting with peers and fellow employees, or upper management."
good,Very Matured Workplace.
good,"AMD is a great company to work for! Change in management occurs approximately every 9 - 12 months, which means new direction and goals - at times making it hard to focus on the core job."
good,There is alot of duplication of efforts and responsibilities.
good,"AMD is a good place to work. The company has made an impressive improvement in both, the market (its market share) and advancements in technologies. It is by far one of the most successful stories in the past 3 years."
good,"I would've stayed with this company forever. But lets be honest the semi conducting industry is always changing. With that said, lay-offs are inevitable."
good,"When I left AMD, the leadership and management was in disarray. Times sure have changed and I could not be more excited about the direction AMD is headed. Their CEO is sharp and focused, leading them into the future with a strong portfolio of products. This is a company on the rise once again that's reinvented itself. Additionally, they have once again become one of the best companies to work for in America."
good,"Its a good job for Computer engineers. Very nice company for VLSI interested Candidates. People who are interested in Graphics, Games and drives they will love this this."
good,Great place to work. Highly innovative company. First company to bring-out High bandwidth memory device.  The only other company that has IP on x86 architecture.
good,"Good to work at AMD, Learnt a lot by working at different projects in AMD. Good work environment. Friendly colleauges. Smooth work process."
good,"Flexible working hours where we can work remotely from home, such a good place to learn but quite stressful, no life balance, often time have to work on weekend, some of the co-workers were good and some not"
good,"great and supporting team"
good,"gud work but project cancels frequently."
good,Reconozco a la empresa en la que labore como una empresa
good,Lots of changes going on - working to respond to the Tablet Market
good,Very good place to work minus the politics. (which you will find almost everywhere)
good,Laid back atmosphere
good,AMD is in the middle of a transition from its traditional x86 model to ARM + x86.
good,"it's easy to interact with people from every function; therefore, good to know new people and new knowledge as market and customers are constantly changing."
good,Validated AMD processors by performing margining test and searched for bugs to report to design engineers.
good,"I worked in NSERC based project with AMD. The work was interesting and within my research work experience and interest. "
good,"High effort needed - no failure allowed. Must be on point always.  If you are a sub performer you will not make it here.  Only the best of the best can have a career here.  That said, high performers do not react well to fellow co-workers that are dead-weight.  great culture if you are the right fit."
good,I enjoyed my many years and many roles at AMD. It's always in a precarious market position relative to Intel and everyone knows that delivering an outstanding competitive product is essential to the company's survival.
good,"It was so long ago, that I'm sure it's not the same as it was when I worked there, but it was a good place to work, with great people and a lot of fun was had."
good,AMD is a great place to work with a great culture. Sometimes long hours are required but the teams are fun to work with and everyone is pushing for the same result.
good,"Good growth, good raises. Management was meh. Previous CEO listened to Board of Directors and company would have folded if it continued with that CEO. New CEO is better, they back to doing what they do best."
good,When I was at AMD it felt like the company was afraid to take risks and go after something which has potential with a risk factor attached to it. Since I left many of the decision making people in upper management changed and now they are on a road to recovery and potential.
good,"ik werk nu al 23 jaar in hetzelfde bedrijf,  heb veel geleerd en ik heb me er altijd goed gevoeld zowel als persoon en als werkneemster."
good,"Currently working for AMD, I would start my day running various reports for our systems to sync and inventory management. "
good,"Good people with great skills mostly go to waste dealing with the politics of a shrinking market and a company going thru a major restructuring more than once a year, with revolving-door upper management, but the culture is oddly friendly most of the time, and work life balance is awesome."
good,"Worked with Global Ops. IT team. Highly intelligent and friendly people. They also got arcade games, ping-pong tables, lot of other cool fun stuff. Unfortunately, the company is not doing so good right now. Team layoffs are pretty frequent. Sometimes, have to deal with problems totally alien to your job title."
good,"Firma umoziwjajaca rozwoj i poznanie najnowzszych technologi w zakresie projektowania ukladow SoC.  Dobra atmosfera pracy, ambitni i zyczliwi ludzie oraz mozliwosc pracy zdalnej."
good,"I worked a 10-year stint at AMD before when the company still manufactured their own products and owned their own real-estate. Competitive pressures have forced AMD to focus on chip design and chip sales only and to sale off their manufacturing and much of their real assets. As a result, the face of the company has changed and the family culture and feeling of a long-term, stable work environment is not as strong as it once was. It is still a very aggressive company with some great career opportunities available. Just feels a little uncertain these days I the halls."
good,"->Overall work culture is good but only is long hours we need to stay to complete the assigned work."
good,"If you want to learn about chip design, AMD is one of the best places to work."
good,Great technology and industry standards going here with good opportunity to learn and experience growth.
good,"Fast-paced, exciting, and fun! I learned a lot in regards to corporations' relationship with universities and how crucial they are. I gained more knowledge to become a success University Relations/Corporate recruiter. I worked with a lot of great managers who took the time to analyze your goals. What I most enjoyed about my position was working with the interns to make sure that they enjoyed their time at AMD and were gaining the knowledge and experience they were looking for."
good,"Great benefits, profile of work fairly good, and good perks."
good,"Your overall work-load and career advancement opportunities really depend on what team you are a part of in Global Ops and what your rank is. After being hired at the most entry-level position in the Product Planning group, I was eager to work and take on new tasks, get recognized, and move up quickly. I felt that the first manager I had did not support my ambitions and actually tried to restrict me from taking on more responsibility. After 3 months I had a new manager and she seemed a little more invested in finding opportunities for me to grow, but I have also had 3 different directors in the span of 1.5 years and they have all seemed relatively unconcerned with helping me move up."
good,"There is a lot of technology and expertise at this company that allows you to become a good engineer. However, the technologies are already very developed and junior engineers do not get to do any design from concept."
good,"i think AMD should be more open minded in internal transfer. "
good,"It is a very busy faced production line but working with good people. Lots of free food management. Good management. Unfortunately, some production dept moved offshore."
good,"The work culture is pretty good, flexible working from home and nice people willing to help everywhere. I met very knowledgeable team mates who can help you to mentor."
good,"Managed engineering lab,  responsible the day to day operation to facilitate 30 validation technicians and one hundred plus engineers.  This include a software library, server farms and environmental chambers"
good,"At the time I worked for AMD, it went through a CEO transition. The culture changed as well. AMD did a good job managing the transition although many people were laid off due to poor new product release planning and execution. Not all managers at AMD are/were worth workjing for."
good,"This was my first job out of university, and I was very happy to have worked here. I learned a lot about what I do and do not want out of a job. One problem I encountered was that I was often put on tasks that did not fit my interest, despite working in a team focused almost entirely on interesting things."
good,Work environment is pretty much like NVIDIA. Co-workers are nice and supportive. management is open for feedback. Used to enjoy cultural evens at AMD.
good,"Show up around 9 and check your email. Go to the Starbucks (on-site) and take a quick smoke break. Work and meetings until lunch. 1.5 to 2 hour lunches. Work until 5 and head out. Nice people, nice direct management, not so nice senior management. Fun team-building events. Benefits lessened over time. AMD was a great company 10 years ago when I started."
good,"lots of excellent opportunities to grow and learn, fast paced, management was very transparent and available to everyone in the company regardless of tenure, "
good,"Great work environment. Challenging projects but very helpful team."
good,AMD was a good place to work with decent compensation/benefits. The culture was good and the coworkers were extra friendly and helpful. The only bad part was that the company was always doing massive layoffs to increase profits.
good,Job security is not gud as company financial condition is not so good
good,I was the lead maintenance tech in the Etch area. I was responsible for the maintaining and technician training for my shift. I learned how to improve my interpersonal skills while dealing with all the different technicians. Management gave me all the tools I needed to succeed and I advanced greatly there. The hardest part of the job became getting burned out on never changing shifts or area--it became a hbardship on my personal life always working the night shift and not being able to change. I loved working with the same people for years.
good,"I've loved working for AMD since I arrived. It's a company I would recommend to anyone that is qualified for any of their current roles. It's not without it's faults, every company has them but I feel that the benefits far outweigh any negatives."
good,Great place/people to work with.
good,Can be stressful depending on who runs the project but all in all a good place to work. Location and campus is overall a nice place. Good benefits and good people.
good,"I heard of their job fair in April 2006.  I went, (along with many other Intel employees).  I was hired right away.  "
good,Very fast paced. Extremely intelligent employees. Get to work on cutting edge technologies. I recommend this company to anyone looking for a challenge.
good,Was promoted three times in the first two years. Was offered on-site training to improve skills as well as given the opportunity to find my own career-advancement training which was paid for by AMD.
good,"Some of the common positive attributes we hear are:"
good,If you want to go to a place where almost everyone is very intelligent and driven then work here.  If you want to skate through a job then you will be weeded out naturally - the culture is driven and thrives on getting things done - and done right !
good,"Excellent work environment. Management can be good, depending on the team. Lots of opportunities to learn and opportunities to learn from different teams."
good,"Flexible hours.  Work at your own pace. Good management.  The work place was comfortable. Sometimes the work got a little boring, but for the most part there was always something to do."
good,"I joined AMD in 2008, almost a decade ago. I truly enjoyed my time there. I was part of sales and marketing team and it being a nimble team allowed us lot of autonomy. Good work life balance and great people to work with. Made some fantastic connection there and truly a great org from tech prospective."
good,I have nothing but good things to say about AMD. It was a great place to work with great benefits and good people.  Lots of opportunities to advance. I have not kept up with AMD.  There have been lots of changes
good,Nice place to work.  People were friendly and it was a nice environment.  I would work there again.  Leading edge technology and tools.  Lots of smart engineers.
good,"Working at AMD has been very fun and the teams that I had there were great. As a Product Engineer hours were really good. The hours obviously would go up drastically when a new product arrived, but overall I enjoyed the management and compensation."

good,"Production technician in servicing all Integrated Circuits machine. machine down, up the machine as soon as possible. Support yield result. Replace computer failure etc"
good,"Each day of work was enjoyable and comfortable. I have learned a lot in working with precision and accurarcy. Management was excellent .The hardest part of my job was when a spare parts badly needed and no available in storeroom,so you can fabricate it immediately.The most enjoyable part my job was there are so many beautiful ladies in the production area."
good,"Give me a lot of experienced during my internships . At the same time, their managers always trying to improve their employee relationships with employer and other staff"
good,"Everyone is friendly in AMD and we are not particular about the time you clock in and out, that's probably because most of us needs to have night conference call with Canada or US. Situated just beside the PIE does not really mean that location is easily accessible, especially with the morning and evening traffic conditions."
good,Working at AMD was my first exposure in the semiconductor industry. I enjoyed every minute working with cutting edge technology in a class room facility.
good,"After 10+ years of spiraling down and near death, AMD has come back roaring. it has broadsided its main rival and is poised to take sizable market share. Next few years will be great for the company. Civil culture. Competent management"
good,"Great place to work, but upward mobility is limited. Relaxed work culture and benefits are great. Great place to retire if you looking for a place with work life balance"
good,This was my first job out of college and I was able to learn a ton about being a professional. I'm still able to take what I was able to learn at AMD and apply it to my current role at an entirely different organization.
good,"Pros:"

good,"i learned at AMD multiple technologies and facing challenges with customers."
good,"Responsible for processing silicon wafers in clean line and oxidation furnaces,recorded completed data into computer spreadsheet and delivered wafers to the next processing area. Shift reports given to oncoming tech about status of current process being conducted. Management available at all times even for individual employees. Weekly meetings held with work groups and management. The hardest part of the job was making sure all processes were correct no flaws. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning new processes in different areas and the work weeks 3on-4off/4on-3off."
good,"I am a 4th year Computer Engineering student from Ryerson University, who has a strong passion for computer/mobile/embedded system technologies. "

good,"	Implemented the process of Hardware Pre-qualification for Asics – This became the standard testing procedure for new hardware"
good,"100% vested your first day at work.  ""Why would we make you wait you should never want to go""."
good,I have been in a clerical position for over 20 years.  I did work at Advance Micro Devices for 7 years.  I enjoyed working as a test operator and would like to pursue that again. There was nothing difficult to learn about this job. I was willing to learn any task. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting along with all my co-workers.
good,Good place to learn and gain a broad range of job experience.
good,"Organize, maintain paper and electronic files; manage projects."

good,AMD is a good company to work for; very productive and have very good incentive for employees who works very hard. Management was very organized. They have good medical coverages for the employees.
good,"High pay, mostly good management, great benefits but it's a semiconductor company so there are always layoffs, spin-offs, and mergers waiting around the corner."
good,"Great company to work for.  overall great compensation and benefit. "
good,"Depends on your team. I've got a great one and so far every day is fun, manager is an engineer so way less bull**** to deal with."
good,Strong technology company but a poor marketing organization. It failed in its approach to educate the customers about the technically superior product that it manufactures.
good,"I found the seven months at AMD as a complete learning experience. I was fresh from Grad school and there were people always around to help me when needed. This internship gave me an opportunity to work with the finest team and let me understand the industrial practises and apply my concepts learnt at school. The team let me involve directly in their project and hence I had ample work to do."
good,- Sometime hectic but fun to work
good,"El trabajo resulta muy ameno & productivo, el respeto & organización relucen en la organización, lamentablemente el giro empresarial comienza a decaer por la competencia nata al que pertenece."

good,"Pros"
good,Entreprise dans laquelle on peut évoluer dans différent domaine
good,No se paga el tiempo extra como debe de ser no tengo seguro

good,I was in the production area and enjoyed the challenge of increasing our production numbers and lowering our costs.

good,"Pros"
good,"prestaba mis seervicios  como auxliar de enferemeria , para varios paracientes donde se lesprestaba  los servicios paleativos a los de la tercera edad,"
good,"AMD is a fair work environment. Their workforce is heavy in contractors, and contracting is a primary method of getting your foot in the door at AMD. Don't hold your breath for a full time position (non-contract) at AMD, but if you do your work well, they will find a way to keep you around even if your contract expires."
good,"great engineering company, excellent team environment. very collaborative and learning work atmosphere. Management is generally accommodative of employee requests."

good,Nice to work here which boost up my career with a full confidence.Timing is also good . Even employees having a good relationship with their team members as well

good,"AMD in Austin is a beautiful campus; the work life is supplemented with on site exercise facilities, cafe's, lunchrooms, pool and ping pong tables, and much more.

Also training for our Malaysian team for certain financial operations.  My coworkers and supervisors were incredibly talented employees and I certainly miss them.  The hardest part of the job is when the buildings were sold and most of us had to begin working from home.

Pay is competitive, location is amazing, Importantly, the mid-level management (who the engineers deal with) is VERY flexible with hours, with taking time off, with load balancing in difficult times. I've literally never been overworked. Barring compute limitations, there's not a lot of excessive meetings and red tape to do actual work, the engineering team is pretty efficient."
good,"I spent twelve years at AMD, and I enjoyed every one of them. AMD allowed me to learn new tools—e.g., FrameMaker, Photoshop, and Illustrator—and AMD offered instruction in technical subjects, such as x86 architecture, which allowed me to communicate more effectively with my engineering subject matter experts (SMEs). I worked on a wide variety of projects—e.g., design guides, layout checklists, processor data sheets, and the internal style guide."
