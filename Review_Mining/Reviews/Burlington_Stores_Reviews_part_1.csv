bad,"This is one greedy company.  I have never seen a company take back payroll like this. You literally work by yourself the month of Jan just so they can make year end results. They also do a yearly purge of managers to as they say "" stay profitable "". They have no loyalty to you as an individual or employee.  You will not have work life balance and will always be asked to give more of yourself"
bad,"It started out good but then I started getting scheduled when I had school and it took them a while to fix it. Managers act like the store is your first priority. Your back hurts from constantly picking things up off the floor. If you have a task and they need help at the cash register, they don’t care and expect you to stop whatever you’re doing even though cashing is not your job. One manager is very predatory and touchy touchy with female employees. The general manager prioritized badly and hours were cut so bad that people didn’t get scheduled for 2+ weeks. They’ll put you in one department by yourself with 5 hours to clean everything. They don’t schedule you when you put in your 2 weeks notice. Stay away, this job is not worth it."
bad,"I have worked for this company twice on contracts. It was the most depressing place to work.  One its very low pay. Two The equipment is so old it could take over 30 minutes to an Hour to resolve 1 issue.  So you really cant reach your goals here.  There isnt much to learn.  Everyone you work with is stressed out, and miserable."
bad,Store manager is a complete a hole! Rude managers! Male manager only communicates to other males appropriately horrible horrible place to work for many people corporate will do nothing after many many complaints what a shame
bad,Poor excuse for management!They don't come to work and when they do their there about 4 hrs leave and make everyone else do their job.Then complain if its not done right which they should be there in the first place.Awful place to work for in retail.
bad,Manager was hard talk with. A lot of people quit because of her and how rude she was. They had favorites at the place they literally didn’t give a s***t about their employees
bad,"not a good place to work not enough people, did not get hours, corporate does not listen to what you have to say, don't get recognized for hard work drains you"
bad,"When I first started at the Greece Burlington it was awesome great management and was layed back and overall a good place to work until a new SM came in and talked down on employees, constantly picked fights with employees and customer. The SM didn’t know how to respond to a medical emergency and was so under qualified for her position I wouldn’t even have hired her as a regular associate."
bad,"Promises of hours and higher pay, favouritism, people taking hour breaks while the only people working get 15min and get scolded when work isn't complete"
bad,"Employees are forced to do multiple peoples jobs on top of there own, dont get paid holiday pay unless it's a Burlington approved holiday. They overwork you and the pay is not good at all. Then expect you to stay after work if closing from anywhere 30mind on up to clean the store while only having maybe 2 to 3 employee working during a closing shift"
bad,"Regional and territorial management was awful.  Specifically, the individuals that were responsible for the Orange and Rockland, NY counties were inept and often acted childish / unprofessional.  They are clearly out for their own self preservation and development.  Expectations were unrealistic, while support was non-existent.  The “so-called” leaders in charge operate on a blame everyone or everything other than themselves type of mentality.  Very poor and spiteful leadership that unfortunately across the board from regional manger to regional human resources."
bad,No structure no money in the budget to pay u for extra hours  and the point system they use is bullcrap that’s why everyone quits all the time no structure
bad,If there was complete different management I would’ve stayed but they are a beautiful store great merchandise the linens department is amazing but the managers are extremely rude and disrespectful and judge mental the don’t treat the employees fair
bad,Management didnt care much about its employers. I got retail experience but wasnt taught by the store manager nor the assistant manager. Didnt pay each of us fairly.
bad,"Between the abusive corporate management, poor wages, and poor hours- Burlington is a bad place to work. All levels of management are out of touch, store managers are verbally abusive and shady, and corporate mistreats its employees horribly. "
bad,"If you need work, do not consider this company. Slave environment. They will schedule you less hours at minimum wage, and expect you do three times as much as any other company."
bad,"They do not give training, on the same day they leave you alone and one has to be asking others who often do not know about work or do not want to help, they are not flexible with schedules, they force everyone to work on Holidays, if not you will be fired, if you call out they add points and if you reach limit you're fired and they cut your hours, they don't give the two 15min  breaks only 30 minutes and sometimes no lunch at all or very late, they force you to do many tasks that are not in job description without extra pay including other people's work to make up who they fired, the managers have priorities with certain employees giving better hours and letting them slack off, they do not treat everyone equally, there are preferences, there is no honesty among the staff, they threaten to fire you constantly for there own benefits in anyway possible, I implore you not to apply, worst place to in any position"
bad,Never have hours they have a web portal you go to see your hours for the week then they text you different schedule they alter it. No bonuses what so ever no 40hrs just part time if you get over 40hrs which is for dec company don't pay time and a half. It's hot asf you swet like crazy and have you do million and one things for little pay. Corporate is in there all week long not doing anything walking around staring at everyone like they want to fire you it's creepy bottom line not worth your time don't work here you only get a 10 cent raise a year can't wait to leave no room to get promoted actually you won't I heard too many great employees quit and found better jobs.
bad,"Horrible experience. Bad managers and coworkers. Little time for breaks, maximum one day off, overworked to be part time, little pay, managers do not care about you"
bad,Claim to be Flexible with hours but if you don’t need their availability They will not schedule you. When i would close we stayed until 12:40 on a normal business day since management were so picky the day before corporate came. Never got 15 minute breaks because supervisors “weren’t responsible”. Too little pay for so many task. LETS ALSO BRING UP HOW LOSS PREVENTION never did their job.
bad,"In the receiving and throughout the store the employees r exploit as animals, and all for the lowest payment, you have to do everything fast, if you suffer from heart problems I do not recommend that you work there, apart If you get sick or hurting they have no benefits and they do not care."
bad,The management is terrible don’t waste your time applying. They don’t properly train you. They have awful communication skills. The only upside is most of the customers are really sweet
bad,This south sacramento burlington plays favoritism and are petty with your hours you can be the best worker but they will promote your position based on who you know and not on how good you work there is no reward they threaten and intimidate you in the receiving department and try to bully you to quite the managers and supervisors are all in kahootz and will lie in your face like your family when really they are  telling other associates lies about you it’s a very bad place to work and if you know your rights SUE BURLINGTON!
bad,If you are female your wages are low in management.  Hourly employees are not paid a living wage.  Only Male asst and store managers and above are paid well.
bad,Management does not speak with each other. Non concern for elder customers or minorities. Threw products around staff. Not much pride in the company. Employees disagreeing with hours given. Location has to reviewed management. Negative vibes in store good if desperate.
bad,This job sucks and you will not have a life outside this job. They will work you all day and night with no breaks or a lunch. And the manager does not care if you have a baby or family that you have to take care off she will make you stay there.
bad,Managers play favoritism. Managers talk to employees as if they are stupid. Lack of leadership. There is too much drama. Store policies do not apply to all employees. Low pay and horrible hours.
bad,"This was probably the worst job I have ever had in my lifetime (cashier).  In fact, this company still owes me for the last 9 hours while I was employed there and to this date I still have not received my pay.  There was literally no training.  They expect the cashier to do everything including what a customer service employee should be doing.  And the pay for a cashier at this company is very low.  I do not recommend this company to any one.  It's very poor management and not worth your time."
bad,"Management and corporate couldn't care less if they tried."
bad,"Leadership has one goal in mind, how they can use untruths and push for unachievable goals. They lack push unrealistic performance matrix to support endless turnover. Recently this is not a good place to work"
bad,terrible pay minimum wage and want you tell up charge ppl on credit cards also will sign you up for random shifts with out letting you know also cant get any hours because to many ppl
bad,"Awful awful place, extremely understaffed, long hours, lines with an hour wait, only two cashiers, everyone was racist. They do not care about you as a person! You will be hired as a cashier and they will make you do everyone else’s job without higher pay. Not worth it at all. DO NOT APPLY HERE"
bad,OMG This job sucked big time first of all way under paid for what they want u to do I'm sorry I mean expect u to do management the worst ..dont work here unless u like being treated like a robot and u get no appreciation worst company I ever worked for
bad,This job was a complete waist of my time and they barely trained me as a cashier and a supervisor. The security is very non existent and the management is barely up to par meaning they don’t care about their employees and could careless about them .
bad,"don't care about the employees, work as cashier, dressing room and floor at the same time"
bad,"Horrible company to work for! "
bad,After 5yrs of being employed there i was very Happy to resign. New manger used bad language to the entire receiving including the ones who worked hard. Felt like this person would do what ever it takes to redirect his boss focusing on his own faults.. many ppl quite after yrs of being employed after he came hmmm when a work place is fair people will stay with a company
bad,Working for Burlington was terrible the managers were nothing but a bunch of slave drivers who played favoritism I hated going to work there but I had bills to pay.
bad,"The store i was located at was not very popular so we didn't have much business. I spent most of my day organizing the store. Management wasn't that good, didn't really care about customers. One thing that I did learn was how to work the cash register."
bad,"I worked for this place for 9 years. When I worked shipping and receiving there was a Supervisor Position, I had already been working there over 8 years but they gave it to someone that was there for a year then I was told to train her."
bad,Burlington is Florida. They treat you like trash. Be prepared to work in the cotton fields again because slavery is back. Having to work with broken or faulty machinery is a daily deterrent. No direction in management and poor communication company wide
bad,"My store was so ghetto  the manager would use all the payroll up on nights she closed because she was scared to close. They worked you to death, they would take you on and off the schedule without letting you know  the only thing I liked was the discounts  raise the pay maybe you’ll have people that are actually excited to work"
bad,"Retail sucks but this one is something else. They treat the new workers differently in a bad way. The managers think they are something and will not respect you at all. They don’t pay good at all very low, you work a lot of hours but they pay you less. They don’t have a lot of people working each day on purpose so you gotta do a lot of work even others work. You don’t even get your schedule like that so you need to keep asking. Not a good place I don’t recommend it at all. Can’t even last a month and they do have favorites and will leave some people out and will treat some poor. They try to look like a good retail store but the work environment is bad. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME HERE!."
bad,The managers make you clean up after their messes from the night before because they dont make their night crew work. The only thing i enjoyed was meeting new people.
bad,Management treats people like slaves. They don’t pay people enough at all for all the work they require. They don’t care about their employees. It’s a hot mess.
bad,The management there is so disabled because they hire so many employees thus me not being able to get the fair amount of hours I need to pay my bills.
bad,"Lack of skilled management and unprofessional, and disrespectful to the worker's. You will never know what time you get off or go in until they text you or call you."
bad,No a good company to work for not very understanding of any situation and horrible management not enough money to pay your bills and definitely not enough hours
bad,"They work their employees to death and can’t even pay them a decent salary. The management sucks. You don’t get enough hours, and they’re always hiring new people so your hours really get cut."
bad,The management is a nightmare and shows favoritism. An overall very stressful 2 year experience in the receiving department. Subtle discrimination from higher management.
bad,"Management was a joke said one thing and did the opposite.. The environment was really bad, the scheduling was the worst I've ever seen.. You know your schedule day by day, so you had to sit by the phone to know if you worked the next day.. How can you plan anything like that? Stay away fromm that place"
bad,Overworked and no recognition. Management never listened to us and was very rude. They make you do every single job there and they make you clean everything
bad,"You have to work every penny that you own. Friendly environment, customers very demanding most of the time. No professional training. You are on your own and always very hectic and tense."
bad,"If you’re looking for a job that has integrity, don’t apply here. I quit after the first day. Super hood and ghetto, no self-respect. Unorganized and filthy and guess what, THEY WANT TO KEEP IT THAT WAY. If you’re a toxic person, or from the hood, you’ll fit right in."
bad,All of my checks were messed up sense I started working there the manager if real forgetful the work schedules was always out late and people hours was messed up and wrong
bad,The Store manager does not care about people stealing the Merchandise out of her store. She speaks to the employees as if they are beneath her as well
bad,You can do better at another job just isn’t a good place to work Poor management and you’ll never move up in the company it’s just not worth working for a company like them they dont trean management will get rid of u if u do good
bad,"The ONLY good thing that came out of this place is that I met a lot of great people! Way too much favoritism, Managers are lazy!! The store is always messy. We were expected to do so much in little time.."
bad,Don't pay enough for the work you have to do I wouldn't tell anyone to work at Burlington it's  a bad place to work the pay is bad the work is to much for the pay
bad,The employees could of been more open and more helpful in location of the products and the products could of been organized better than how they are .
bad,"I been working for Burlington for over a year. The store went thru a few store managers, merchandiser managers  and assistant managers all have left. It's short staffed, face pace and the pay is very low for the work. I do not recommend no one to work there. Management and corporate may seem friendly but they are not. The only good thing about working there is they get nice merchandise at times and the 30 percent discount every other month along with benefits for the part time employees. 8 to 20 hours a week."
bad,"This isn't your typical Loss Prevention Job. They don't like for you to approach customers they want you to provide only customer service, Your main Job is doing audits and making sure the inventory is correct.All they push is CUSTOMER SERVICE THAT IS ALL THEY WANT YOU TO DO! If you see someone stealing you cant approach them just ask them can you help them with anything smh.The regonial director is a Joke as well the pay is only 12.00 a hour its not worth it and you can not get no over time. back ground is easy to past and they do hire felony's I am one. So be prepared for drama in colonial heights people steal everyday and you cant do anything.HAVE FUN!!!!!!!!!"
bad,"Extremely unorganized with poor management. Requires too much for minimum wage, especially having to have open availability on the weekends. Would not recommend working in this unprofessional environment."
bad,"This store is disorganized. There's not enough walkies to go around for everyone so you have people just going about their business unable to hear anything from the managers or what not. The scheduling system doesn't work and management hasn't bothered to help those who struggle with it at all. They just throw the trainies right into the fire and have them fend for themselves but get upset when they have a question or need help. You're essentially treated like a slave at this store if you're not in the manager's little clique of favorites. Coworkers are disrespectful and I have been told by some workers that most people who come here don't last more than a year or two before they leave. For one, that's not something you should tell someone who just started and two, that clearly means that there is a problem with your management and it needs to be fixed. Overall, this is a horrible place and I've only gathered that after a WEEK of working here."
bad,"Burlington pays $8.50 they need to raise the wage. They make you  work hard for the holidays. They tell you that receiving will be working from 7am until 12pm , it was usually until 2pm"
bad,"Managers will use you and break you. will give you more responsibility and more physical work but will REFUSE to pay accordingly. Instead of letting people go, they will just not schedule you."
bad,"Burlington was my first job, horrible management, but great co workers, they would give the new people a lot of hours and the people who has been there longer gets less hours. Can be stressful because you can be the only sales associate on the floor and they will still call you up to ring up a customer."
bad,Manger is just awful. Thief is always going on and at night getting out of the store is not safe sometimes. No one is getting hired for security or loss protection. Manger doesn’t manage anything when it’s busy so we are swamped so much and they don’t help.
bad,This company sucks. Poor management and job advancements. At times your only working maybe 10 hours a week. That's not enough to pay for today's cost of living.
bad,"All decisions are made last second from corporate down to the store level.   No at this company is proactive, its reactive.  Coaching in the moment is there motto, because there is no training.  Way too many chiefs and not enough Indians.  Favortism is a big issue"
bad,Tons of favoritism. They see who comes to work to actually work and give them all the load of the slackers as they let them keep slacking. The hourly pay and hours you get is a joke. You make nothing but your body is gonna feel like you’re doing overtime at a warehouse type of job.
bad,Manager showed favoritism. Whenever I would ask for some kind of assistance I was always avoided. Seems the manager had her favorite people she liked and would always assist them.
bad,"I feel like is the location I was. In Miami dolphin mall, even people who buys here is rude. Management in general don’t take in considerations many things. They’w rather talk and treat you badly. Giving late breaks, long schedules without realizing that you have to be standing the whole time. Breaks are only half an hour too. They also restrain you a lot from going to the restrooms and having water bottles with you. Ethically speaking, they rather hire someone that answer to their requests like a slave. They rather hire someone newer who barely knows about the store needs than someone that has been working there for about five years. In addition, supervisors are overworked and treat bad and rude. Never have enough personal to attend the stores needs. I worked there for almost two consecutive years and I only went up $1 raise from $8.50 to $9.50. I don’t understand how this place was nominated best work environment or something like that"
bad,"They are so rasiest, and treat anyone that is not of color like absolute trash. The managers only care about themselves and treat other employees like they are beneath them."
bad,The management was bad and employees don’t last. Noone was happy to be there and they gave very little training. Did allow me a lot of time off (sick)
bad,"i worked for my pay, job culture sucked, the job wasn’t hard. typical day was super busy, management sucked. and the most enjoyable part was nothing bc i hated it"
bad,"Management is inconsistent. They do not communicate at all with staff. I work very hard and my work go unnoticed, while you have these young adults walking around on their cell phones."
bad,"The management in that building needs to have training themselves"
bad,"Very stressful environment to work at, expect a lot from someone when they don't really try and be their for their employees, takes a lot from you. Doesn't really appreciate the employees their"
bad,I would never tell anyone to work here. Management is very unprofessional. They act like high schoolers and don't do their job. If you are friends with them than you will be fine. I was fired for no reason but they claimed it was a computer issue or miscommunication. It took me a month to have to fight to get my first check.  One person will tell you something and the next manager will say something complete opposite. No one follows order and does what they want to do. They advertise receiving to have a schedule of 7-3 but reall you would be lucky to make 20 hours a week
bad,"Bad communication, rude managers, rude employees, only a few good hard workers. People are very lazy at times and push the work onto the other people."
bad,It seemed like in order to fit in and be accepted you needed to be in the management clique. Otherwise you were left to fend for yourself and I find that really concerning. As a manger you are NOT supposed to have favorites. Only worked here for like a week or two and I caught that vibe. Would not recommend
bad,You have to work too hard with a lot of stress . Some Management aren’t friendly and just push you to be hard worker without any thankfully!!!! I never back to work with this company!!!
bad,work at Burlington mean They take all your time and energy without making any money  ... They cut hours every day .. working everywhere in store from receiving to cashier ..
bad,"I was hired at Burlington as a CSS (Customer Service Supervisor). I originally applied for a full time position and when I got hired I was told I would only be working part time due to the fact that current Burlington employees get first priority on new openings. That was the first red flag for me. During orientation I did over 50 training courses on a computer... It was dreadful and not really helpful. Training was okay but I was only training at the store I had orientation at. I would be working at a new location opening up soon. Once I got to the new location, it was a total nightmare. Management had us working like literal slaves trying to setup the new store. Management expected us to build tier carts, flat beds, racks, etc. On top of that, we didn't have any of the proper equipment to build what they wanted built. Then they had us unload multiple trucks and expected us to know what to do after. Absolutely no guidance whatsoever. Such a terrible place to work and Burlington will literally hire anybody off the street. Careful when working for this terrible company."
bad,You receive endless emails about nothing then upper management threatens your job every day if you have vacation you can't take them than you only have one weekend off okus they make you work every holiday they don't ask they demand Burlington is no place to work if you wanna build your career
bad,"There are no human reasoning with management at all. Personalities from management is smile and keep dumping the work on you and pay the minimum. People with a green card are treated just that way. Like illegal immigrants. Piled up with so many different tasks but less money. This company needs more than a review. They need undercover agents to go in and just listen, watch and observe. I give it an ""0"" rating. So to be stress- free, do not apply."
bad,"The job sucked just good discounts They had shoplifters everyday I worked The pay sucked but the getting paid every Friday was cool "
bad,Working for Burlington for almost four years and still making minimum wage. No set schedule for flow team members. Received hours via text message from supervisors less than 24 hours ahead of when expected to work. The men do 98% of all physically demanding work at same pay rate as women.
bad,"How this store is managed is questionable at least! It is ran more as a sweat shop in the back room with a bunch of power hungry women who think by yelling and belittling you makes the job get done faster. Clapping their hands at you like you are some kind of dog and shouting at you, when you are completely aware of what is going on. Now the first day of work I feel that some sort of training would have been helpful, however I received no direction of how to do my job just told to follow people around and they would tell me what to do. How is one to learn their job responsibility when never taught! Note to Burlingtons, treat your employees with a little more dignity and respect!!!"
bad,Over worked and under paid..management is a joke and only caters to the employees that kiss butt. Alot of favoritism very high school. Lines are long. Employees are not properly trained. Lots of go backs. Not a clear understanding of policy procedure rules always change. Like to pay minimum wage with alot of excuses why you dont deserve a raise.
bad,"Welcome customers to the store. Assisted with purchases. Retrive merchandise etc"
bad,"Management has a habit of making decisions without fully thinking through how they will impact the dynamic of the store in the long term.  When I was hired there was only one full time associate in the store when there is supposed to be five, the other four had left with very little notice.  In the short time I worked there two full time associates quit without notice during the same weekend and the store manager resigned because of extreme pressure from corporate.  Just before she resigned, said store manager said something extremely hurtful and inappropriate to one of the full timers that left without notice.  Anytime someone brought an issue to managements attention we were basically told to suck it up and that it could be worse instead of actually addressing the issue and trying to improve.  Turn over in this store is the highest I've ever seen in a retail job.  Glaringly obvious favoritism dictates hours and pay, as well as who is able to advance."
bad,It is slave work. You are stretched very thin. Four associates is not enough to run a store on a WEEKEND. Company is very greedy and care more about their pockets then they do their associates.
bad,"Good luck if you think you can work here and getting hours.You need another job to make living ."
bad,3rd party company should come in and clean house. Corporate only care about money. They have no respect for associates. The pay is horrible.  Target paid $12 minimum for the same employment. Branch manager doesn't appreciate the associate and doesn't believe in work/personal life boundaries.
bad,Working at Burlington was so long ago but I can remember some things. They never worked with my college schedule and they are not realistic with people getting sick and the mangers was very unprofessional.
bad,I was hired as a cashier but spent most of my time as a door greeter due to my manager seeing me as nothing more then my disability I will not go back
bad,"at the beginning it was nice to work, then 2 managers came in and everything changed to the worse. low hours, more work put on employee not enough help"
bad,Horrible hours they are open until 11. Which means you don’t get to go home until 12:30-1. Worst retail environment I’ve ever worked in. Toxic work environment the manager hide in the office and let the supervisors run the floor. Horrible benefits won’t even give you time and half for working holidays. Really bad place to work.
bad,"Only worked for a month the manager do not care about doctor excuses he will take you off the schedule or cut your hours, breaks be too short working there was just not it!"
bad,This company makes you their work slave. Yeah you signed up for the work but it was absolutely ridiculous how much you were given. There is a ton of drama there. When you report it to the manager be careful because they will more than likely laugh in your face. I worked my butt off and never got praised for it. Overall management doesn’t respect their workers.
bad,And have to deal with junkies and homeless people stealing all day everyday. As well as lazy co-workers and incompetent management. It's not worth the level of stress and no one geta into retail expecting to deal with bodily fluids and dirty needles. The favoritism and toddler tattle tale tantrems between grown people is ridiculous and it's no wonder the turnover rate is what it is.
bad,The store manager is horrible and doesnt know how to run a store or hire employees and he takes care of nothing for reprimanding people that do no work and the people that do have to pick up there slack and he lies about what your pay is and the pay they give you aint worth the work you have to do. Best advice is go to McDonald's they pay more.
bad,I advise any applicant's to look elsewhere I was there for six years worst job I ever had Im still upset I stayed too long and the worst management team in history do not apply there keep looking.
bad,"Management is all over the place, have bad attitudes and no one that works there want to work there anymore. The building leaks when it rains and customers treated like they don't exist."
bad,"Working here was very stressful, they put everyone as part-time and give you 10 to 12 hours per week. "
bad,my schedule was all over the place. the managers are so unprofessional and rough around the edges. All they do is gossip so low brow coworkers. there wasn't any way to get human resources to do their job either.
bad,"-Lies"
bad,"Worst company i've ever worked for. Absolutley no communication from management. Always running out of supplies. Horrible safety issues such as having to dig in a barrel of pinned sensors and try not to stab yourself. Clothing racks will fall on you because they are old and bent, plus the floor is pitted and worn. Backroom becomes extremely hot and management wont do anything to fix it. literally working in a sweatshop. When you unload the truck in the morning it doesnt matter if its 4 pallets or 14 pallets your expected to finish in 5 hours. Be thankful if you can manage 20 hrs a week."
bad,"They treat their employees wrong, not enough pay for the job, they like to pick on some employees poor management, receiving was the worst. Don’t recommend for anyone to work there."
bad,"When I started at Burlington, I was in school so I told them my availability they continued to schedule hours during my school hours. Which put me in a place where I had to choose between working and my education."
bad,Worst work experience ever. They’ll say that you are a part-time worker when really you’re barely getting any days or hours. They call you when someone else calls off and EXPECT you to drop everything you’re doing to come in because they barely give hours. I would work twice every other week and I didn’t like that because we got paid every Friday so my check was little to nothing. management was very rude they talk to you like you’re nothing to them and just want you to take it. Nobody there has customer service skills. Very unprofessional.
bad,When interviewed was told no weekends. I took the job for this reason and for part time hours. Soon changed after accepting the position. Other employees hostile no management. No control over store or departments. People usually don't stay at this store.
bad,Work was great at start but later you were expect to do other departments job. You never got recognition for your hard work or efforts. I exceeded my jobs expectation and never got the opportunity for advancement. Management was very critical of employees and once personal life.
bad,In all my 3yrs they never gave raises their excuse was due to minimum wage increase. They had employees sign a paper that they weren't getting a raise. I refused to sign. Which they refused to give me copy. They set yearly reviews low so they didn't have to give raises. If you were not full time you were looked down on and treated poorly. They did not give you proper breaks for 8hrs shift.
bad,They expect you to work according to u realistic standards and one week you may work 30hrs the next like 8 management doesn't know how to talk to people and they treat you like garbage. There is no home/work balance at all.
bad,"Management is rude at the Winston-Salem location and does not help employees learn and grow.  I would not work here ever again if I could help it. It was a temporary job for school, but an unpleasant experience altogether."
bad,"Previous employer at Crestwood location. Management is terrible. Lack of communication, very unfair and they treat you like slaves. Want you to do your job and theirs too. Store manager and Assistant store manager BOTH take days off at same time. They don't train you properly, just throw you on the register, and they wonder why the turnover rate is high."
bad,"My time at Burlington has been miserable. Almost all of the managers are lazy and entitled. They hardly help on the floor unless corporate is there. They seem to hide in their offices because they don’t want to deal with the customers or any of the employees. There is no team work within the store. The employees are treated less than human. They are there just to simply pick the mess off the floor and ring, nothing else. There isn’t any advancing or learning as an employee. No one at the auburn hills location cares about your growth. Employees disappear for hour long lunches and extra long breaks, no manager does anything about it. And honestly, I do not blame them because they aren’t appreciated or even respected. Half of the staff has over the points for attendance, but they don’t get fired because one manager deletes their points, or the managers don’t want to deal with the confrontation so they let them stay. There is a select group of employees that managers show a prefrence for. They are the ones that get their points deleted all of the time and basically"
bad,Managers are completely incompetent when it comes to making schedules in which there is enough coverage. They don’t allow you to get your own job done because you’re too busy running around the store due to the lack of staffing and doing 10 different jobs that aren’t your own. Associates talk to each other rudely and no one is reprimanded or warned about behavior and respect. You’re thrown anywhere in the store they want you for that day despite your job title and again due to LACK OF STAFF & you’re expected to do everything perfectly with no proper training before hand. They go through so many interviews to hire staff & yet they hardly schedule the staff they currently have employed due to a “lack of payroll” yet we made sales and then some pretty much everyday. Nothing but favoritism here. And the customers are RUDE. Worst working experience I’ve ever had.
bad,"horrible place to work, no one cares what the store looks like or about who is actual working.  Underpaid and environment is stressful.  Management runs around like chickens with heads cut off and don't know anything."
bad,Cashiers expected to do too much additional work for the very low pay. Cash pick ups not done by management. Poor training. Poor scheduling. No breaks
bad,The managers are not structured.. they hold no one accountable because there no one to hold them accountable.. the managers are not on the same page.. there is no LEADERSHIP AT ALL.....
bad,"Horrible management. Don’t apply. I was hired in February 2019, not only was the management at the time lacking to say the least they were doing things they shouldn’t have been doing with my schedule, then new management was hired to replace the old ones. They acted nice and cherry at first but slowly as they got comfortable they started showing their true colors. They don’t care about how hard you work or anything of that nature. They only hire and fire you based on their own personal opinions on you. I saw many times them not even let people know that they were fired, just never allowed to to be put on the  schedule again. I was their hardest worker. I did everything including things that weren’t in my job description constantly on a regular basis with no added benefits or pay. I was made to unload the actual truck when I was hired for the sales floor."
bad,College Park location has a horrible manager that doesn't know what she's doing and does not pay any attention to her employees while that's going on in the inside on the outside they're breaking into cars daily. There is no money to be made here and store hours are always being cut.
bad,"To much turnover, low pay, no training. Stay away! No guidance or support. You just get thrown into your job to sink.or swim. No powers to detain, arrest. All you are is a door man who watches the metal rust."
bad,"I worked for this company for two years ""part time"" in the receiving department,we were constantly over worked sometimes working 11 hours a day because of lack of staff and horrible upper management. Favoritism was obvious I was passed over for a management position even though I knew the process and had more experience than the person who was chosen. DO NOT DO IT!"
bad,"•Working here helped me develop my customer service skills"
bad,"The employees are all divided into their own clicks, everyone throws everyone under the bus, management was petty and spread rumors about their employees, pay isn’t good, the atmosphere is chaotic and stressful and they don’t care about their employees. "
bad,"Burlington is a very stressful place to work in recieving, especially as a male.   Turnover is very high in this department because were not treated with respect.   We are always very understaffed because new hires only last a couple weeks before finding something better.  Female recieving employees have an easy time because they are not expected to lift much or even touch the trash, they basially just hang up clothes the whole shift.  On my regular shift we had 7 females and 2 males in recieving, yet us 2 males did all of the hard labor.   Male employees must do all of the physical work unloading the truck and throwing out boxes into the trash compactor.   We start at 6 but they do not turn the AC on for us until the store opens to customers at 9:30.   There is too much physical work being done without help from other employees and we don't even get air conditioning.   We make minimum wage and do not have benefits.   Even after 2 years of working for Burlington I never had the oppertunity to sit down with management for a review to discuss a promotion or raise as promised."
bad,Let me start by saying I'm not done bitter ex employee who got fired or something I just  recently quit tho after an argument with management. I am the only man on an all female receiving team. We have been short staffed the entire year I worked here and Everytime someone gets hired they quit because they treat their employees like complete garbage. The store manager rarely gets off his but and when he does it's to nit pick at little things like items being misplaced a few shelves off. If ylou need anything he refers you too the manager underneath him who honestly is a really nice lady she just has a mouth on her but I genuinely do think she is a good manager but expects alot minimum wage.  The job consists of unloading the truck into pallets then opening the boxes and tagging and putting in shelf easy enough. Problem is since everyone is new no one knows what they are doing and we only have four hours to do it so if u don't get it done ur being harassedsed by management and being told that u have to stay untill done or written up. Keep in mind management doesn't do anything.  So if we don't finish then it just piles up and the next day or must be done plus that days requirements. Also keep in mind the day employees come in an hour before we leave. Their job is to stand around and look pretty and do not help any of the receiving associates they just complain and remove stuff from shelf and bring it to back management often socialize s with them as most of them are friends and can be frequently spotted doing nothing but talking and gossiping daily. In other wards there is no
bad,This was the worst job ever. They hired me on the promise of having full time and 40 hrs Once i started it was part time hours very low pay and they want you to work in other areas also Had to leave my register to get price check constantly The customers at this store are very rude Managers had their favorites Pay is 8 they wanted me to work 2 days a week 4 hours a day and you get paid weekly Ummm nooo This company is very greedy and they dont care about their employees
bad,"Management at the westland location is a joke. Absolutely no communication between the managers and staff unless its negative. Constant hour cuts. Such a petty, hostile work environment."
bad,Lacking integrity and full of belittling management that isn't willing to actually train employees correctly the first time around. Management has favourites and has no problem picking said favorites when they are very much in the wrong.
bad,They are the lowest paid retail store in America! McDonald’s starts minimum wage at $11.50 per hour. They start out at $9 an hour. You always have to have open availability on weekends. No set schedule so it makes it hard to actually have a life outside of work.
bad,"I currently work at store 446 and honestly dont apply to this company.  Bad Management, especially store manager.  Low pay, overworked, no benefits, hostile work environment."
bad,Management and Supervisor needs to be trained on how to speak to people. They have no communication skills. They clearly hate their jobs and will schedule you for shifts you tell them you can not work.
bad,"The Corona store is a joke! It's filthy dirty, dead cockroaches all over the back office area. When I did orientation the Manager that scheduled it didn't show up and didn't tell anyone I was coming in. The manager that did help me was extremely put out, left me in a filthy dirty cobweb field room with debris and trash everywhere for 6 hours and didn't once come to see how I was doing. They don't train you at all, they just throw up there to fend for yourself. Also they  schedule you like once a week! Do yourself a favor and do not apply here."
bad,"treated unfairly & like slaves. Store manager only cares about himself and not the workers. was rude and disrespectful , a lot of good team members quit because they don't want to work under him."
bad,Work environment is horrible.. Customers are rude & nasty... Managers do not care as long as money is flowing.. Favoritism at an all time high...Scheduling sucks....and no room for growth.... DO NOT WORK THERE
bad,Poor place to work. Management and supervisors feel like they don't have to ring when the line gets long at the checkouts.   Have to deal with a lot of favoritism at this job. They don't post open positions.
bad,"For this location it was awful and they tell you what you want to hear, to get you to work with them I would never recommend it working it's in Kansas but I'm not going to say the exact location of It. I I don't want to be rude but it's in Johnson County that's all I can say sorry and yeah. they will tell you what you want to hear to get to work with them but, when your in the its awful. & I was supposed to be working full-time at the once I got into being part of that location they put me in it I was working part time and I was looking for a full-time to get some cash to pay my college and they lied to me straight up and that's just unprofessional. And the assistant manager I was Interview with her and she interview me for cashier and once we interviewed she told me well I don't have any more positions for that position and she told me she had  receiving available. She said are you interested and I was like what the heck okay so I took it and you know in the next day  I was in the break room and She interviewed a person the lady and she was there for the  cashier position 2 and she told her you got the job and and I was so disappointed upset that she lied to me she could have told me hey you're not a good fit for this position but you know what once you get into receiving for certain amount of months or years you can level up to be a cashier or a salesperson or something you know but no she's like I'm sorry I don't have that position anymore and that's just rude to have another person like the next day as a cashier what the heck it's just I have worked as a cashier for three"
bad,this job  sucks. the manager gives hours too their favorite people & they do not put up schedules when they are suppose too.  its a hot mess in burlington.
bad,The place wasn’t a good place to work. Management was accountable for their actions so they couldn’t hold their employees accountable for their negative actions and being a Loss Prevention specialist at the time made my job very difficult   Assistant store manager wasn’t reliable which made it difficult to work under. The employees didn’t respect the management team. It was a poorly run store.
bad,I worked for 2 months and never got paid they lost my paperwork twice and kept lying to me saying i will get paid soon it was problems at headquarters and Christmas season but holding everything up this is the gateway mall store.
bad,This was the worst Job I have ever had !!!  The store in reference is located at 100 Oaks Mall .  The management team inside the store was over the Top... The so Called corporate Had their head stuck up their own ----- and thought it did not even stink... The environment is the worse I have ever worked in due to the cliental.   You would be safer working at a Zoo.. Kids tear the store apart and thieving is an every day event ..    The hanging racks often used as a jungle gym.. On 2 occasions  entire racks turned over due to kids swinging on them .. The bending and stooping you do to pick things off the floor will consume your entire day …
bad,Job was ok and kinda fun scaring off thieves but the big problem was the managers from the store as well as the loss prevention managers. They don’t value you as an employee. The managers will talk down to you and try to intimidate you with their position.  All they care about is themselves. They put too much pressure on you to catch thieves and do reports but there’s nothing you can really do when you’re not a cop. If the managers weren’t there then I would still be there.If you’re ok with managers screaming at you and being disrespectful then go ahead and go for it otherwise stay away!!
bad,"I dont recommend job for living that's for sure pay is terrible ,management terrible ,no way to advance ,because those positions are only given to the favorites and the clicks,manage ment very unprofessional rude and ignorant , too many favorites , too many clicks,  they careless about they employee, associates are terrible , rude, disrespectful, especially if you go against them anything ,they will retailate against you , even get management against you as well they retailate as well , management is dishonest , unprofessional will lie on you in a minute , whole work atmosphere here is hostile and terrible ,and the associates as well sum are lazy ,and will not work , and talk bad about you and set you up to fail every time as well as management ,no work hours , hardly any hours ,it can go from weeks or months , rules only apply to sum and not others , must watch your back always that's how bad associates and management are, new associates they dont train very well at all basically on your own. Might be better to look else where and no benefits or insurance ."
bad,Working for Burlington was NOT worth it. I started off in the back and ended up being put up front as a cashier on a Saturday with NO training. In 4 weeks I made 500$. 4 freaking weeks. Even though I worked almost EVERY DAY.
bad,Horrible place to work people who worked there in management have been there since the dinosaur left earth. People steal out of there every day it’s crazy and they do nothing about it.
bad,"They wrote me up for being at the hospital with my mother. And i was told by a manger "" your mother going into surgery isnt a vary good reason to call in"" "
bad,"Managers are rude,disrespectful and not team players. Extremely sexist environment the men received more privileges then the females. HORRIBLE WORK ENVIRONMENT. Horrible work ethics, they most definitely do not live by the Ethics they display during orientation."
bad,"Lets just say i m a former employee at this location i was fired due to ""points"" but clearly i was really fired due to me calling corporate to let them know the things going on in the store. This is a location that in order to succeed u gotta be young for one manager and another manager u gotta kiss they butt the moment u speak up or even see the unfairness say goodbye to ur job worst store ever and everyone there is under qualified for there position"
bad,Management needs to brush up on their people skills.i don't have enough fingers & toes to count how many times I needed to attend to a upset customer/coworker due to condescending remarks from manager!!!
bad,I worked for this company faithfully for almost  4 years. I get accosted at 30 weeks pregnant by a disgruntled employee and I had to defend myself. Terminated
bad,Great people to work with I got along with all employees that I worked with they were very helpful I am learning a lot working with great people looking forward to what’s ahead
bad,"Some of the managers were fair ,but one of them were petty and believe everything their little click told them ,i didnt get achance to voice my opinion because i were parttime and he didn't care liars were told on me about standing around when things were slow i worked in the fitting around and i ran some rack when no one ware their with me and helped in other areas when i was not busy in the fitting room-one employee wre so bossy at least she tried to be and wanted to talk to you any kind of way -i refuse to tolerate that i had to stand firm with them and that's when the lies begin too one of the manager and he believe them.some of those people are so petty i worked my shift and did not return the next day because they didn appreciate my hard work,and they tried to make me feel bad because i were parttime -thinking they could handle me like i were nothing but God !! They will reap what they sow every one of them liar."
bad,"There’s favoritism. They pick and choose who to give"
bad,I worked  here and slaved for 3 months just to mess up once and got fired. I begged for my job back with tears because it was 3 days before Christmas. They didn’t care. The lady who fired me over the phone ended up dying a few days later....guess god didn’t like me being slaved then fired for that one mistake either. There’s no structure or discipline at this job everyone does whatever they want. They treat ppl so terrible. If your not looking for a career and want to make quick money this is the place.
bad,Job is not worth the time or effort. They work you hard and sometimes don’t give breaks. No raises for the people who help develop the store or any advancement. Management was bias and lied often.
bad,If you are looking for a job where you do it all and are rewarded for it with more work then this is the place for you! Great discount but there is nothing else positive about the job. The other employees are very nice when they show up to work.
bad,"Before the remodeling it was super unorganized. Employees unprofessional. Cursing and fighting. Customer lines long. No bags, Card machine not working, computer freezing up, sensor machine not working etc. Schedule time to leave not relevant. Manager made you stay Passed your time a lot. Managers would leave after having you stay to clean even if your ride is not there yet after having you stay Passed your time"
bad,"Worked hard for this company faithfully for  two years ! was never appreciated! Within despite  I would put my all to finish my job in such little hours to satisfy my manager and myself ,and because I had my goals in my job ,to do right ,but never got recognized because I didn’t sleep with the manager,so others that slept with that manager got a better position,unprofessional communication by text with mangers instead verbally,bullying by employees ,and nothing was done ! For two years I would complete the inventory for the store with no tickets ! In a quick paste so the store would be the top store in the region!due to that I was known for quick on no tickets and never got rewarded for that ! Constantly watched bye lost prevention instead of doing there job more discrete and not accuse one for others ,and due to that I was a very sick person with Lupus which is a very bad disease to deal with and work in retail , I still managed to get to work ! But at the end when I choose to leave on my own because I refused to get fired ,and I never did nothing wrong and being bullied they did nothing ! I couldn’t get unemployment because I left such an un cruel company! Don’t wish on no one what I went through!"
bad,It was ok place to work.  Doesn't pay enough and the training doesn't really happen. Well the training doesn't happen! Not really going to advance in this place.   Loved the people I worked with but management sucks!!  No communication at all between them and that makes it hard on everyone!
bad,"I really loved the job, the customers were fun and i had a good time with my coworkers but the managers were nevet much help and they tended to lack enthusiasm and understanding in the workplace. Much too serious and poor people skills."
bad,they make it seem very nice and friendly once you start working there they are actually not so very welcoming you have to figure things out by yourself nobody likes to help you don't get the proper training you should get.
bad,"Don’t think about working for this terrible company. Hours are low, pay is terrible for what they expect you to do. Not even close to what was explained in the interview. Sad sad company."
bad,"Horrible place to work, management is rude and favors who they want. Management will always point out the bad and never notice the good. Rats in receiving and back room for overstock, roaches in the breakroom, customers complained that a roach ran up her arm when shoping in the baby department, rats would be in chip boxes so when going to put chips out there was holes in most the bags, the company lies and never stands to their words, they don't care about the customers..their motive is ""get the payment and move to the next"" ..a cashier got fired for being sick, I can go on but that's the jist of it."
bad,"I don’t know about the other Burlington’s but the one I worked with was horrible they were the worst job I ever worked for (and it’s sad cause Burlington is my favorite store to shop at) but when I first started working it was going good, and then mid of me working there it started getting bad. Mangers and some Supervisors would yell at customers if there is something wrong, they would  rarely liked to help the customers if they needed it. They were not very clean, there was multiple times where me or another worker would find  roaches in the break room and in the back and also we have found rats dead and alive ones. And the reason I left was cause I got really sick in December but I would still wake up and go to work and even pick up shifts for other people which was making me being sick work until one day where I had to leave work and go to the hospital and then when I got better I found out I was gonna be let go cause of it and my job was seasonal so I waited for my end date to leave so they so they couldn’t fire me. Like I said in the beginning I don’t know about another Burlington’s but mines was horrible and I hope the management there gets fired."
bad,"I've worked in fasted moving environments that require limitless amounts of multitasking for over 9 years. I have never dealt with such disrespect from my supervisors in over all of my 9 years in customer service. They belittle you, and think they can talk to you any type of way, meanwhile the store manager likes to speak to other people about confidential information. so it's like ""playing telephone"" it was full of drama. They can never keep employees because they either quit OR are fired even new employees ON THEIR FIRST DAY, have walked out and never came back... because they are just so rude, and provide little to no support, they schedule you without your consent. They would change your schedule when it had already been printed. I hated working there, I've had to stand my ground a few times with the supervisors because they use their title to be on power trips. I loved working there because I love working with people, however management was terrible, and messy!!"
bad,"bad pay "
bad,"Horrible place to work at. Managers didn't know what they were doing always snapping at co-workers.  Scheduled were a joke you didn't know what time your shift ends cause even tho its says 11pm ""closing"" it really means you staying til 3:00am. Then somehow your schedule magical changes while on the clock and when you are expecting to leave at a certain time, ""They says, oh didn't you check your schedule we may have changed it."" Im like when, cuz i check it today and its say Im schedule til 10.  """"They were like oh no we just change it like 30 mins ago. It was 9:20 pm. Yeah i didn't stay too long after that."
bad,They don't pay enough for you to live. Also they ask you to do more than what you are paid to do. They suck as an employer and they are racist and sexist
bad,"im not sure what they pay now, but when i worked there they didnt pay you enough to deal with the stress. And upper management did treat you very well"
bad,"i personally didn't like this job even tho it was easy and was never really challenged with anything, i was a cashier and sales representative, i got this job when i was in high school and it was a good way for me to see that money is the key to everything in life."
bad,Burlington is not what they portray too be . Management is horrible . They do not value their employees. Management does not give credit for the hard work the employees put in everyday . They yell / curse at employees on the sales floor in front of customers . it is not acceptable.
bad,Just terrible. Dont like it i dont like how y'all trying to make me speak on it either. Honestly i just don't feel comfortable talking about it when i worked there i never recievied help. Its to late sorry.
bad,"Managers are 50 plus, two faced and will talk about you by name upstairs in their office for anyone to hear or worse, right in front of you, then say they were just joking. They will embarrass you over the walkie with all the store employees who have one listening to them pretty much call you stupid or slow. They do no work on the floor, just sit up in the office calling the shots except when corporate comes to visit, then they rush around making unrealistic work loads for us and pretend to be busy. They also play favorites...ALOT. It’s not worth the $11 now $12 dollars an hour they expect you to slave for. Avoid the Worcester location it’s the worst."
bad,"Your availability is from 6:00 am 4pm;  but you only work from 6 in the morning to maybe 12pm."
bad,I didn’t like working there I there was no team work I had to work by myself every day with no help got yelled at for no reason and I didn’t get payed the way I was going to get payed bad place to work at work.
bad,Asked to go around a new job was flat out denied  but granted to others.try to show your worth and interest in growth to be ignored. Positions given to others who weren't suited for it
bad,working at burlington coat factory made me dislike retail .the customers feel like they need to disrespect you to get what they want. i wouldn't recommend anyone to work there .
bad,"Low pay , pay toll cut, poor managment very unfair, low pay for what you have to deal with , pays are all unfair some get 9$ some 9.50 some 8.25 and all do the same things. A lot of gossiping and judgmental people. They don’t praise you for your good work and I was getting four hours once a week once seasonal was over. None of the employees felt happy. The assistant managers are very biased"
bad,"Needs better organization and better communication between managers and store associates, longer lunch breaks, better training for new store associates, and better respect towards everyone."
bad,"So working here was probably the worst decision of my life. I wish I would’ve never stuck around for as long as I did. I’ve never in all my life worked in a place where everyone was so unhappy, mean and malicious. This place will send you to your freaking grave. The amount of work you are forced to do is not worth the measly amount of money. Managers and supervisors are incompetent and unprofessional. They lack understanding and have no regard for their customers or employees. Besides the poor working conditions, the place is a mess and quite frankly an utter embarrassment. I feel like working here brought down my worth and value as a human being. I was actually embarrassed to tell people I work at this location. The sad thing is there’s no excuse for the condition of the place. I’ve been to other Burlington’s and they are clean and more professional by a mile. The truth is that they honestly do not care about their staff or the customers. Please do not waste your time with this place. I wouldn’t wish these kind of conditions on my worst enemy."
bad,It appears there is a discord with staff and management.  There is no room for improvement and employees fear management because they are quick to fire someone.
bad,"If you want to be treated like a human being, do NOT work here! The management staff lacks professionalism and gets angry with you for not learning the material even though they hardly train you when you first start. I called twice an hour early for an absence and no one answered and called again when the store opened and ended up getting yelled at for not “letting them know beforehand”. Manager has favorites, and it shows VERY visibly. One of the managers was being unfair with me and another manager noticed and had a talk with her and suddenly the mean manager started showing me respect. They change your schedule without letting you know beforehand therefore resulting in an absence and an angry manager calling you and asking why you didn’t show up. Unfair when it comes with personal life, they act as if you have to reside there 24/7. Manager asked if I could work a certain date and said I couldn’t due to college final exams, so it was stressful as it is, and then asked what time I got out of school and just set up my shift that day without my approval/consent."
bad,Receiving associates do more than what is required of them and no one helps out. too many people trying to be the boss. Rude managers too. Trashy job.
bad,Management full of liars and bad attitudes they will talk to you any kind of way all they do is sit around watch you do all the work and talk to you any kind of way don’t waste your Time I do not recommend this job to anyone
bad,"I was promised full time after the 90 day probationary hire,"
bad,I don’t recommend anyone work here. Bunch of racist people work here. Managment is not good. Go apply other place.salary is really low nobody cares for you. No appreciation nothing us good here. I just worked gere because it nears to my house.
bad,"Managers are always on your back trying to get you to do stuff that isn’t on your job description, $9.00/h is not worth all the stuff you have to do. You barely get hours and never had a consistent schedule, sometimes while on the job after they told you had a few hours they’d take it back and send you home. "
bad,"Bad place to work. Was hired for part time at night and the managers didn’t know where to put me after training on the computer so they told me to just go home. That should have been a red flag. The next night, the managers had to LOOK for someone to train me because no one wanted to. Finally when someone decided to train me, the person led me to the linen department and told me to make it look pretty. What a joke."
bad,the job  had a consistent flow of customers that made hours go by fast. there were enough hours given in the week and opportunities to take on more hours if needed.
bad,"This company does not care about there employees, they makes them stay late . There is no growth and they will try to fire you if you want work the days they call you in for work that day.. MANAGER SUCK, The company sucks as a whole all they care about is the money.. not there employees..."
bad,I was hired for the promise of CSS but ended up place as a part time cashier. This company does not comprehend that people have lives outside of work. I got no paid maternity leave. Plus came back to threats about being fried. I got sick and lost my voice. I couldnt work if I have to use my voice and my children got sick afterwards. My littlest one is 3 months and I had to take him to the ER. Two days later I got fired for too many missed days. Couple weeks before Christmas. The Mamager never bothered to talk to me. Everytime I had an appointment I would let them know and they still will schedule me. People will call out and they would rather leave all tge work for uou to do instead of calling for someone else to replace and come in. Worst place I have ever worked for.
bad,I worked at burlington for 2 months an a new manager had just came in an had changed everything. Meaning people were fired an some just left. Leaving people like me who were floor associates to juggle the register an different departments at the same time. I was over worked with little to no staff. With horrible pay as well. Not a good experience.
bad,Work really hard not enough pay managers were rude kinda bullied employees by talking down and about them very poor management Skills .Working more then one area because people constantly were walking out of the workplace.
bad,Management tends to always be selective in who they treat nicely or well. Favoritism is clear. You HAVE to have open availability and they’re not flexible on hours or scheduals. At least at one location I know of.
bad,"Severely understaffed, poorly managed, extremely busy and it is typical for there to be only 3 employees working the entire store and a high volume of customers, go-backs to do, and store a mess. Huge weight on your shoulders each day. You are expected to break your back to be worth anything. 15% discount is not worth it, no benefits, overworked and underpaid and underappreciated."
bad,"The management plays a HUGE PART in favoritism as well as the supervisor current one , and they make u do more then you can possibly do at once , it's an over all bad job for anyone who don't like to be in a fast pace kinda job and not be Favorited , i recommend no one works here this is past experience which is how i know the way Northolmsted location works"
bad,"This place is so unorganized and unprofessional. The manger has favorites and treats the employees like trash. They rush you and expect you to do way too much. The environment was always stressful and they only told us what we did bad on and what we need to fix; never when we do anything right. I hated coming to work, and the scheduling is wack. I told them I could not work certain days and they scheduled me for them anyway. The people here do not care about you. they just want your time."
bad,"The pay was very low. It was not enough to even be worth it. Some weeks I would only be scheduled for 11 hours and others it was 30. The management had just changed and no one was on the same page. I was placed in the stock room but, I was hired to be a cashier."
bad,The management team harassed multiple people in a short time span. Over worked and set unrealistic expectations. Verbal and physical harassment by the store manager.
bad,I was a prospective employee and they were trying to offer me 8$ an hour for a receiving position that required you to be at work in the early hours of the mornings.  I quickly declined! People shouldn’t be making no 8$ in 2018. Especially if you’re about to unload a truck. Unbelievable. Don’t let these companies use you!
bad,On a normal day I would report to work I would be told my job ( which was normally sportwear aka fitting room) and would also be told of the other job or jobs I had to do. For example if a employee who worked in mens or accesories decided not to come to work that day I would have to their job as well as my own and multiple jobs with little to no help. Way too stressful and not worth the $9.
bad,Place and managers were awful. They didn't work with their employees and were stuck up and rude. I am happy that I no longer work there. They don't understand people have lives outside of work.
bad,"This store is the worst.  A lot of great employees but horrible  store manager.  Rude, non appreciative & extremely ungrateful.  Lies to upper management with no repercussions.  Lost many great employees and security guards left due to management."
bad,"The lines are ridiculously long with only a few cashiers at time to ring. Constantly calling floor people to come help ring. At the end of the night the managers ask the cashiers to go on the floor to clean, as if they don't have enough to clean up at the front of end of the store. The only thing I enjoy about my job here is the great friends I've made and my returning customers that I get to know on a more personal level."
bad,"I used to work for this company. And its not easy. One they expect a lot from you. If you're a cashier a lot of times you are left by yourself to do a job of two people. If your in the floor is the same  you are responsible of one area  by yourself. I only recommend people who have already have experience working in retail. However, the people here are really nice and are willing to help you."
bad,Both managers for loss prevention are trash dookie. They dont know how to operate the business. 2 big fat lazy m&m brothers. No assistance no back up just thrown to the wolves
bad,"The hardest part is dealing with manager that has no clue what an employee is worth. I had manager that called me a cancer and at the time, my mother was dying with cancer."
bad,"dint like this job at all take time work is not consistent and dint pay for what your rally work for as Customer services, Computer, Stock Assistant Manager"
bad,"This place was a joke. They did not make this place safe for no one. A lady got killed in their store. this place was just horrible. I hated this place, I hated the customers and the class of people they attracted, and I hated the managers."
bad,"They expect you to do the work of 5 people in a short amount of time."
bad,Apply ANYWHERE but here. Do yourself a favor. Management DOES NOT work with you. Hours are terrible here. People are too faced and will backstab you for a promotion
bad,"If you're only looking to work 8-12 hours a week then go for it. Otherwise seek employment elsewhere. During interview was told hours would not be a problem. Apparently that was not true. I'm a good worker. Always on time,ready for the day's tasks,have not missed a day of work since I started. Very disorganized place. I feel bad leaving a negative review,but I just wouldn't reccomend working at this store."
bad,Everything kept breaking and bees were also in the store and backroom.  Took everything at least a week too get fixed.  Not enough hour & pay.  We did get enough breaks and appropriate times.  People who work there are rude and don't care about anyone else except them.
bad,"Cashier! Cashier! Cashier! That's all you will be, no matter what position you're hired for. The company underfunds the front end and you will spend 90% of your shift cashing out customers. Then you will be yelled at about the condition of your department, because you spent your entire shift on register!"
bad,I've held numerous jobs with many companies and I would have to say that Burlington is the worse job that I've ever had. When 18 year olds come in and quit you know that the job is the worse. The paychecks weren't even enough for prom tickets. You will be lucky to get 20 hours a week working as a part time employee. They won't hesitate to give you a whopping total of only 8 hours a week. Management is horrendous. If you enjoy 10 cent raises and no hours and horrible management this is the job for you. If you have a family don't waste your time even applying here. You can make more money on welfare and that is a fact. There is also a lot of favoritism in the stores.
bad,you can never talk to a manager no talking very stressful and they dont wanna pay get more work out of u for less hours 4hours 3 days a week  and 15 hours a week no money at all
bad,"Don't work here if you can help it. It was really bad, poor management and poor pay, this is definitely a teenager job to have while in high school. If you have kids, this is not worth it especially if you have to leave your kids."
bad,"Hated working there in general.  I had a horrible boss that bullied her employees, when addressing her supervisor no changes were ever made to the conditions."
bad,"Horrible management. Constant arguments between employees, management etc. If you are looking for a first job maybe but anything other than that trust me this is not the place you want to work."
bad,For the location I was at there was an investigation going on because someone kept stealing inventory and it was the manager who in turn fired people to make up for missing inventory to cover their actions. They were caught but I and the others couldn’t be rehired despite the entire incident.
bad,If you don't have bills this is the job for you. The is stressful. You don't get paid enough. Managers are quick to jump on you. If you like stressing then go ahead.
bad,"Older systems in place (registers and computers) need to be updated"
bad,"Not a very good place to work . Turn over rate extreme , I've been there 6 years and I cant count on one hand those that were there when I started and that's just in my position . In store operations some don't last a week and that's if they show up for the first day."
bad,"Worked at Burlington for nearly two years. Don't bother going to management if you have a problem unless you are a manager yourself. The good managers are powerless to help you. The others couldn't care less. Heaven forbid you have the slightest problem because, whether you're in the right or not, they're against you. They toy around with your position, and if you're not doing well, they won't tell you to your face. They'll just put you elsewhere constantly and hope you don't question it. The slightest problem and, as far as they're concerned, you're waging a war. In other words, they like to exaggerate. A lot! If you can act like a sentient dummy - shut up and have no emotion - you're perfect! Otherwise, just stay away if you're not a customer. The best thing about the job are the (very few) managers who are capable of empathy and don't look at you as lesser and will at least hear you out, whether they can help or not. The rest have selective hearing at best."
bad,"This job is trash. They make it seem like it is a big deal to work for them, yet reality gives you a different perspective of what this job is about.."
bad,Don't pay enough  . Stressful work management does stuff they are not supposed to do when the head store manager is not there . You do everything by yourself
bad,"Terrible place to work managment is super rude, customers are nuts, they give you hours and then just take them away , a lot of gossip around the store"
bad,The store was very busy and you had to move very fast and take care the customers. It was all about cusmoter serivce and helping greeting everyday and night
bad,"It's okay, management could be better, and they could hire individuals who really cares about the job, but it's doable because they are so flexible. Only gets benefits for full-timers though."
bad,"This is a horrible place to work. They work you to the bone, provide very few breaks, and don’t compensate/pay you enough to be tortured like this. I wouldn’t recommend this job to my worst enemy. For someone fresh out of high school, I can see why they’d be interested in applying, but don’t. There are other retailers that will treat you better. They claim they will work around your school schedule, but they don’t always put you on the schedule. Stay away!!"
bad,i recommend nobody to work here at all. they treat the employees so unfairly. the only good thing about working at burlington coat factory is the weekly pay.
bad,Poor management only given 4 hour work shifts and a maximum of 3 days a week. They make you rush to get everything done within 4 hours which is a lot of freight.
bad,Go work here if you would like to get a rash or infection. If you like disrespect show to you and your work if you like to be overworked and don't care to be able to pay your bills.
bad,"I worked for Burlington for about 3 years and I do not recommend this company for a good place to work."
bad,I worked there for 4 years. If I could give 0 stars I would. Never gives raises and the working conditions are horrible. The management there was also terrible.
bad,"horrible place as most their is favoritism,lousy management,gossip from the management,manager against manager, you have a quota to get down and your constantly sabotaged,part timers get treated better than the full timers i will never walk in a Burlington again.As a supervisor you dont get respect for your title,the chain of command is who you know pretty sad.You work hard and get not even you did a great job.Never ever have floor coverage always pulled all over the place .Incompetent people putting merchandise in the wrong area doesn't matter how many times you tell them you spend time putting it back where it belongs. most of the leads are leaving like quitting,that should tell you something right there.most leads have already been written up its called a PIP,which means you dont get your raise.You get blamed for things thats out of your control because the management doesnt want to take the heat. ive been in retail for years and this place is a nightmare"
bad,"It is a horrible place to work.Causes you to stress out, unprofessional managers, racist managers. Unfair scheduling, showing favoritism to other associates"
bad,Today’s stars are tomorrow’s liability. Very little recognition. Always looking for more with no clear direction given. Favorites can do no wrong even when they are clearly subpar.
bad,i would not recommend my worst enemy to this place.  i havent even stepped foot in this store since i quit 5 years ago.  the management is unfair. constantly degraded. always talked down to.
bad,They never have enough people working.they have one closing cashier and two or three people working on the floor also  the pay is the lowest at a starting rate of 8.25.
bad,They do not give enough hours to their employees. Only fulltime or employees who transferred get the hours. Not fair when it comes to the hours. they have their favorites.
bad,working here was very fast paced I had to catch on in researching pretty quicky. management had their favorites and judged everyone else harshly. the pay in my opion was not enough for everything they made us do.
bad,"Poor management, unethical practices, unprofessional behavior, limited training, no air conditioning. High turn over rate, no conflict resolution, unsafe place to work."
bad,"This is the most unfriendly company to dedicated employees. I will never refer "
bad,AVOID THIS JOB!!!!! No one has a clue what they are doing. People barely speak English in here. My trainer they gave me all he did was speak spanish. So I roamed around because I didnt know what to do! Management has no clue either. Horrible place.
bad,Where i worked at the workers were very rude that they gave everyone mean looks. The managers were the worst ones that gave the guest mean looks. one of the mangers fire me with out letting me know i was getting fired
bad,Burlington is a stressful enviorment. The managers do what they want and then blame the work on the workers. The lack of communication is there. Its either you work of shut up.
bad,There is nothing that I can say except I didn't not like working here the last 3 years that I was there you don't get enough hours nor sufficient enough pay or raises and they expect you to give up your life just to be all about Burington and that is not how the world works especially if you are not making enough money.
bad,"Zero communication, management is disgustingly incompetent. Store in Fairfax, VA does not care about you. They change the schedule without any warning and you will get in trouble for showing up when the posted schedule told you to. Forget working here if you have any injuries because they will not accommodate you. Even if you've been to the hospital for it."
bad,The managers at the store I worked at were unbecoming. Every day was the exact same negative environment. I would not recommend this job to anyone who has any retail experience or wants a genuine idea of what it takes to work in this industry. This is not the environment to learn in. The attitude and the unwillingness to take feedback from employees and customers is going to be their downfall. There have been plenty of incidences in which managers would argue with customers.
bad,"You'd come in early in the morning and only work 4-6 hour shifts for 3 days a week. Very low hours, barely made enough to pay anything. It is very unreliable."
bad,"The GM often displays extreme favoritism to certain associates, speaks in a degrading manner to most associates. constantly finding loopholes in the scheduling to ensure certain people do not qualify for benefits. often delegates hard work or responsibilities to the AM. the hours are inconsistent and the pay is nowhere near worthy of the work you put in"
bad,"Poor training program. Learn by mistakes and corporate always complaining and never happy. Unfair treatment to all employees, not enough hours to successfully manage store. Constantly having to cut hours causing management to work over 60 hour work weeks.All over very unfair and unprofessional company. Would not recommend. They pay well but you are expected to work and live at the store."
bad,cashier just helping the customers with there needs and sometimes on the floor putting the returns were they belong and sometimes fitting room just putting the cloth were it belongs
bad,"Worst job ever after Kroger . Phony managers, always had an attitude, never rotated weekends even though I was told they would during to interview process. Managers also lack interpersonal skills when  it came to workers having to call out due to emergencies. WORST JOB EVER"
bad,"Assistant manager changes schedule with less than a 12 hour notice, the assistant manager always lashing out, yelling and use profanity towards staff when store manager is not present. Corporate  will not do anything about it because some of the women are good friends with the assistant manager.The job is a hostile workplace and you get less than 15 hours a week."
bad,Not enough hours for employees. Management was lacking and not very accommodating. My immediate manager was great but can't speak highly of the rest. Don't recommend working here.
bad,Poor management no training over demanding unconcerned not sympathetic they dont care what you are going through they want you to be at work if you are still alive they think you should be at work
bad,I can honestly say it was probably the worst job I have ever worked at. The boss was horrible he put words in my mouth trying to get others and I in trouble. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone
bad,"the only thing the mangers care about is the money they don’t care about your problems if you feel  comfortable at work, when you mention a problem that has to do with another co worker / days off they push it off to the side. ALL they care about is having enough people to work for them they don’t care at all about the work environment. Also the costumers are messy and destroy the store leaving it up to us to stay and extra hour an a half to clean up the store before closing even if not scheduled to do so.I would never recommend anyone to work here."
bad,"Worst Management EVER, ALL OF THEM!!! And one of them literally smelled and acted like a sourpuss, LOL. No one working there knew the concept of ""team-player"". I was NEW... 2 days new and felt as if I was being a nuisance if I had a question or didn't know something, got that vibe from both staff and management. Because the store was understaffed, Old Sourpuss had the nerve to ask me to recruit new employees as I'm ringing up their merchandise, REALLY!!??... yeah okay. They asked for a whole LOT for $8/hr, needless to say, I quit. Also, the store is filthy."
bad,Poor management at the last store I worked at would NOT RECOMMEND working there. I love the job and the previous stores I worked at however this one will target you and get rid of you by any means necessary and DEFINITELY not care
bad,"I was a student while working here. I always provided my availability well in advance to the changes but they still consistantly scheduled me shifts during my class times. They never got the schedules out in time and would frequently put them out on days I didn't work, and then not email them, so if they scheduled me for the next day I wouldn't know in time to trade it with someone else."
bad,Awful middle management.  Terrible work / life balance.  Constant replacement of regional leadership.  Leadership lacks cohesion and professionalism.  Not a good company to work for.
bad,"No comment on this company. The pay is poor and there aren't enough staff working everyday. The place is a mess and the moral is "
bad,"didn't like it too much , the people who worked there were friendly but manager and the work environments are pretty stressful. they had great discounts but I wouldn't want to work there again."
bad,"This is a very unstable company,  I wouldn't tell my kids to go work for a Burlington,  especially one in Memphis,  TN. They have bad everything and I mean bad everything."
bad,"The store is so quick paced. The other cashiers liked to goof off instead of working. I was taking care of the long lines we had all by myself. The store was always hot, no air conditioning anywhere. They constantly messed up my paychecks. The managers were completely incompetent."
bad,"This company is not for someone who has responsibilities. The company does not care about its employees. They are good at using people and dumping, there is nothing like employee appreciation all year round. They won't even give one penny [1 cent ] to each employee at the end of the year to appreciate them. I will not recommend this company to anyone."
bad,"worked there for 3 yrs and had 3 store managers , i enjoy working with my team and training new store clerks but due to some cuts by the company i had to find myself another employer."
bad,I was theatened by another employee for being transgender and the manager at the time defended and said it was the employees right to have that opinion despite the clear discrimination and hostile environment. I quit on the spot because I no longer felt safe. Especially with that many box cutters just laying around.
bad,"That place is the worst ever, Management is even worse, If I could give Management a( 0) I would, how can anyone survive on 10-18 hours per week, making barely over min wage? Management gets 40-41hrs wkly and that never changes, there are people that have worked for that company for over 7 plus years just making $10.00. As big as that store is 1 person has 2-3 departments to clean and be a cashier, The lost prevention is there for employee theft and not the customers that actually steal merchandise on a daily basis, the work load is just ridiculous. when it's time to get a raise you might get .10-.15 cents,part timers can forget it no compensation at all, you get points for call ins Dr's excuse or not, through the week you get 1pt, the weekend call off you get 2pts,10 pts you are fired, but management is forever going on vacations, they just don't care you make complaints to the corporate office and you get hassled or hours cut even worse, That Roseville store has the worst management team they all need to go, can't keep any workers because they don't appreciate you. Employees come and go through a revolving door, it's a shame The store manager has the biggest ego ever, he only cares about himself, Don't work there, It's a mess."
bad,"there is no chances to move up in this store. the other employees are nice but management does not treat them well. If your part time you will get 15 hours or less a week, full time gets 40 minimum. but there are very few full time staff. the store is constantly understaffed so the stress on the employees that are scheduled is high. they will higher you to be in one department but its unlikely that you will stay there, as you are constantly moved around. hours are sporadic so do not expect a 9 to 5 job. oh and if you change your availability due to school, your hours will be cut even more."
bad,Uniforms I learned a lot management wasn't organized  all culture I enjoyed multitasking helping in all positions organizing and sorting it easy going
bad,Poor management  they don't care about your problems   supervisors play favoritism supervisor m mangers go around talking stuff about there workers  they fired people for no reason just to set an example  low paid can't live off of there money  ... been there for 1 year n 6 months  only getting paid 11.50 an hour  plus I was the only one hired on  in my department  n I worked for DTS    do not work here
bad,"I was able to get the job easily, but started out very low hourly rate. I worked in receiving during the early morning. 5am-10am where i was made to feel like a slave minus the whip. It was very stressful."
bad,"very stressful and lazy management. all my supervisors told me different things, there was little to no communication between them. As a cashier i was also responsible for layaways, returns, running recovery, answering the phone, staying much past time to get off having to jump back on the register per managers request until the line went down and putting up hangers and sensors and taking care of returns after. The managers were very nice and everyone that works there are friendly. Return policy is awful. Bad experience. wouldnt recommend."
bad,first and formal working for burlington would be out of the question why you say that you are getting over worked for less hours and they expect a lot out of certain workers you be sorry if you ever applied there they expect you to process the truck and run the merchandise and expect to run fast stocking all the merchandise is hard work appreciated no all they give you is attitude that why everyone quits because you are told one thing that turns up to a million things all at once and do you think they care no where is your help when you need management where is your assistance when items can fit on the shelf and when you do put it on a shelf its always a problem or issue or concern.
bad,"Management is the worst, they are rude and unprofessional the work environment is super stressful , hours are even worse. Not at all a good place to work"
bad,This was a temporary retail position that ended due to a close family loss and then returning to college that was out of state; managers were nice however there were not enough hours provided
bad,A typical day at work was constantly being harassed by certain Supervisors and peers while doing my job. I hated working there but eventually bounced.
bad,"The staff gissips, employees gossip. Noone wants to do their job. The employees are ghetto. Its like high school. Everything is unfair. Not worth the pay or your time. This job is for desperate people who cant find anything better"
bad,i mostly remember it being stressful dealing with the managers that barley worked hard and expected the most from their associates.the hardest part of the day was always closing time because the store would be trashed and managers at the time could never be found.
bad,Work culture was not pleasant.. I learned to survive on a difficult situations with supervisors. Did meet good workers and customers .Standards of the stores where very difficult to maintain dew to lack of support.
bad,"I have work there for 6 years and the only good thing working there was my Mentor, Gaining experience & Travel to different stores when needed of help."
bad,The management was lacking and incompetent. Scheduling was inadequate. There were not enough workers on the floor to adequately provide customer service..
bad,The store really wasn't helpful. Management wasn't great at all. The pay sucked. The manager got fire and the store wasn't professional at all. I was being overworked.
bad,"When i worked at Burlington the management was very poor, they didnt schedule fairly. Employees who have been there for almost a year got scheduled less hours then someone who just started that week. My manager would constantly not just with me but with other employees as well, always had an attitude and always give dirty looks. When i first started i liked it but when i realized how poorly and unfairly employees were treated i no longer wanted to work there i found it hard to want to go to work even for the little bit of hours i actually had scheduled."
bad,"You do to much for no pay , your so called co-supervisors are more worried about items on sale than actually being where they are needed to be. The sales associates won't help out when they need not all but a majority of them. They rather worry about their breaks before helping customers. Management the store manager is a jerk, he tends to give the back of the store 10x more hrs when they should be going towards the front end and sales floor only because they are the ones who deal with customers who help out. The ones who deal with short end of the stick when the arrogant or ignorant customers come in. Majority of the store is more interested on who they can or can't date in the store and more worried about drama."
bad,the worst working experience i have ever had. Management didnt submit time cards. Store wasn't organized at all. The workers are under paid for the work that is required of them!!! Worst place to work
bad,I was hired as a cashier and would also help on the sale floor and wear house from time to time. I really enjoy the customer interaction most days. I enjoyed the other employees I worked with as well
bad,"The management team at the Bridgewater store is unfair and ""clicky"", unfair favoritism & no chance of advancement. They take advantage of your flexibility and then will not reciprocate when the employee needs more hours or assistance in any way."
bad,it was absolutely the worst experience ever. i hated it. the management was horrible they lied and defended employees that stole. worst job i ever had .
bad,"Sales Person/Cashier my duties were to make sure my section was organized at all times with the right selection of clothing by sizes and brands help customer find their needs, I was also a cashier with a fast paste of moving long lines and made everyone was happy with there're visit to the store and made them feel like they could come back any time."
bad,The place looks deserted all the time there's no business they don't order any merchandise for sale. The compensation is bad for the work that you have to do I worked Freight and receiving most of the day's work was cancelled because they cancelled the truck. We are normally scheduled 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. most days you would leave at 11 it's cool if you like $25 checks. This place is also not family-oriented I would not recommend if you have a small child. Management is strict and disrespectful they treat their employees like they are low lives with the inability to think yet do not offer any type of training or orientation. They don't make sales so they cut hours I don't see why they are hiring because they can't afford to pay the employees that they have. Save yourself some trouble and financial problems skip it.
bad,"This store is no longer open. there is nothing to write about. I worked there over 20 years, so I do not remember what my duties were. I think they have build another building in the spot where this establishment once stood"
bad,"I was miserable working here. The company was very poorly run.  The managers all had different ways they wanted things done and rarely communicated with each other about it. Management also played favorites a lot when it came to promotion and hours. There were far better workers who would get pushed aside because of it. There was a supervisor who insult and berate employess. The only pros were that most of the supervisors , other than the one, were very polite and helpful and most of the coworkers were great."
bad,"do not see why I have to do this. no need to do this I do not care to do this for this job, who does this. I do not do this. I'm not doing this. I'm not doing this"
bad,Burlington is a great company to work for if your in high school the hardest part about working for them is not enough hours and lack of communications a lot of hours cut and low pay.
bad,"You get paid $9 something an hour as a sales associate, I was a cashier there. "
bad,the worst place to ever work at people ar so rude for the pay to be that low and on top of that the managers dont even help you out when its your  first day on the job the expect you to know  every thing
bad,"Burlington is beyond stressful, the management will use and abuse employees. they will treat their employees unfairly and without justification. it is a unwelcoming feeling from the start."
bad,"This place is not the place to work, this is an horrible place. This place needs to go out of business. There was 3 killings while i was there and the company did not care, did not contact the family, and told us out their own mouth that they did not care."
bad,"The schedule is all over the place from week to week. No room to plan anything because schedule beginning on Sunday is not posted until late afternoon the previous Friday or sometimes even on Saturday. Full time associates almost always work every weekend, Poor management who doesn't care that people may have a life outside of work. Morale is very low and we never do anything fun to boost it. The only good part of this job is the customer interaction."
bad,I worked at Burlington for a couple months. I never had experience stocking items or working in the receiving department. Obviously i was new to it all. I had passive aggressive co-workers which made me really uncomfortable. Since i was new and i just needed assistance on certain things i wasn't getting the hang of yet. My supervisor would say really subtle rude things to me and it made me feel discouraged like i was stupid. I thought supervisors were suppose to do the opposite.
bad,This was company is terrible to work for. I feel like I was under payed and the company had no real employee incentives. I would never work for this company again.
bad,managers were stealing and co workers screamed at each other and didnt listen to instruction. Employees stole . not a great place to make a career .  thi
bad,"This job was a waste of time, alot of work for nothing. The management sucks. I wouldn't recommend this job at all! The schedule was disorganized and I spent 3 weeks going back and forth wasting money on transportation and I never got a permanent schedule. It was very hard communicating with the manager."
bad,"this company was my first job & i honestly hated it with a passion. Management absolutely sucks & disrespects you, all while threatening you with your job."
bad,"Do you enjoy being treated like a donkey while getting paid low wages? Come work for Burlington! Management is questionable at best and if you're good enough at your job, you get to do multiple associates jobs! It's a blast to be doing the work of six people when you're only one person! Who doesn't just love a condescending boss who tries to make you quit on multiple occasions!! I always come into work with the fakest smile I can pull off! I just love when I get to clock out and go home!"
bad,"You work for them , once a job opens up you ask can you get that position. They rather give the position to someone off the street then give it to someone who works there and knows what to do."
bad,Unorganized that place need a whole new training for the managment and the worker the ppl are rud and impolite not a friendly environment I would never do that again
bad,"Overall, management is touch and go depending on which location you're at. Low opportunity for advancement; they usually hire outside. I worked at 5 different locations and only a few people at each location actually liked working there. Most associates are treated poorly. Compensation is very low for the amount of work expected."
bad,Not a good job no horrible pay no good manager it just sucks don't do it every they do not reward hard work will cut ur hours if u speak up for yourself
bad,Customers and co workers were very rude and the place was filthy. Store area was dirty and the break room had rats. Plus they always had to look into your bag before you left the store. One time I had to wait 15 mins for a manager to check my bag.
bad,"Great for part time,"
bad,Work elsewhere. This is the last resort. This place sucks more than a a blavk hole. You're truly better off working just about anywhere else. I can't ever see myself working there again much less shopping there.
bad,"I applied for a full time position and I get a schedule with me working one day in two weeks which is an absolute joke. Managers behave  VERY unprofessionally, swear all the time, talk about “knocking out” customers and employees while using hand gestures. Uncomfortable workplace. Break room looked like it was from the movie SAW."
bad,Always was short handed on cashier and never organized and stay racial profiling on almost every other customers.smh .never can get overtime due to lost prevention.All the employer and employees like/love to gossip about what happened. And they watch every employee closely thinking they might steal.Also when supposedly talking to management about a problem everyone seems to know your business when it should have been confidential.
bad,I really don't have too much to say because I was a former worker there for almost a year management is terrible horrible very poor the work culture is poor as well the crew I worked with some of the people were okay and some of the people or just very mean the managers don't know how to run a business because literally they be in their offices all day long no guidance no nothing to the rest of the crew so it's like people will be out on the floor running around looking like chickens with their heads cut off same with receiving because that's where I was that's where my position was in receiving being the unloader for truck but my work experience there was excellent I say I went Far and Beyond Burlington Burlington could handle but the management there was so poor I swear they lost a good worker which is myself one of the best workers at Burlington cuz that's what the boss told me before she let me go
bad,"Poor, poor management everyone at this store smoked drugs and never did there job correct, employees  gossip so much about each other by far the worst working place I have ever worked even with it being a part time job"
bad,"It was fun to work here, you help a lot of people with their shopping! The only thing i don't like it was the people working in here are really mean !!!"
bad,managment is horrible and majority of employees are unprofessional also the store is very unorganized also alot of clicks and drama goes on especially with managment
bad,"Not a good work environment an Store #69 in Albuquerque, it's a mess with the store manager. She never empower, appreciates, encourages, or acknowledges her associates at all."
bad,"Communication is terrible, managers stand around and not help with keeping departments shoppable. Never schedules people that deserve the hours, but will call you when their favorites call off."
bad,I still believe I wasn't given the correct and appropriate amount of pay and they state you are off at a specific time but you stay 30 min after every night without over time.
bad,"Bad experience. I requested  week off about 3 weeks to a month ahead of time for legal issues I had to attend to. My boss approved it. The day I was scheduled to return, I called the store requesting my schedule for the week and was informed that I was taken off the schedule due to ""missing consecutive days at work"" which is not my fault at all because I had that week off. I explain the situation and ask to speak to the manager and I get the phone hung up on me. Took me 3 days to finally get a hold of the manager and the manager told me it was a mistake and I'll be put on the schedule to work for the week after and to just call on Friday for the schedule. I call that Friday to get my schedule for the week they said I was going to be back on and again, they say the same thing, I'm no longer on the schedule. I ask to speak to the manager AGAIN and he tells me the same thing, ""we have to put you back in the system but you'll be on the schedule for next week to work. I'll give you a call to let you know what days to come in"" and he never called me so I no longer work there."
bad,Work here at you own risk! this job is for teenagers who needs extra money to pay phone bill and by video games ect... It was the worst job i ever had in my life.
bad,I worked as a mark down associate so I came in and scan and mark down. I also worked as an cashier and a sales associate. I made sure I trained the new associate what to do doing the mark down
bad,"Management is horrible,especially the store manager,store manager didn't like our Receiving Manager because she knew her job and she was out spoken,our Receiving Manager was a fair Manager,Backstabbing store manager!!!! Not a good store to work at!!!"
bad,I was mistreated as an employee. Hated that they make you up sale without any money incentives. Managers plays favorites even if you are a good worker.
bad,this was the worse place to work during thanksgiving and Christmas. customers would come in and trash the place making it hard to recover the store for the next day of business
bad,"Its reallly not a fun place to work management was a joke, and the workers are rude. Customers even can notice how bad the management and workers are."
bad,had to do all duties far asa supervisor i had to run the front make sure all the casheirs is were they need to be.counting tills taking money to there tills.
bad,"They expect you to finish work but cut hours that it's impossible. They also took our 15 minute breaks away for ''productivity"". Management was also a joke, knew nothing about the process or how to manage a team. Don't work for them."
bad,"Working for BCF was cutthroat and even though you work with 2 other managers, it seems like you are on your own especially when you are closing the store and working the weekends.  They want to make sure that the store is recovered with payrolls being cut!"
bad,"Management is horrible. They made me feel stupid and I wasn't good enough. The supervisor was by far the worse. She wouldn't let us drink water in the stockroom because it's a ""distraction"" All she ever did was stand around and yell. There was even employees stealing stuff from the breakroom. It was a very disorganized stockroom, never finished any projects then they wonder why we are so far behind. Then overheard the supervisor say now that I was leaving.. they could get work done. Ever since she said that I haven't been back. Don't recommend working here."
bad,Management doesn't even care about if your injured and have doctor note because company policy apparently says they dont accept doctor notes and they dont clear you for being out of work by a medical professional.
bad,Burlington was not a fun place to work at.  Hours were always being cut.  Clothing were constantly missing prices.  Customer were rude.  I don't recommend this job to anyone.
bad,Maybe if it weren't for the supervisor and store manager being so stuck up and bossy it could have made my time working there better but that wasn't the case. The Burlington in North Brunswick is way better. The staff and workers are much more chill.
bad,"My time there was miserable. Very messy environment. Management is poor. No associates, more work for the employees that stick around. Raises are a joke. I no longer work there but it looks worse every time I step foot there."
bad,"Too much work for for the pay rate they try to pay their employees"
bad,"This job is pretty much what you would expect from a retail establishment. The managers thought they were better than the employees and treated them very poorly, i have nothing good to say about this job."
bad,I would not recommend this job to anyone. The management team was fantastic. The work was mundane and very boring. I learned nearly nothing at that job. There was no advancement opportunities and I needed something more.
bad,I don't feel the management would interact at all with their employees. I did floor sets and moved product from holding area onto the floor. I don't feel anyone at this company gets the pay rate they are desired.
bad,"Dept doesn't respect one another, it's like high school but with grown women very clicky, no cross-training, lacks management support especially by the director and the pay is terrible."
bad,"Poor management, they don't care about their employees. You are forced to work on your days off. They expect too much for little pay. No call and sick during the holiday"
bad,My typical day would include working early morning unloading the truck we had a old way before where the process would go really fast now it goes really slow management sucks they have no appreciate for hard work they don't care about there workers cuz if they did they wouldn't put all the responsibility on one person who is not getting paid for they expect alot but don't appreciate hard workers when they get them that's why a lot of workers leave it's stress full they push alot for what to make sure it goes smooth it went ruff n rocky.
bad,"This was truly the worst job I've ever had. The managers are useless and when the equipment didn't work,  they blamed everyone else but themselves. None of them did any work.. and the one guy just seemed to be paid to fill a seat. "
bad,"inconsistent with hours and scheduling, inconsistent pay, no benefits, no paid vacations, no respect for personal time. not an workplace that is open to improvement and hears out the employees."
bad,"This is another job that I had a long time ago when I was young. I remember having to ensure that the store was clean all the time, that I presented great customer service to all of the consumers, and maintain and run the register."
bad,It was a horrid place to work. It was hot. The people I worked with we're rude. There was no teamwork. They didn't appreciate it when I got sick and had to take time off per doctors orders.
bad,"This place will not give you full time hours. they take hours from you and with in a minute notice . They do not stick to what they say. "
bad,"Management sucks. Horrible hours horrible pay. Don't waste your time trying to work here. The hours really suck, super early morning and the pay leaves MUCH to be desired. Coworkers are lazy and immature as well."
bad,Wouldn't work there ever again pay sucked and coworkers were rude ..bosses were not helpful there was no so called team it was more like a mean girls click
bad,"Underemployed as flow associate No room for advancement EVEN WITH A DEGREE IN FASHION.  Store management resents suggestions for better ways of doing things. Bottom of the barrel employees hired as cashiers, they are angry and don't bother hiding it from customers and co-workers. No medical benefits. Have to work 6 days/week, and start working at 6am"
bad,the most uncouth and unprofessional group of management I ever seen. They steal from the store and higher secret shoppers to try to set up employees in effort to blame their theft on employees. They are all about get back games and power.
bad,"My coworkers are one of the kindest people to work with. I enjoy working with them. Customers are friendly, and are not hard to deal with. Management could brush up on their leadership skills."
bad,"Burlington Stores have a very poorly structured managerial system that makes it hard to have a very high employee moral, and often cause customer frustrations. full-Time employees are constantly over worked to meet the ever changing demands of a Regional manager who himself doesn't know what he wants or how the store needs to be. The only good thing about working at a Burlington Store are the people you meet their."
bad,"I have learned at burlington when the store gores under managment there is no flexibilty its the managers way or no way, I have learn that you cant run a company without considering your emplyeess lifestyle."
bad,I was given a horrible schedule that changed every week. Paid poorly because of lack of experience. I was shorted on my check many times and had to speak with manager.
bad,A repetitive non-flexible fast paced company. Availability controls hours you work (may be termed on-call and possibly work 5 hours or less a week). Management does not communicate with each other.
bad,"Corporate environment is toxic.  Instead of creating a culture of teamwork and collaboration, ideas gathered from brainstorms and taken as one's own and giving no credit to the originator of the thought/concept."
bad,"sometimes I loved to go to work there, other times I did not. For one thing could not get enough hours or days there. Too much everybody in other peoples business"
bad,Management had no idea or pumping laws.. so I lost my milk supply.. they don't give breaks on time... they also told me I would have to pump in my car.. illegal. This place was a mess and understaffed.
bad,"A terrible company to work for. Discrimination and unprofessional ism in the workplace. I am notified less than 9 hours before my shift to randomly not show up because I am not needed or desired. Also, working illegal 2 hour shifts. Has to be 3 hours +. Very physically demanding. I was promised at least 12 hours every week by Company standards, and receive less than that."
bad,"I could go one for Days about this company . I would not and have not suggested to anyone to work for this company. At least not in the San Diego market. They do not care about their store associates Leaders or even the stores themselves. "
bad,they were very rude and unprofessional and they could had did better with the company it was very unorganized and they could had communicated better with us.
bad,"It has been many years since I've been with the company, but at my stores location it was a terrible struggle to collaborate and create the team environment .The management has changed since then and my old colleagues are happier now."
bad,"They'll tell you that you don't know what you are doing, but they really don't care?, never give any real direction, "
bad,"I was told during interview that I was being hired on as a sales associate for days. After being there for a few weeks a new store manager came to the store. She was very unprepared for her job duties. She was not on the same page as the assistant managers and I kept getting different assignments from different managers. I was finally told I was being placed in the stock room and would be required to come in each day at 6 AM. This was not the original agreement. My pay was very little and my hours did not work out for me. When I went to speak to the manager about this I was told that it might be best if I found a job better fit for me. While I was there, once the new store manager took over 4 others girls also left the company."
bad,Fun place to work just wasn't what I was looking for at the time. Definitely is somewhere I would work again. loved the people I worked with. The store manager was a bit mean to employees and customers I do have to say though.
bad,"This store chain is totally undermining their employees ever since the wage increase. They've cut back hours, reduced break times, force employees to wear electronic monitoring devices during bathroom breaks, lunchtime, and regular 30 mins break. If the corporate office took a survey of their store employees they would be surprised how low they would rate them.  To all burlington employees rise up and fight for your worth. Don't let your local store manager punk you with unethical labor laws."
bad,"typical day would be a CSM breathing down your neck, customers always complaining cause we were always short handed and lines were always long, management was really rude on a daily basis.Everyday was a struggle not to quit on the spot."
bad,This company is downright terrible. They treat their employees like they mean nothing and that their lives are not important as management. Getting time off for family issues will get you fired as well as any mistake that you make. The only way to grow in this business is to be shopper and not an employee.
bad,Burlington is not for everybody. At least the youth. They will only schedule people the management liked. If you weren't in good favor with them then you would end up like me and only get 1-2 days on the schedule at best.
bad,"hope the store survives. We seem to forget about fundamentals when it comes to guidelines that the company sets. New hires or promotions are thrown into the proverbial shark tank. Going back to needing constant leadership, training is a big issue."
bad,"it sucks, hated it.  bosses are annoying you make terrible money only worked there for some extra money and new a manager otherwise i never would have worked there..it was awful back always hurt, you stand at a table all day and don't move much"
bad,"The lack of support as an employee from Management was difficult and was the cause of so much turnover of the company. "
bad,"Non salary earning employees are put third to customers and standards/guidelines of the company.  Working as a manager, you are giving little to no help with outrages company goals.  Stores are constantly being opened in several locations but the quotas are not being met in many of them.  If you are not earing salary with this company then it is not worth it for the minimum wage and the unworthy pay for supervisory positions."
bad,working with customers great experience but when you needed help with dealing with the customers the supervisors weren't helpful and no one was there to assist you
bad,"A typical day is dealing with stubborn employees and customers. I have learned you need to have patience no matter the circumstances, The culture is stressful. The hardest part is all the work they give."
bad,..... The most horrible place to work. Not payed enough for all the work that you do. There is  this older lady she has been with the company for over 20 years and not once has gotten a raise!!!!
bad,"-Did not receive any training for the job "
bad,"Burlington seemed like a nice company. Unfortunately, working there is awful. Management were awful ! "
bad,"Management only promotes people they like instead of people good for the position."
bad,"The morale at Burlington is ridiculolusly low.  Management is terrible and incompetent.  I hated going to work every single day. The LP regional manager is a joke and many times visited our store smelling like a liquor cabinet.  When I complained to HR, I was fired."
bad,Absolutely the worst company I ever worked for. They treat their employees like trash. Example: Management told us that they've hired a lot of people and they've fired a lot of people and there is always someone to take your place.
bad,Burlington is a very horrible company I wouldn't  recommend  No one to work with they do not care about employees there All for their  customers and bad benefits
bad,"The management is rude! They don't wanna take the time 2 properly train u. They barely give enough hours then wanna start u off below minimum wage. They say u get a raise after 6 month probation. But I think that's their cheap way of getting someone on board just 2 see how long they will stick around 1st. They never have enough staff, someone is constantly calling out or not showing up. Ur hired as a cashier but they're so short staffed they still make u get on the floor & help. U request days off in advance they still schedule u 2 then if u can't get someone 2 cover ur shift u get points against u!"
bad,"the managers suck there. "
bad,"Save yourself the trouble, don't apply for this job if you had prior experience because they will pay you the same as entry level associates. Since I had backroom experience, they were in desperate need for somebody who could help with the process of the truck in the morning. DO NOT SHOW THAT YOU ARE PRODUCTIVE. They will take advantage of that and make you do more than you are being paid for. Heck, I felt like I was the Supervisor most of the time since the associates and even the manager relied on me to push the team and answer questions. I wasn't being paid fairly for my experience and skillset. Btw, at the time this was posted, I already gave in my 2 week notice. Serves them right, it was bad when i was there, its gonna get worse for them now."
bad,Just another company who thinks they are above people when they make their billions off the backs of the very people they belittle. Stay away from this company if you value yourself. Look for a company who will treat you with respect the way you deserve.
bad,I do not recommend this job it was a lot of work and did not get paid enough for the work that was done also there was a lot of drama there and management was the worst someone stole $300 from me and no one did anything about it like they claimed to do
bad,I only worked there for a month. Well not even a month because I was always on call. Or else I would have to call them to see if I can get hours. Waste of time
bad,"I worked at Burlington for almost 2 yrs. I worked my butt off doing the tasks that others didn't want to do. Management dangles the carrot for promotion but never comes. Upper management just looking for work horses and pay minimally. Before Burlington I had previous work experience and was hired at a minimal rate. Later I found out a new worker hired in more than me!!! Told SM nothing done.  Blamed HR!! "
bad,"Poor Leadership, unrealistic payroll expectations, expected hours to work is unreasonable, accountability is only on SM, no planning, strategies, or support from corporate."
bad,"This job would be perfect for someone just graduating high school, a person who has retired and looking for busy work, or a person with no experience this job will help you to gain experience. As far as for individual with children this job doesn't have a set schedule and the pay isn't enough to take care of a family."
bad,"management had little to no people skill "
bad,"Not a good working environment, management is horrible, customer service is the worst, store is always a mess, not enough employees on the floor to assist, bathrooms always dirty. This is a good company to be apart of especially in the loss prevention field due to lack of training, the environment isnt the best place to work for at all."
bad,"No raises"
bad,I really disliked working at Burlington because I don't think they pay enough for everything they want done. My manager in Burlington was on of the worst managers I have ever had since I started working.
bad,"They had me working in the shoe section all alone. when it was time to close they would send people to help me and the help would never come!!!"
bad,This work was tough and you weren't paid well enough. They did provide some discounts but there were times when you had to work overtime. You were also expected to work outside of your department.
bad,"Stocking merchandise, assisting front end with customers. The hardest part of working here was having the supervisor dating and living with an associate"
bad,"A typical day at work was to arm and disarm the fire and security alarms, check visitors and employee identification cards, perform hourly patrols and log in and out incoming and outgoing trailers into the truck yard. I learned the security business well. Management demeans and harrases the employees. Work place culture sucks. The hardest part of the job was dealing with management. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the fellow security officers."
bad,"Typical day at work could include anything from checking customers out, restocking racks, tagging items, marking items down, and assisting customers on the floor. I didn't learn much at this job. Management was absolutely terrible. I noticed favoritism as far as possible advancement in the company. The workplace was okay because of friendly coworkers. The hardest part of the job was working so hard and not receiving a raise/promotion. Most enjoyable part of the job was break time with coworkers."
bad,All together Burlington is a very unprofessional store due to management. The front end leaders are very rude and lack communication skills. Breaks were handled poorly as well.
bad,"Not a good place to work. In the beginning I loved to work there but as the years went on management became horrible.  The merchandise in not what it used to be. Years ago you can go there for anything household,clothing, baby need,you can find it and many selections. Now you go there you are lucky if you can you find anything you like. Options are not there like they used to be."
bad,"Worst company to work for They want you to slave for 9 per hour has a horrible turn over rate, managers are very unpeofessional. Worst job I ever had do not apply a job for people who want extra income"
bad,This Job Was Very Under Staffed Expected Too Much From A Small Team And They Didn't Want To Hire Anyone They Always Complained About Payroll. Was Behind At Work Messy Backroom And The Pay Was Extremely Low For The Work They Wanted Done Wouldn't Recommend Anyone To work There.
bad,"The most enjoyable part of this job was clocking out. Some of my coworkers were very immature and racist, and the fact that they were adults shaming on a 20 year old is just sad. I loved working there but some of the managers and employees made i impossible to enjoy working there. They claim that their the best but honestly the only good thing about Burlington is there prices.The rest is just terrible, well at least in the one i worked for. It honeslty makes the company name look bad. Thats why I just left, i didnt bother quitting."
bad,Horrible management from store manager to ccs.No one is orderly or professional. Lack of hours.Store is never reset correctly.
bad,If you love working your job that's all that matters. Customer service can be very complex if you have the patience then you fit the description.
bad,Started out part time hours got cut now I'm on call. Haven't got called in for 3 weeks. Great place for high school graduates not for real bills.
bad,needs a lot of improvement. from associates to the management. a lot of fights and just chaotic. not a great work environment.
bad,"I wouldn't ever go back to this retail store to work at. I don't know if they have gotten better, but the only problem was the customers and some management."
bad,The only thing good is the discount and the co-workers the hours are always cut short.  They take hours from workers designed to work that are then takes them away from them
bad,"Burlington has rules and policies and positions that make no sense. The markdown team duties made no sense, scan everything find half.. make some imaginary figure that doesn't exist because of tagging errors and theft and changed tickets."
bad,"Job seeker be aware !!!!! "
bad,A typical day is spent working in a cash wrap ringing out customers. Cleaning the sales floor and putting merchandise back. The hardest part of the job is the holiday hours and standing on your feet for long hours. The most enjoyable part was definitely the people you meet there.
bad,"Handling customer service, as far as lay aways & returns was especially difficult. Again, this is all dependent on the location of the store & the customers that visit that location."
bad,I worked at the Burlington in Harper Woods inside of east land mall. This is a very ghetto ratchet place to work. Management are clueless on their job and they are very rude and ghetto. Worked employee like slaves and took all credit although they just sit in office. Very unorganized. Employees are very lazy and do whatever they want no one ever works they just sit and gossip at customer service while customers are present. Wouldn't recommend this location to anyone.
bad,"I had a Horrible experience working there and would never recommend burlington stores as a good place to work. They have you over worked and under paid. The shifts are rotating and they give no enough hours to part time employees and have full time employees overworked. Also, Management is a disaster and store cleanliness is disgusting.As a result of this, Associates are always unhappy and struggling to get their jobs done for every single day which ultimately affects their performance at work and obviously Customers will leave the store with bad experience."
bad,"Steer clear of the drama, pay is undesirable for all that you do. Management sucks and will repeatedly let you know. Discount on clothes, shoes, etc is a plus. There are cliques in this work enviorment."
bad,"this is not a job to depend on feeding your family with , hours are not much , pay is not much , leave it for high school kids, management all over the place , very crazy"
bad,The managers don't do their job if you call them they take their time getting to the front end.  They just sit in the back and leave you in the front getting hit by thousands of people with no help until the cashier comes in which will not be until 12 pm
bad,Horrible management! They have no respect for their employees and don't like helping them when it comes to days off 😤 I've already been looking for a new job temporarily till I finish school
bad,"- Co-workers gossip a lot."
bad,"The management played favorites. "
bad,"Incompetent managers. They're never on the same page. One tells you to do one thing and another tells you to do something else. Never properly staffed. Terrible pay, especially for shift supervisors. Unreliable employees keep getting hours even though they're not coming in. When you bring it up to management, the constant reply is ""I don't want to term them because our turnover will be high"" Terrible customers, they're slobs, can't keep their kids under control. They get attitudes about things that corporate determines, not employees."
bad,I like poo and poo is the best if you like poo too you should try to eat it it tastes like poo and has the consistency of a fine poo.
bad,"EVERY MANAGER deserves to be replaced, including the current LP supervisor. The lies and accusations they come up with to get their numbers up is preposterous. As a former LP agent at the Burlington store located at 645 Atlantic Ave... I've witnessed people get fired for  some silly things. I understand every job has rules, i understand that there are consequences for certain actions, but people make mistakes. These are peoples livelihoods they are messing with. Talk about them wiping out an entire loss prevention team before the holidays. I'm not bitter, i have a better job now. But WRONG is WRONG!!!!!!!"
bad,Management  is worthless  they let the loss prevention run the store they give the hours to the ones who always call in  I didn't like working there  managers need to know how to talk to employees  don't tell employees  that they are nothing
bad,"A typical day at work consists of nothing but illiterate customers. What i learned while working here is that you'll lose whatever patience you have. Management tweaks with your schedule without your consent. My co-workers arent as bad as the management team, but could use some work. The hardest part of my job is being nice. The most enjoyable time of the job is leaving."
bad,"They don't treat you well, they discriminate you when you have a mental health illness. I had did not had the best experience there I wouldn't suggest working there. Plus the pay isn't the best there and they barely give you hours. ."
bad,"Both store manager and ASM are rude and lazy. No praise for hard work or a job well done. Always understaffed which makes my job much harder since I am always a back up cashier instead of on the floor doing my job. Favoritism is off the charts.I am a very hard worker but get no recognition for my effort. The saying you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar must be a saying they have never heard or just choose not to believe, A typical day is very stressful."
bad,"I didn't like the job"
bad,From the beginning of my job experience here I had problems dealing with management but the only thing that kept me there was the employees.
bad,"burlington is one of the most poorly managed establishments that i have ever worked for to date. the managers do not know what they are doing, the entire store is a mess constantly , there is no one to work there aren't enough people on the schedule and they constantly cut hours and they that the employees terribly"
bad,"Does not give you enough hours to make ends meet. A lot of favoritism involved, so if you are not a favorite don't expect much."
bad,Management micro manages or better yet pretends to. Started at the bottom regardless of prior experience in retail. Was lucky to see 15 hours a work week. Dirty carpet. Dirty bathrooms. Short staff.
bad,terrible people terrible job anything and everything about the place was terrible management was terrible the process of the warehouse made no sense was dirty unorganized
bad,"Very unorganized, Job will have you hired for one position, but you'll end up working every position at that store. Never enough employees working, a lot of people will call out and management will ask you to stay and work extra long and hectic hours only for minimum wage. Store is always trashed by the end of the night. There is no clean up crew at this store. The associates must all work together in getting the store spotless for the next morning. So if you work a night shift, don't expect to leave the store until the whole place is cleaned and everyone is finished. All associates leave out at the same time."
bad,"Do not work here. As someone that cares about people and wants everyone to advance in the workplace that actually does a good job, stay far, far away from this place. They make you do other people's jobs as well."
bad,"If I could give no stars I would. Cant tell you how dishonest and fake this whole company is. Very big disappointment. no equality, very sexist, and never keep to their word."
bad,"This place is so unorganized. The management didn't communicate well with each other. Customer were the rudest people I have ever come into contact with. I became very familiar with the entire front end very quickly as I had already had cashiers experience. Was highly liked and the go to girl for being in charge when supervisors were on break or none were scheduled for the front end. But I felt like I should've been compensated more for training new employees being left alone with an entire front end of new employees who had no idea what they were doing. Frequently left alone on the front end from 9am-2 sometimes 4 had to constantly call for backup and pull an already short staffed floor crew to help me on the registers. Unrealistic with their expectations, they'd hire cashiers and floor associates and not train them properly causing customers to get very upset. If you want to enjoy your job and make decent money definitely do NOT apply for the Redford location. this store is a lot better with the straightening, but bathrooms are nasty and we have to share them with the customers who go in and will literally clog up every single toilet, urinate and leave blood on the toilet seats on a regular basis. Nothing about this store was appealing. At first I was excited for a new job but quickly saw what other associates meant when they asked me on my first day if I was going to return for my next shift. The turnover at this store is ridiculously high, I saw an entire crew of cashiers quit almost all at the same time. Stay away from Redford Burlington if you like to enjoy life."
bad,"Absolutely horrible, I worked LP and it was horrible, the regional LP was crooked and always on a power trip, the store manger was actually the best person there, but it was full of gossip, backstabbing associates, everyone was out to get you and they stole company time, by leaving early, never clocking out,  taking off for hours on end on company time....don't work there."
bad,Rude manager and supervisor  this place is the worst place to work poor pay  no hours suck!! You work extra hours they dont pay overtime. Store always a mess they dony traing you you got to learn ur self they dont have no organization in this place
bad,"The over work you and expect the workers to do everything including some management jobs without good pay. They want the people on the floor to be on the register and have their area cleaned and organized as well. They offer vacation based on points, so if you are even late for a few minutes one time out of the year then you do not get vacation days. So that means you have to be on time all year in order to get a vacation. You can hardly ever move up in position unless someone quits. Burlington has old electronics and need to catch up to 2016. Some of the equipment there is older than me but they want you to make sure the customers have a speedy checkout but how with old registers. There aren't any seats for older people to sit throughout the huge store. Management sit in the office all day and don't do nothing. Oh and you only get a 30 min break."
bad,Second worst job I ever had. Good job for college students and extra money. Managers aren't the best
bad,If you want to work with some of the worst managers around this is the place to go!! Liars and just plain ignorant. Save your time and find a better company.
bad,I was disrespected constantly by my cashiers and the manager just told me to deal with it. never again.
bad,very rude management not a healthy enviroment lack of respect from staff. you have no growth finacially...............................................
bad,"I would not recommend anyone to work here unless it is their first job. There is no opportunity for advancement, no stability, and low pay for the work you do plus the work they expect."
bad,there`s no moving up in this company and no appreciation of there employees.just alot of work for a little bit of pay and you will be in the same postion for years unless you and corporate we made them 5 billion this year they thank us with chips and soda.
bad,Working for Burlington was a horrible experience. There is a lot of favoritism and no real opportunities to advance. The pay is very low.
bad,"While working at Burlington Coat Factory, I noticed that there was no organization and no direction. The store manager wasn't able to do simple tasks such as cashiering or properly make work schedules. Managers that worked underneath him was able to follow all managerial procedures. The hours were horrible and the pay was even worse. The company doesn't pay according to work history, which is a downfall. This company only pays at an entry level experience no matter  what."
bad,"poor pay, horrible place to work, not enough hours, high turn over rates for employees and managers. make enough money just to go to work and that's it."
bad,"I worked for burlington in macon, ga and my experience there was horrible. There was lack of communication between management and all other employees. As a former CSS my job was made hard because uppera management would not enforce decisions. The work load and pay was NOT equal. Many stock room workers had to work 16 hours without a break and were threatened to be fired if they left. There was favortism because cashiers were not held accountable for their actions, disrespect, tardiness, and unprofessionalism. This company was a joke to work for and is not on my resume as previous employment. Think again about considering this for a job!!!"
bad,"I don't even know where to start first of all if you plan on working here don't expect to make a lot of money or get a lot of hours, that's not gonna happen EVER The manager is very nice but my co-workers are extremely lazy and there's so much gossiping among other employees and people here are very nosey it's ridiculous there's usually only one cashier in the morning which is disappointing since this a retail store, this job has hardly any benefits, it's boring to work here and it's only a job for high school students not if you have kids or bills to pay, Burlington has the highest turnover rate I've ever seen in my life last year over 20 employees quit my job because of insufficient pay/hours so that tells you something right there working here won't pay your bills, it only pays 8 dollars an hour and less than 30 hours a week, I'm ashamed that I even work here... it is a nice place to work I can at least say that but working here won't help you financially...bottom line if you want a nice job and wanna make lots of money or get lots of hours look elsewhere Burlington is not the place!!!!"
bad,"The employees are very, mean and the managers are criminals."
bad,"Typical day at work was very frustrating.  It was a study in just how much the managers could push your buttons and make you want to puke.  Most days I was on the register about 70% of the time with my so called manager griping because the work on the floor isn't getting done.  Well...I wonder why?  I'm usually the only one in the department,  with no one to help me keep the floor clean, build strollers, build travel systems, rearrange areas because product has sold down and needs to be replaced. Well, who does all this when I'm having to ring on register....no one and I get blamed for it.  It's my fault I'm having to ring....when I was told to go do it.  It's my fault things are not getting done on the floor because I'm having to spend MOST of my day being a cashier.  I like helping people...I like talking to people about the products.  I'm chewed out because I'm talking to the people about the products.  I'm told I have to give good customer service...then I'm told I spend too much time with the customers.  I'm told I have bad job performance but, I'm one of the hardest working people on the floor.  I'm told things aren't getting done in my area, but, I can't even start my day in my own area.  I can't even stay in my area because I have to go do  someone else's job, because they don't have enough cashiers so they can relieve each other to go on breaks or lunch. I can't get everything done because there's no one to help customers while I build things, clean up and open my own merchandise to put out.  we were told we wouldn't have to put out our own merchandise anymore...yet...here"
bad,"My first and only day working for this place was on a Saturday and honestly I liked it; new point of sale system to me but I got used to it. The co-workers and such were nice and helpful but honestly I had to quit the job; for the store manager had said a complete bald faced lie to me: he told me that I would get 12-30 hours in a week (in the job interview.) then I had found out that day that they would call me when they need me, so basically the job was one of those on-call jobs.  So I basically quit because I need a job where I get constant hours not being called on a whim. So if you want a job that is on-call; go ahead apply here but trust me if you want a steady stream of hours then look elsewhere."
bad,lazy job but management expect too much out of you when the pay rate is in the basement. i hope more people feel the way i do!
bad,"The Management team is horrible, they stab each other in the back. You never get a support for management, HR, regional vp and etc."
bad,Very unorganized. Company need to grow and all rules should be black and white without all the gray areas. Regional team should be more useful to store teams. This company should be more professional. Terminating  team members employment on the phone or on a text is non professional. But if you want to go work for a company like this ENJOY.
bad,"This company was horrible, I was promised all of these things and advancements when I was hired. None which occured, the management team at this store was a joke. No one was ever on the same page, staffing was always below what it should have been and then they left it up to you to make it work as all of the managers sat in the office upstairs all day gossiping. No one ever wanted to help anyone else in the store yet they constantly through phone number percentages in your face. In this day and age of telemarketers you can't force ppl to give up their phone numbers and penalize me when I didn't get a certain percent. The pay and benefits was atrocious. I was disgusted that I even accepted this position. I was out of there on the first thing smoking and let me tell you first hand that the turn over rate here is out of this world. We literally had employees who would get hired and stop showing up after a week because that's how bad this job and location was."
bad,A typical day included showing up and immediately unpacking the truck and sorting the merchandise. I didnt work there very long. I ended up coming down with sever bronchitis and was unable to work. I handed them orders from my doctor but they said doctors notes don't matter and they had to let me go. Needless to say I wasnt very happy about the way I was terminated.
bad,"There is plenty of micromanagement going on with this place if that's what you're into. Some of the managers aren't the nicest or most tactful people to work around. If you're into high stress with little pay and no raises then this is the place for you, especially during busy seasons."
bad,"they don't care about you. I really wanted to form a union! Do not work in laurel, md burlington. dont do it. dont do it. you will regret it."
bad,"unorganized , managers don't listen to your needs everyone there is taking for granted. There is alot of changes and were not notified about them"
bad,"I would not advise anyone to work there. The management didn't care for the employees. I worked there for six months, and constantly asked for more houres, but never got them."
bad,The management doesn't know anything about running a store.. schedules are always messed up by the management then the employees gotta figure out how they're going to make it work cause they won't fix it for you! If u are a young person looking for a temp job while going to school than maybe it is for u but idt it's worth the stress for the pay and headache they cause their employees they sure over work people
bad,"Clothes, everywhere, always, & without hesitation the staff wont care to assist you. Whether new or a customer. Auburn hills is the worst because they only care about what CEO thinks, not the people under them. Nothing changes for the better."
bad,"They lied about my pay, and played games to try to keep me working for them. The pay stinks... one week I cleared $60. Also, the management was very unprofessional. A ""stinker"" of a job to say the least. I genuinely do not recommended this place for a job unless you like making well under $140 a week while waking up at 5am 4 days a week and burn gas to do something. Nice close, funky work life."
bad,"I worked one shift. One. The store STAYS a mess and they do not hire enough people to work. I didnt even get a break!!! Now... I know I only worked one day but here is what really made me angry. I had a family member who passed away, one who had been sick and I was the one caring for them. I called to inform them I wouldn't be in to work due to death in the family. I had to take care of arrangements and ensure my other family members were taken care of. I told them that. The manager I talked to said, ""I mean, you're scheduled to work this week"". I was shocked. I explained the situation again and they said, ""well you're on the schedule so what do you wanna do?"" I said well keep me off permanently. Rude! And I didn't go back! They pay minimum wage too... don't waste your time."
bad,"job was very unprofessional and unorganized, managment team was strict on its employees especially the pregnant ones, they wouldnt let employees take their breaks/have water"
bad,"typical day at work , full of repetition. unclean environment. management inefficient. co workers weren't friendly . no sense of teamwork. bad job."
bad,this was a cool place to work however they pay of $8.50 cents is not worth it to me so i left after a month. I just dont see value in a company that starts off employee at 8$ and 50 like really  this billion dollar company is all it can afford ha.
bad,dont care about employees unorganized just horrible scheduling horrible told them when i got hired needed off for a week still had me scheduled n they said i had 3 no calls no shows after repeatedly leaving notes and telling them i needed off n never missed a day before then
bad,"For starters you work around 12-20 hours a week as a part time employee because thats basically all they hire,the full-time positions are offered only to employees that have been there for a while. A typical shift is 3-4 hours and they expect the work of someone who had been there 6-8 hours, its even worse if theres a visit from corporate then they'll really work you, they'll make you stay until late and you'll think ""yeah it sucks im tired i wanna go home but this is good right cause more hours = more money"", WRONG you'll get a call/text from a manager asking you to come in 1-2 hours later the next time you have a shift so theres that, also the management is HORRIBLE they're incredibly disorganized. Personally most of my co-workers were really cool except for the NCOs and head cashiers they were rude and stuck up. The most difficult part of the job though is that if youre on the sales floor you have an entire department to take care of plus most of the time youre also a back-up cashier which makes it difficult to finish your work leaving the store a mess and unhappy managers, my advice is only apply here as a LAST alternative."
bad,"The Burlington I worked for treats its workers like scum. Its ghetto and the management there sucks. The manager cant even run the store correctly. The employees themselves were not too bad, it was mostly the management. They were ignorant and trashy. They thought it was fun to mess with your hours and your pay check. I would NOT recommend working for Burlington Coat Factory! Save yourself the stress and aggravation and find yourself a better paying job and somewhere that will actually treat you like a human-being."
bad,"poor scheduling (short hours & poor pay), poor management in training new hires. no notice given on change of schedules. lack of communication all around, with register work and floor/stock work."
bad,This was an ok job if you were starting out from high school. I didn't see thsi as a career but just a get by to pay bills. I met great people thru out working here.
bad,"horrible bosses. The managers are very rude, they dont pay their employees ontime or when their sopposed to. They short peoples checks and then dont want to fix the problem."
bad,This company make sure that all employees other that management  are kept on minimal hours so that the company can save money on overtime pay and insurance payouts.
bad,Only part time hours. Pay not good at all. Managers talk to you any kind of way to only be making enough to buy lunch. I only recommend working there if you a college student looking for a little extra cash.
bad,"Was over worked and expected to never sit down, managers would scream at workers and be rude to customers. Openly made fun of, by managers and supervisors. Unprofessional."
bad,"Burlington is a Company that doesn't care about there Employees. You work four hours a day for only 16 hrs a week. While Manager exceed more than 40 hrs a week but does absolutely NOTHING. "
bad,"I started about 4 months ago in shipping and receiving, I open, ticket, hang, and sensor clothes for 4 hours with 1 15 minute break. The supervisor has no people skills what so ever. She barks over and over c'mon c'mon there's more to do and every single day we walk back there she says ""we have 9 bins to get through"". We had 5 day before we couldn't get through what makes her think with lazy, talkative 18-20 year olds that can't seem to work and talk at the same time we are not getting through 9. Oh ya as she literally stands there doing nothing, not 1 thing. She won't help and not 1 kid out there respects her so they work even slower because she barks. She's never happy, never jokes or laughs to try and lighten the mood. They just don't understand that if moral is sour, and it is believe me, that by taking music away, yelling at us for talking and laughing, and new rule..depending on day, we can't move more than 4 feet from where we are working and they need to know if we run to bathroom. I feel like I should raise my hand to ask for bathroom pass. The store manager is around off and on kinda, but useless like the supervisor. They also have a new way of doing things faster and it might actually help, but then again it actually needs to be done more than 1 day. The only days they do it is when district managers are coming and act like we should know how to do it right. They wonder why district manager gets mad cuz we get nothing done, it's because of the way things are done, what they let people get away with,  and the system they are ""suppose"" to use. Biggest thing that would"
bad,Upper management is very unprofessional they care more about gossip and hear say and think its ok to mistreat employees.  There pay is far to low for the amount of hours you work they expect you to work at all times up to 15 hours a day and don't care if you have a family to take care of. Overall this company F'n blows!!!
bad,management doesnt care about their employees they just get over on people. they over work people to where they quit and they fire the best people over small situtations that could be resovled. they also do not take harrassment seriously but they will make a small situation a bigger promblem. human resource department are ALWAYS making tons of mistakes with pay and paperwork
bad,Staff was great. Regional team needs to work together and get on the same page. Each regional member gave different direction.
bad,theres never enough people on the schedule and they will not let you receive more than 25 hours a week if you haven't worked there for years. or if you don't have years of experience of retail somewhere else.
bad,Open cashier & customer service counters.  Process all customer returns & layaways. Provided conflict resolution to our customers that were not satisfied.
bad,"As a Customer Service Supervisor, Management understaffed the Front End and therefore, I was at the cash register 95% of the time. "
bad,Management talks down to associates and is extremely disrespectful and rude. Loss prevention plays favorites and is always trying to get certain associates in trouble. The store manager does the schedule the day before the week starts and treats everyone like they're 5 years old.   Everything in the store is falling apart and looks terrible.  The customers are all hoodrats who destroy the store. Everyone is out to get you. The store can't keep associates and everyone calls out all the time so it is constantly understaffed.
bad,"The citadel mall location is a horrible place to work. You are not a valued employee in this store. They continue to hire people even though they do not have enough hours to give the people already employed. Some people who have been on the team for years are only getting to work 2 to 3 days a week. Management falling apart, no employee care, horrible scheduling, not flexible, overall a terrible place to work."
bad,Management is not organized. They do not care about you as a person. They have a high turn over rate. 6 other people left there the same week I did.
bad,"typical workplace"
bad,"My typical day at work involving "
bad,This place is so unprofessional. I learned money management/handling and order. Everyone kind of does their own things and everyone thinks their the boss
bad,my first job. management was okay but did things their way not the right way. i was closing up the kitchen and had no business doing it because my supervisor wanted to leave early.
bad,"Management does not care about personal life or balance. "
bad,"Worked for this company for over 10 years. Was a great, caring company at one point. However, they were bought by Bain Capital, which was their end. Multiple large layoffs after that point, with remaining employees supposed to pick up slack for all the people layed off. Employees were treated like power tools at that point that management felt they could just use up until worn out, and then just toss aside for new tool."
bad,"Like my co workers, like how easy it was and the 45min lunches but hours are a struggle pay is low and managment is bad. You really have to watch your check they will short you."
bad,Burlington has no associate loyalty. Requires world class customer service with gas station pay.There's pretty much nothing to learn from Burlington.
bad,Burlington is not a good place to work for any person in any walk of life! Do too much for absolutely nothing. You get fired or let go if Burlington is not number one priority. It takes all of your time and energy.
bad,this job was very unpleasant . the staff is nice but everything else is just a joke. You can barely make enough money to survive there and the hours are terrible.
bad,"Great company to work for."
bad,"the management needs help ALOT of help, they do not know how to treat their employees fairly, there is alot of favoritism here. i liked working with the employees i just did not appreciate how the management here would literally try and put an employee against other employers."
bad,"As an sales associate i learned alot of things working for burlington coat factory i manage to help out in every department,mark down tags,help with inventory,ect i got along with all of my co-workers, managers as well the hardest part of my job was getting the hang of the register, what i most enjoyed about this job was getting along with my co-workers because we have to make sure the customers see that this store have respect for them as well as our selves"
bad,on a typical day we make sure everything in our department is clean for our customers to shop and feel comfortable in our store.
bad,I would not recommend that job for anyone. If you want them to use you and not be able to move up in that company then go work for them
bad,"Bad place, no training the store in savannah ga has been open 8 years and has had 6 store managers and countless turn over in other managers and employees.The regional team is bad no communication the store manager walked out on his shift it was me and another manager we worked through christmas and then inventory. we had other managers that came from other stores to help some were great but they all had different ways of doing things. so this guy nick comes down from atlanta with the new store manager we were never told about and just rips us apart for all that we havent done.Picture this two managers running a almost 9 million dollar store the busiest season we were 15 plus people under staffed going into this no store manager and at the end of it all we just sucked per nick and upper managers.oh and no training regional said they didnt realize we new so little. really? So whos fault is it that you dont know your job either and where your store is at with people open positions and training.some regional team! ,run,run do not apply."
bad,"Did not enjoy the experience at all. No hours, management is horrible,no great communication from them whatsoever and no guarantee if you get a regular store position. If you get this seasonal position, use it as a gap job, you'll make a little bit of money but you'll be able to have time to find another place to work."
bad,"I worked there for a year. The managers did not take their jobs seriously, always goofed off and didn't appreciate the employees at all. They showed no sympathy and constantly talk bad about one another. I would advise all who try to apply to Burlington to just move on. Even when you are desperate. This is not a job. You will end up getting 9 hour weeks and constantly be looked down upon. It ended up getting to the point where i was angry the moment i walk into the store. This company is not a good company"
bad,"Plenty of room for advancement because they'll offer you a promotion after only 2 weeks of working there! Because of this, no one ever really knows much about the products they're pushing. Management is rude and very unprofessional. Horrible place to work, wouldn't recommend it to my enemy."
bad,A typical day at work was easy going and assisting customer's while shopping made me feel as if I was shopping as well. I learned how to communicate sanitary procedures to unsanitary unpleasant customers
bad,"inventory, merchandising, organizing."
bad,My experience in working for Burlington Stores involves a lot of days of being over worked and completely underpaid. I do a lot for the company and have entirely too much experience to be this unhappy with this company.
bad,I learned a lot about how management should not run things during my time there.  So I guess for that it was a great learning experience on how not to do things so all in all I am glad to have had it.
bad,a typical day at work as a sales associate is restocking merchandise and assisting customer locate merchandise.
bad,"Very nice den you 10% of discount if employed, the managers are good people in question but very distracted personal organizing for hire. I went to work and it took 2 weeks on and give me my schedule was only part-time with minimum wage of 7.25, The truth is unfair for making me tired to work done one time 7.25 With 18 hours a week. Personnel, and some are bad people envious do not leave well prepare your work."
bad,No structure at all. You are thrown into the job with no tour or training at all. supposed to leave at 9:30 pm yet you have to clean everyone elses department so you leave at 1am
bad,"unorganized,management has all different ideas,dirty store loss prevention needs to shower,management does not care about employees"
bad,"No benefits/horrible pay. It was beyond unprofessional. The management was ok, but the employees were horrible."
bad,"a typical work day is busy  time consuming "
bad,"Don't waste your time.  Do not apply.  If you want to work without air conditioning in over 100 degree weather.  Or if you get sick or go to the hospital,  they give you ""points"" and then they fire you after your 90 day probation period.  Compete waste of time and energy."
bad,I learned to not put all your hope into management. They do not communicate with you and do not reward or mention those who are hard working.
bad,"Typical day was coming in, gather around to listen to the receiving manager give you a whole bunch of lies and listening to the receiving supervisor lie along with the receiving manager. The associates always are loud and cursing and talking about you behind your back."
bad,"This is the WORST employer I've EVER worked for."
bad,"Hours wasn't great, they take advantage of you, the pay isn't great at all thought they would pay more then I'm getting due to they say competitive pay but no way. I would never work there again. The managers wasn't all that great either. I did so much there and they did not appreciate anything I did."
bad,the store manager was always in a crappymood she was rude and was not pleasant at all . i will never work their again  !
bad,"I was working another full time job that I was soon to get benefits from; Burlington Coat Factory built me up and entised me to quit they other job and ""open"" my schedule to them in order to obtain benefits.  However, I worked every shift imaginable....but then they sent me home anywhere from 15 min to 2+ hours early....because of this I was not able to get health benefits.  "
bad,Worst job in history. I advise anyone looking for a job not to go there management sucks. You will not be treated with respect there.
bad,"Work consisted of a regular routine. It'd be rare to have done something different. I was usually on the floor making sure things were organized, clean, and where they were suppose to be. I also help put new merchandise out. At times I was told to go to the basement and just help throw out boxes if no one was available."
bad,Wrongful Termination. It was busy everyday I came in to wotrk
bad,The management is horrible. Some of the people in management positions do not deserve to be in their position. They all crack under pressure. Customer service is horrible and some of the employees are not mindful of the customers.
bad,This Job was the worst employment I have ever had. Some people in their were ok but this job was truly the definition of no structure. The employees were very rude and took very long lunches and breaks not considering the other employees that had to wait on them to get back. Everything was unprofessional about BCF and I was happy to leave.
bad,"Bad pay long hours and discord among work life, not very content over all."
bad,didn't like this place store was dirty. management didn't care.
bad,Horrible  no advancement no raises i did not like working here and would never work here again
bad,had a problem with the mangers and how the ran the store worst job ever never will i ever work there again
bad,"Overworked managers, regional team has limited accountability and integrity."
bad,"I worked there for 4 years, worst time ever. The store manager called me and my team stupid and incompetent in many occasions.  The area managers talk mad gossip about the employees personal life to other employees.  Raises were inly 13 cents a year (that is if you got one). When I got the receiving supervisor position they refused to send me out for training saying that there wasn't any time.  I had to learn my position in the busiest season of retail (Christmas) by calling other stores and talking to other receiving supervisors. You can only be called stupid so many times, I just had to leave."
bad,"I've learned a whole lot when I first started working at retail , I've learned how to work under pressure , how to channel the customers emotions like anger for example. Not only did I learn for my bosses and co-workers but also learned from the customers. The customers helped me shine the most by sharing their experiences , educating me about the merchandise and that right their alone just helps me serve the customers a whole lot better. I believe if u talk to a customer properly and confidently then their shouldn't be any problems. The hardest part of the job I would have to say is when you're doing most of the work and most of the co-workers are doing half effort or call out on u on a busy day.. and that forces u to worry more and deal with more responsibility but in the end I take it as a learning experience because we all have to learn how handle situations like that. The most enjoyable part of any job would be the co-workers and even the bosses. Not all of them are cool  for whatever reason but their must be some level of respect.. we must always be professional no matter if u love or hate you're co-workers. Mostly though I never had any issues with my bosses or co-workers because I always had a smile on my face. :)"
bad,"My manager showed favortism to a lot of cow-workers"
bad,"Horrible pay, they will tell you 8 dollars an hour is too much even though you will be working hard, no use on trying to advance because the pay is basically the same no matter where you work. The scheduling is horrible they will change your schedule constantly even after its posted not let you know and you still will get written up for it. They will try to screw you over on your breaks especially if you close. The discount isn't worth it unless you have a second job. The hours are horrible there is no way to make it on the low pay and few hours. Don't get use to the people you work with everyone quits unless they really need this job."
bad,"horrible place to work, employees were all so miserable, management was not the best either."
bad,"Do not work here , well the one in Inglewood that is , They don't care about your life they hire who they think is young and dumb and will be happy with 8 to 10 hours per week . You are over worked and clearly underpaid . Management is horrible , I've never seen a bunch of lazy upper management in my life, I mean seriously these managers just sat and the office and stuffed their faces leaving their duties and our duties to the regular employees . 2nd level management didn't do anything either but talk about stuff not related to the job . They don't care about your life , this store is filthy and unorganized. Breaks are short IF you even get a break . pay will never go above 8 dollars and there is no room for growth at all so don't even bother ."
bad,This part time job makes you feel that there is no job advancing opportunity.
bad,The work atmosphere at Burlington Coat Factory was very unprofessional. The management team could not agree on anything. Everybody wanted to be the boss and no one wanted to listen and take responsibility for things that needed to be done.
bad,typical day at work come in unload the merchandise stack em and scan them in tag clothes and shoes with sizes and sensors if needed one of the supervisors was very racist bad mouthed me a lot in spanish because he knew i could not understand what he was saying
bad,"Working there was ok "
bad,They work you to the bone. If you don't tell them that you have a limit they will try to work you to death. I learned absolutely nothing but how to keep Burlington's merchandise off of the floor. There is no organization or leadership in any of the locations I've been to. The co-workers are just people who want a pay check most of them are just worn out by the job and have given up any hope for advancement.
bad,"management had no concern for the workers. They would never advocate for you. "
bad,No advancement waste of time. Ppl steal all the time not a safe place to work.
bad,"I have never been so miserable at a job in my whole entire life, before I worked for this company. You are over worked and definitely under paid for all the work they expect you to do. BCF could care less about you its about BCF. Corporate on down are terrible. If u are desperate for a job this is the place for you...just kidding.. This job is for teenagers who have no responsibilities."
bad,This is not a place anyone should want to work unless you were in desperate need of a job. The managers treat you like nothing and they aren't willing to work with people. This is a very unhealthy work environment for anyone. They don't give the proper training needed to get the job done and they always compare your work to others who are not in the same retail environment.
bad,Yet It was a great job you were under a lot of work with little pay.
bad,terrible place to work. They uses the employee with underpay. They dont take care of their employees
bad,Very bad ethics. No room for advancement. Managers make you do too much for minimum wage.Would not even give one star if that was an option.
bad,"the company only care about the bottom dollar every year i was there there was always new corporate people always changing process no consistancy, and always new managers at the store level cause the  managers always threw everyone under the bus and took no responsability. They say good pay but minimum wage is what it is. WORSE JOB EVER!!!"
bad,"i currently work for Burlington and this is my opinion. the managers we have are horrible. they dont care about any body but themselves. the associates are not respected everything is our fault. under staff horrible raises the pay is horrible. i'm currently full time but is looking for a better job. if the company and managers would show more respect i would stay . at my store we are losing people left and right cause of their attitude. SOMETHING NEEDS TO CHANGE!!!!"
bad,"Managers are never around,employees wonder off and pay was poor"
bad,"Started there an it was great always talked with everyone an everyone wanted to help you . They gave you hours every week to hell you out with training , but they start cutting your hours from 30-35 to 12-18 . Horrible management , unprofessional company , never was trained right , poor store never is clean an always associates fault. Head manager shouldn't be in the position at all ."
bad,My experience at Burlington was great but I do have to say the the management there was out of control. they showed favoritism and discriminated!
bad,This was the worst work experiences I have ever had in my 25 years in the customer service filed.
bad,I was there for 3 years and never got a raise. Marked down many different products.
bad,"enjoyed working with the public,some employees not very "
bad,I definitely enjoyed wotking with my co workers. Management was horrible they had a lack of communication that seeped thru to the coworkers which made for alot of complaints everyday. I definitely miss my coworkers though they made it worth coming into work everyday.
bad,The managers are unorganized and they show no respect. Low pay.
bad,thow they have great layways an clothes the management sucks they dont care bout employees or the hours they give out...And the company has changed hands so many times..due to bankrupty issues..
bad,"Unmotivated co-workers, management and the rest of the store team.  Unable to work around personal schedule"
bad,"When I first started working there, it was nice. I enjoyed the people I worked with. One of the downfalls about retail is if they dont reach their goals in sales, hours get cut. So youre being over worked to fit the needs of the store and not really getting paid enough or getting the right amount of hours. I went from working 28 hours a week to 16 hours a week. Two days! Management went down the drain, every time I turn around there is a new manager. New managers have the experience but they dont have the knowledge of the stores need. So youre dealing with clueless new managers. The store was just trash. It was hard keeping burlington clean. Customers come in and destroy the store. Clothes and shoes everywhere. It was depressing working around a filthy store and then being expected to clean it up. I thank god I dont have children and real responsibilities like rent and major bills or I would have struggled... Nice store to shop, but worse place to work. For my two years of suffering, I stay away from working for retail stores!"
bad,"I have enjoyed nothing about my experience at Burlington Coat Factory, the only reason I have stayed is because they work with my school schedule. "
bad,"the management is horrible, they treat the employee's and coustomers disrespectfully. I dont understand how burlington coat factory still is able to be open for buisness. i have gotten hurt while on the job and they told me to work faster. also management has sexual relations with the employees. just not right. the corporate doesn't know anything about running a buisness they just want MONEY AND DONT CARE FOR THE EMPLOYEES  struggles and works hard daily to make the company money. never will work or refer anyone to burlington coat factory."
bad,"Love working with the customers!"
bad,"This used to be a fun placed to work, but the company's greed causes them to constantly change things that will help them (them as in the corporate high-ups) fill their pockets, but screw over those working at the store level. You'll find store associates doing the jobs of 3 or 4 associates because of lack of payroll, but being paid the wage of one person, customers not able to find help, once again, due to lack of payroll, and hardworking associates being taken advantage of and run into the ground by management. There is absolutely little opportunity for advancement. You might move around to several positions, but very rarely will you move up, and if you do, it won't be very hard. Don't expect to be management unless you have years and years of retail experience and a related degree. You get a review once a year and will receive an extremely miniscule raise at that time. One of my co-workers revealed to me they have been there 5 years and barely makes $0.50 more than their starting wage. The hardest part of this job is following company policies as you're supposed to only to get in trouble for doing so when a customer is unhappy with it. Management will not back you up whatsoever. Schedules are supposed to be done by a computer system with fine-tuning by management, however, management practically overrides the computer's scheduling. Hours aren't allocated by skill level, as they are supposed to, but by the management's personal feelings. Anything short of having an open availability will make sure you barely have hours for the week, although the company boasts ""flexible scheduling."""
bad,I loved the fact that I got to meet new people everyday. I am able to put a smile on my customer face! There were things I did not agree on with the way managment handled conficts.
bad,Management completely sucks and the hours they give you are horrible. Definitely not a place to work if you're looking for some place to work to pay bills. You'd be homeless. Sorry Burlington but you have great product but sucky service and associates with attitudes.. they hire anyone to work there.The pay suck as well
bad,"I worked for Burlington for a couple of years at the El Paso store on the westside!It was terrible the management didnt care nothing about you. Always disrepecting you in manyways. VERY LAZY managers theyt sat on their behind all day giving orders on the phone, Instead of talking face to face Alot of work not enough employees,Very low pay that u couldnt pay bills. They would give u 15 cent raise that took forever to get. But the goodthing was the associates they were very nice and sweet. We were all a big family. The only thing that kept me there so long was them. We were all stressed out. But we stayed cause it was a job. But if we had a better job offer somewhere else we would jump on it! But i will NEVER go back to that hell hole. They really know how to stress u out. Its like you have all this energy at first then u lose your energy cause the enviroment. Receiving is a danger zone. Somebody should call Osha on them . Also there is no benifits for you. Nobody is fulltime and u will NEVER grow in this company!"
bad,The hardest part od the job was getting the customers to leave happy if they came in with a bad mind set but i managed to pull through and make them leave with a smile on their face
bad,it was an awful place to work. work was hard and not enough pay. turn over was crazy. management didnt seem to care about the employees. most of my coworkers were unhappy there.
bad,"No pros discount is only 10% which covers just sales tax, over worked for low pay, and horrible management. Good luck if you close"
bad,"I hated this job. It's completely unorganized. You have to work really hard for very little pay. My hours are great, however. Management is poor. Worked many retail jobs but none as horrible as this."
bad,Terrible place to work.Wouldn't recommend it to anyone.Over worked and underpayed.Not appreciated.Never told thankyou for hard work that was being done but instead punished for everyone elses failure to do there job.
bad,"Burlington Coat Factory was an interesting place to work. The hours were usually long or really short. Sometimes the number of hours that were schedule did not seem enough or were what seemed like to much at a time. It was hard to keep the front cleaned,while managing others that did not clean well after themselves or their customers. More then a few of the associates would not complete their jobs that needed to be completed to take care of others jobs."
bad,"If you are a student in college or highschool or if you want a good paying job, DO NOT APPLY HERE."
bad,"very bad Company Values, radical problems in store."
bad,"Wasn't worth my time, the hours were horrible employees were not appreciated"
bad,Not good place. Management will throw you under bus. Don't give you days off you need. Talk to associates any kind of way. Management is always changing. Since I been there had about 6 store managers. Not good place.
bad,"Customers are often very rude and impatient, especially if its something out of your control. They also complain about the cashiers and sales associates being slow physically. Customers often pick damaged items that have been returned to stock and try to get an extra discount even after its been marked down. Co-workers are petty and often complain. Even if they've been there for years. Management is unorganized and unprofessional. They also show favortism. And are very often rude to customers. They let customer service return anything and return it to stock. The comapny overall is ok if you don't have any other options. The best part i guess is getting the employee discount and they have the layaway option. The worst would be all of thee above!! I've been hired twice and still get the same pay per hour!!"
bad,nothing about this job was fun.the people are rude the management are very unorganized.
bad,Needs more employees for better customer services. They have overtime that is not paid and low payment
bad,"I have run the stock room for over 3 yrs, and have never seen such lack of comuncation between levals of management in my professional career. From building teams and exceptions to weekly goals this store/company is a joke."
bad,"“A minimum wage paying, slave-driving company with (unattainable) quotas, over-worked employees with a high dose of sugar-coated, ineffective moral boosting management sprinkled on top.”"
bad,"poor teamwork, division within departments as well as among the management team."
bad,If you get a loss prevention job they make you were a vest most of your shift and you look so obvous that they will laugh at you.....
bad,"I enjoyed working with the staff, learned many management skills that I can take with me to my next place of employment, co workers were very hard working, Management relied on the staff to accomplish tasks that challenged them.BCF had employed very tallented people in the retail field,Many fond memmories."
bad,A typicial day consist of bending over all day picking up clothes off the floor. I have learned that a dirty store is a problem store. The most enjoyable part of the day was going home at the end of the day. However they have now since cleaned up and redid the whole store..It is much cleaner now.
bad,"Hours lack, pay is minimal. However, a typical day is always busy. There are always projects to do such as putting out new merchandise and making new walls for display. The best part about retail is giving great customer service and working in such a diverse environment."
bad,i enjoy working at burlington however everday is a learning experience.
bad,"They make you were a vest , and they pay really bad...Not a big fan of this company . Basically you are spotted right away and it becomes difficult for people to take you seriously when you stop them...."
bad,Loved working there but didn't last long. Laid me off before my 90 day review.
bad,"No growth potential, terrible management, too little hours, and little pay"
bad,don't waste your time. you can find something better
bad,Your over worked not compensated enough not appreciated being yelled and screamed at for every little mistake being rushed being sent home if production is low or being over worked if production is high ever since they got new management it was all down hill the old manager was transfer'd to another store now that manager was great and appreciated every single employee but now its horrible place to work.
bad,"This could have been a good place to work if not for too many chiefs and way to few indians.This is a very micro-managed company, which makes it very difficult to understand the priorieties. The things I was told when hired were much different after work begun. A weeks training is a joke, which by the way turned out to be two days. Way to few employees to accomplish the many plans they had. Impossible to accomplish the tasks plus provide the customer service that they wanted with the number of employees that were there. And, it was always your fault. An 80 hour work week would probably be enough to keep your head above water."
bad,"I wouldn't recommend this company to anyone. Very, very, very, very, very un-organized, and very inconsiderate. Your training should be four weeks but they push you through it in one week."
bad,"I, like many in the managerial staff, was over used and underpaid."
bad,There is no room for advancement and there are no guaranteed hours
bad,Hated every minute of every day working for this company. Would not even shop there again.
bad,"I worked here for 4 years and only received less than a $1 in raises. I worked hard for this company and they did nothing to show me that I was worth something to them, moving me from one department to the next and never actually listening to what I really wanted. And then when they told me I couldn't have a supervisor job/manger job because one was not available they moved me departments and then created the position that I was looking for and gave it to someone they just hired with no experience. Not a great company to work for."
bad,This is an unorganized company. Advancement in technology is needed within the organization. The management style needs improvement. Culture of the organization is horrible. Customers throw merchandise on the floor and nothing is done about it. The workers spend their time picking clothes off the floor than selling items to customers.
bad,"The one I worked for, the management did not co-inside with supervisors so that it was a sucessful business,"
bad,"horrible work environment. turn over high, bad management, no training,"
bad,Really bad place to work at. Supervisors and store manager stand around talking  about the employees. You’re always getting threatened to get fired if you’re not working as fast as they please. Extremely unprofessional! The back supervisor would show up to work with marks on her neck she wouldn’t bother covering up. Hours are really really bad and the pay is much worse. I tried helping a coworker out and the store manager said and I quote “ don’t be helping him this is not a place for team effort focus on yourself “ pretty sad
bad,"Management is the worst, they are rude and treat their employees like garbage. Do not work for Burlington.  Management will make you feel unappreciated."
bad,"Please do not get your hopes to high in this company. Pay is not fair, management is so bad, and opportunities of advancement are very low. Lots of favoritism and supervisor are not fully prepared."
bad,I helped them set the entire store up while working there. Only being paid $9 a hour and Management is completely disoriented. Very unprofessional and won’t understand their younger employees in scheduling regarding school or other activities.
bad,If you are not part of the management click you will be pushed out! If you have been there for years they will try to get rid of you because 'you make to much money' for your job title
bad,"Been with the company for 3 years. I've seen more employees leave than I can remember their names. Hard working people leave because management plays favoritism. They will use you and wear you down. The managers will tell at associates in front of other employees and customers. They don't care, they constantly are ""over payroll"" and they ""don't make their goals"" some of the people are really nice and you can talk to them outside of work and make friends with. Some people are just rude"
bad,My location where i work is soooooo unprofessional.. The managers except one are very lazy unprofessional shows favouritism towards certain employees which is not appreciated.. Store is so unorganized.. They cant keep employees because lack of professionalism.. Other associates talk about other associates and managers thinks it ok but it is very messy and ignorant. Im very Fed up!
bad,"Dont work at Burlington in West Allis Milwaukee, WI. The company don’t want to give the employees hours, paychecks be short, and The employees is not friendly."
bad,Burlington in Dedham wasn't that bad but they don't really care about theirs employee how could someone can survive with 12 dollars per hour for a part-time job this is ridiculous...
bad,"I had previously been employed at Burlington for more than a two and half years . I was the go to person, for every department for call offsets etc. New store manager taken me off schedule slowly due to my pt availability conflicting schedule. On the mangers behalf, not mines. The lack of hours, force me into seeking more hours, after expressing to management that I needed hours!"
bad,"If you are looking for a job, please apply to Mcdonalds/walmart first. They pay more and its less of a work compared to Burlington. I worked there for two years and I regret me staying there for so long."
bad,Favoritism every where. Only got 4 hours a week while others who had the same job got 24hr a week when there was “no hours”. Do not apply here if you have a family or bills.
bad,i do not know after i left. When i was there pay was low and schedule changes every two weeks. the store manger takes time of as needed assistant managers do not take time off.
bad,"Loved my job, loved my co-workers, still do, disappointed that management support was zero. Management positions should be based on experience and people skills, and not who you know at corporate.corporate."
bad,"Working at Burlington was a grade A pain in my butt. It was absolutely horrible and I would never recommend this job to anyone. There is no communication whatsoever, everyone is rude, and you get paid $10 an hour to deal with it all. It got so bad that I would make myself sick even thinking about going to work. At the store I worked at we had 4 full time people walk out, and 5 part timers walk out If that doesn’t tell you something I don’t know what will. The receiving supervisor was only hired on because she knew the general manager and she had no prior retail experience. The general manager said she had retail experience but didn’t even know what a compactor was. The receiving supervisor was trained 3+ weeks at a different store and still didn’t know how to do a dam* thing. We had 2 new people that started working with us and she didn’t even train them. Didn’t even try! They were putting everything in the wrong places, throwing clothes into the wrong bins, it was just a mess. But, guess who fixed it.. that’s right I did. We were also doing the GOH rails (garments on hangers) and the new girls had been sensoring them wrong so I brought it up to the supervisor and she told me to leave it and nott to worry about it. What kind of supervisor sees something wrong and leaves it! This place was an absolute nightmare and I’m just scratching the surface. DO NOT WORK HERE!!"
bad,"Worked for this company for almost 5 yrs in a management position. Started out at one store, which was amazing. Great atmosphere, store manager and associates were long term and felt like family. I was really happy, until they asked me to transfer to another location in the same city. Had always heard terrible stories of this other store, so was not excited about going there. It also doubled my drive time to get there. When I got there, the store was a nightmare, the store manager was a nightmare, rarely showed for work, and his associates all took after him. Next store manager came and this one was worse. Regional management could have cared less. It was the problem store and nobody liked it. I sadly ended my career there, I chose to leave. I would not recommend working here. At least the store I was moved too."
bad,Every manager quit during my employment except for the head supervisor. Employee's do not quit a company they quit a manager. Starting pay is very low but responsibilities multiply rapidly.
bad,I can't think of one good thing to say about working there. When you are the new person you are blamed for everything even if it had nothing to do with you. I was there for six months and it didn't get any better. Staff was rude from the beginning and never talked to me unless there was something they wanted to blame me for. I felt like I couldn't do anything without getting yelled at.
bad,"The manager cares more about getting their lashes done, going to Chick-fil-A and any other appointment they can squeeze in during work hours. There is always missing money and when you start to question it, suddenly you are the bad guy. There is way"
bad,Was verbally humiliated by Assistant manager daily when working with her was also sexually harrased by store manager often. It became so bad that I had to put my two weeks in. Don't bother calling human resources the store manager and assistant manager protect one another. Best advice have an attorney on standby seriously. If corporate only knew.
bad,"However, their hands were tied to company policies which were NOT employee-friendly.  It wasn't about people at all.  It was about how much the store brought in each day.  Their goals were decided by how much had been brought in by the same store the previous year, regardless of whether that day of the month had landed on a Holiday the year before.  It made no sense at all. "
bad,After working for them for 5 1/2 years I still made less them most other retail stores starting pay. Management at Green Bay location is horrible since January.
bad,"They expect you to run multiple departments. And if you don't get what you're supposed to get done if you're full time you get in trouble. But expect you to so sstt for 2 hours a shift. Backup cashier, fitting room and still keep your department clean. And its impossible when your whole shift you have to be backup cashier. Because they only schedule 1 cashier at night time"
bad,"At first it was great to work there, that may have only been because the store was in the middle of moving from one store to another, so it was closed and consisted of setting up the store. As soon as the store opened and Christmas was over, hours were drastically cut to 12 hours a week. Although they expected you to get the same amount of work done in a 12 hour work week compared to a 30ish hour week. Management would tell you hours are coming next week, 3 months passed, no hours came, we instead recieved daily schedules, that we were to check each night to know if we were working for four hours the following day. Sometimes you would get there at 6, and they would ask you to stay longer at around 930( we got out at 10), and hold it against you when you didn't. All in all its a horrible place to work, the stress level is nowhere worth the pay."
bad,"This job sucks to work there management don't care about your personal needs they walk around like you owe them something,  do not work there if you need to pay bills otherwise you are going to need a second job."
bad,The management is poor and it’s trashy. The mangers are rude get smart definitely don’t work around your schedule. I recommend working at Towson but not Eastpoint. So
bad,"Worked for Burlington Store Savannah,Ga"
bad,"The manager left so had a new one that had no idea how to run a store. The mangers are like a click if one doesn't like you they all don't. I was fired from the store because I ran after a shop lifter even though I was loss prevention, that person was arrested and we got our product back. Same night another person ran out with stuff I got something back and the license plate to the truck and gave the information to the police but was fired because I went into the parking lot. After all this the new loss prevention officer who I trained went to my job that I was returning to in the same mall told them not to hire me because I was trying to steal from their store which wasn't true. Then after ALL that I went into to buy something and the same loss prevention officer was trying to kick me out even though I was buying something and doing nothing WRONG. The pay is low and it is a terrible place to work."
bad,Not much hours need a job with more hours and pay. I like to be on my feet they really do not care much for you or your issues you may have at home. But I need a better job this one is not working out for me or paying my bills.
bad,"I wouldn’t recommend to work here, some of the associates and managers are very rude when you ask for help, and you don’t get trained so you have to figure things out on your own. Some of the managers are lazy as well and they are just walking around talking on their cell phones.  On holidays it’s pretty busy and they don’t have enough people working so basically you have to do the whole store. That’s why they are always hiring because people don’t last working there.. And let’s not forget about the rude and messy customers that leave a mess and can’t put the items back where they belong."
bad,I’d give this no stars if it was an option. This store is disgusting! The staff and management are unprofessional they do not care about their customers or employees. The bathrooms are always out of order there’s been times that the toilet water from the bathrooms seeps through the floors to the men’s section. You can literally smell the bad sewage when you walk in there. There’s pieces of the ceiling falling in the women’s section. Overall the building is disgusting. Lines are always super long. They are severely understaffed. Working here is embarrassing I wouldn’t recommend this job to anyone. The management all talk and gossip about each other and can’t work as a team. Receiving department is especially terrible. If the supervisor doesn’t like you you don’t get hours. They purposely make your life a nightmare to make you leave. Don’t waste your time with us place.
bad,"Worst possible place to work at, even for people who are new to the working environment. Management staff treats those who have a lower position as them horribly but not to those who are FAVORITED. Will change your schedule days without informing you and will add points to your employee attendance sheet if you decide to show up or not; adding points no matter what your decision is. Managers get mad at you for mistakes you weren’t aware of for the lack of training that was supposed to be taught when you first started working there. Coworkers are okay, everyone has their own cliques. More of a “just do your job and go home” sort of thing."
bad,"This place is so unorganized and unprofessional. The manger has favorites and treats the employees like trash. The environment was always stressful and they only told us what we did bad on and what we need to fix; never when we do anything right. I hated coming to work, and the scheduling is wack. I told them I could not work certain days and they scheduled me for them anyway. The people here do not care about you. they just want your time."
bad,"A typical day at work is handling customers and new merchandise, to be put out on the departments floor. I learned how to manage fitting room. no hours hard part."
bad,"A typical day at work as a cashier was standing behind a register for 8 hours a day, doing typical customer service. I learned regular customer service skills, like running a register and customer service. The workplace culture between coworkers was friendly and fun. Between the employees and management, it was tense. The hardest part of the job was dealing with irate customers. Many of our customers didn't speak English very well and I don't know any other languages so the language barrier could be difficult to handle. The best part were my coworkers - they were awesome. "
bad,I worked there for about 4 months and this was my second job. Customers were rude 24/7 and management was never around to even help with anything. Nobody else would help you even at night time felt like I was basically doing my department by myself.
bad,As long as you did your job the managers were mainly in the office room or up at the registers. Just show up and do what you were supposed to do and that was it.
bad,"Burlington has changed dramatically over the years that I have worked here. In the beginning, not many tasks needed to be taken care. Everyone had their own separate roles to take care of by the end of their shift and that was all one had to worry about. Associates in the departments would take care of their areas and cashiers would help in ringing up purchases or returns or layaway's. The store now wants associates to help in departments, ring up customers, ask every customer for surveys in where sometimes the customer does not even care enough to hear or just want to leave after the transaction is done, and then if no surveys are completed; management and you will get blamed. Besides surveys, the store will look like a total mess because customers will take clothes off their hangars, look at it, then toss them on top of the racks; same with shoes and about everything in the store. In the end, you will have angry customers who don't know the policy no matter how many times you tell them, they will bicker about small stains and demand half off or fight with you because they swore the item they had was priced at 7.99 or cheaper from what it comes up onto the system. One last thing is when you need help from a manager, most of the time, despite what you learned and told the customer, the manager will give the customer the full right and please them with their purchase. Despite the policy, managers will ok things with angry customers and from your own knowledge; your knowledge on policy's is void and does not matter. I also have been falsely accused of stealing an item which I"
bad,"good place to work at. Nice people to work with but the hours are very bad, they promise you something different and when you start they give you something different"
bad,"a typical day at work would be to either open or close the store as an emergency keyholder, count/balance the safe, prepare cashier's register tills for daily operation. setup next day register tills, edit/submit employee payroll, post up next week employee work schedule, organize the breakroom per holiday season.  Run and audit register audit report and layaway report's. etc"
bad,I was just not happy there.  There were a lot of favorites played even down to what you could wear.  There were very few hours available and the pay was terrible.
bad,I hate the management. I hate the people that work there and I would not recommend anyone to work at this awful place ever. I was punished for getting fired for something my supervisor wanted me to do.
bad,"Certain managers are really close to supervisors and show favoritism to certain employees. Not enough hours, and are not really accepting of new associates. Awkward, judgmental, and your best is never enough. Demanding of even little things like, how you bag products and how many donations you receive. They look for anything wrong you do to lecture you on it. The awkward, unwelcoming environment is not worth the low pay and commute. You do receive a small discount and on certain days/holidays associates get bigger discounts; that really is the only perk of working here. You are better off working somewhere else overall."
bad,The management at the store sucks! I was located at the Burlington in downtown Silver Spring and it was dirty all the time! The employees here are disrespectful and inconsiderate. They were always on the phone while on the sales floor and the manager did nothing! I spoke with my manager a few times about my schedule being changed and she agreed to change it but never did. This Burington store sucks and I would NOT recommend this store to anyone!
bad,"The hiring manager is rude,arrogant, unprofessional,she's the reason why people quit, I don't know how she keep a job, I did like the job not some management."
bad,Poor management very unprofessional I would never work there again. If your looking for a stable job look somewhere else it’s a waste of time working for burlingtonstores
bad,was horrible working there horrible management alot of trash talk people didnt show up alot to much work given for so little pay breaks lasted like 5 minutes
bad,Burlington is a good company to work for but they need to concentrate on management witch is very poor. The management at the bronx location i worked at was very disrespectful at times and did not have a positive outlook on their employees. Was more like a slave plantation than a work environment.
bad,"We are always in a rush and it seems the less you work the less they expect from you. So if you are a hard working person, be prepared to carry the weight of all the other employees who get a free check courtesy of your hard work."
bad,Burlington does not care for their employees and lie o you about everything. Employees call off all the time and never get punished and the employees that are faithful and work hard always got the short end of the stick.
bad,"horrible, i hope no one ever has to work here. job is unprofessional, they hire anyone that walks in the door, you cant request off for anything, managers are clueless. dont work here"
bad,I worked at Burlington for Two months never had a weekend off and was always closing. They claim they have open door policy but when you go to address and issue with the managers they dont care. Poor scheduling and not enough staff and always left on your own and managers refused to help.
bad,"I worked for this company for 10 years and it's a true testament that you do what you must do until you are .  The company is accusatory they don't listen, they don't pay way, It's a poor excuse for management as well as those that are forced into overtime...with no say so..."
bad,I like working there but the hours and the low pay was killing me especially the management  staff sucked but i did love working with all my coworkers
bad,Mangement was horrible the head manger complained about how many days she worked. When hired there was no orientation at all.Manger makes a comment saying if she has to bring in other people they would do something about it.Just plain horrible to work for and have to wait 6 hours to get a lunch.
bad,Very unorganized and the most unprofessional workplace I've ever worked. The employee stole merchandise when I alerted the store mananger I was Told I could be fired for telling that I told.
bad,"its okay for a college or high school student since they only hire part time. its great for a 2nd job as well. the pay is $8.00 but moves up "
bad,"Can't trust management, it's like highschool with drama. No room to grow always understaffed because they can't keep anyone due to management and pay."
bad,"I worked at this location for almost two years in the beginning it felt like any other job. it was great. The hours for me were convenient. but as the months went by the managers began to show you their true colors. First, one thing that is definitely clear about this burlington in general is that they 100% dont value their employees. In their eyes we have no life. I say this because of the way ive experienced theyve treated my coworkers including me with pure disrespect. If you really want to know what its like to be disrespected become an employee here. The managers here do not take their own job seriously. Leave it to them to consistently make ""mistakes"" on schedules and call you on your days off (apparently, they are so lazy that they let the computer generate the schedule making). Leave it to them to constantly forget to not schedule you on days you asked them not to. They have very little interest in the environment and relationship the employees have with each other. It doesnt matter how many times you go to them for help for any kind of concern. All they will do is watch you talk. Not to mention they sure do love making inappropriate and unnecessary comments about their employees behind their backs. They think that just because theyve gotten along with a few employees in the store and make little secretive comments that these employees arent actually going to tell other employees in the store. Bottom line is..i wasnt going to leave this place without having the last laugh. I WOULD NEVER EVER recommend this place to anybody. This burlington has tainted me from the rest"
bad,"I loved doing the usual sorting, sizing, ticketing of merchandise. My problem with it was when I was interviewing and being hired, I was told I'd be working 6am to 3pm, Monday thru Friday. I wanted Monday/Tuesday for college but the manager refused to hire me unless I had those open availability so I caved in and opened them up. Truth is you never work more than 30 hours here. They are strict about that. No work Mondays and Wednesdays. You come in one day and the manager says you'll only work 2 hours. No point in waking up at 5am to work at 6am in the morning to work only 2 hours. I was never asked to stay extra hours even when I asked. One week I only worked 5 hours. There's no place for advancement in this location."
bad,"I worked here as a cashier and this store was a mess! I don't just mean in cleanliness either, management was all over the place as far as instructions were concerned. We had 3 main managers and they would all tell us that our main duties were something different every day, so I was never quite clear on what a typical day at work included. The hardest part of the job was definitely dealing with how unorganized the store was, so the lines were always backed up which made the cashiers look bad. An upside of working here would definitely be my co-workers. Although some were rude and unfriendly, most off them were really nice people who made the job enjoyable. Burlington as a company was pretty okay though. For the most part, I would say they cared about their employees. We got an additional 25% every month which definitely was an upside."
bad,Overworked. I hated it the manager was completely uneducated and they let me go after 2 months because they claimed it was seasonal which was never made clear.
bad,Very few chances to excel within the company. Management worries about management and leaves the associates with little to nothing to work with unless you are a full time employee.
bad,Horrible place to work bad hours management will fire you for anything issue if you call off including your first time no advancement in this company at all
bad,"it wasn't as fast paced as you would think, it was very disorganized and the management were not very nice. my supervisors were highly disrespectful to me. the hardest part of the job was standing, and lifting for 8 hours at a time."
bad,"a typical day at this place includes the managers giving you unrealistic expectations.. now the job is not hard at all when youve learned the ropes and all, but its ridiculous. the rules change ALL THE TIME. the managers threaten you when you say you can extend for a shift. lets say you are working a 9-1 shift, at 12:30 they will ask you to extend that day. that is not enough time for you to change plans. if they wanted you to work a longer shift they shouldve scheduled that. not asking last minute. when you say ""no i cant extend"" they threaten to change the department you work in so you work the hours they want you to work. also when minimum wage went up in california. they decided to give us longer lunches. you have to pay me more now, just kidding they decide to longer your lunches so they dont have too. this place is a joke and i dont recommend this place to anybody. i dont know how i stayed there for as long as i did. also this place is dirty, there are constant roaches and crickets and there were two baby snakes caught in one of the storage rooms. weve constantly told the managers that weve found bugs and roaches and they still havent done anything. it might sound like i am just bashing this company but its what ive seen heard and know about this place."
bad,"Used to be a fun and caring company but has fallen on hard times, and no longer care about employee engagement. Just the bottom dollar"
bad,"This is the only retail establishment that I have ever worked for that is not as  interested in sales growth.  The leadership at the regional and corporate level seem to prefer management by fear rather that to support an environment that is positive to work in.  As part of a three member management team, we moved our store from just under $6million to currently trend at $8.5million in less than two years.  This was cause for the store manager to be asked to take a step down and be replaced with someone that does not promote initiative at all."
bad,not very well maintained scheduling is horrible. not enough employees and will have you working till wee hours in the morning
bad,"Typically the management does not communicate well amongst each other and that leads to disorganization throughout the employee team.  The main manager is lazy and disrespectful to lesser ranking employees.  She holds over your head what little hours they do provide and she is very condescending.  The employees are nice though.  I learned that no matter how hard you try in this job you will only be given a certain amount of recognition, if any at all.  The hardest part of the job was remaining diligent when the managers all call you to perform their work duties as well as your own."
bad,"I worked there while in high school, I wasn't too impressed by the job. Especially when they wouldn't let me take off to attend my own high school graduation."
bad,"This was a wonderful place to work in the past before the company was sold. The new management is rotten to the CORE VALUES. Do not believe in the FALSE SMILES and the FALSE DREAMS. The management works you like slaves with a smile on their faces. They  will try to burn you out and quickly move on to the next piece of meat. "
bad,"My typical day at work is very busy and productive, I learned to organize and set tasks in order to complete them in a timely manner. Management were very open but can treat employees better and supervise them and advise or give tips on their job, didn't receive proper training so I had to ask a lot around, it was definitely the hardest part, I got used to being on my feet for hours and I worked in a department I liked which made it better."
bad,"There is no concern or care about development, promotion, or education to advance either at Burlington or your career."
bad,"This is the worst company I have ever had the pleasure of working for . The mangers are rude and disrespectful, they don't like to give you days off and when you do have a day off they call you in, and get upset when you say no. They also have a terrible habit of adding you to the schedule for the day without communicating with you and letting you know. Very terrible company all together"
bad,"Upper management was terrible, they never returned phone calls and did not keep us informed on any store matters"
bad,"A one sided company. Managment is not fair with work schedules. And the territory mangement is worst. They like some and not others, and they show it in the scheduling of management personel."
bad,Perform job duties as asigned for that day/shift as outlined by supervisor; she was easy to work with side by side; pull out am freight; display as per coorporate and supervisory instruction; move fictures; assist clients with specific needs; coordinate and measure for alterations; coordinate off site orders/shipping etc.  I learned specific coding on garment tags; merchandising; how to drive sales; target sales; accounting; maping; The hardest was they gave me an alternative in order to continue working on a full time basis and obtain health benefits I would need to quit my other full time job
bad,"Pay is horrible, management is bipolar and crazy, co-workers are fun to work with for the most part."
bad,"I worked here for several months before putting in my 2 weeks. On my orientation day I was warned immediately from a employee to run from this place. This place really works you hard for minimum wage. Most of management just walks around the store telling associates where to recover, and not bothering to help their own department. The store is just unorganized and filled with employees who think they are in higher positions then what they really are, sales associates acting like they are management and what not. It was very disappointing how this store treated its employees, considering how most worked hard and did their job."
bad,"Management is garbage, the customers that the store brings are disgusting, and no one cares about you as a worker."
bad,"I would clock in go to back office to count drawer then I would go to my work area. I was responsible for greeting guest, created, pulled and retrieved layaways. I had to maintain professionalism while dealing with angry customers. At the end of the day I cleaned work area, emptied trash, helped organize and restock floor, put up created layaways and counted down till."
bad,"This job was absolutely horrible. A typical day was spent in the fitting room overwhelmed with putting piles and piles of clothes away because there was no limit on how many items you could bring in. Then along with working in the fitting room I was in charge of half of the store that was the whole clothing department. Most of the time there was only 1 or 2 people all day and evening and too much work to do. I didn't connect with any of the managers, most of the time they ignored me. 1 manager was rude and had unacceptable behavior yelling at people for no reason and calling people names. Another manager tried hitting on all the young girls that worked there. Half of the employees were fired for shoplifting including the head of my department who also did drugs while at work. I was also hired for day shifts but spent most of the time working 2-10 or 5-10pm. Plus this job only paid minimum wage. Over all this job got so bad and was affecting my health so I just quit."
bad,Working here was not a good idea promised 25-30 hrs a week but got 5-10 hrs not even enough to take a bus to work. I was paying to go to work..Two thumbs down !!
bad,Poor scheduling / hours.
bad,"I was treated horribly. My manager and supervisor was beyond rude and nasty too me. I have a panic disorder, i was fired for having a panic attack during my second week on the job. During my attack I was screamed at and told to go home and to not come back. Also they didnt pay me for my second week and swore up and down i didnt work. They are always hiring because they treat everyone like horribly and noone wants to work for them."
bad,This company is very political in every level never work there
bad,"The pay and hours are rediculously low. They have no morals or ""family"" enviornment. They expect you to get 10 hours worth of work done in 5 hours, and if not you are questiond. I was one of there best and most reliable workers and they never appreciated me. i worked every department, when ever they needed me, and worked split shifts and i never got a thank you. they knew i was a single parent and took advantage of the fact that i needed the money to get me to work longer or outragious shifts. I happily left and not far behind me almost all of there managers were fired."
bad,they were very disorganized and didn't know how to be with the employees.
bad,"This is an absolutely terrible company to work with. This is the first store of its kind in the area and a considerable amount of hype was associated with its grand opening, to only fade into a lull within its first month. The overall negativity felt within its walls, is absolutely unparalleled, ranging from the disharmonious management and disorganization both on the floor and in its scheduling office, to its exploited associates, who are simply viewed as another means of cheap labor. Flexibility of schedule is nonexistent and favoritism reigns freely, as in most large stores. While the job itself is not challenging the lack of hours, constant management quarrels and dissatisfied employees is enough to make this an uphill battle."
bad,All managers/supervisors are extremely rude to seasonal employees and rude to customers. I've worked in a few retail places and never experienced this. Managers/supervisors get upset if you ask for help and they are super LAZY. I felt bad for the customers. Seasonal workers were so nice & miss working with them. We helped each other and we all felt the same way with management. Bur
bad,Working for Burlington was the worst for me. I never had the most disrespectful coworkers and staff in my life. This store manager would favor certain employees.
bad,"I been working at this company almost 3 years and people get paid more or moved to better positions after months of employment. "
bad,"Management is terrible. They just don't care about the people who make the company run. Little appreciation, you're worked like a slave. The slackers get more respect than the hard workers. Upper management only cares about figures and not the employees."
bad,"The Austell location is a very unsanitary environment with dirty stained carpets, literal trash filled environment in the stock room, supervisors office and even managers office. Management lacked communication with each other and associates. I never knew when I worked until the night before!! So frustrating and inconvenient!! Management ACTS like they care about you, but truly don’t."
bad,"Not a good place to work . My particular store and its managers were not fit to be managers or over see workers . Store manager was very rude to customers and employees . Would talk bad about anyone she could and finding remedial things to complain about , while huge violations were being committed along with not following store policy . Would not recommend to anyone who enjoys feeling fulfilled at work ."
bad,"I worked for this company for 4 year's and I love my job I liked the people that I worked with I took my role very serious. I was able to get the experience working at 4 different stores, I recently left due to managment the store manager is horrible , dis honest, rude ,unfair my biggest regret was going to the sioux falls location. I had no training at all I came in with just knowledge that I had gained from other stores . You rarley hear about the good that you do  and callla to corporate does not work .. I lasted not even a year at that location by it's easy to see why the can never keep anyone that's good .. needs a new store manager"
bad,Not a great  work environment.  Not enough help  or support from you boss  and the company. The company need to look at the staffing levels and how the freight comes into the store
bad,"I was barely getting any hours. I also did not receive my first paycheck until a week later. My father passed away and I told the store manager, no condolences were offered and they did not give me any time off for bereavement."
bad,Just another day of work the hardest part of the day is dealing with my lead she has no ideal of with it she doing the best part of the day is clocking out Burlington coat factory is just for summer vacation for kids that's looking for some extra money 18 and 25 years old kid2
bad,"Like most companies, payroll is the biggest controllable expense. Burlington operates on a lean budget while expecting huge results. This culture can be taxing to the workforce and work/life balance."
bad,this job is great for people starting out but there’s no room to grow managers are very lazy and just sit in offices all day expecting you to do all of their work for them the pay is terrible. i worked seasonally and after the season they just stopped scheduling half of the employees because they were to overstaffed for the off season most of the people i worked with during the season were great to work with and made the job enjoyable
bad,"Job was horrible. Everyone who worked there was miserable and mean. Beware of the security tags, you can get really hurt if you take them off incorrectly or drop one on the floor. They dont care about you. Must have a fully open availability but they only are willing to give you four days or less. Wouldn't honor my school availability but during the interview she said it wouldn't be an issue. Managers are cruel and throw items on the floor and tell you to pick it up. Going there, would give me extreme anxiety. I've never felt that way before and I have worked retail for five years now. Short breaks. Please I advise anyone looking to work at burlington to research the company and you will see all the horror stories. Don't put yourself through the stress of this company and continue searching. There is a reason they are always hiring, it's because the turnover is insane and people dont last more than a month or two. Look elsewhere."
bad,"Worked about 12 hours a week. When we asked if there were more hours or a chance of it being increased the manager would just joke about it like ""y'all probably not gonna be here anyway."" Constantly yelled at us, had us working in a extremely hot room with no air condition. The other employees there were really cool people we all got along great but the overall store was 😑"
bad,"I had 2 very serious things happen 2 weeks from each other, management did not help me, belittled me, and also refused to own up to. If you can't dedicate your whole life to them then this isn't for you."
bad,"This job is a joke. You literally get no opportunities for more hours or any raises, you come in at 6 am -10 am random days that they feel works for them and it’s never consistent hours, When u first start they will act like u will have opportunity for raises or extra hours but it doesn’t happen and you will quickly realize this job is miserable and also you realize why people quit so quickly after starting then I was let go without any type of notice and for no reason. One day they told me they would call to let me know when i worked again but they never even called to tell me anything and I tried to call but heard nothing or got put through til it disconnected. All the managers are very rude except shaun he is the only good manager thereshaun."
bad,I worked here for 1 year and 6 months and started as a cashier and was then promoted to Customer Service Supervisor. My one former co-worker in the men’s department has a notorious habit of being extremely rude towards co-workers as well as customers. No one cared for him yet management would do nothing about it. When I inform them of my complaints over his behavior I was told to let it go and that it doesn’t matter. Also management doesn’t acknowledge doctor notes when you’re absent. Breaks in my position weren’t honored and I was lucky to get a lunch at a decent time. My immediate manager who was the Operations manager wouldn’t let me take lunch til after 9pm at times which was extremely unfair and once said I didn’t have to take lunch even though it is corporate policy. Also my immediate manager would lecture me for doing my job because he believed it inconvenienced everyone. He insisted on doing my duties and I was just to make sure he didn’t have to come to the registers. Also I had to instruct him on how to do his job at the registers like my last immediate manager. This company also will take back any product in any condition if the customer throws enough of a fit and threatens to call corporate. There are literally no limits since I discovered someone took back bloody used underwear when I wasn’t working. I was also required to have a radio with me during lunch and had to answer questions during my lunch. I would be rudely interrupted during breaks by my immediate manager as well. Also my raise for my promotion was just $1 and that only meant I got paid the same as the
bad,"At a glance Burlington seems like a great place to work. Employee discount is nice but that's where it stops. Management at the Worcester store is horrible. The store manager is constantly giving orders from her office all day while barely seeing the floor and assisting her team. Having a conversation with her about something she does not agree with is impossible. She refuses to listen to reason and instead twists it to make it entirely your fault. She is inconsiderate of those with mental health issues and does not seem to understand how severely they can impact someone. "
bad,"They gave me no training whatsoever so my first day of my first ever job was horrible. Why offer a job with no training. The schedule is ridiculous, it doesn’t matter what hours you put, if they feel like keeping you all day they will. Closing is at 11 but if they can,they will keep you till 2 am. I wouldn’t recommend this job unless you have experience in sales floor because again NO TRAINING."
bad,They don’t have a good management and they don’t care about their employees they look at you as if you are a machine need to do whatever they want. No raise at all and they do just they give 0.10 cent after a year they a humiliate you when you ask.
bad,Burlington is a terrible place to work. Corporate is very demanding with very little pay in return for your hard work. Raises are little to nothing. You are expected to do the work for 3 people while management sits back in their comfy office on their computer. Management is not personable and plays the roll of a bully. Stores are extremely hot and uncomfortable.
bad,"Expectations beyond unrealistic! Only one in the organization that is held accountable is the Store Manager, zero work life balance, zero appreciation for work done, disastrous approach to freight, customers stealing by pushing entire shopping carts of merchandise out the front door multiple times a day while LP just watches, extremely high turnover, low wages for associates, extremely poor communication, operational processes that don't work, dishonest upper management ... I could go on and on. "
bad,"The main manager at Burlington in sandy UT, is very inconsiderate who thinks very highly of himself. The assistant manager was great, very understanding and a compassionate person. This is not a great company to work for. They do not schedule enough people to work and as busy as they get you will often find yourself to be the only person doing anything, especially as a cashier. Majority of people who work there often called out, they have a terrible time keeping good employees and keep lazy people around because they are grandfathered in from opening the store last year. From a corporate standpoint you are just a number on a piece of paper. I wouldn't recommend anyone to waiste thier time working here unless you want to be overworked and undervalued."
bad,"At this Burlington location, the managers were condescending, lazy, rude, and disrespectful. And the employees don’t do their jobs, and when you complain about it, they cover it up. As well as a stressful workplace, horrible work ethics, and they have no problem with not being fair/ethical to all employees/ not give equal treatment. All the employees there are aware of the horrible management, but they all say that the managers will never get caught being horrible/breaking rules, because no one will complain! All the employees won’t report unethical behavior of management, so it’s a very stressful, and horrible place to work."
bad,There is barely any room to grow in this company. They will tell you there is just to keep you working. The communication skills are terrible and so is the rate of pay. I worked there for two years and didn’t receive a raise or better position. It was like high school all over again drama wise. The assistant manager talks bad about people to other coworkers. Also the store manager does not handle any kind of conflict well let alone handle any conflicts at all. I have yet to see the store manager ring up one transaction even when we were really short staffed and could have used the extra help.
bad,Worst experience of my life! Didn't work there a year and was mistreated since the day I started. They hate it most when you stick up for yourself and when you do they retaliate and treat you worse. I had to take off because my mother had passed away and I called then from the hospital room and left a message. I went in a few days later and was told they didn't receive any calls and I lost points for not showing up. I went to another manager and was insulted by her saying oh it's only 3 points is ok. Then my days of work widdled down to 1 day a week and was treated worse than when I started. I was forced to quit.
bad,"To put it simple, this company was a good one when I first started. It all changed when upper management changed and began to follow a harsher course and unprofessional business ethic which includes but is not limited to: yelling, professional threatening emails, verbal warnings, and loss of employment. Thats just management. On the hourly level, be careful of loss prevention. A really heavy set older man whom believes himself to be the ultimate authority on loss prevention supervises a few stores. He's always telling LP to consider employees thieves and likes to threaten and treat store staff with great hostility. He will also call you a liar and a thief without evidence. Store management is actually good. Despite the constant pressure they face, they tend to look after their employees as family. Hours will be harsh because the company likes to cut funds on a dime for shareholders. They just launched a credit program which is not off to a great start. West coasters get to apply and ruin their credit. East coasters get a 10% off purchase if they apply. Overall, stay away because loss prevention will try to fire you and hours are harsh. I left for greener pastures because I saw how bad things were getting. Management is good, upper is horrific."
bad,"Management does not take your personal life seriously . They expect you to be available all the time regardless of your availability. If you don’t work the hours they schedule you for (even if it’s not your available) they will get upset. This job is better for single, young people. If your a mother or a father FORGET ABOUT IT!!"
bad,"Management does not look out and fight for their employees, hostile high school like work environment. Hard work and experience is a small portion of how you advance in this company. Being liked by upper management and being fake is how you get ahead. Ask many people who have worked in the buying office and left, they will tell you it is full of toxicity."
bad,Zero training. DLPM & assistant were totally lost. Pay was awful. Job was the worst ever I was pleased when I left and went to MACYs. Stay away from Burlington
bad,"The management is very inconsistent and rude. They talk down to you and say very passive aggressive things to your face. The hours are wildly inconsistent. The pay is bad and when I was supposed to be getting a raise, I was told they can only “afford” to give me a .22 cent raise! The people I’d advise to work here are college students who don’t have to pay rent or people who can’t get hired anywhere else."
bad,"Every man for themselves "
bad,All you do at this job is pick up after customers and more often than not you'll get sent to a register to ring them out. Management does not care about the people working her and are quick to replace you.
bad,"Painful hard labor, long hours and very rude managers. The store is never busy yet always messy, we must always act like we are doing something even if there isn't anything to do. not meaningful"
bad,I was hired under false pretences. I was told it would be a full time permanent job and it was neither. I was written of the schedule without notification
bad,In these stores the salary is almost the minimun there is not commision nor bonus. The work is very hard and no benefis at all. The schedule is terrible. I strongly no recomended this place.
bad,"This company sucks and the ""service from the heart"" motto is bullcrap. This company will do anything to save money, that is why employees start off at $8.25 in my area. Minimum wage to work your butt off. This was my first job so I was very excited at first to be working there but all the employees don't care because the retention rate is not high. I left after over a year and in my last month I finally got a raise... it was ten cents!! So after a year I ended off at $8.35. I don't recommend this to anyone. The only thing that made this ok was my manager who rocked but that was it. Don't work here."
bad,"This is the absolutely worst place I've ever worked in my life! I enjoyed the work, it was fun, but the Managers made it horrible. First off, you get paid, $8.00/hour and there's no place for advancement. If you call in sick, the General Manager will get mad at you and won't talk to you for weeks on hand. He pouts like a child. The staff who work 40 hours/week basically stand around the store all day long and boss the newbie's around. It's a very cut-throat environment. If only the main headquarters' new what went on at this store, then maybe this place would turn around and some would get fired and be a better place to work. Right now, good people continue to get let go and the friends to the manager, stay. That's why you constantly see job openings at this place. No one stays and its not because of the job, its the managers!"
bad,The manger is a rat very poor skills. Talks down to workers little care for the workers. Acts all high and mighty never really cares whats wrong with people.
bad,Back of the store (office) was very unorganized. Papers are everywhere. More of a high school job. If you want great pay this isn’t the place of work unless you’re a supervisor or manager .
bad,"Not a good place. Managers play favorites, domt hold every employee to same standards, and heard a manager several times saying if you make her mad, she controls your hours. So u make her mad u dont get hours. Fired for stuff out of my control."
bad,"Management SUCKS !"
bad,If the had good leadership maybe I wouldn't have quit they don't do team work at all one person can't do very bodies job when you have  5 assistant managers and not enough workers it will fail!
bad,"Always stick alone at my department at mostly closing time. Never much help from others especially during busy days. Some employees have shorter times spent in the store than myself. Management always expect you to EVERYTHING."
bad,"Managment sucks, store is disfunctional not enough coverage for departments pay is to low for what they have and want you to do. This store needs to be monitored."
bad,It was managed poorly and people were sketchy. I really didn't enjoy working at Burlington and definitely would not recommend anyone to work there. Fast food is a better pick.
bad,The company is a great company to work for but the corporate staff for south Florida is no a good leadership team to work for. The pay was competitive to the market but that is because the company understands people show get paid for there work but the south Florida regional team expected you to have no work life balance.
bad,"good first time job for students, not enough hours for the work performed, pay  not good for the job you do,  management is not reasonable to job situation. hours are not consistant. no job advancement, no steady work"
bad,"Not worth your time to consider working here. Low pay, no hours (even when promised). The new store manager lacks the depth to understand what a horrible job he is doing. Overall the staff works hard and tolerates a lot of bad management."
bad,"Transferred for a supe position I was recommended. I was never placed even after reworking an entire department thru xmas and remodel. Didn't recieve a raise bc they based on store performance, not personal. Min wage went up, they didn't adjust my to reflect raise i had previously (people just hired in making just as much as i was after working there for 1+ years). Favoritism heavy in company. You won't move up unless the managers love you. performance doesn't matter. hire people with questionable backgrounds. When working department, you can't get things done bc you'll be on register. They treat their employees like garbage."
bad,"Cut-throat and backstabbing environment. Dishonest, manipulative, thieving management. Would risk causing serious bodily harm or death just to make a dollar. Management and the company as a whole could care less about employees unless they get rewarded for doing so."
bad,"The receiving team are very rude they treat new employees like garbage, they make new employees do everythings they don't wanna do. Very bad environment Receiving manager dont do anything about it. Not a healthy place to work. Lots of gossip. BAD FOR A NEW STORE!!!!"
bad,"I started working as a seasonal associate. "
bad,"Do your job and go home, don't try and get cought up in everyone else problems.  Stay out of the drama, A lot of work and standing in one spot on your feet for 8 hours plus. If you like retail then tis is for you."
bad,"This company will hire just about anyone and then try to exploit them to their fullest extent. "
bad,The employee there are wonderful everyone gets along and can joke with another but management can be bit diffrent they are not fair to everyone and treat newer younger people with no class
bad,this place was so unorganized it was horrible working there. i did learn how to work the cashier and do management duties that i was not qualified to do but the manager at times called out.
bad,Worst training program I've ever encountered. Lacked supplies. Coworkers were rude including management as well. You're thrown in a very high paced environment and told to wing it. Asst. Co workers and asst managers were ghetto. New employees left to do most of the work. Incredibly rude and unprofessional. Changes in operation from manager to manager. Missed several breaks due to terrible time management on part of managers. Treated like a nuisance if you have any questions. Overworked and underpaid.
bad,"	Consistently outperformed daily sales goals by building positive and trusting relationships with customers, assessing their needs, and suggesting best-fit merchandise items"
bad,"On a typical day, it would be a slow and you would be able to get a project done but  it would get messed up as soon as you walk away from it"
bad,Too political and stressful. Not nearly enough pay for what you have to deal with everyday. I advanced quickly and still wouldn't recommend working here.
bad,"A no-fun work place, Managers was always hounding their employee's to come to work on their day off. Also, they wanted you to work when you was hurt bad."
bad,"Management does't take time to properly train you, they schedule you for 18 hour work days, and everyone is rude. The store manager will pressure you to quit if you have a chronic illness. Rudest woman I've ever met!!"
bad,They want you to do the work of  6 people and pay you as a teenager hours are never stable and is a unsafe place to work very unprofessional company to work for would not recommend working her not even as a first time job. The whole staff is imature and thier loss prevention is a joke
bad,Been working for Burlington for about a year now. Moving into a new position is hard or it will never happen. They will hire outside the company first before looking at a person that already work for them. Co-workers are very rude and with attitude. Just working there until I find a better and good job.
bad,"Management neglects to truly train you. They rely on associates instead of taking the time themselves.  You have to learn as much as you can on the fly. Even then it's irrelevant because the associates who you supervise have more control over your job than you. Payroll will mess up your check and disavow any knowledge of it. And forget about speaking your mind or having an opinion. Walking in they tell you that they value your opinion and ideas, yet in reality, what they want is a conforming drone who walks in the building with total knowledge of all their practices and procedures and has no purpose but to bow to the will of the machine. Growth is nonexistent. And if anyone reading this does choose to work there, be silent. Joke with people, put on that smile but NEVER give any personal information. Each associate as well as management will use that info against you the moment you aggravate them. Good luck."
bad,"Constant turnover, poor hiring practices, management slightly insane. District and regional managers are in the store so often we can't get anything done. Miserable pay and only about 12 hours a week regardless of what they say in the interview."
bad,"This is a beginning job, you have no voice , no opinion, corporate sucks, they have pretty decent managers but they are not appreciated, they fired one of the best managers they had and kept one who did nothing but he was recently fired. I had to do most of the work when i worked others were lazy."
bad,"Worst 3 years of my life at this company!"
bad,Poor Management! Don't know how to treat employees. NOT Enough working hours! Favoritism! Good employee discounts. Meet some Good people.
bad,"- I was scheduled for an interview and when I arrived, no one was aware of my appointment."
bad,"I filled out the application for a specific job in their company, was hired and was put on the front end, which I did not ask for.  When I finally approached the shift manager she tried, but other management said NO!   Unbelievable.  Then they treated me like a leper after that.  "
bad,"Our manager was awful. He felt that he knew better than everybody else it would not take anybody's ideas and implement them. The general manager also loved to belittle people I have seen many people leave because of this. I come from a family of small owned businesses, and my father always told me to make sure you say good morning to your employees. I don't think our manager ever said good morning or goodbye to anybody it was awful!!!"
bad,A typical day at work replenish merchandise.Management  did not how to treat their workers.the hardest part of this is pulling racks of coats.the most enjoyable part of the was my co-workers
bad,A supervisor new to the company should work more than 10 hours a week in order to learn the company and supervise associates to their fullest potential.
bad,"The attitude among several of the Team Members leaves much to be desired. On a typical day, many of the associates were not productive unless they spotted a manager approaching. What I have learned is how to properly deal with clients. I have also learned to advocate for myself when there is  problem that may interfere with the general productivity of the store, and my work performance. I would have to say that management, at least from my experience was inept in the ways in which they chose how to handle training of new associates, dealing with issues that may arise among Team Member, and accessibility should a Team Member need assistance.  The hardest part of the job was having to deal with ignorant personalities that seemed to be able to do whatever pleased them. The most enjoyable part of the job was working hard for my compensation."
bad,As a mgr expect to work 60 + hours a week. Horrible regional team in upstate ny. Difficult environment to work in! Not enough help!! And I mean not enough help
bad,"In general, nobody worked together towards a common goal and upper management was rude and inconsistent with expectations. I have to say this was the absolute worst place I have ever worked for."
bad,"I loved working for Burlington Coat Factory but unfortunately, they had chosen some very questionable employees. I loved my direct boss. I loved my cashiers and coworkers. Some of the customers were hard to deal with as they are everywhere, but it was definately fun. At the very least, it's a good place to gain experience but definately not for good pay."
bad,A typical day meant getting to the store early for my shift to check the schedule to make sure the schedule remained the same as the day prior. Expect to be passed over for any real promotions if you really work at your job. It would seem that the more dedicated you are to the company the faster you get chewed up. Some of the management was amazing and then some of them will accuse you of actions you haven't taken.
bad,"Burlington is an okay place to work if u need the cash and experience. I have been working here a substantial amount of time and my paycheck still has not seen any improvement. Work can be challenging depending what manager is on duty. The main manager is a complete fake and very ignorant. The associates are ok ,depending on the day. Its very hard to rise up in this company I say so because it's been people here for over 10+ years still cashiering , still in different departments. I don't understand how a person could stay here that long ! It's a jungle on weekends, and please don't close with  the main manager and her side kick you'll never see the light of day. Ending they have really cut hours to about 12 per associate so if you think you can live off of 12 hours weekely ,and a pay rate under 10.00 go ahead and apply."
bad,when i go to work i would help the customers when they need help . sometimes the customers would ask questions like how does this dress look on me . sometimes they would pick something as a gift and they would ask me for there opinion.
bad,"Very busy company  .Managers/Supervisors could be better. Love the job, just wrong store."
bad,"Your day consists of picking up merchandise from off the floor. Typical retail, unorganized store management with unrealistic expectations. You won't be able to fully recover your assigned area because help is always needed in other departments, then management will complain about your department not being recovered. Management is also unwilling to work around any other job or school schedules. Also be prepared to deal with the creepy loss prevention guy, while people are walking out the door with stolen merchandise he'll be busy harassing you and trying his hardest to intimidate you. Only good things about this job are the friendly coworkers and getting paid weekly. Overall unless you're a teenager or someone with no responsibilities looking for part time work, this job simply isn't worth the trouble."
bad,"Working evenings mostly, co workers were nice, very friendly and fun to work with, there was nothing hard about this job, most enjoyable part about this job is interacting with customers on the daily, there were poor management there."
bad,typical work day consisted of covering shifts for fired or suspended employees on a regular basis and exceeding my hours (no overtime) when a coworker would not show up
bad,"first thing you have to clean your work area , help others workers to make the surrondings  more confortable for the clients ."
bad,"I enjoyed my coworkers- they were the best part of the job, but the managers at my particular location were rude, incompetent, and unorganized. The company as a whole is just not a good place, I left to have my baby and was told I couldn't come back to work. After that I filed for unemployment, and the company said that I quit for a better job. I wasn't paid enough for all the work I was doing [8 hour days, 30 min break, pregnant & on my feet, no benefits, no respect from management]. Over all, I would NOT recommend working for Burlington Coat Factory."
bad,My crew was great. Far as management goes could had been better.
bad,"working at Burlington coat factory has its perks because you get to work with different people on a regular basis and you also get to change the different areas that you want to work in. the hardest part of the job was the fact that there was no communication between management and the employees, what i did learn while working at burlington was how to read sales spread sheets and also I learned more about the shipping and receiving"
bad,"the regional team is a joke, they make fun of each other, laugh behind the other backs, the HR dept. does not follow through with issues very one sided an if associates dont like you they make stuff up an it believed."
bad,I myself didnt like how burlington manages their company. there is alot of favortism and cliques between managers and employees
bad,I would not recommend Burlington coat factory to anyone. 1 at company no benefits. A high school job not a career. No value for employees they would just rather replace you.
bad,"At Burlington Coat Factory, your daily routine is to come in, pick up clothes off the floor and put them back on hangers, clean up the shoe department, and retrurn unpurchased items back to the shelves and racks."
bad,One Co workers weed nice and other were rude and they paid under minimum wage
bad,Burlington Coat Factory has a nice store as well as nice products but if there was anything that could have been changed it would have been the hours that they was giving to me.
bad,"When I started with BCF, it was still family owned. The Milsteins cared about the employees while maintaining a great bottom line. When the company was sold, the new owners allowed many of the out of control managers to show their evil side. Management could care less about the employees. You were there to work under so much stress that it was a blessing when you finally got laid off. Managers laid off employees and then were ""rewarded"" with BIG bonuses for a job well done."
bad,"Typically, I would check in with fellow workers, and boss, to see what is to be done that day."
bad,Morale and pay tend to be low. Not a place where you would want to retire.
bad,This company does not give know thank you for job well done don't care about. The worker there's know room for growth for know one alot of disrespect inside this company the security guard always following the worker's not the merchant just not a good place to work.
bad,This company sucks. They spend so much time trying to keep people from stealing from them and no time taking care of their employees. Work schedules are poorly done.
bad,"The employees are nice just not very helpful."
bad,"Management was my main reason for quitting this job, they DO NOT appreciate employees there and the hard work they do. I have worked retail for years but Burlington was something else, they want you to do the most work in the least possible time, with the least possible people."
bad,"I have spent almost 10-years as a loss prevention officer for this company and was the highest ranking loss prevention associate in my region in 2016. I only make $10.70/hour, and my management team has turned a deaf ear to my requests for a pay raise. I am held to an extremely high expectation, and reprimands for undesirable performance is swift. I was demoted over a year ago, and was never informed. I discovered on my own accord one day only after logging into my HR homepage and reviewing my employee statistics. Very unprofessional management, and the lower-end employees are totally disposable and severely undervalued."
bad,"Working for Burlington was pretty much laid back. I liked the job, it was part time. I enjoyed interacting with different people everyday, it was also a seasonal job."
bad,Pay is minimum wage and you will get around 20 hours per week.  Work life balance is good if you can live on that.  I couldn't afford to stay.  I Suppose it would be good for a teenager.  Store discount is 15%.
bad,"High turnover, I think it might depend on the location, so shop there before you apply, see how many workers you see, look at the store.  If you can't find help or the fitting rooms are stacked up with returns ask yourself if this is where you want to work.  Job isn't hard if you have a good team."
bad,"All associates in company are 100% and disgustingly too easily disposable. No job security, whereas upper management has word over subordinates. Superiors are poorly trained, not well-equipped to handle shaping employees into successful beings. By all means, truly a DISHONEST company. DO NOT WORK FOR BURLINGTON. Disappointment."
bad,"This is one of the most unprofessional, unethical and illegal workplaces I've work to date. First of all, management is a group of habitual liars and unethical people. The overnight supervisor is a sociopath and bully who will retaliate against you if you dont gossip and do what she wants you to do and how she wants you to do it. Side note~ they dont give out breaks, they change and erase your hours, they will attempt to slander your name and character if you go against any of their unacceptable behaviors."
bad,"Burlington's ""open door"" policy is basically a joke. You can hear the crickets chirping while you are trying to explain a situation to management. Severely understaffed. New hires disappear after 2 shifts, never to be heard from again. No accountability. No real leadership. If you are a hard, diligent worker, they just expect more from you. If you are lazy, they ignore it. Just show up. Store is filthy and no A/C."
bad,"Mangers are useless, they always have a problem about everything. Associates talk too much on the walkie and have attitude problems. This is a discount store, so expect horrible customers. CSS often yells at cashiers and department managers annoy you about every little thing. You will not get paid enough for what you have to deal with. The only thing this place has done for me was give me a headache and unnecessary stress. Theres a point system for when you call out which is ridiculous and childish. Coworkers here are nice and the only good part about this job. Often ran out of bags, registers go down A LOT and lots of drama. Managers expect you to die for this job."
bad,The management is very unprofessional and everyone gossips about you and bullies you. There is favoritism and cliques. They don’t give out many hours.
bad,I love my co workers and some mangers but this job will have u poor and no house but it's the job and I am looking else where .  I mean for what we do we need more pay
bad,Would not recommend to work there.   Too many managers that do not mesh with what the company goals are.   Every time a higher up came in they wanted  something different then what another wanted.   Hard to please.   Running scared all the time.
bad,"the absolute worst company to work for... No benefits whatsoever but most importantly , the managers don't care about u. even if you're doing the right thing they'll have something negative to say.. they don't train u and expect u to know everything .. also u only get a 15 after working 6 hours so they try their best to only give u 6 hour shifts . Its like a sweat shop in the back of receiving. cold, dark, dirty and cramped. they promote diversity and inclusion to get as many minorities to work them like crazy... they talk to us with no regard while our Caucasian team members get smiles and respect... don't bother applying to work here... Save your time and sanity ..."
bad,"They lied to me and told me everyone had to do a new training for the new system. After, they took me to the back and accused me of stealing toddler sweaters now forcing me to pay one hundred and fourty dollars."
bad,"I spent my time over the holidays (Thanksgiving, Black Friday, Christmas Eve, New Years) at Burlington. The store is HUGE and you have to walk your entire shift around the store picking up clothes off the floor, organizing merchandise (OVER AND OVER AGAIN), cleaning up the dressing room, ringing people up on the register, walking to the back of the store to get a layaway and running it to the front, getting talked down to by managers, getting asked every hour if you have a walkie-talkie, getting asked if you're ignoring managers because they don't know how to speak properly into a walkie-talkie, getting attitude from co-workers that aren't in charge, etc. I only took this job because it was seasonal and I NEEDED something to pay my bills. Little did I know that $9 an hour doesn't really add up. This job was not worth my time and if you have bills to pay, it probably isn't worth your's either. Do yourself a favor and take my advice to NOT work for this company until they can pay their employees at least $12 an hour. Seeing as they made around $85,000 in one day (that I know of) I really don't see why they can't. Rant over."
bad,"The Standard Operating Procedure that was used for conducting business was inefficient, and ambiguous. You never received training based on your role, but rather, thrown into the fire."
bad,"They are hugely understaffed and the customer service supervisors and managers say they are told by corporate that they are not allowed to wait on customers, that they are there to supervise only, which customers complain about all the time Customers can't understand why the supervisors won't ring up their purchase when there are only 1 or 2 cashiers and the customers are waiting,   I have never worked anywhere else where the lowest paid employees are responsible for so much and supervisors do no work, The sales associates are given more work than they can possibly get done on their shift and that is used as excuses for write ups to keep the raises Low or to give NO raise,  Sales associates often have to handle 2 departments on their shift as well as "
bad,"The managers that ran the store were very snobbish and judgmental. They were not understanding and did not care about your personal problems or anything personal about you. If you worked as a cut-throat salesperson, and raised money for the store and the ""donations"", then you were a good employee. All they care about are their numbers, they do not care about your hard work ethic or your wishes to be moved up. I would never recommend anyone to work for Burlington stores. It is a joke of an employment,"
bad,"You are bounced from one assignment to another without enough time to finish your assignments.  The store manager and assistant manager where I worked were terrific.  The problem was the District "
bad,"The associates working there are great. Some managers are amazing and really know what they are doing while others make you scratch your head  and wonder how they became manager, until you see them interact with regional team members, then that answers all the questions."
bad,Poor management pay is unrealistic Operations manager is the worst made most of the good employees quit.Very few hours pay is very low barely gas money
bad,I don't have many words just don't work in the clifton location. I barely had hours. When I tried to change my availability I wasn't able to. I was scheduled on days I asked off.
bad,Working for Burlington nowadays is very stressful. There is a new manager who does not know what he is doing. Another retired after several years and the store is in worst condition than before.
bad,High turnover/Trying to make the company a kohl's with mostly former kohl's people. No home life/work life balance. They give you sick time but you cant take it. Your job is on the line daily. Corp.is always negative.
bad,"I had a part time position because I'm a part time student... They complained about my availability after they hired me. I was clear about my availability in my interview. You get minimum wage for basically putting yourself at risk. If you're in a bad location, good luck."
bad,"never enough people working, try to do your job, pulled to do ten other things, so when that first job isn't done, management yells at you for that. Nothing is ever good enough"
bad,DO NOT WORK HERE. you never work the same shifts they change every week. the managers pick favorites. if you ask for help the other employees are very rude about it. the pay definitely is not enough and you get zero paid sick days or vacation days. overall just not a good place to work. they care more about the money than they do about their employees. also the discount they offer isn't very good either.
bad,Manager's are way over worked and end up working too many hours.  There is never enough payroll to cover your stores which means the managers have to do it all.  Not much of a work/life balance.
bad,"No Schedule for receiving department.  Must be productive or you will have no hours.  There is no formal training, learn as you go.  If you look stupid or do something wrong they let you know."
bad,"All the managers where phsycopaths , no one communicated , the job was okay itself , cashiering was simple , easy , but the work environment is not good for anyone’s mental health and emotional well being. You would think that the customers would be the ones to make things complicated , but everyone who works there is drama, especially the managers . Had 9 managers being there for a year and a half . Burlington is a billion dollar company , yet everyone is underpaid , we would run out of supplies like bags , had no functioning bathrooms, understaffed , and horrible management. The  managers where usually white and racist. Was also sexually harassed by our LP, which supervisors/management totally disregarded."
bad,"Although off priced retail has a very important position in the marketplace, the company was not well run. The resources were limited and the expectations beyond unachievable."
bad,"This is literally one of the worst places to work esp the marlton area in jersey. Management sucks, its a bunch of favoritism, the pay sucks, theres no room to advance, no over time every schedule is pretty much set. Your over worked for the price of nothing. They will tell you your part time but give u full time hours."
bad,"Unable to trust upper management. Although there was a cultural change taken place for open/honest feedback, the Upper Management did not welcome such feedback.  The Territory management had an antiquated view of multi-unit management.  During store visits, you were required to work in the store helping with recovery, auditing racks, walking the warehouse and observing front of store.  All this prior to conducting the reason for your visit. "
bad,"Excellent, Fun great working ethics and  team effort.. display perfection and also I got chance to learn floor layouts an also what needs to move or what's in season."
bad,Working at Burlington was a short time for me due to hours being cut. When I was first hired I was supposed be full time but never received full time hours.
bad,"Pros: The events were plentiful, but the department I worked in had a strict policy about how many individuals can go at one time since it was a customer facing department. Some of the coworkers were nice."
bad,Very unorganized environment and seems to be a job more so for teens. fits around your schedule but does not have much room for advancement. best part of the job was merchandising the sales floor and greeting customers
bad,this is the worst place ever to work ive had to do not only my job but someones else because they were lazy and everyone talks so much s**t about everyone
bad,"horrible management except for a few , no call off line, no breaks at times, communication skills are horrible. meet some nice people but the attitudes will have you looking for another job"
bad,"Even if you have experience, they hire you as a cashier. Opportunities to advance are minimal, and so is the pay that they typically offer anyone."
bad,"burlington is a horrible place to work the time and effort i put in was not worth it. customers and some staff were also rude the barely train u on ur job. the pay sucks they dont pay u for over time and i also was sick my first 2 week working there from dust on the sales floor,on the clothes and in the air."
bad,A typical day at work is ok but very confuseing right when you get there i was the first one there from my shift most times we usually was short handed.
bad,"Started off stable for a week then they kept hiring and cutting hours. I've learn nothing in my department and they're annoyed with me for not knowing. Only they're favorites get hours so unless you're close friends your hours get cut or don't exist. My co-workers are the greatest people I have met they lighten the mood they stick up for each other, and they say the honest truth to anyone and everyone."
bad,"Process Freight "
bad,"Depending on the location you work at you could have a great experience or drive yoursely crazy from stress. I had several positions at multiple locations. Some stores are wonderful and others will cause you so much stress you will make yourself sick. My best advice is that if you just need a part time job for extra money then go for it. If your looking at management, run far away and don't believe the hype. Work life balance in non existant and the compensation is mediocre at best."
bad,"I have worked at Burlington for about 3 months, while the work is easy the management specifically at the El Con mall location is terrible. A supervisor is suppose to make you feel comfortable about asking questions not feel dumb. They hire a lot of people so you get very little hours, they usually range between 8 and 12."
bad,"The management was okay depending on who the manager was that you were working with  the Gm over the whole store had favorites they dont care how you feel and they dont try and solve problems between co workers. Also , you will start off working like 5 days a week but after being there for a week i then starting working 2 days a week and when i went and asked why im only working 2 days a week they said oh the hours got cut they didnt have enough to go around. The strange thing about the whole thing is while they were cutting my hours they where still hiring more and more people so all in all it was a horrible place to work ! DONT WORK THERE IF YOU HAVE BILLS OR KIDS !!"
bad,learning retail is a very difficult job constantly being  exposed to new fashion  in which you may see firsthand. speaking your likes and dis likes to customers.Cashier /associate is a all around job you must be capable to do everything customer service is your job.     management is very confusing expecially when there are more than one manager coworkers are freindly  but  affraid that they might mess up and be fired. the hardest part of  the job is trying to do all.
bad,the people who come into shop treat the workers like they are lower than dirt and so does the managment
bad,"I did not enjoy coming to work, I never felt welcomed, the management was horrible, wasn't a welcoming environment, and was glad that I left this job."
bad,"The company expected way more than the employees could handle. Employees were expected to take on projects that would require three people and were actually left on their own and finish before the shift was over. At the time I worked there the management had their favorites and any wouldn't take some of the problems in the store seriously. The area wasn't much help at all either, the type of cliental that the store attracted  were rude, messy, and inconsiderate."
bad,Burlington is by far the worst place I have ever worked. I never got the right training but was yelled at that I could not do the job. My boss was unfair and best of all when I was laid off they hired my replacement right way durring a hiring freeze. My boss also was 29 and has had about 10 jobs enough said. My boss even had a issue when I had a dentist appointment and gave a hard time with a doctors note STAY AWAY
bad,"As a merchandise manager for this company, I learned that what you really are is an assistant store manager. It is the position where you have to wear all of the hats. You are expected to get everything done yesterday, so if you do not have a great supporting team, you can forget it. The store manager and regional managers were HORRIBLE!! The absolute worst I ever worked with, or for, and I've been in management 20 yrs."
bad,3 years ago; great place to work.
bad,"Horrible management! "
bad,"*Pay poorly."
bad,"Easy job to obtain for holiday season but you will want to surely quit after seeing their business practices. No breaks although your told to take 15 minute break, the line never ends because the cashiers do EVERYTHING! Cashiers do purchase transactions, returns, holds, layaway, and the one that really made me question my existence... separate hangers by size. Management has no clue how long that takes, Burlington  does not focus on driving credit. You don't  have room to grow. Getting  paid $9/hour is unacceptable  for the amount of work cashiers do. It's just unnecessary stress. Sensors have to be separated as well. This job was annoying."
bad,"Management was why I left. They were very rude and disrespectful and would not help you. I was forced to work overtime when I said I couldn't and told I couldn't be paid for it. The main manager knocked everything off of the display tables, told me to fix it, and made fun of me while I picked everything up. That wasn't even my section. I felt beaten down and humiliated everyday"
bad,Was only making 9 dollars yet they wanted us to do everything and anything.  The hours they put you down was never correct.  The schedule always changed and if you couldnt check it on your phone and it changed last minute you were still at fault. The manager never actually tells you your doing anything wrong until you talk to him then he has an attitude towards you.
bad,Burlington should really be ashamed of the pay rate and expectations that give and expect from employees. The two don't match at all. Very poorcompany
bad,"I can’t speak for all stores but this particular store is a mess. First of all the schedule is borderline unethical... examples..."
bad,"In our branch the management would play favorites, and openly show it. Constant shouting at employees. The hardest part of the job was dealing with management attitudes."
bad,I was recruited and left a perfectly good company for an opportunity to work closer to home and under someone I previously worked for. The company was all about job security and “Grow with us”. Once you hit a certain level in your career here you are not safe. Even the Store manager worries about losing his job. It’s TONS of favoritism on every level. Your life doesn’t matter only others careers. It’s only a matter of time until they restructure again and make expectations even worse for those that work there and eliminate more management positions.
bad,I worked there had trouble getting anything to work never got paid for my orientation I worked for a month only got one check for a low amount this place is the worst place to work for PLEASE think of the worst retail place and times it by 10 that's how bad it is and the bosses didn't help one bit kept make excuses on why they didn't pay me
bad,"i was hurt on job supervisors would not except Drs. restrictions,started cutting my hrs down to 8 hrs a week i been the longest employee there they looked all over me when it came to getting hrs. i was treated badly."
bad,I do owe it to l Burlington for training me in various roles to gain extensive experience but the pay did not reflect my job duties.  They only offered ten cent raises at the time of my employment which was in 2009.
bad,Place doesn't give you enough hours send you home early and their is alot of favoritism that goes on their with the company's employee alot of trash talking
bad,An employee was paid minimum wage and not provided safety equipment for a stock receiver and working conditions were deplorable. The stock team was not properly trained. Unorganized store and hard to work and mainstream the stock room. An overflow of shipment and nowhere to put it. Management was not trained correctly and employees were micromanaged and yelled at constantly.
bad,Management expects too much out of you due to pressure from corporate. They take everything for granted. The customers are the worst part of this job. Always looking for a discount or breaking things. They give you a lot of hours and make it hard for you to have a social life. Also you make 20 cent raises every year and that's barely a raise.
bad,"High turn over cause of the bad/stressful environment, stay away from POE and Buyer areas, other departments could be different."
bad,Burlington was a good place to work at great positive team workers felt like family I actually was there when the store first opens so great vibes all around and that’s always good for a workplace
bad,"Not a good working environment due to bad management and you will not work during the weekends. When the truck shows up on Friday but you have to work on the Mondays, but it varies."
bad,"Not enough pay for all the demands. Unfair, unprofessional.  Didn't wanna pay the good employees what there worth. Never fully staffed. Over worked and underpaid"
bad,"Good interview, hired within week or so....30-40 hours/week for about 3-4 weeks..after that for cpl months hours dropped to 10-12 hours/week...for the last 2 months I have had zero hours but still listed as an available employee! I've had meetings with mgrs to ask if I done something wrong and was told no, that I'm a good employee and do my job well....there's just no available hours.....so here I am looking for a new job!"
bad,"Executive management very close minded & not open to suggestions for improvement.  Stuck on Weeks of Supply & Sales Per Square Foot as the only statistics that matter.  If you don't have the right product, and it is not selling, the weeks of supply is not going to allow any more product that you need to flow in.  When you are running down 60% in a category because you only have size 0 & 3 bottoms, they still expect you to somehow have an increase in sales.  If you do not, it is a reflection on your ""leadership"".  You cannot order product, cannot control any aspect of that.  You can have every piece of it out of the backroom & on the sales floor & still not have the RIGHT product.  Executive management will not accept any blame & are very quick to give it.  I don't foresee this company succeeding in the future at all & am glad to no longer be part of it."
bad,this was not a good job it was the worse time of my life on a job 7.95 hr is not enough to even put gas in your car to get to the job the leadership keeps the bonus money the workers always get there hrs cut and are expected to keep a good mindset and bet there on time and do a perfect job or there job will be taken and for 7.95 that just shouldn't happen.
bad,Poor management and don't work with your availability . They need better managers here and have a better pay rating. Also they need more professionalism for managers
bad,You do not get enough hours. I have been here for almost 2 years and still get little hours. They never listen to us. Will be looking for a new job with better managers. Do not work here if you actually want managers to listen to you and who actually care about you.
bad,"Worked 1 week on call, 1 week off, repeat"
bad,No room for advancement and defiantly not a livable wage. I learned that in order to be treated with respect you have to be a favorite of the managers otherwise you get shafted.
bad,"-No work/life balance"
bad,"The people I worked with were good team workers, and the managers supported us well; from time to time I was able to help customers load furniture into their vehicles at the warehouse."
bad,Business and culture is horrible. Wouldnt work there ever again .Mangement is horrible. And they really dont appreciate their empolees and or guest . They have to work on the cuture.
bad,"The job itself isn't hard, keep your area clean, get your go backs, ask customers if they are finding everything okay, and if your department needs a price check be sure to find the item or an item similar that can be charged. I learned that no matter how bad or stressful your day can get, you keep level headed, calm, and let it roll off your back. the managers at Burlington play a lot of favoritism with employees, they value a co worker who is lazy and talks a lot over a truly hard worker. when you come in to ask a question about the company or requesting days off they simply don't know the answer and will dismiss you they engage in the coworker gossip and will blame each other or someone else for their mistakes. They will call you off work the days you are scheduled and expect you to come in on a day you aren't scheduled with little notice. bottom line the managers are NOT professional. It trickles down to some of the employees, with the exception of some, most of the employees are kind and helpful and we would help each other out. the hardest part of the job is dealing with the unprofessional managers and co workers, but the most enjoyable part was interacting with different people, helping them and hopefully having them leaving happy and satisfied."
bad,"You don't get many hours here. The people are fun to work with. But it really is a dead end job. It's a job. But making $9.00 and averaging about 20 hours. Just isn't good enough, AT ALL."
bad,A typical day at burlington is ringing up purchases and doing returns. Making sure the store is neat and shelves are stocked.the hardest part when you have rude customers that make the work harder.The best part is you get paid every week.
bad,heavy lines but quickly handled ..... you meet all kinds of shoppers receive discounts  ......  fair team work ............. dont offer that many hours or days
bad,Burlington coat factory is one of many major clothing companies. They treat their workers as lesser because its easy for them to hire new people. Its hard to balance work and studies if your trying to go to college as well.
bad,Not a good place to work... The managers wasn't a nice group of people u want to work for at all. I just didnt seem myself working there for a long period a time. And i have been doing cashiering for about 8 years. I was very disappointed in the company. I wouldnt have anybody that i love work there.. They are very racist to the black employees never seen such thing in my life
bad,I enjoyed most of the work day. However we didn't work the job we were hired for. And I had to often work with immature co workers. the pay was not worth the work.
bad,"management dosen't really know what they are dong little pay, very very rude supervisors, they dont listen to the employees concerns"
bad,Great working environment that teaches me how to handle business in a timely manner. The manager and co workers are friendly and I enjoy working with them.
bad,ASM's are great but the store manager only favors a few employees and it sucks!!!! Hours are good they work with your schedule but no one is happy to work here. All the associates ( the ones that aren't the favorites) see the favoritism and are very unhappy about it ! There is NO job security here !!!
bad,I never had a problem where I worked before but working at Burlington was a bad experience for me. I arrived at work all the time on time and gave my best performance. I would ask for hours because I would be put on the schedule for 2 or 3 days at four hours a day which is horrible. No matter how hard I worked of how much I would ask for hours I would not get them. It is not easy to work for only $100 a week. So I quit. My co-workers were not professional and where always late or not showing up. The hardest part of the job was not being there enough to earn a real income. The most enjoyable part was the customers. I always had a good outcome with the customers I assisted.
bad,"Not many hours given to pay bills, it a waste of my time. they over work you for little payNot many hours given to pay bills, it a waste of my time. they over work you for little pay. Not many hours given to pay bills, it a waste of my time. they over work you for little pay. Not many hours given to pay bills, it a waste of my time. they over work you for little pay."
bad,"I worked LP for 9 months, all the time was trained for 1 day when every one else was trained for weeks. got in trouble for pretty much anything because the store manager didnt like me. shes mad i didnt laugh at her jokes and kiss her butt. I return a coat i bought past 30 days with receipt AND THEY FIRE ME. management orchestrated the whole thing....made sure i couldnt use lack of training as an excuse. made sure they switched my shift so i could be there when the HR was available to fire me. they are screw ups. you can go in that store and steal anything and no one would ever know. LOL - just go wheel a rack out the door and the old man and geek a zoid from 1975 wont ever know. cameras suck. no clear instruction EVER. management is clueless about everything. They let anyone return anything ANY Condition. but an associate does it and they lose their job, screw burlington i hope they go out of business. OH and lets not forget the fact that they SUED me for THEFT when i never stole anything."
bad,I enjoyeg working at Burlington coat factory.Everyone one was friendly and very helpful. The job was enjoyable.
bad,"Worked in receiving unloaded truck tag garments Folded  garments hung garments size garments sorted basically did everything and want it done in 6 hours then  you have management thats all uppity because they have a title worst part, time ever not worth it"
bad,day at work take back all returns and scan out layaways and answer incoming calls.
bad,"Take your chances and you will be sorry.  Terrible upper management.  Plan on working 70 -75 hours a week.  They think they are a Macy's on a discount budget.  Training is poor at best.  DM's tell you one thing, and then if you follow their direction, and it does not work out, they will sell you down the river.  They do reviews on a bell curve, so if you inherit a broken store, you will not make bonus and also not have a job!  Regional management will not keep confidential communication and if you complain, again you will lose your job."
bad,I was at customer services which my job was to make sure i satify the customer before they walk out the door which i was pround of doing because i like to know i made someone's day while working.
bad,"The co-workers are friendly, but the job has very poor management. Most nights your closing by yourself because they forget to put more then one person on the schedule for your department. The pay isn't much at all and if you aren't a manager or MTA, you won't get anymore hours then 25,"
bad,typical day at work pretty much qualifies as recover and put things back on the floor if your a sales associate. for cashiers your main responsibility is keep your area clean and put your returns in there own bins. 
bad,"no teamwork, manager is lazy, rude co-workers, training is vague, no talking, no communications, good for a first temporary job, leads do more work than actual manager"
bad,It's sad when the management team doesn't know a thing on how things run around here. Favoritism exists as well you be seeing people walking around here like if that is what they are paid to do !!!!
bad,"Honestly the work here sucks. i would give it 0 starts if i could! I knew retails suck but here in burlington is soo bad its the worst! Not only does management play favoritism, but legitely cut off everyones' hours even for seasonal holiday work. They don't even know what they're doing. The lack of communication is so exhausting that at this point even the supervisor doesn't even know whats going on. Its true labor at its core. management legitly changes your schedule at the last second and expects you to know it. Like today I worked for 3 hours and didnt even know that my schedule had changed to clock out an hour early. They dont even give you lunch unless they tell u to stay at the last minute until 2 or 3 pm. sometimes they dont even give you your 15min break.I hate working and currently applying somewhere else. Dont waste your life here its not worth it! Oh and by the way, on a monday I had to work on three freakin palets all by myself to unbox and process the products for 44 minutes straight until the supervisor decided to send me some help. seriously though, dont waste your precious time here. Especially here on AZ mills mall burlington store!"
bad,"The management is very lacking. The general manger has no backbone,  the work environment is everyone for themselves.  They don't train anyone. The managers sit in the office.  They don't know how to make a schedule. There's never enough cashiers so you can't get anything done. The store is constantly a mess.  It's Just not worth the aggravation.  The only time it's good to work at is when the corporate boss is in town."
bad,"Management aren’t terrible but, invest nothing in guiding a career path forward. everything is always someone else’s decision is the most common cop-out used by managers. raises don’t keep up with cost of living, even with exceptional reviews."
bad,They suck at everything. When asked for help with an issue (with an open door policy) i was told to go to someone else to resolve the problem. Nobody cared that I wasn’t happy with the work environment. It continued to get worse and worse until I finally left.
bad,"You are pressured to get a million jobs done within an 8 hours shift for min wage.   Corporate is always pressuring management for store change then management tends to pressure the associates to get it done, then bash them if the work isn't done."
bad,Upper management (regional team and higher) makes it hard to work for this company. They expect one person to do the job of many. They're opening more stores around the company but cutting positions in their already established stores making it hard for employees to run the store. Coworkers and assistant and store manager are nice but the rest of the job makes it stressful
bad,ones persons personal business is the whole stores. A lot of drama. Poor communication and lies between managers and employees. To low of a pay and not enough hours
bad,their was grate management just bad in all different ways no training they don't answer the equations that you have you have to figure out everything on your own even though its a really busy store and you work so hard they don't pay enough.
bad,"Never have I worked for a company that expects WAY TOO MUCH for way too little pay. And management plays favorites and if they don’t like you, they’ll make sure you know with the hours and pay. Want depression and Anxiety for super little pay? Work at your local Burlington!"
bad,"A bunch of control freaks ran the department.  They displayed improper manners and actions towards their subordinates and spoke poorly to them (think white trash with chips on their shoulder or attitudes).  The “no respect” was a constant.  Director NEVER said good morning to staff.  NOT a team oriented department whatsoever.  TOO much volume, not enough help to manage workload.  They act like they’re doing employees a favor offering overtime when it’s good for them.  Blatantly contradicts their “family work-life balance” mantra which clearly is another falsity.  Forget about taking a well deserved PTO day, you’ll just come back to twice the amount of work you had when you left (lack of coverage among the team)."
bad,They give you enough rope to hang yourself.  Management doesn't stand over you (which is nice) but management is often nowhere to be found until you do something wrong...no matter how small.  Then they are more than happy to throw you under the bus.
bad,"Worst job I have ever had! I do not recommend anyone to work here, if you are trying to get a full time job/ advance in retail unless youre a high school student that needs some money. Managment does not help anyone whatsoever, make you look bad in front of customers, employees are rude, customers are literally ALWAYS RIGHT, and there is a mess AT ALL TIMES! Closing hours are also ridiculous, 11pm is closing time but be ready to leave at almost 1am!"
bad,Worst place to advance your career in security. I literally had no assistance from my supervisor. The 28th Street location had the best manager by far. the Alpine location had the worst and most unprofessional management.
bad,if finding a job weren't  so hard no one wold work at berlington. is crazy working there because they dint really allow overtime. plus there was a lot of people that work there for years and get let go for nothing because the store was doing good  we meet our goal every day so it was cheapness.
bad,Work was boring and repetitive. Management was biased and played favorites. Workplace disputes was handled poorly. High turnover rate and workers were taken advantaged of.
bad,"okay play to work at"
bad,"I was working for Burlington for over two years and the only positive thing about it was some employees. They expect you to work in all departments with out any training. They were always under staffed expect for cashiers. For example, there will be over 20 cashier but only 2 people on the floor and expect the cashier to clean the store after the store closes. The managers and supervisors feels like they are better then you because they have a higher job title. The pay is nothing and they don't give hours."
bad,Fun job there good to there employees they provide lunch on fridays ice cream on hot days water bottles Gatorades best company I've been with only flaw is that its hot
bad,"When I started out as a cashier, the work environment was friendly and my schedule was flexible where I was able to manage my life outside work. Now I'm being overworked and not compensated well and management is a total disaster having 4 managers."
bad,very busy' I learned how to keep up in a very intense work enviorment and and learned a couple of new things as far as processing new merchandise entering the store
bad,"A typical day is here is like walking into a storm and you're being thrown around, you have to deal with customers that berate you if you don't give them a discount on items that are already marked down, or if they want to return items that they wore. Management is selective when it comes to returning items especially so if a customer threatens to call corporate. Some managers are more likely to help you with customer issues and some will leave you to deal with it on your own. Despite those issues, working here is fun and you can really learn a lot about running a store entirely by yourself on a shift when multiple employees call out. For anyone that's reading this review I'm letting you know that working here is highly stressful, you'll be overworked, and you may or may not get help from management. So if you're a self-sufficient individual this will at least help with honing your leadership skills."
bad,"worked the floor and put merchandise back, also worked register cashed people out very positive place to work, loved my employees. management was great."
bad,"The store manager was a bossy women, but confident personality."
bad,"Please just shop , do not work here. You will only work 12-18 hrs a week they are rude they slave you only when corporate comes and then send you home. the only fun thing you can o here is help customers once they are gone you experience the disrespect."
bad,"Most enjoyable part of my job, the store associates. Developed a Rock star team that was amazing how beautiful the store would look on the daily."
bad,"I was recruited to work for this company. I quit my current job and relocated 200 miles. The management at the stores I was assigned were never informed that I had been hired and had no idea I was coming. I quickly learned of the massive communication gap between the corporate office and the stores as well as the huge push back for anything coming from my department (Loss Prevention.) Due to the resentment for my job title, there was a very uncomfortable working environment."
bad,"A typical day at work  starts off with co- workers talking about each other to me behind their back including the managers. The hardest part of the job seeing people steal, but we had no one to tell no lose prevention. The most enjoyable part of the job was help the customers."
bad,"to much work and not enough pay, bad giving lunches and breaks on time, not enough organization at all. some employees dont want to do there job, the management is cool people."
bad,"As a full-timer you're promised 2 hours of organization time in your section, and I haven't gotten that in weeks. I'm weeks behind in my SSTT (Sizing, sorting, ticketing, tagging) of my department because management constantly puts me up to other tasks, or we don't have enough people and I end up doing other people's jobs, and then it's my fault that my work isn't getting done when it's literally impossible for me to touch my department for more than a minute. Management micromanages you to every footstep you make and then blames you when something isn't done to corporate expectations. "
bad,"Minimum pay"
bad,I worked for this company for 16 years and I will say that I did learn a lot as this was the first warehouse job i've had. The number one problem with this company is the raises. You could work your tail off to the bone and when your yearly review would come around you would only get 50 cents raise at the max. Back in 2009 there was a major overhaul in the company and as a result of this overhaul there were a lot of supervisors and managers that were let go from the company. Before this overhaul it was in my opinion a tolerable place to work for but still not a long term solution. The only reason why I stayed through most of my tenure is because of lack of experience for one and two the economy was in a recession for a long time until just recently where it did pick up.Most of the managers that came in after this overhaul were very rude and disrespectful to you. I remember times where a manager and supervisor were talking and laughing at me behind my back. They were very unprofessional and lacked communication with their employees. They have a system in place as far as production where if you don't meet their production standards you will be fired. They would give all the easy work to their favorites while people they disliked were given the grunt work and their production went down the toilet as a result. I really felt it was every man or woman for themselves in there as they did lack teamwork. It was not always like this but most of the time it was. At the end of the day in one of their buildings it was like driving to get out of a concert or sporting event. The people I worked
bad,"Very peaceful and you keep to yourself a lot, unless welcoming customers. The most enjoyable thing about my job here, was i had customers every single day, write in a very nice survey about my customer service given. And my picture was on the company website as well. I was almost employee of the month"
bad,Not organized & never enough help.Hardly ever got breaks & was expected to work eight or nine hours with short lunch hour..The only asset of the job was that we got discount.
bad,Burlington is a terrible store to work for they overwork their employees under pay them and terminate them for no reasons at all. The people that Burlington has supervising the team are unprofessional childlike disrespectful and inconsiderate to new hires
bad,good working condition  for a retail stop re it was fairly slow paced good environment  good co worker would recommend this job to anyone that is look to be n that filed of work.
bad,"All employees  here is unhappy, too much work, Bad benefits if you working less than 37 hours the health insurance is not covering you and the employee have to pay more money and usually full timer has exactly 37 hours scheduled but we have to working 2 days for night shifts and we leave almost half an hour early and our schedules becomes less than 37."
bad,They hired for full time over hired and only gave 14-20 hours to each employee if they were lucky. When you ask for more hours they turn you down and say you ts not in budget for new employees to get over 20 hours
bad,"Arrive at work and directed to location of work assisgnment."
bad,"I did like working here, but the hiring manager is very rude, arrogant, very unprofessional, how do she keep a job, she's the reason people quit and no one stays."
bad,We have corporate visit after corporate visit. You are always prepping for a visit and have no time to work to develop your team or develop a routine. I have been with the company 4 months and had a grand total of 12 days off. Working as many as 21 days in a row without a day off and about 75 hours per week. In the 4 months we have had 8 corporate visits.  I am exhausted and ready to quit after 4 months with the company.
bad,Organize and break down received inventory. Stock out inventory. Sensor clothing/products. Management is laid back and not really caring. Work environment is slow paced and really no pressure.
bad,It was. A challenge but a great team effort  management should reconize they great workers is was a fast and great places to work but they never regoniz there Best employee
bad,"always busy. theres always something to do in this store. always putting merchandise away, where they belong. employees were great when I worked there."
bad,The job could be better when catering to employees. Didn't like the working conditions as far as how hot the building was everyday. If they were to give better benefits and have longer breaks the job would be better.
bad,"Work Hard Do Your Best and Gain The Experience that will move you forward to achieve better."
bad,"Went to the job fair and the management team was extremely unorganized didn't know what we were supposed to feel out or Who to talk to. All the hiring team from other Burlington stores incorporate. They were all just sitting back there eaten breakfast & donuts and nobody knew anything. Management was extremely rude treated us like we were dirt under their feet. THE PAY RATE THEY OFFER ME WAS UNBELIEVABLY LOW!! "
bad,"I didn't enjoy my experience working here. We were always understaffed making the workload 50% harder than usual. The store was always messy, and we had no cleaning crew. I honestly would not work here unless I got paid 9/hr."
bad,Enjoyed what I did .I knew what was expected of me always ready to work. Worked well with other co-workers and managers too.
bad,"Wore plain clothes and performed on-the-floor store surveillance to anyone showing a demeanor or signs that they were going to commit larceny. Also performed internal employee theft investigations, training of associates and addressing shortage related issues."
bad,"While working at Burlington, I was trying to get an apartment as well. And as I had found, I constantly asked my managers for more hours. I was already working at most 15/wk while making $8/hr. I asked every week after looking at my schedule. And still never got more. After a month of doing everyone's work including my own, I just had to quit. I picked up on everyone's slack. As they only talked on their phones or just sat around. I ran around the store constantly like a chicken with my head cut off. Only reason the job work/life balance was so high was because of the little time I was working. I would never go back there. I'd rather work constantly at 40+ hrs and have a place to live and food to eat then work barely ever and struggling just to eat. I got so stressed out while working there instead of being unemployed that I would get sick."
bad,Working as an sales and customer services in burlington coat factory was a good experience I enjoy helping the customers and seeing them satifys as well as completing my task at work.I must say however when it came to team work the other employees didnt like being a part of it.
bad,"There is a terribly high turn over rate. Management could be better. However, they were willing to work around my school schedule which was great. I would not recommend this job to others."
bad,"Horrible management, inconsistent hours,never in my life have I worked for a company this horrible. Crazy thing if you try and report to coporate they tell management who you are and now your being treated unfairly at work."
bad,"I was hired as “on-call” after they hired me for a job I did not apply for. There were three other people hired with me that got stuck in jobs that they did not apply for as well. I only worked once a week, less than five hours, which is not great if you provide for a family. I applied here to help myself pay for my college classes but was not able to since I barely received hours."
bad,They give u very little hours other Than that fun place to work at and management is ok very short shifts that’s the one thing I did not like about it
bad,The company does not have realistic goals for the employees to meet and when their employees don't meet them they beat down the management staff for not having to work even harder for the little money they make the employees definitely have to work too hard minimum wage can't pay bills.
bad,"Great shift hours to work. (9am-10pm)"
bad,When compared to their competition Burlington is way behind in regards to compensation.  Salary increases are not even enough to cover increased costs of living.
bad,"Do your job and go home, Stay out of the drama, Lots of work and on your feet for 8 hours or more. If you like retail then tis is for you. The work culture is great."
bad,"Overall they needed to explain more what we can do or can't do. I thought burlington be more with communication, but I did have a good time with other associates."
bad,"I was hired June 1st and just began the job , So i really haven't gotten the feel for the company yet . It's a very bog department store and offers lots of sales so the atmosphere is wonderful ."
bad,"The pay did not equal to the expectations, the managers were prejudice and bias when it came to decision making. Their attitudes were not professional and they lacked customer service skills. I did learn how to operate a POS"
bad,"I left my last company Lowes for Burlington they offered me a pay raise and a management position. but i soon learned that the company was understaffed, and shorting me allot of pay. that they promised upon hire. so i resigned."
bad,"Monitored performances of personnel to ensure a productive work environment, ensured workflow efficiencies, customer services excellence and quality assurance, responsible for supervision of staffs, organized display merchandising and sales. Co-workers were mostly co-operative and fun to work with. Enjoyed the welcoming environment that we(co-workers) created among ourselves."
bad,All they want to do is push credit cards. Nobody wants a credit card!!!!!!! It’s not a bad job by any means. There’s always something to do so time goes by quickly they just want you to shove the credit card down people’s throats which is VERY ANNOYING!
bad,"They care about one thing, making budget. You are just a number, no matter how hard you work, no matter how long you work. And the only way to get in their good graces is to make as many friends as possible.  Run don't walk away from this business. The work is never ending, and they care about nothing other than the budget."
bad,Very low budget pay. 12 dollars an hr meanwhile Walmart is next door with a big sign outside the store saying starting pay $15.  The entire staff is not friendly except takiesha and keisha. They are amazing.
bad,"Very unorganized had three managers and only one of them actually got stuff done and he was the assistant manager.  The hours were good in the beginning but as they brought in new people because their turnover rate was HIGH, they’d stop giving hours to the older people.  One manager would gossip with other employees and supervisors about people that worked there. It started off well but ended as just overall a horrible experience."
bad,"The job itself is physically demanding however, they are kind and it's a great place to start a work career. It is a very busy area and most of the learning has to be self-done."
bad,"Employees are disrespectful to customers and to their fellow employees. Managers walk around all day talking on the phone. Store is constantly messy, partly due to customers and a poor job on the employees end.  Bathrooms are disgusting. Certain positions in receiving will have you standing at a table essentially doing nothing but twiddling your fingers for hours on end. Save yourself the headache and find another store to work for."
bad,"If you want a heavy workload with garbage pay then this is the job for you... when I was first hired I was lied to and told I would work 6am-2:30pm 3-4 days a week which was perfect. But once I actually got the job I only worked 7am-11pm 3 days a week and they told me some weeks are so slow I will not get any hours at all. but then during the holiday season I began working 6-2:30 every day and they hired on extra help and there was 6 people all working together which made a lighter work load. But the big problem was once the seasonal help all left there was still a big work load and only me and one other girl. and after the seasonal people left, whenever I worked 6am-2:30, they made me do what 6 people would have been doing all by myself so it took me a while, but everyone would tell me you have to hurry up you have to hurry up when I had to donut and bring out 14+ racks with 30+ articles of clothing on each by MYSELF. And my supervisor wouldn't have one of the 5 people to stop processing all of it and come and help me. The management is pretty good and everyone who is a manager is easy to talk to, however there is a lot of drama. and its also easy to plan things because you get weekends off. For someone looking to make some extra cash this is a good job but for a reliable income this isnt the job you want because one week you will make 100 dollars and other weeks you’ll make 250 a week. And you don't find out what day you are working until the day before so you can't plan anything. All in all I think they mean well here, and there are a few nice people I work with but between"
bad,"There are many days that they are understaffed, we only have one manager and the employees get treated like slaves. Also, there are days where it can be really stressful because they only have one csshier scheduled for the whole store."
bad,"Customized a professional and friendly environment for customers to enjoy their time in the store.  Listening to the concerns and negotiate a better solution for the consumer.  As well as greeting all of the customers that I pass by and seeing that they are doing well in what they are finding for. Selected to handle cash register as the Customer Service when consumers are returning, exchanging, or buying items with cash or cards.  As well as when customers are in need of using the store layaway."
bad,"I will never work for this company again no wonder they always are hiring for positions that are not full time, management is terrible you raise a complaint or issue they lower your hours to none. You call HR about a boss problem they will not assist you because ""Oh I know this person."" that's terrible"
bad,A job you can hold on to while looking for your career. No real opportunity for advancement. The staff is awesome but upper management is way out of touch.
bad,"The associates will ban together when it really counts. I have very little use of the management, there is so much that they could do differently that they didn't even consider out of fear of  Corporate."
bad,"The store was striving when it opened everyone was on board to deliver a great customer experience. The atmosphere was very enjoyable until slowly, but surely that is the way things run in a small town, management started replacing staff with no regards to show favoritism, not for the benefit of the store. The quality of service as well as the store outlay became very poor. The hardest part of the job was to stay when management did not recognize the effort and outstanding job of the workers they once had. Corporate would make routine visits but, if employees expressed their discomforts, you must be sure local management would run them out in no time. The most enjoyable part of the job was just remaining active all the time with a positive attitude would keep the good staff going. Of coarse this came from an engaged supervisor that cared."
bad,Working In the Saginaw store is the most horrible work experience ever! The management sucks there dont care about there employees at all. The hours are HORRIBLE!!! They favor the employees who dont ever speak up and say whats on there mind. It to me is just a side job until I can get one that is worth giving my time to.
bad,bad experience horrible supervisor no leadership under paid you do more than your actually paid to do understaff bad hours pooor pay just bad place to work out absoultly horrible
bad,I enjoy in working at the  Burlington  Coat Factory .They show me how to change the price on tags. And I also enjoying working with other people and helping the customers on what they need and show they where they are.
bad,"I NEEDED a job so I took this one. Was hoping for at least 25 hours + per week. For the first couple of weeks I got 30+ but then I was scheduled 15 hours one week and 9 the next. Apparently the computer schedules according to past sales trends so everyone's hours get cut during lower sales weeks. I needed consistent hours and that would obviously NOT happen. Raises tend to be roughly 17 cents (if that) after about 6 mos or 1 year (not exactly sure). The shareholders make MORE than the employees.  I found a higher paying job and told them to give my meager hours to someone else.  Employees are expected to work all holidays (all hands on deck) on the holidays they are open - which is many."
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job is being a great team leader and working hard with the team,I learned alots while working for that company"
bad,The worst place for anyone to work I was treated with such disrespect and slander by a supervisor they sided with that supervisor who was obviously on drugs and had the anger issue from it. I left no one deserves to be treated like dirt. Also was called disrespectful names by that supervisor.
bad,"manager were ""so busy"" i never got my login in info to the company sites.Took a week to get a time card to clock in.Never had any training on postion."
bad,"The last manager here was amazing but was moved to another store. After that I saw my decline in hours and then wasn’t being scheduled. The pay is low for the amount of jobs they ask you to do. You will work receiving, cashier, and sales floor. There is a lack of leadership when a manager is not around and one supervisor in particular can be very rude. The associates that work there are very friendly but the lack of leadership and communication makes this a very difficult job."
bad,"Burlngton is a overly/mismanaged organization. "
bad,"The store manager is petty, he will get upset with you and give you one day on the schedule (4 hours), my coworkers complained about favoritism and racism, which I never felt like I experienced. But the company complains about making $6 billion a year but only gives $4900 in payroll for a whole month. Leaving one person up front, with long lines, and constantly having to call people from the sales floor to help and sometimes you get no help because there is no one on the floor. Certain people do not deserve management positions, they dont do anything all day but will turn around and complain about how tired they are. I could go on and on about this place."
bad,"They just randomly start hiring new people, they force you to stay past your scheduled hours and they will tell you that if you leave at the time your schedule says then they will cut your hours. If they see your not machine fast they will hire other people and cut your hours until you quit or they find an excuse to fire you and your checks are very low they will lie to you and say it’s a full time job then they will only schedule you 3 days a weeek for less than 8 hours usually between 3-6 hours per shift"
bad,The discounts is the only thing that they got going for them at that company. I liked the people I work with but at the end of the day I was there for a check
bad,"The store is filled with unnecessarily competitive people, management taunts their employees to argue with each other we stay off their backs when they do shady stuff. Management keeps the names of those who quit on the roster to make it seem like they have more people in receiving than they actually do. Management won't turn on the lights until 9:30AM, so we have to work in the dark for 3 hours prior, and the air never works so it's always blistering hot in there. Management doesn't lead by example and we're not given the SOP ""bible"" to know how things are supposed to be done, and for the last time we already know HOW LONG it takes for things to be done, but we are sabotaged when certification comes around. The equipment is janky and dangerous to lug around and they don't care. You're expected to do the work of 10 with only 5 people working hardlines, and the supervisor overpulls to ensure sustainable hours only for certain people and then gives the others 12 hours a week. The ASM screams and bullies you over the intercom in front of customers all we need is new management, please. I tried to speak with HR about my situation and they will only reply about information that is wrong, not the facts that could potentially ruin a company. You are painfully disrespected here."
bad,"Managers do not communicate and set unrealistic expectations. Feels like a sweat shop, the pay doesn't reflect the work you're expected to do. Managers are rude and feel like they're above everyone else. Some employees don't work, which is unfair to those who do. I need the side money, otherwise I would've quit. This place drains the life out of you, and will make you depressed. Look for employment somewhere else."
bad,During a short period of time I have realized a lot about working for this company. You are over worked and stretched thin for very low pay. Barely any room for advancement. I know working retail you expect unpredictable schedules but here they make it inconvenient for you. For the amount they are paying I say it is not worth it. Looking to leave immediately.
bad,"customers are rude, co-workers refuse to help you, managers only care about getting a job done but get upset when you don't know how BECAUSE YOU WERE NEVER TAUGHT. managers don't care if you have other responsibilities, they think Burlington is your first priority. i hated that job but the main reason i left is because they scheduled me to work during the times I had school & no matter how much i spoke to them they didn't hear it. it was always “this is the time you are scheduled for your job, you better show up” (Glen Oaks Burlington)"
bad,prefer to not respond. There is nothing that I want to respond to at this time. I ended up  not being content in this position. It  is best that it just be left at thhat.
bad,At this store in Harlingen Tx management is weak and they turn the other way to certain associates and management all the way up to districts married or not all had relationships with other associates we were told to hush up and never speak of it we work for a year all we were worth was a ten Cent raise and work wise you never did lost prevention you were a secretary for them
bad,"When I first started at Burlington I felt it would be a good place to work. I was wrong. A typical day is spent doing your job and someone else’s as well. I spent a lot of time on the register which means you can’t get much done, but management expects you to.  They never have enough cashiers.  Most of the employees were friendly, but management was a different story. Management was unprofessional and messy. Managers would talk about employees behind their backs. Make rude comments and remarks about people. The store manager is rude and shows favoritism to certain employees. This was the worst job I ever had and do not recommend anyone apply here unless you’re desperate for a job."
bad,Constant employee turnover and daily negative conversations.  Always using blame instead of trying to correct the situation.  No proper training and high expectations.
bad,The work environment and management were not great.  Work hours very inconsistent and sometimes I was only getting 4 hours per week.  I can barely fill my gas tank up with that.
bad,ok place to work if you can put up with office politics   work staff  was generally great to work with    floor associates spend WAY too much time on the registers instead of being on the floor helping customers
bad,the managers were very un professional. They did not create a schedule that was easy enough to follow leading up to random days you were scheduled to work.
bad,"My first job out of college, the only good of this job was the first manager I had, he was so dedicated and always helped with anything we needed. The work here was definitely and experience, one that I have learned from, so I am grateful for that."
bad,"very stressful, they did not even train me they just threw me out on the floor as seasonal and expected me to know everything. and then did not  hire me on based on the fact that i did not know much even though they did not even train me."
bad,"Worked here for 4 and a half years in the back room and it was a joke, always called to the floor. Pay increases were very far and inbetween, you get a huge cut in hours after the holidays."
bad,Not a good job at all .. They are very meaay unprofessional behavior nasty store. Hard to work with people like that.. Most of the time they were talking about the customers
bad,"I did not like this job at all. the people who worked there were very rude, even to customers. very unorganized. Not much else to say about this job"
bad,"My coworkers make the day go by faster for me, they're a joy to be around. We bring smiles to one another's faces.Even on a bad day, we lift one another up. I've met some really cool people here. Management team could be better, and the pay could also be better for what we do."
bad,"even though everyone is friendly the don't want to give you any hours or any days I was always working from 4 to 12 hours a week"
bad,"This company may be great for young employees who are just needing to get some work experience. There is little chance to move up and if you do move up, there is no job description. Every manager has a different view on what your job actually is."
bad,"I wore many hats Customer Service Supervisor , Floor Associate , Receiving,  Markdown, Cashier, Loss prevention I learned to still give it my all no matter what and make the customer happy no matter what chaos is going on"
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job was working in a fast paced environment with a team of dedicated individuals. I also enjoy helping customers in their shopping endeavors from begining to end.
bad,"Always look for something new to do at work, from learning how to do key recs for new arriving merchandise, transfer out, build a crib a day at work is always looking to achieve something new to learn show my surperiors i want to be here and that i enjoy my job."
bad,the job is ok they only thing they only have part time  not enough hours because i am interested in a full time position some of the co- works are kinda tough to work with alot of intimadation when you call in not really a good place to work for
bad,I enjoyed working with the public. My team was good we got along very well.
bad,Poor management.  Difficult Schedule.  Inconsistent expectations.
bad,"The internal management sucks...terrible scheduling, horrible unmotivated employees, bad customer service, and horrible pay! I wouldn't recommend a prisoner this job on work release! There's no advancement at all..."
bad,A typical day included waiting on customers restocking the front of the store. We also contacted customers about layways and I was responsible for price overrides as well.
bad,"The Manager that hired me was willing to ""work with"" her people if they needed it.  If something unexpected happened and you needed help, she did her best to help you so you could keep your job and she could keep a valued employee.  She would follow the rules, but she also liked to have fun.  This was a good environment to work in.  If your working for someone who will ""go the distance"" for you, you will respond in kind."
bad,"My typical day at work was busy on the weekends and during the week day it is much slower. I was learning customer service and learning how to work with my employees. Some of the managers was disrespectful, in my opinion, but the others was okay. The hardest part of the job was when I had to learn customer service. I had to learn how to return and exchange items and make people layaway's. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people and getting to know them."
bad,"Just  your average retail job. An average day would consist of getting the go backs, helping customers, and helping the front out with checking guest out"
bad,To start off I can't say anything bad about the managers or team leads as I didn't work there long enough to get a real sense of how they treat there employees. I can say the amount of physical labor they want you to do for a little bit of pay didn't seem worth it to me. I mean they paid just over minimum wage and some of the product you have to handle is too heavy for one person to handle and you have to move it around by hand. You have to keep a physical count of every box you touch so you can record it at the end of the night and hand it in to your supervisor.I guess there is a quota you have to meet and if you can't meet expectations they don't need you.You only get one break a day which is forty five minutes. Most other jobs I have worked I got three breaks a day either an hour or a half hour lunch and two fifteen minute breaks. Overtime is mandatory on Saturdays when they have it which is quite often I've heard. I guess theft there is bad because they have security when you enter the building and when you enter the warehouse.That's about it for the review. I don't know maybe i'm nit picking but I know there are jobs out there that pay you more for less work. Maybe this review was helpful to you maybe it wasn't. I guess if you need a job and they hire you try it out to see if it's worth it to you.
bad,Learned a lot. First retail job ever. Started when I was in high school. Made some lasting friendships with co-workers.
bad,"I've gained alot of customer service experience with this company, I was young and just graduating high school"
bad,"Assist customers with shoes"
bad,Really fun job. The pace was fast moving and never boring.All of my co workers were very nice
bad,I would get to work and start putting new clothes on the hangers and hang them up to be sold.I learned about all the new fashion designs that were going on at that time.I really liked my store manager he was my mentor.My co-works were very supportive and helpful.The hardest part about the job was when a customer was looking for a specific clothing item and I was unable to find it.The most enjoyable part of my job was when customers would tell me Thank You over and over again and how appreciated they made me feel.
bad,"the store was always dirty unorganized "
bad,"-open freight"
bad,Not a good paying company that also requires a lot of work management didn't keep up on what work was being done by who and at what pace.
bad,"I worked in shoes. I recovered alot, but it was seasonal. It was fine, if our customers weren't leaving their old shoes and we'd have to find them. Managment was hardly ever there."
bad,"Organization within the store is pretty bad, it takes awhile and a lot of tugging to get things done that would make the store a better place to work. Overall okay place to work with decent managers and decent pay."
bad,"When I first went into burlington they didn't have any of my papers ready and I didnt know alot of rules before working . They didn't let me know about what not and what to do, was just very unorganized. The team members were very lazy I felt like people just weren't getting along with each other and I always had a negative mood walking out. But I still continue to keep working and stay professional."
bad,I was able to learn many different aspects of the warehouse position held
bad,"a typical day , learned new techniques , co-workers sociable"
bad,"I think the company need to trust more to the associates and working more manager with associates daily basis and assistant consistently all areas.......and listen the associates, because when the rumors it spreads is because something it’s happened."
bad,It was a very messy store employees didn't care about there jobs  I tried hard working with my manager on getting in new employees to clean up the place
bad,A typical day at work was hacked but I stilll manage to work thourght it.
bad,"My overall experience was horrible working for this company. I advise anyone dont waste your time!!!! Not worth it. Managers dont do anything but walk around doing nothing acting as if their ""god"". No organization, racist, shows favoritism towards a certain race. Ssupervisors"
bad,"The manager was rarely in the building to do her job, employees clocked in and out whenever they pleased. The workplace was constantly unorganized. Employees treated each other unfairly! Never knew what my schedule was to leave..."
bad,"You won't like it. Tons of customers & tons of attitude & stuff. "
bad,"too much drama, low pay, dont respect hard workers only the ones that dont do anything, not enough hours, alot of drama and allowing certain ones to get away with more stuff then others"
bad,The schedules were all over the place and the pay does not match the amount of slaving they have you doing! The employees are like high school students as far as behavior goes and the manager is hardly ever there.
bad,"Over worked and under paid for the amount of work performed. The company kept all employees except upper management at less than 40 hours per week, therefore we didn’t qualify for medical, dental or vacation benefits."
bad,"Management was inattentive and unavailable most days, and the attitudes of workers was terrible. It was a horrible work experience and you had to beg for breaks or to use the restroom. No promises of advancement and a deadend job. Do not recommend."
bad,"You have eight managers to report too. If someone in charge tells you one thing, the other managers will get mad at you because they had a different plan. You have so many people to report too it's ridiculous. I never knew a week ahead what time I would be off. I literally had to ask what time I was off and those in charge would literally roll their eyes at me and through a fit. It's hard to plan doctors appointments and emergencies. They literally want you to die for this job. One of the managers there is passive aggressive and micromanages you. She's literally toxic and days when she wasn't there, it was nice. Downsides are: you are not praised for your hard work. They also don't apologize when they make a mistake and accuse you of an error. It takes a toll on your mental health. Unless you really need a paycheck, stay. But if it's too much, I would recommend to leave because it's so disorganized, power-driven, egoistic managers who don't care about you."
bad,"The work is fast pace .  Corporate goals are unrealistic. Lack of man power , lack of equipment and hours makes it impossible most times to meet corporate goals ."
bad,No growth opportunities. Management is unprofessional. Policies and procedures are not explained thoroughly. There are not enough hours available. High theft
bad,"they never have hours, there is no space to grow and the pay sucks! they start you at $9 hourly and if you start during holidays they give you $7 hourly if you live with your parents its the perfect job"
bad,Working for Burlington was like slave work. You work so hard but get paid so little with few hours. The workers didn’t make you feel comfortable at all.
bad,The company required to much work for small pay. This is a very stressful retail job I've ever worked. You have to do too many things be a cashier sales floor associate and stock merchandise.
bad,"I don't even know where to start with this place the management is terrible they always cut your hours back and always promote the lazy people the AC doesn't work and they expect you to get work done quickly while you're working in the heat the coworkers are very cool they make work not seem so bad but the work here in general is just terrible the only reason why I haven't quit is because I haven't found a new job but when I do trust me I'm gone, run while you still can."
bad,It was flawed. They over hire so you barley get hoyrs and the hours you do get arent enough for a good paycheck. The management was good just didnt deliever everything they were said out to be. Its a great place for someone looking for experience but other than that not worth it.
bad,i only worked there for 1 day. i was a seasonal on-call associate. i basically just worked in the back putting shoes together and in the correct box by size of shoes.
bad,"I worked at Burlington for over a year. When i first started I loved working there and offend was praised for my work ethic. Then our manger switched to a burlington closer to his home. So we got a new manager and she starts causing everyone to leave. If she didn't like you she became very rude and she would constantly be displeased with your work. Luckily, I was on her good side but most of my co-workers were not. I have never seen so many people quit their job in 2 months. The new manager had promised me a promotion and a raise. She would use the promotion as a way to keep me from taking other job offers. I found out later that she had already given the job to a waitress she saw at WingStop all time. Then i found out that every other sales associate was making 4-6 dollars more than me."
bad,"-hours were longs"
bad,They don't give out enough hours they call you and tell you that you don't have to come like 30 minutes before you about to leave out the house you work one or two days a week.
bad,"ok place to work, to start off after high school, job positions are good, management needs work, salaries need to improve. better clothing and also better treatment for their employees"
bad,Worked as both a sales floor associate/backup cashier and receiving and both jobs were terrible. Rarely had enough people to do the job we were required to do and management was terrible. Team members did not want to work as a team and everyone tried to do their own things. Rules were barely enforced and rarely followed. Pay was terrible. One good thing is breaks weren't closely watched so you could take longer then you were supposed to on your break. Overall would not recommend.
bad,"Lack of cashiers causing the queuing line to get long, making the customers frustrated that they are not being taken care of in an orderly fashion. The full-time Customer Service Supervisor is hardly up front, walks away without informing anyone. Talks down to other associates, gets frustrated if you ask him for help. The new Store Manager treats people like they are beneath her, unless you are willing to suck up to her she treats you like you are nothing and are wasting her time. If you have a complaint about another employee, she will not do anything and tell you to get back to work."
bad,"stressful not enough workers daily, as a part time supervisor I should not be working 12 hours a weeks . when I first got hired there I was told the minimum amount of hours I would work is 25 or 30 which I agree with. I have only receive 15 hours weekly. I felt like they bribe me into accepting the job. then completely change their mind afterwards."
bad,"When first joining the company, I was excited then after working for the company, I have learned that it was not a good company to be apart of. I was promised more hours more pay. I was lied to. I got more pay then was taken off the schedule for 3 weeks straight. This company shows lots of favoritism. When it comes to customer service, they lack training. I spoke to them about the issues, and instead of fixing the problem, they ignored it."
bad,The inconsistent hours leave me no room to pay bills or rent in full every month. I am always short on a bill or rent. I am barely making it Asking for hours or even changing my availability to get more hours still hasn't helped in any way. I currently am seeking work else where the management sucks.
bad,"managers don't do a good job they stay in their office all day and expect us cashiers to answer phones ,clean and attend customers all at once and they get upset when you try to do as they ask. the highest manager rushes cashiers when attending customers and ask that no employee purchases or exchange anything but she will do it through out the day with no care in the world she does not leand by example"
bad,"An employee would go around their ordered department for the day and maintain it nice, clean, and neat. We'd help a customer with any questions they may have and we'd also give out the service of sizing people (meaning in suits, dress clothes, etc.). It is always busy with amazing prices other departments can't beat, but can sure use some new adjustments to the store."
bad,Management do not respect the employee the employees do not work as a team you are not given enough hours weekly and their are no benefits. The work is to much for one employee to do they praise those work work barley nothing because of preference and favoritism.
bad,"I work full time home I recover and run home merchandise, I learned more on floor experience, management is a joke, it's pretty easy job but bad company"
bad,"became immediately ill on very first day of work; found I was allergic to the store. The hours were gruelling, the work was back breaking, and the pay wasn't nearly enough for all they expected us to do. "
bad,I didn't like working for this company. There was no respect for customers and there was no line between sales associates and management. The hours were low and they do not train you a property. This story is unorganized and very dirty.
bad,"management is always the issue. not treating their employees well results to high turn overs. Bunch of young girls who are overly competitive when we are all being paid the same rate, and have the same jobs."
bad,they are very nasty and rude and do not pay us enough or give you enough hours to make a living. they only give you enough hours to give you gas back and forth to work
bad,"I've worked for this company for 6 1/2 years and have seen multiple managers come and go. Depending on what manager worked there depended on how we were treated. One manager allowed his friend to steal half of my hours and two others till he was fired for other things. The next just assumed that I and others weren't doing our job, and treated us with disrespect. Our area manager would take all credit for all work done and lie when issues came up btwn co-workers. I almost came to blows btwn my coworker because she never talked to me about issues she came to her about. I honestly stayed as long as I did because I loved the people I came to really care for like family."
bad,"For starters there is alot of favoritism, they do not know how to treat their employees, managers never do anything accurately, for low pay and no benefits you are treated like slaves, the Union is not supportive of the employees, its never the same staff because the employees are treated so poorly."
bad,I was happy when I got the job but when I started working and after working for them for so long I didn't like it. The management is bad there.
bad,"matter of fact I will. There's nothing nice to say about this job.. I've been trained to work in different areas of the store but I'm still only getting 12hrs a week there, when a lady who was hired a couple days ago is working 30+ hrs (mind you she was promised 30+hrs weekly by a manager who worked at another store not Burlington with her) for the same position I been doing. Everytime we ask for more hours its oh we don't have the payroll.. what!. I just don't understand. I'm looking for a better career cause this one is not cutting it."
bad,"At this job you have to ring out the customers, work the sales floor and keep the store clean and organized. Now i loved this part of the job including taking care of the customers, but the management was not that great they don't know how to talk to people or treat people. Just need better outgoing managers."
bad,management is not on the same page.. I am full-time sales associate but my find myself cleaning everyday each shift I work because a shortage of staff
bad,"Packaging boxes, labeling boxes, ticketing, and material handling. Hardest part of the job was being rushed. The management was Poor, favors were done for people that only knew someone in a higher position."
bad,"My experience  with Burlington coat factory wasn't all that great it worked for my school work balance but every day was struggle mentally at least. it was a learning experience. "
bad,its just not a very good company to work for. there is little room for advancement and generally there is a lack of payroll so essentially you end up in a situation where there is a ton of work to do and no payroll to actually make it so people can be IN the store to do it.
bad,store just opened but there are late closing hours till 12 o'clock they only pay 7.00 an hourunfair teatment
bad,"Burlington Coat Factory its was a good job. I learned a lot of thing ,like costumer servicesd, how to do layway, price mardowns ect. The management was ok but the only thing was that they didnt give me that much hours. My co-worker were very nice, helpless  and friendly. The hardest part of my job was bild babies furniture. The most enjoyble part of the job was costumer service , I always like it to help people."
bad,"At burlington a typical day at work consisted of clocking in, being told to do something big in a little bit of time, struggling to finish the task in the few hours that was given to you to work on it, and clocking out feeling worthless.  Working there I learned that just because people look nice and pretend to be nice its not always how it seems, so working there I learned to never judge a book by its cover.  At Burlington there are 4 managers.  All the departments are divided into sections and each manager is given a section.  My manager was amazing, what you would think a manager should be like.  Everyone makes mistakes so when my manager asked me to redo a whole department on a busy weekend in 4 hours I knew he had made a mistake.  Why you might ask, well we are not allowed to do projects on the weekend because it takes time away from customers, I was the only one in the department that I was working in (half the store), and not to metion the half the store that I was in was not where he wanted me to do the project.  My co- workers were nice to me.  Working at Burlington I made a lot of great new friends and met a lot of new people.  The hardest part of the job was completing what sometimes seeming impossible thing a manager wants me to do.  The most enjoyable part of the job was providing customer service to customers and in return meeting new people. "
bad,it was a long day working conditions were bad.  I didn't learn anything I had to learn on my own.  The supervisor of the receiving team was very rude and not a great leader.  Management wasn't much better.  Co-workers were fine we helped each other get though the day.  Hardest part of the job was finding someone to teach and help you achieve goals that weren't set.  Working with my coworkers.  
bad,this job is one of the worst jobs I've had. the management is very un organized with everything. some days we would have more than enough help other days we would be short staffed. the employees at burlington coat factory don't care to much about anything. they just show up do what they have to do and leave. most of the employees at burlington work there as part time job. the pay is horrible and the staff is rude. 
bad,Easy alot of walking mark down merchadise in the store to meet a weekly goal of 85 percent.
bad,"A day at work is quite monotonous, similuar to adding the same numbers together again and again; with the exception of dealing with angry customers who ask questions like,""The sign says that these are 30% off"" and with a polight tone in your voice and a smile on your face... you take a deep breath and explaine that the %30 off is compared to what the merchandise would be sold for at a regular department store and point it out on the ticket."
bad,"Unpleasant experience working there."
bad,Ser más profesionales. Tener mejor ambiente de trabajo. Los jefes ser más líderes y dar el ejemplo. La paga malísima. Tiene políticas que no se adapta a situaciones laborales reales.
bad,The job doesn't pay enough for the work required. They hold you back from advancement. Does NOT pay enough for you to pay rent. Not a good work experience.
bad,"Terrible management, not organized at all. Racist. Treat employees bad ,reason why they dont last there. They dont have  a bathroom for employee only. Bathrooms are always out of service. Over all of the store need a lot of fixing. Needs better management..."
bad,"Burlington won’t pay you fairly. Period. They will nickel and dime you until you have no choice but leave. There’s hardly no room for growth. Even the, “better,” positions aren’t really better. Just a lot more responsibility, maybe a $0.75 raise. A good place for kids to work. You can’t be a grownup with real responsibility and work for Burlington."
bad,"I was trained 4 hours by videos.  I waited two weeks to get a call from a manager, then they put me for shifts I wasn't available for. During the interview I made it very clear that I did not and could not be on register  and he agreed.  My 3rd shift there I got called up front to learn the register.  I resigned from there then."
bad,Lease Administrator manager was a total dictator.  She would constantly have meetings where she was the only speaker for 3-4 hours at a time.  Very unfriendly environment.
bad,"No work life balance"
bad,"It would be a decent place to work, if it had better management. Fastpaste environment however, the amount of work doesn't fit along with how much we get paid hourly."
bad,"Schedule was set up very poorly, distance and schedule was not worth the pay. Management was rude, poor leadership. Was a good experience to learn from. Learned how to deal with a few scenarios differently. Overall appreciate the opportunity to work."
bad,If you are a manager with integrity and ethics I would steer clear of Burlington. In all of my years in retail this place has been the worst. Women in management are paid less than men usually. There are a lot of  “ office” managers who get paid to sit in the office. There is not that much clerical work to do. The fairness among the staff is horrible. Associates are talked about and demeaned. You can reach out to HR and even voice your opinion in a yearly survey and nothing will be done. I was told not to question things with the regional team and just be happy I had a job. Horrible ethics!! HORRIBLE
bad,A typical day at work would depend on the weather sometimes the store would be really crowded and other days it would be empty. I learned how to be more patient.
bad,"too many mangers about 3 or 4. About 3 supervisors. If one didn't like you, they would put you in a department no one else liked working in, Always wanted you moving around even when there were no customers. Employees always quit that's why they were always hiring. I would never recommend anyone to work here."
bad,"I personally would not work for Burlington again or at least at Grandview location. Not enough help. Inconsistent,very disorganized,and lack of willingness to work. Not given a lot of motivation."
bad,"A company that pretends to be family friendly"
bad,If you are looking for a job that wants you to do 4 other peoples jobs and yours. go for it but they will yell at you when your job is not done and ask you how come.
bad,"My experience with Burlington was so bad ... the pay is $9.00  and comes along with long hours or none at all there’s no inbetween. It is NOT worth it . It seems as if their expectations are so high yet low pay! Also no matter how much one can pickup and reorganize items it’s always a mess! The customers at Burlington have no manners or respect and will throw or leave items on the floor.It is very tiring and if any management sees you trying to take a 5 min break they get onto you ... another problem was dealing with closing time. Burlington closes at 10pm and we give customers an extra 30 mins to get everything they need and leave the store .. Don’t expect to leave right on time because nobody clocks out / leaves until EVERY associate is done with their tasks. You basically leave when it’s 11:30 pm ... Another reason not to work here is that once you’re done with orientation they just throw you out onto the floor and you are left to figure everything out . Nobody Explains what to do you’re expected to know .. there is no training ... nobody even relieves you for break , you have to remind management since they forget."
bad,"Very slow pace if your just hanging clothes and putting stuff away makes time go slow & for $9.00 is not worth it.  You still get tired because your making sure everything is in its place and walking here and there its just boring.  I suggest you be cashier instead at a different store. Also make sure you give a detailed schedule on days and times you can work because 31 hours a week is alot when you have a full time job. Make sure every supervisor and manager is aware of that work schedule that is your part time. Manager who didn't not interview me is just so unprofessional & likes to hang up on people.Yelling at someone over the phone is not professional.  Im glad i quit and got to see what this place is about and its not for me. I would not recommend if you have a full time job either but if your looking for part time, seasonal or temp not for you. Look somewhere else."
bad,"Hard work went unnoticed"
bad,I learned alot but to deal with managers talking down on you and like to make people cry and feel degraded. The magement wasnt the best they lie alot. No pay raise when it was due. They promote people who dont do anything but stay in office all day! The culture wasnt fun because only few people work and help do everything while everyone else sits on their phone goes hiding and staying in their area not being a team. Hardest part of job was going into an environment you are not appreciated in. Easiest part was getting to clock out and go home.
bad,"The management is incredibly awful and extremely racists. The schedules are always majority of the time poorly out together , also the full time  jobs are more likely to go to Caucasian as Mexicans"
bad,"This job is very stressful if you work in the back of the house. There are certain tasks that you have to complete in a day and the management makes you do these things in as little as 15 minutes which is an unfair amount of time to ticket, sensor, size and run a full rack of clothes. The part-time hours are terrible. Sometimes you'll work every day during the week and other weeks you'll only work for two days. That's just a few of the problems with working here."
bad,"It was a cool job at first, but management started to forget that employees are people too. They try to force you to make your minimum wage part time job your main priority. They didn’t make the schedule until the day of most of the times (it’s supposed to be 2 weeks in advance). They would randomly call you in on your day off and get mad when you can’t make it, sometimes they’d call you to do a job in a department you know nothing about. Management was so rude 90% of the times and they would often get mad and  threaten to give your job away for something that’s out of your control. Also the hours were so unpredictable! One day you gotta stay longer than scheduled and the next you only get 3 hours. The positive thing was the discount and the nice co works."
bad,"During my time there  I was a full-time college student making $7.00 an hour being required to close down multiple departments by myself. Unfortunately BCF has a history of taking advantage of their employees and staff members. Working in departments that are as big as some stores in the mall, then being required to upkeep fitting rooms and floor was a constant struggle of appeasement with management."
bad,I like the store as a whole but that specific store was not organized and the management was poor they wouldn’t schedule me for a whole week then tell me I was going to get in trouble for not going in.
bad,"Worst clientele ever, I loved the people I worked with but some of the stuff we had to deal with for what they paid you is absolutely not worth it. The place is falling apart, when they have a big wig show up all heck breaks loose and you have to make it look like we were a completely different store. I was told once to make it look like yonkers. This place is a joke."
bad,As a new cashier I was forced to learn everything on my own and I still had to do everyone else work. I was told to do work that I was not trained for and I was barely given any breaks.
bad,Don’t let the managers at Burlington push you around especially the one in Kissimmee do what is right for you and your wellbeing and always stand up for yourself
bad,"I worked in sportswear which is one of the biggest departments in the store. I rarely got help and was scheduled on busy days by myself and management would not help. The management does not care about their associates, if you call out because a family issue such as a relative passing, they will claim it’s your fault and still give you points. I wouldn’t recommend this job to anyone and even if you’re desperate, this should be your last option to result to."
bad,Horrendous. The place is a cesspool and there's no advancement. Not just that but there's a ton of stress you must face working for these people. Retail can be difficult... But not until you work for Burlington. I would never recommend Burlington.
bad,"I would not recommend this job for anyone .  The pay is poor and they work you like slaves .  I worked in the north east  Philadelphia location which is supposed to be a corporate store , but  The store manager runs this store ghetto and very unprofessional .  Also I never seen a store with more managers than workers . They try to work you without a break and they made me work my whole shift Without a break and let me take my meal 30 minutes before my shift ended ."
bad,"What I mean by the title is this, Burlington is nice to work at if you are looking for a paycheck. Although you will not get far if this is your primary income and you are trying to get ahead. Great for students!"
bad,"Only thing i liked was my schedule & co-workers, but managers didn't know what there doing. Some managers are very unprofessional, very rude don't know how to talk to there employess or treat any good employees good."
bad,During my time with Burlington I witnessed people get fired wrongfully and I experienced unethical behavior from managers. The hire ups were to friendly with their employees.
bad,"This job is good for a person that just wants to make a few dollars on the side but not a job where you can really advance. the hours are picked by a computer system so you will be seeing anywhere from 8- 20 hours a week. schedules are posted week by week so its hard to plan ahead,  you get paid weekly but if you are not a full timer than you want be really bringing much home on Friday. the job goes off a point system so if you call out or if youre late than that gets counted as points and thats how they fire people. management is very unprofessional, the store is so unorganized. its 12 registers but they only have 2 cashiers working. alot of favortism and the work atmosphere is depressing. everyone complains on how they dont like working there so the negative tension is thick. its a good job for the holidays and maybe a job if you are just graduating from high school."
bad,"i tbh hated it, they really could care less bout there workers, i still did my job and didn't slack off but to see others do it and not get anything for it was horrible only because they got along with managers and yet  id see hard workers get the boot for missing one day or being a little behind it was just bad management, i couldn't really enjoy a work place like this when the slackers get rewarded and the workers get the boot"
bad,"Management doesn't help you with situations with co-workers or customers, they promise full time positions but never give them to you because of benefits, they have ""favorites"" and give them the most hours and shifts. I was locked in the store at closing time because they didn't bother to see if I was even still in there. I know many co-workers who have had problems with the management there and had to call corporate many times. The only time i asked for time off was for grievance and ever since then they haven't called me back and I've been calling and going in and no one will tell me if I'm fired for any reason, on call, or what. And this has been ever since January. I've been told to call corporate about this. It is not a place you would want to work."
bad,not a good place to work always running out of bags and not good pay store manager is very disrespectful didn't like it at all for all the things you have to deal with its not the best pay at all
bad,"This location is HORRIBLE! Everything from the management, pay rate, environment, and employees! I was never properly trained. Had it not been for my previous job I would have been a lost cause. The management is ridiculous. Their level of communication is extremely low. The employees are not welcoming to new people.. I was walked passed and not spoken to for hours standing next to someone until I spoke first. They treat you as if you're doing the hardest job in the world and they're the only people that can do it. I'm sure this problem isn't company wide, but this particular location needs to be staffed appropriately. The pay is NOT worth showing up! No matter how much experience you have. I was very close to calling HR but I did myself a favor and resigned. If you desperately need a job go for it. If not, there are plenty of retail stores that you can choose from in Tyler."
bad,There's not much to say I didn't really like it. This is a type of job for people that don't have too many bills. The management can be good but the pay sucks if you definitely working hard.
bad,"The only interest about that job was serving the people, management  was not willing to flow with the employees, the pay rate was very low and here was not enough benefits."
bad,"When I worked here I worked as a customer service supervisor, at first I loved the job and SOME of management. The pay for this position sucked and you couldn't even take care of expenses with the pay. My cashiers were great an respected me however when ever I needed any type of assistance with the little few that didn't want to do their job I never got help. Management just walked around on their phone and when called to the front to assist a customer it was always an attitude and didn't want to help the customer. The store manager was not friendly, and his assistant was two faced an two faced can get. I was promised a position an was lied to, managers would laugh in your face when it came to trying to advance. The turn over rate of cashiers was awful, they had new cashiers almost every day and three times a week. I strongly feel that the Burlington in Huntsville should not be there , the back room for layaway was a freaking mess and nothing was never in the right spot so customers layaway were constantly lost and no one could ever find them. The customer service since I been back in there is off the top awful. The prices are good but that's the only thing good about this store."
bad,"Laid back establishment to work for, however they do not offer enough hours to work nor enough pay to make a living for yourself. Hard to move up as well."
bad,Very Unorganized and very witty schedules. Never a steady schedule. Come to work work for either 4-9 hours. Never really 9 hours more than one day.
bad,I mean its what you expect at retail. The customers are ratchet but its a cheap store so it attracts the cheap people. Which include the loud and ghetto. The pay and hours is what you expect at retail so that was not my problem with Burlington. My problem was management. The dirty teeth manager there and the assistant manager who asks like a female but was supposed to be a man talking about people behind their backs and gossiping like a schoolgirl. As far as management the worst I've ever encountered. I would suggest going somewhere else because its just not worth the headache unless you're dead broke.
bad,"days were generally tiring, but it's work so that's okay. there's a lot of negativity and in some cases, bullying among the associates. dealing with customers teaches you discipline. the hours are terrible and often times, managers played favorites to decide who gets them."
bad,As an employee at Burlington I have witnessed the way they hire people and fire them before they are eligible for benefits. The managers do not work together and the employees have no structure.
bad,"Very tiring, low pay, short breaks, coworkers are very judgmental and sometimes rude, not enough employees, they make you stay after hours and long hours."
bad,"Whenever I come into Burlington Stores, I am always ready to work for however many hours there is to work.  There is always something new coming off of the truck.  We all take breaks at the same time and finish at the same.  I have learned a lot about different vendors,"
bad,very unorganized and do not have good time management. Short breaks and not enough workers and you must pick up the slack for others mistake no matter what department your in.
bad,"3 out of 5 managers are willing to help and talk to you about what needs to be done, the other two expect for it to be said once and very poorly said at that and to be done then and there. Receiving gets a lot of backlash from its manager. Very hostile environment in receiving. Pay could be better. Hours suck, don't expect to get more than 25 hours."
bad,not available my problem was not with store it was just very hard for me at that time to get back and forth to work it public transportation
bad,Doesn't pay much. Can't get by on the amount they pay you and they don't give out any hours. They show a lot of favoritism to certain workers. They hire a lot of people and don't give any hours.
bad,Made great friends.  Management plays favorites.  Never any work to do and the day just drags on and on. Pay is poor and some weeks you only work 2 days.
bad,"Busy and rude customers more than not. Management is ill informed, and do not resolve issues appropriately. Hardest part of the job is customers that come in to basically make your job harder or just simply to ruin your day."
bad,a different manager might make it a better place no room for advancement unless you do things that are not suppose to be done
bad,"cant survive of this job but you work with great poeple "
bad,Shipping/Receiving its a fast paced heavily populated company
bad,Had upper management issues and was not structured well but was a fun place to work at sometimes.
bad,"Burlington as employment, needs assistance. It should only be for teenagers. Managment is horrible."
bad,"Corporate is horrible...little pay, and as soon as you receive an advancement or pay raise, your hours get cut in half. Managers belittle their employees, and I've seen too many, that actually worked hard, be mistreated, so they're forced to resign...nobody's trained. The company itself doesn't care about their employees; but concentrate more on making money. How can an employee deliver superb customer service, in such a negative environment"
bad,Receiving dept is organized and Co workers and management are nice and knowledgeable however front store management are rude and do not provided breaks except for lunch. No training what so ever and paid almost minimum wage for long hours on your feet. 
bad,"working here was like a step back in life, and depressing, every day at work felt like a month long."
bad,A very busy day I learn how to put up shoes displays & management was good & co-workers work as a team.
bad,I've notice that some of the BCF are supervised differently and the turn around is no stop.
bad,"I worked for BCF offsite (warehouse). The work load wasn't too bad, and some of my fellow co-workers were okay too. My issues was the management staff. I didn't mind the heavy lifting, stacking boxes, loading the trucks, etc. I just don't think my hard work was apprieciated by the management. I was, in my opinion, one of the best workers there. I gave 110% to the job. I even did work outside of my job description, just because it had to get done, and I knew how to do it. I was even discimination going on that site."
bad,"I would go to work, get yelled at by customers and the managers. Managers there did not care about you as a person...or even a good associate. They were ridiculous. My old co-workers...well I feel bad for them. The hardest part of this job is keeping your mouth shut...or not crying from being yelled at. There was nothing enjoyable about working here."
bad,Upon working at this specific location management were cruel and mean and would show favoritism to certain employees. Often times you would barely get enough hours to cover anything. Hours fluctuate never know when you are going to work. Management talks to employees without any respect. Over worked for small amount of pay and under minimum wage.
bad,Workers are lazy and don’t care about others. I’ve never had a job I didn’t like or didn’t have fun with until I worked here. Maybe it’s just this location.
bad,"Lines are long af since it’s the holiday season. Not enough cashiers on registers to shorten the checkout time for shoppers. Managers don’t ask you questions, they jump to conclusions and assume you did something simply bc you happen to be standing near whatever the issue is. I never got officially trained. My first day I watched another cashier checkout a few people for about an hour or two then I was told I had to take over because she needed to go clean her department. I am a fast learner but sometimes mistakes happen at the worst possible times and there just so happens to never be a manager around to help. You’d think with having a bunch of new hires dealing with money they’d designate a manager to stand up at the register To assist when issues arrive but What do I know, I’m not the CEO."
bad,Management is bad most of the time they are talking. They have a lot of petty people working there so be careful with who you trust. Costumers are interesting that's as nice as I can put it. Oh and if your looking for full time employment just skip this. Discounts are okay they only give %15 too employees So it's not bad. Hours are flexible and sometimes they won't even give you any hours. For the whole week.
bad,"The job in itself isn't hard, but the time limit and restrictions make it impossible. All managers agree it isn't fair but the times are forced on to everyone to the point they have a rotating door of employees. No one stays long, if you do you'll only get burned in the end. This isn't a biased review, just a sad fact."
bad,My position was freelance so I did not get the full experience. I did enjoy creative writing but the pay was not worth my time at that point in my life. I was freelance copywriter.
bad,Management here needs extreme work. They are    rude and never properly train new employees. The only thing the made BURLINGTON good was the coworkers
bad,I have been working at Burlington for about 5 months and and we never have a competent LP to stop people from stealing or barely enough people to run the store during peek hours. Most of the associates that work on the floor are usually up front ringing and the registers run slow all the time.
bad,This job is literally for those who are between the ages of  16 - 21. I would not make this a full time job (only during the holidays) this is more so a part time job to get in and get out while you are in school and or awaiting a better position. The pay is degrading to the amount of work they have you do and the different roles you are expected to act as and or be. The only good thing about the discount is double discount days which is near the holidays.
bad,"If I would have known all that I know now(close to 2 weeks later) I would’ve went elsewhere. Coworkers constantly tell me that people will go to break and never return. Management is all over the place, slow paced, and high turnover rate. Pay starts at $9 even though I have previous experience at bigger stores than them. I think if the pay was slightly higher, employees would perform better.Very very high turnover rate."
bad,"It was productive but not a good place to work,They treat you as if you are an adolescent management yells You’re not allowed to move work more than a four hour shift as if you were a minor we’re grown adults we do not need to be yelled that we can be spoken to There’s  constantly yelling from every management there"
bad,Very uncomfortable place to work having negative supervisors. Schedule is very inconsistent. Store stays hot. Restrooms are usually nasty. Floors aren’t clean. Whole store is unorganized because floor people aren’t made to do their job.
bad,"everyday if you are new you will get blamed even if you were not the one to make the mistake. if you try to stand up for yourself, they don't listen or care. manager picks favorites."
bad,The environment was ok the professionalism was not the company turnover rate is outta this world it’s definitely not a place where you can live off of
bad,Overworked and underpaid. Low morale. Favoritisms. Too much drama amongst employees. Poor shift scheduling. Filthy rest rooms. Poor climate control. No seniority benefits.
bad,"At Burlington the only good thing was having a very nice manager, she was kind and friendly to the staff, however, the employees sometimes take advantage of her kindness. "
bad,"Idk about the other stores, but management does have “favorites”, and those people were the only ones working getting hours. The pay is minimum wage yet they try and work is like it’s a sweat shop"
bad,"Burlington is a good job for students or first time workers. It is a very fast paced work environment especially on weekends and holidays. I left Burlington because of management and eventually the pay wasn’t enough, you’re basically receiving minimum wage."
bad,"Great place for a young person to work, but pay is minimum wage and raises are below average. Work is hectic and face paced. a challenging place to work."
bad,"Better training , not people friendly "
bad,"Over my 4+years of service to Burlington the associates have slowly been treated worse and worse, retracting benefits, outsourcing job positions, frequent changes in upper management. My store manager is completely useless, but knows the right people so he gets away with not preforming his job properly and has no problem making someone else his scapegoat. Promotions are promised but never fulfilled. I loved my job 2 years ago. The insurance is awful, no paid maternity leave. They have unrealistic expectations for what one person can complete. They have no problem stacking extra responsibilities on someone but they do not like to compensate for it."
bad,"Not a good place to work. The manager doesn't schedule. The supervisors are a mess. There's nothing but favoritism. Nobody listens, Everyone is for themselves."
bad,"Fun place to work but you don’t get many hours, Some managers are cool but the hiring manager isn’t . Very low Pay it’s not worth Working There. You have really nice co workers who help each other out but I wouldn’t recommend working here."
bad,a great store with alot of potential however it is stiffled with coorporate management and thier multidirectional agendas and lack of consistant communication. Today lets do it this way next week its why did YOU do it like that. next month we should be this way. not to mention lets ask the full time employees to be department managers without the title or compensation and ask them to see over the entire store be a cashier and stock person. no you dont have anyone else in the department with you its just you...you and you...the part timer comes in few days but just end up cashier.
bad,Just a overall crazy unprofessional unorganized place to work the managers don’t communicate the workers are loud and unruly it’s just very stressful to work in that enviornment
bad,This is an ok place to work just a lil while. I wasn’t here for a long time. But they tend to hire most people for part time only. No room for advancement.
bad,Micro management. Hourly pay is below minimum wage. Burlington does offer benefits. Sick pay 5 hours a year. Store manager are incompetent and a lot of favoritism.
bad,"It’s a good first job but not reliable."
bad,"P-T very minimal hours.  Had to complete the traditional first day paperwork at home on my own time before I began the job.  Very low wages.  No benefits.  High pressure for the minimal pay and hours.  Showed up for work one day and was told ""we don't need you today"" even though I was scheduled - they changed the schedule at the last minute.   Very unfair.  Employee emergency fund paid by the employees - not the company.  Clearly they do not respect their employees and prefer high turn-over to investing in employee retention."
bad,"A typical day starts @ 6 am, wearing all black, 3rd floor of the building where it is very hot. "
bad,"This seemed like a great place to work at first. They gave me short hours when transitioning into the workplace. But it started to go downhill after that. There wasn't one day that I had off that the managers didn't try to call me in to cover someone else's shift. Also, they'd always ask me to stay longer than what I was scheduled. While this might not bother the next person, I always made plans around my work schedule and it really stunk being put on the spot all the time. I will say that I absolutely loved my coworkers. Great teamwork. The managers were really the problem. They always called us out if we did something wrong instead of taking us to the side and telling us how we could have done better. Typical day at work was hectic. There would be times when no one was in the store, and then once one person walked in, it seemed like a herd of people came. Even if I was on the sales floor, trying to do my job, I would always have to back up cashier. They never scheduled enough cashiers on busy days. We would also have to pick up the slack when other workers did not do his or her job correctly."
bad,Not a career just a job not many hours. Would not suggest working here if you looking for a good paying job with hours never gove raises or advancements in the company
bad,"It was a comision based job but no one mentioned it for a long time. i lost a lot of sales because of that. co workers were helpful but sudden management change happen, witout any notice."
bad,Barely got any hours communication skills was horrible.  Wasn't Alot of stability there everything was half done feel like nothing was serious about the job. They didn't appreciate our great work ethic.
bad,"A terrible company to work for. Dept managers are not supported or trained to do the job. so the hourly workers dont stand a chance."
bad,The job would be great if management knew what they were doing with the day to day operation of the store and if they dealt with their employees with respect and provided room for growth and advancement. I would not recommend anyone to work here if you are looking for something stable. This job is best for high school students or recent grads looking for work experience.
bad,"management is very poor."
bad,"The upper management was the most rudest. Stock team manager at the time I got hired was very nice but as she transferred to the front end, they replaced her with someone who very disrespectful and rude to their employees. As for the Pay, starts at $8/hour ends at $9/hour with little to no room for advancement in the business no matter how long you are there. They do not ever have full time employees and won’t hire full time unless management. Not allowed over 40 hours and only guaranteed 12 hours a week. $90/week at $9/hour 12 hours a week after taxes. Not even enough to pay rent for the month. They work you to the bone just like any other retail in the stock room, expecting you to be fast so that they can have you clock out sooner so that they don’t have to pay you much more. Managers get a ton of vacations and bonuses while their employees are treated like the dirt they walk on. You will not get health insurance and are required to work weekends if you work sales floor. They are strict on their dress code."
bad,"Work at Burlington could range from hectic to boring, with the holidays being the obvious exception. The quality of the company itself cannot be shown by the quality of one store, but this much can be said:"
bad,"very fast paced, good discounts, horrible manangement, no benefits for part timers, low pay, low hours. Most people that work there have to have two jobs if they want to pay rent or other bills."
bad,"They had no store"
bad,"I'm a part time cashier since July, 2017. The pay is alright but the hours are very poor. Management is horrible. They have favorites and the work schedules are all over the place. I would not recommend this company if you're looking for a stable job, it's more like a side job due to the hours they give to employees."
bad,The company does not care about their employees. My store did not offer time off for sickness or any advancement for employees. The open door policy is a joke. There is retaliation for voicing concerns.
bad,It's a decent place to work except for the fact that there is no proper management hierarchy. Some people feel entitle and don't want to do the job they are getting paid to do. The breakroom and bathroom is unsanitary sometimes not even toilet paper is available. Pro's employee discounts
bad,"Short morning work-like a workout."
bad,Just wasn't a good fit for me. Since i worked as Loss Prevention there was nothing for me to do and i just stood around all day being bored. The other associates were friendly but alienated me.
bad,"bad management"
bad,"When I first stated It seemed nice. Dealing with people and cleaning the store. After awhile when I noticed I wasn't getting anymore hours, low pay and It didn't look as if advancing to a higher position was nowhere in site, I decided to move on"
bad,Supervisors are too harsh and pick on certain individuals ALL THE TIME. Hours are horrible and pay is almost minimum wage for all they expect you to do.
bad,"Not bad for a summer job. However, if I had to stay there long term, I would have grown extremely depressed. I had to scan all inventory to search for items that were to be given a price reduction. The goal was to reach 80% compliance. However, due to theft and poor policies to retag merchandise, it was just about impossible. The managers had to know this but pretended to be blind to the fact. Thus, took their frustration out on the staff. I faired well, but my co-workers within the department were often yelled at for little to no reasons. The General manager was horrid. However, the operations manager (my direct supervisor) was very nice."
bad,My experience working at burlington was horrible. I applied to be a stock associate and they switched me to being a cashier. I had no training and was always getting in trouble for the mistakes i made. The managers where horrible and they where not flexible with me.
bad,you dont get very much hours and the pay isnt what a person can live off of.The only benefit about working here is the discount that is provided and the lay way thats available year round
bad,"Only thing productive was your work area. You had to take merchandise out of box, put ticket on, & send it to another department for checking and have them send it out."
bad,"I like working at Burlington. I just could not stand the people that I was working with. The employees were not trained properly because the manager were new and was sure about what he needed to do. Maybe it was just too much from what he expected to do. Anyway, I understood my job duties, I was just led by other members who wanted to be manager try to tell me what to do on a everyday basis. However, my job then became affected because I was confused on who really was the manager. I began to get uncomfortable with working with specific people. I wasn't sure who to report any concerns I may had throughout the day. Although the job was easy, the people who I worked with were very hard to deal with. I loved to help customers. They would come in the store with no idea of what they wanted to buy. Before the left I knew that they would be satisfied after I helped to find something according to the occasion."
bad,I enjoyed working with my coworkers. They were lively and were quite fun. There were no problems until our lead manager moved and we had a new manager come in. This is when things got worse and poor management killed this store. There was no organisation and one manager made multiple employees quit. This was also happening during our Christmas season so it was the worst time for us not to have any cashiers.
bad,"A company with lots of promises who is trying to be competitive with TJX and Kohls. There is no way. New stores are looking great, but most are old and dirty. There is not a day with out some issues like call offs, no tools to succeed. People are paid poorly and company hires mainly Pt employees to save. There interest in people and culture is just shiny on the top, not so much the rest. Regional VP gives directions, comes back with SVP and it is wrong and you take the fall. My experience was awful  and I don't recommend. Some team members and managers were great and fun to work with."
bad,"Working here was very overwhelming. With management that was not very concerned with their Sales Team. They have a points system which I think is very stupid. The associates must not reach a certain amount of points for being tardy or absent, if so then they will be terminated. The only best thing that I liked about working here was getting a weekly paycheck."
bad,"Burlington lived strongly by the phrase, ""customer is always right."" They never worked with their employees when situations occurred, atleast the old management didn't."
bad,a typical day at Burlington as cashier I normally handle guest returns answer phones calls make layaways and handle regular transactions. Working there I've learned how to create layaway plans and how to pack and store them. The management there is very friendly they make it a fun environment to work in alone with the co-workers. The hardest part about working there is the fact that they are always under staffed and it makes it a little difficult to get everything done. The most enjoyable part of working here is talking to our customers helping them with any issues they may having and seeing a smile on their faces when their leaving.
bad,"work load is too much, the amount of employee per department is not enough.you can not get a full time job only part time and sometime you can work 5 days but only 4 hours per day. good for students but not for some one lives on paycheck"
bad,"Burlington has shown a recent trend of not valuing employees and always looking for a way to cheat them. Employees are nameless, faceless, and replaceable at any time."
bad,"I enjoyed meeting the people that I did during my time in retail. However, working here made me learn that retail jobs are not for me."
bad,Enjoyed customer service experience. People sometimes give it a horrible name but I enjoyed making people smile and helping them get gifts for the season.
bad,didn't give good hours and always laying off people. Burlington has nice clothes but the work environment is not great and they didn't have a lot to offer as far as benefits.
bad,Getting paid at poverty level made it difficult to get things important done. Expecting employes to work full time hours with no compensation benefits. Managers being able to do what ever they want and not help the store upkeep. No pay raises.
bad,"very busy location. poor management, even worse pay. customers were terrible, lines always long but at least you could keep busy until the end of your shift because you were constantly ringing up customers"
bad,"This place has horrible management, the employees I work with are rude people always running there mouth and all gossip as if there still stuck in high-school. It's rat invested and always smell in the store. Place just sucks to be honest."
bad,i was young working two jobs so therefore it wasnt complicated i liked it i really got along with all co workers which i liked the most
bad,I will never do it again. They don't pay enough for the job responsibilities. Management was not supportive and at times could become personal with you. If they didn't like you...they showed it.
bad,Everyone there complains because of the workload vs the pay. Very messes and unorganized place. There's no clarity for expectation. Would recommend this organization to anyone.
bad,Typical day would consist of unloading trucks all day for 8 hours without any help or supervision. Co workers play around and don't work. Hardest part of the job was probably waking up early to start work at 4am.
bad,"I liked the job when I was first hired but ever since new management came in, everything went downhill. I would not recommend anyone work for this particular burlington unless it's a last resort. I loved my coworkers but management is truly terrible. They don't know the meaning of respect."
bad,"Some nice customers.  Coworkers more worried about other coworkers jobs and duties more so then the management worries.  Self appointed supervisors on sales floor. Too much gossiping amongst employees and managers. Not a professional work environment at all. Managers never schedule employee breaks. They will let you work a whole shift and never ask or schedule your lunch break. Managers let it be known that they hate their jobs and therefore will try to make your workday a living nigtmare. Managers do not communicate with each other. One will tell you to do one task, then another will come along and put you on another task. Then they will fight about who's right. Its a daily power struggle between management.  Employees are hostile, conniving and cut throat.  You will be worked hard and get burned out. You will not get the proper recognition unless you are sucking up to management literally.  The pay is definitely not worth the aggravation.  Nasty, hateful managers with an axe to grind unless you like listening to their personal business and  man troubles."
bad,"management was my main problem, they kept telling the employees that its a right to work state, poor cleanliness requests."
bad,I just hang clothes and sensor them. As well as shoes. Not too exciting.
bad,sales associate learned to be patient organized get along with all coworkers
bad,It's a dead in no job no way to advance! After five years after doing almost every job in store I felt stuck. The hours were great in the beginning and as years went on they got worse.
bad,"The company attracts lower-income classes to generate sales. These customers actively harass employees while the employees never receive wage increases or safety. The management care nothing about the workers who interact with customers. In fact, the store management sabotaged my job status in retaliation for my reporting their bully-behavior to corporate headquarters. As a supervisor, I only received one wage increase over 3 years which brought me to $9.25 hourly with no medical or dental insurance."
bad,"Really disgusting working there. Management was very rude and inconsiderate to workers needs, i.e bathroom breaks, cleanliness, etc. Bugs and mice got into clothing boxes and food boxes in the back room."
bad,"It's a great place to work just at times management would not help you with your schedule if you couldn't get there at a certain time because of transportation issues. "
bad,"management is not great. no flexible schedule , short breaks, not any floor staff"
bad,"I imagine the experience is different according to your location, but I just did not enjoy my time there. I was exposed to a lot of things like gangbangers and drug dealers on a daily basis. I was offered drugs a few times by the customers. I saw many things that I will never forget...it was definitely a learning experience..."
bad,.I was not happy working there because everyone did not get along which got in the way of being profefessionals
bad,"Typical day: Majority of the co-workers don't actually work, and can be found talking or ""passing time"".  Constantly beat down by upper management.  They don't recognize successes yet never let you miss out hearing about a failure or a bad score, constantly restructuring and laying people off."
bad,it was to much going on at the work place to many people bringing there outside life to work with them 
bad,burlington was a great place to work most days i enjoyed the customers. there are alot of regulars that make your day very plasent. and other days are not as good. as with any job. burlingtons management is very unorganized and there do favor certain employees. they change the sheduale all the time. there is no room for advancements. and pay raises are not worth all the stress. this would be a great job for teenagers. you can not provide for a family with this job. also you never get out on time. you might be scheduled 3-4 days a week then your basically on call. your hours get cut alot of times also. and your asked to stay if its to busy.
bad,"The hardest part of the job is crabby customers that despite going far and beyond still not satisfied . The most enjoyable part of the job is working with co workers that work hard but can also have fun at work at the same time while working, also the different types of people of different cultures and all walks of life. I tend to have an ear for accents from different languages, from people from the south to people from over seas."
bad,"The job is very unprofessional, similar to high school there are rumors spread, gossip, and favoritism shown. The hours are not stable and definitely under paid."
bad,Long
bad,The most enjoyable part of working at Burlington was able to learn and gain experience as my first time job.
bad,"I would start my shift off with a very disorganized and cluttered department. The department looked like noone ever worked there or made it look descent for the customers. My shift went by so fast because I was constantly always cleaning the department and I couldn't have a chance to do other duties besides the department. I learned that the clothing had to be colorized a certain way. I learned how to dress mannequins the proper way and I helped customers with thier purchases. The management wasn't great at all, I thought the empolyees were not treated fairly. I felt like I was a slave and I was appreciated but I needed to save money for college. Team work with the co-worker was bad, it was hard to get help from others with your department. I was always put in another department to help because I was fast at cleaning. The hardest part of the job was finding where to begin to clean, thats how disorganized it was for me. The most enjoyable was being able to see all the new items that came in."
bad,"Its a growing company but still has a lot to learn, poor employee retention and favoritism really disappoint me."
bad,If your looking for a part time job then this job was a good job. The Co-workers did not talk to you so you pretty much was by yourself.
bad,"Well, Burligton can be a great retail company to work for, but the down fall is they dont want to pay employees enough money to get the job done. Your job is always on the line and at anytime you dont feel very secure."
bad,"I have worked for other off price retailers and I can honestly say they are better. Burlington offers no creativity for merchandising. They just want every display to look like the picture. As a manager, be prepared to work 10-12 hour days 6 days a week. There is no budget for you to run the store properly but everything still has to get done. So it’s common to come in on days off to finish projects."
bad,"Retail is a busy job.this was my first retail job. I learned from ground up, all areas. I liked learning new things and how this are set up. My partner and I worked hard completing tasks."
bad,"My time at Burlington may have been short but it felt like a endless cycle. When new management under Monique came, they only care about the money made & how the store looks. They always put the schedule up last minute the day before the new week begins & they barely work with people schedules. It’s either you devote all your time to them or they’ll attempt to guilt trip you to come into work on your off days bringing up your points. So childish and unprofessional. Who would want to work for a company like that?"
bad,"Zero communication between all levels of the company/store. Corporate and managers are constantly changing truck deliveries and putting Receiving out of work with no heads up, or demanding for them to work on days they were told they were going to have off. High turnover rate because of this, and the little pay. They're always so desperate for workers they literally hire incompetent people and allow them to basically just stand around while the few good workers do everything."
bad,Well they let me go and kept two of the most slowest people ever. Store is really going under. The management is nasty and rude you don’t get any hours
bad,Ok job nothing more nothing less. I was pregnant so I needed a little change in my pocket. Discount 15% wasn’t nothing to go wow over but it was something.
bad,"Training is insufficient. Not enough payroll allocated for the workload to pay hourly staff, therefore salary managers are expected to complete task which result in 70 hr work weeks at no additional pay."
bad,I have never worked for a more disorganized company. I won’t go into great detail as if I do they will definitely know who I am. They have some serious organizational issues starting from a corporate level. They never gave me proper training on certain metrics that are “very important” but no one every trained me on them. I feel like the management that I was under was more concerned about their future and getting promoted  than cultivating new talent.
bad,Too much management changes. Stress high. Lots of co workers not happy. Pay not up to other retail stores in the area. High turn over rate. Expect lots for little pay
bad,"Not such a good store to work at, my checks weren’t that good even though I would put in a lot of hours. I did a lot of work that I wasn’t supposed to do, only because the managers wouldn’t want to do them. I had to pick up a lot of heavy boxes, and I once sprained my wrist because someone else didn’t want to do their work."
bad,"No advancement while working not enough hours to live off of . Too little pay , an poor management within the company no room to grow lack of integrity from others"
bad,"A typical day ay work consists of me checking out customers and assisting them with their purchases, refunds, etc.  In between, I am expected to keep the cashier area clean and orderly, as well as keep the line area clean.  "
bad,I do like our 30% discount we get. It really comes in handy around the holidays and also around back to school days. Especially the layaway service they got.
bad,This company only cares about money. They don't like it when employees speak their minds. I don't feel like i was treated good they played favoritism. The General manager was so rude. He didn't care if you were feeling sick or anything he wanted you to come in. if you asked to leave early because you didn't feel good he would make you feel guilty for it. I called in 1 time and he told me that there was only 1 person on the floor if i didn't come in come to find out he lied there was well over 5 more employees working.
bad,Every pore LP leader ship at Burlington.  I would never recommend no one to work for Burlington horrible LP.  It’s not a very strong leader ship at that LP department from the director down
bad,"Underpaid, overworked, extremely stressful. The most enjoyable part for me was my coworkers. Management was soso the turnover rate is high............"
bad,"The job is the usual retail shenanigans. Management is poor, pay is minimum wage. There was no raises given out, due to the minimum wage increase despite employees hard work. Management have great managing skills but lack people skills."
bad,"The work environment with Store Manager and up is poor. They (SM, DM, RVP) will defend the store managers whether they are right or wrong. Work day consisted of working until the store manager felt like it was an okay time for the assistants to go home. No work life balance."
bad,"Recieving is only mornings, they dont have set truck delivery schedules apparently (bull) they can only make a schedule on a day 2 day basis because of the inconsistent deliveries (also bull)."
bad,"Felt under appreciated, was taken advantage of because I was actually competent while my coworkers weren’t, had to pick up their slack , could not talk to management"
bad,This job was good to begin as a starter job but it wasn’t at a livable wage and I worked ridiculous shifts that turned to doubles at 14hrs. Or sometimes it would be only a couple days a week. The benefits were nonexistent because I wasn’t full time. There were a couple good managers but only a couple. The people who worked there on the sales floor could be more chatty than need be. Overall a good starter job
bad,"The scheduling is horrible. You never have the same 2 days off its a surprise every week. They dont have loss prevention there at all times and shoplifting is out of control. I left because i got threatened by a shoplifter and my manager didn't back me up."
bad,"Maybe its just FL but 9 dollars an hour for work that almost any other job would pay you for maybe $11+ is ridiculous. The only good manager was the stock manger, the store manager was a just plain terrible. All other supervisors were okay. Coworkers gossiped way too much but thats expected anyways."
bad,Hours aren't good. Can work 1-5 days out of the week 4-5hrs a day. Only time job gets busy is November through  December after that job goes down bad.Minimum wage. No pto or paid sick time. They dont care about their employees in any way unless you kiss ....
bad,"Constantly busy which means constantly doing recovery and running go backs. Can be pretty stressful at times, poor management, inconsistent hours, poor benefits and not worth the pay."
bad,Very sad place to work. Management is no good. They lie about how the policy works. Don't give enough hours and they are very unpredictable. Stressful place
bad,"The cary store is a joke management changes schedule at will they make you work longer than scheduled,work 8 or more hrs NO LUNCH and MAYBE a break....trust me I worked there"
bad,"Burlington has some amazing people, but the organization of the work load and the scheduling is very unorganized and can be quite stressful. Overload their workers."
bad,Everyone was always in a bad mood. There was always a mess. It seemed like everyone hated their job. They would always call me on my days off. Literally every single day off they would call if I could go in. I hardly had time with my family.
bad,This place is only really a good place for people who are in college full time of people who just need extra cash to spend. This is not a place I would choose to work for my whole life.
bad,I am over worked under paid been with the company for 5 years and moving up is a a favorite contest. Not a place for a person with a family or any financial responsibilities.
bad,"The Hiring process wasn't long, but once you're hired things get ify. Don't bother trying telling them you have a second job, even though you only get 12 hours a week, they hate it when you're not available when they want you to be. The training is mostly on the computer but actual hands on training is unreliable. Many of the people forget you're new and will leave you unprepared with long lines and no help. Many get annoyed if you ask for help or to be shown how to do something. Much of the stress comes from not being fully trained in how to do one task before being told to do a totally different one."
bad,"This store is hectic, stressful and will have your pulling it your hair,I worked here a year and a half, I loved my co workers that's about it management allows customers to get crazy and management runs and hides"
bad,"Working here was nothing but stress and it took a toll not only on my physical health, but also a lot of my mental health as well. All the managers treat you like you're not even a person. They just want you to work faster than a regular human and even if you're doing a great job and have a good pace, they still complain and don't acknowledge you. "
bad,"Not only are customers rude, the managers only talk to you to get down your throat about something. Nothing is ever good enough. Management sucks as they let everyone slack around and not do their job. Infact, no one does their job. Managers called employee names and treated them just awful."
bad,I told the manager I could not work weekends except for the firs 4 hours each sat and sun but that was not good enough. 
bad,"Great place for strong creative merchandiser to work.  The stored environment is extremely fasted paced, coverage and recruiting store hourly talent is a challenge."
bad,i love the discount  but the way the treat employess is sad... the  do holiday pay try to give u left hour so you vocation time.. manganet is rude aand make you feel uncomfortable. they belittle... while working there i was so stressed out and felt very unappericaited.
bad,"Working for Burlington is not bad, but the management team makes it almost unbearable! No one is ever on the same page and favoritism is extremely blatant. I’m not sure how management is at other Burlington stores, but the management at Steelyard is completely terrible. Also, those in positions of management (supervisors, keyholders, css, assistant manager, store manager) do not know how to talk to their employees and are very rude."
bad,Honestly I shouldn’t feel like coming to work scared thinking it’s my last day just because managers be having personal problems with associates. Just for being yourself & being free spirit.
bad,"If you have no job experience or have not worked in a while it is not a bad place to start. At times is fast paced and can be stressful, other times is slow."
bad,most of my co workers were pleasant and fun to be around. Management had no clue half the time with what they were doing and they didn't take very good care of their associates. Its not a clean environment either.
bad,Did not take care of employee.  Very unorganized.  No manager was great. Poor leadership leading to poor production.  Managers do not communicate with each other not to subordinates.
bad,"i would complete every task i had.. sometimes i would work double shift, from opening to close.. but they wouldnt apreciate your hard work i ve work here for 4 years and  allways with minimum wage... i wouldnt recommend this place to work.."
bad,"management very poor. I worked very long hours and been paid salary. never been late to work. I was a very hard worker, organized and efficient.a lot is expected from workers. As corporation running the company workers are just a number. no appretiation for good workers."
bad,"Although the work is easy and not a hassle there is very poor management. The only thing that made it worth going to was fellow coworkers. Management was an absolute joke noone communicated things to one another. Supplies to do basic needs of the job were rarely found or had. Customers orders were constantly lost as well. "
bad,Stressful work place work most holiday part timers get less than 20 hours per week fast pace pay very unfair its all about who likes you not your work ethic
bad,"The css are some rude people, when it got busy they left you to do it to yourself, Management was rude too, expect for this one manager. It's a bad place if you don't speak Spanish this is not the place for you. One of the Managers got mad at me for not speaking the language. Hardest part Head Manager always messed up my schedule so I never knew my hours. My hours got cut after I told a manager on a css. I did not enjoy my job at all. I was just thankful I had a job at the time."
bad,"Low hours, low pay, plenty of work to do for a low paying job. Co-workers are great to work with but you most likely would need another job or full-time. Management is great as well."
bad,"Part- time position which turned into full-time, very stressful work environment that started with 2 full-time employees and 2 part-time employees whom shared accounting, reconciliation responsibilities."
bad,Working at Burlington was a very hectic job with a lot of requirements for sucha a low pay rate which made it quite impossible to want to stay and work long term.
bad,i did not enjoy working here. a lot of drama and rude people in charge. very competive and hard to work your way up. hours were not steady. I enjoyed working with people and helping them with the trends and good prices though
bad,"There's never a really a day off at Burlington; they either schedule you for an eight hour shift or call you in on the days you're supposed to have off. While two of the managers is super nice and understanding, one is an absolute nightmare and will continuously downplay her employees. The customers in the store suck, as well do the other employees; everyone was very rude."
bad,The job would be great if there was more staff and if  it paid a bit more. The hours aren't guaranteed. It's just really hard to live off of. If they gave there Loss Prevention more money it would be amazing.
bad,"The entails of the job was relatively easy and having the double pro of social-interaction. I performed the duties of sales-floor associate transporting furniture and merchandise( graco carriages, cribs etc.) I also worked in the infantry-registry for nursing and expectant mothers."
bad,The employees are great but this job is real demanding and does not offer a great balance between work and home life. Your schedule is never set and end up working a lot of late afternoons and evenings.
bad,This job is an okay place to work but the people that work there only care about how they can be benefited from the job. They have no regard for anything or anyone else.
bad,"A place where you are over worked and underpaid, not a place to advance but a place just to work and get some minor experience in the field of retail. Clear favoritism, no effort in helping you to learn the other machines that can help them overall, but clearly have the time to gripe about low 'quality' workers. That's what you will deal with management, they get rid of the good workers and complain that there aren't any good people left. Doesn't help that people don't want to stay because of their incompetence."
bad,"A typical day consisted of making sure your cashier station is clean, and efficiently checking out customers. Management was a massive problem, extremely rude, and did not conform to any scheduling conflicts."
bad,I was not taken in by the staff and they were rude. They expect all new hires to do there work and it is bogus. I didn't work there long enough to feel out the whole situation but they did not welcome me and i felt out of place.
bad,"The stores are set up for failure and management is held accountable without flexibility to make change. Payroll, hours, wages, accountability are all at a corporate level and leave minimal opportunity to manage a store by meeting it's needs. Extremely high turnover, issues with security, non-communication with upper level, is a few of store level concerns to achieve success."
bad,"People at Burlington are nice to work with, very helpful. Job can be boring at times since your stuck in one room all day. To me it was a good place to work it was just that it was a boring job and i had to quit because of a illness at the time."
bad,I worked with a lot of nice people. We go paid every week which was nice. Since this place is at the mall it is open late. They are very good at acknowledging when you do good things.
bad,Enjoy working here although it's always busy there are no times for breaks unless it's lunch . Staff is nice and welcoming . I love to shop there basically getting paid to give them back there money
bad,"At first I loved my job. The store manager was great, and my crew was amazing. Then My store manager had left due to issues he was having with corporate. When he left everything went south. Corporate started to panic and they were pushing everyone farther than necessary. We were all working 12-14 hours shifts, some were working doubles being there from open to close then having to work overnight for floor changes and coming in to open again. The atmosphere was horrible with the management. I was a receiving supervisor and my team was amazing we had a lot of fun working and still managed to get the job done. But recognition was never given to my team and especially not to me. We were always told that we weren't going fast enough and that if we weren't sweating we weren't working. I would get a 300 carton truck and be scheduled 4 people if I'm lucky and have from 6-10 to unload, tag (pricing) push to the floor and put out on the shelves. That doesn't include the clothing that has to be opened out of bags, tagged (pricing) hung up and then put on a rack to go out. Also there are shoes, we have to un-box, tag, security sensor, place on a cart and put them up pair by pair. One by one my team started to quit because of upper management. In turn it caused me to have to work even longer hours, well into the night because of the demand for it to be done and then I would get yelled at because I was over 40 hours for the week and my team were only allowed part time at minimum wage with the demand on them to perform above and beyond their pay. Overall this job sucked, the employees are"
bad,"If you like to keep the same wage as from when you were hired forever, no advancement in your job, and more pressure and workflow over time, this is the right place for you"
bad,"A typical day at Burlington is over-worked and under paid. Associates must stand on their feet all day, restrooms are far and shared with customers and are unsanitary. Associates must work at a face pace are not given breaks entitled to. It is truly slave labor. In addition to that, there are times when I am scheduled to work two days in a week. In a day when I am scheduled to work a 9 hour shift, I am given 1 paid 15 minute break and 1 30 minute lunch break; we must punch out upstairs so by the time we get from the fourth floor to the only break-room on the C level, which is located below the first floor, I usually have about 20 to 18 minutes left to eat and use the restroom and pray there are people waiting to use the restroom. I thought legally a person who works 4 hours gets a 15 minute break, a person who works 30 minutes gets a 15 minute break and a 30 minute meal break and a person who works 8 hours gets two 15 minute breaks and one 30 minute meal break."
bad,"My work place is for work, not for judging my coworkers! The manager was very mean... She literally beat me up verbally that I cried. I had to quite."
bad,"you are basically spinning your wheels. Operation and "
bad,"I was the customer service supervisor so I would deal with any issues, questions or concerns customers may have in doing layaways and returns. I was over the front end cashiers as well. I also ran the cashier in the return department"
bad,"If your in the Pittsburgh pa area. These two branches the management is horrible but one or two in each store. They are very degrading on how they treat their employees. Hours are bad unless you are a teen. The management expects you to work only on their schedules, if your in college they are reluctant to work with you. But, your co-workers on the floor are wonderful."
bad,"I needed a job bad and I know I can always depend on ideed search. Well I put in the app and got a call back the same day. Great right? So I go to the interview and everything and get hired. However she tells me that she knows I want at least $8.00/hr. But we can only pay you $7.25/ hr she says smh. Mean as though I needed a job I took it. Now I wish I never have. This job is for people who already have a good job, People who are looking to suppliment their income. This job is not for people who are trying to move up (ROOSEVELT BLD.) What makes matters worst is they only want you to work for them. I wasnt getting many hours so I told the manager I might need to  get a new job so she told me they may need to pick another canidate. She told me this as I was being flexible with my hours and taking up more shifts for the company. Im getting the feeling that they dont value their employees, I mean I work 8 hrs on July 4th and Im not getting paid time and a half. Yet im told by a Store manager ""We dont get paid time and a half why should you???"" WHAT!? "
bad,Maintaining my store department and helping out customers. Some managers were better than other. Most were okay to work with. Co-workers always gossip and didn't always get the job done in time. Hardest part of the job was dealing with messy customers.Most enjoyable part of the job was being able to keep my department clean for more than a few hours.
bad,"The hours were good, but the pay for your skills were poor. The supervisors are sometimes corrupt and take advantage of you. They'll make you do things your job isn't designated to do. Supervisor's are lazy (power gets to them)."
bad,"You basically deal with almost the same customers everyday, literally the same customers shop there everyday. I honestly don't care for the new management. However, I did learn how to multitask and have patience for people. Also the hardest part of the job is recovering the store towards the end of the night, it gets so messy and the associates don't get to leave on time. And I look forward to seeing my coworkers more than actually doing my job."
bad,"Long hours. One person in each department, managers ride the backs of workers. Cannot please management. Not all, but some lazy workers."
bad,"With as few as 4 hours a week, this job was not for me.  A typical work day for myself consisted of scanning area's and finding ""markdowns"".  My job was mostly easy, however it was repetitive and tedious.  The most enjoyable part of my job were my co-workers, working with fun down to earth people make your experience at a job enjoyable."
bad,"As a full time associate with so much knowledge of the business I had to run 3 departments on my own, run the cash register when needed, and merchandise freight. The other associates call in or don't show up and that put more on me alone in a big department store. Management is rude to the customers and are lazy."
bad,"not enough pay"
bad,"Typical retail, Rush, rush, no appreciation from manger. Great prices on clothing. Co-workers were only reason that I can in everyday."
bad,I did not like this job what so ever. I was attending school and they had no care in the world. They actually told me that I would need to choose between work or school. They paid you minimum wage to basically maintain the whole store. It didn't matter what department you were placed in you were still responsible for every other department. The management was rude and inconsiderate.
bad,come in rush to do a 8 hour job in 5 hours and cashier customer service as well
bad,"In receiving I was responsible for unloading pallets, and tagging merchandise.  The Management was not helpful during this process.  Management bad at relaying messages to me about shortages and overages.  I did learn how to work well with others under little to no supervision.  managers contradicting what the others say.  One tells you to dos one thing then another comes along and tells you not to do it then get in trouble for not doing what the first one tells you to do."
bad,"Guaranteed to learn leadership  and excellent customer service skills. will learn different departments, merchandising and recovery."
bad,"learned how to pick up the slack if someone isn't doing their job"
bad,"Very lax environment so much, that management was slow to customers attention."
bad,"A Typical day consist of complete task without enough personnel. Often I opened the store with just me and the store maintenance.Never enough payroll to efficiently run a 85,000 sq foot multi-level building.Learned resilience and finding the best out of very difficult days."
bad,"I started in 2007 and I got the opportunity to learn the retail business.  Unfortunately, if you are a hard-worker, they use and abuse you.  Management is very ungrateful unless you are a favorite employee.  New manager comes in with a very high level of expectation.  She does not work with your schedule and if you do not meet her expectation, she will let you go in an instant.  I've been there since 2007 and got promoted through hard work, acquired skill and knowledge.  New manager has been in the store for only three days and she lets me go just like that.  Five associates is leaving in the next 2 weeks.  She will end up losing all the good and hardworking employees who have been there since the store opening.  Good luck working for this store.  Do more research before you commit.  You might not have a life outside it if you do"
bad,"Helping my customers to find outfits they would have never found on their own, i love that, learn how to build baby furniture,hardest part when i could'nt work on the floor one on one with the customers, a typical day would be setting up clothes according to floor plan."
bad,AT THE AGE OF 40 Burlington Tucson had the worst store management I have ever worked under.
bad,"I have to say, my typical work day was a blast. I enjoy what I do and I love my coworkers. I did learn a lot of valuable skills at Burlington, including data entry, which looks great on a resume. However, they will start you at minimum wage and your raises won't be great. Management (at least at the Greensburg Burlington) was very disorganized and bordered on unprofessional a lot of the time. I would say apply at Burlington if you really don't need the extra money. If you're trying to make a living, forget it."
bad,Recieving was always a wreck. Employees scanning merchandise at the wrong time building the backlog. Incompitent managers.
bad,"This store opened nov.2011 and is in massive trouble. Horrible managers, lawsuits,high theft, internal theft. I will finish this year and then Im out"
bad,I had a bad experience with this job. Started the store from grand opening and worked my way up quite easily. The negative part of this was my pay was minimal for taking on multiple leadership roles and managers were condescending.
bad,Associates are told 4 different things by four different managers on a daily basis resulting in the associates managing themselves
bad,This is a very exciting job for youth. Very easy to manage while in school
bad,"Very high theft rate. Employees call Store Manager at home with anything that goes on the store whether true or not. Little support given by upper management. New programs in place leave little time to complete job duties. Cross training program very poor and forced at the last minute in order to complete timeline, thereby cheating associates and management ample time to complete properly."
bad,A typical day at work would be to supervise the youth area making sure no clothes or toys are on the floor and feeding unwanted items back into place.
bad,"I like assisting customers,my cow-workers are so helpful and I love shopping there."
bad,No communication from upper management. I liked the job and the people I worked with. I enjoyed the customers. Hardest part of job was having to write up someone. The girls I worked with were fun to be around. I liked taking care of the problems that came up.
bad,"When I was working there, I was never even given a name tag. Every day I worked I would ask, yet the closest I got to getting one was someone walking upstairs to go make it and then forgetting to do it. My name was misspelled, which was occasionally an issue when depositing my checks. Yet again they refused to correct this no matter how much I asked. The scheduling system was ""automated"" and I wasn't scheduled two weeks in a row once. Then they decided on the second week to give me a shift. The problem is that they never called me, not once. I'm not going to catch the bus to work every day on the off-chance they scheduled me last second. I was then hospitalized near the end and they didn't call once, even though I had shifts during that time. When I got out there was new management. I continually asked to be added back into the schedule, but to no such luck. They didn't call me once, I don't even know if I have been listed for job abandonment because they refuse to speak with me."
bad,"Like most ""retail"" corporations the bottom line is what dictates the ""mood"" of the individual stores. Although some management staff go above and beyond; when pressed for numbers, they too feel the pressure and it rolls down hill."
bad,I really have nothing nice to say except I enjoyed working with majority of my coworkers and made some great friends on this journey.
bad,"I've worked at burlington for about two years now and I don't plan on staying, we go through so many employees and I can see why. We work our butts off and hardly get paid! its ridiculous"
bad,"they work you too hard, never have hours, they often try to bully you into doing work and threatening your job if you you can't complete it. I have went home from work in so much pain. My leg muscles would feel like they are on fire. I can't wait to get away from here. And the only pay minimum wage."
bad,"I've been working here for 8 months,  and I can tell you it is the most loosely ran outfit I have ever worked. They do not recognize great work and kiss the behinds of their laziest workers! Always short staffed. Makes it very difficult to give it your all!"
bad,"The manager was never on top of things, we never knew when we were going to get out or how many hours we were going to be working. We would get called in at the last minute, for example the night before."
bad,The store was great when I first started until the general manager and some really good coworkers left or got fired for unnecessary reasons. In the beginning everyone got along was more family oriented until management and certain floor and cashier people started doing their own thing making clicks and talking about other employees spreading lies and rumors. Not enough hours are given and when you ask for more hours or to be called in you don't get the opportunity. Don't be in school because they don't care about your LIFE outside of this place and you won't even be scheduled for almost a month here.
bad,You’re either making minimum wage hourly or decent wages hourly but given no hours. Either way they’re getting more work out of you than you get paid for.
bad,"Since new management, the quality of workers and work has gone very downhill. In the beginning of my time as a Burlington associate, workdays were enjoyable with great coworkers and went by fairly quickly. In the recent months, multiple employees have began to express their desire to resign due to the new general manager's extreme changes to the work environment. The salary was sufficient for the time, but now I am looking for something more stable and long-term."
bad,"A typical day at work is working the register, helping customers out, cleaning the work space and as well as closing at least two times per week. Easy job and weekly pay."
bad,"I got hired at Burlington, and then was able to work a total of 9 hours in one whole month. This is purely an on-call job, according to their ""payroll"", which never has enough to staff the store with enough workers to clear the chaos and the long lines. Burlington has no specific management culture, and therefore, the extremely different managers gossip against each other with workers, creating a toxic environment. Management is more about boosting their own egos and sense of superiority than boosting sales. The store hires from the bottom, and only half of a crew on any given day works. If you complain about the fact that the permanent employees are spending their whole shift standing around doing nothing, and on their phones while you actually work the job, you get in trouble by management. Management does not want to be called out for purposely letting workers stay on that should have been let go the first time they pulled out their phone and let an hour go by. Shifts are too short for anything but gas money. Turnover is extreme, precisely because they look for the lowest type of worker. Every shift you work with a whole new crew. Burlington will go the same way as all the other stores, but it is on them."
bad,A typical work day would usually be stressful if it’s not enough cashiers on the register but for the most part it’s usually an okay day everyday. I learned how to deal with upset customers and how to time consume . Management is usually good depending on what manager it is . The workplace culture is usually positive and sometimes stressful. The hardest part of the job is having an inconsistent schedule . The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people everyday:
bad,"In order to receive working hours you have to obtain at least 3 credit applications from customers a day, get customer donations when they ask for them, get customer phone numbers at the end of each transaction completed  and at least 15 loyalty member email address sign ups a day from customers."
bad,"The main manager isn't very easy to deal with. The majority of the workers don't like being around him. A lot is expected of the workers but we only get paid 9/hr. Turn over is high and the store does nothing to ensure that that changes, so we are always low on workers. The job isn't hard, but one of the few positives is the 15% off."
bad,"Management is horrible and questionable, culture is full of gossip and trying to one-up each other, HR is difficult to reach - must go through hoops with 1-800 numbers on posters in break room as the only option to attempt reaching someone about questionable behavior and practices"
bad,"positive: got along with coworkers"
bad,No standards Always short handed. Alot of associates call out and change their hours whenever they want. Same associates get stuck picking up the slack
bad,"Women who want to advance in a career need not apply, the glass ceiling for this company is very low and continues to drop. When I started we had an all female management staff that listened to all employees. Now it's almost all men and the one female manager gets used as a go-to to throw under the corporate bus. They start you off at minimum wage and only raise you to 9$ an hour after six months. There is only one raise a year and after six years, my biggest raise was 15 cents."
bad,"too much drama, not enough hours, not enough pay. Hours are inconsistent and not flexible. The management does not care about you, you do way more than what you're being paid to for."
bad,"Work days consisted of showing up in the morning to sort pallets most times beyond the capacity of the sorting team. This would delay merchandise restocking and make the team miss the deadline. "
bad,"Does not provide schedule for new workers until after 1-2 weeks."
bad,"Horrible management, working for no type of advancement at all. You don’t get paid nearly enough for what you have to endure working there. Very petty people there"
bad,"I was given the opportunity at the second week at the se military location to become a supervisor for customer service for the front of the house. I was extremely excited to help make a big difference at Burlington. Especially because I have 10 plus years experience in customer/ hospitality. I just wanted to help my boss reach her goal of at least 80%-100% of satisfaction of customer service experiences. I'm was driving to learn, and to empower my fellow employees to be excited, to smile, to laugh, speak up, and to show everyone a few new changes at my boss's request. But some employees were reluctant to change their ways and stubborn to hear someone else tell them what to do. And when I spoke up about them... "
bad,"This is a very easy to get, simple, tedious job. It isn't hard, but not for the lazy. Advancement is often talked about, but never occurs. Turnover is high."
bad,management didn't give direction. promoted based on favoritism. no structure. easy going atmospheres. no high pressure sales. Lack of communication. management is my only concern
bad,"no day was typical, changed daily based on needs of business.  must be able to multi-task at drop of hat. always making floor changes due to new freight."
bad,I Partically think that this job is by far the worst job i've had. The enviroment isnt welcoming to anybody sometimes i feel like the customers dont even feel welcomed. The attitudes are horrible and i honestly would not reccomend this job to anybody who has high spirits and love to come to work and do there jobs with no problems
bad,I was hired on after a previous employment with Burlington which was part time M-Sat. I was was given the bare minimum of hours and placed in the fitting room the entire 4 months.The assistant managers were treating me like I was new to Retail an it was horrible. I wanted to be in a department where I was comfortable.
bad,"This place will leave workers underpaid and overworked. The schedule was never consistent and interfered with my sleeping patterns. The most possible hours are during Thanksgiving and Christmas seasons, but hours are still quickly cut. You can be removed from the the schedule on the weekend at the last minute and management will not call to warn you, wasting your gas and time. Workers are rude to customers. Too much gossip and drama there, without benefits or decent pay. If you are not retiring but need a tiny part time check for the moment, accept the job while still doing applications elsewhere and going to college. Workers always quitting there. It is difficult to get breaks and lunches on time because plenty ignore you on the walkie."
bad,The job was good it was close to my house but it was less hours I was working there for while so I learn a lot of things so jobs that I am looking for is warehouse and retail jobs
bad,"Great company with future growth.  "
bad,"Little to no structure. Scheduling is very unorganized, and turnover rate is very high. Mist the time rules are not followed by employees, and there are rarely no disciplinary actions."
bad,Well The store I’m at is the most stressful job every Nobody I. There does team work what’s so ever.. and I’m waiting on transfer but I love Burlington don’t get me wrong it just the people in there
bad,I worked as cashier also worked in the freight department in the back i also worked in the shoe department. I did a bit of everything there my customer service is always the best.
bad,"Burlington Coat Factory is a discount retailer with many many name brand items to choose from. It is an ok part-time gig for teenagers to earn a little income. Or a part-time job for someone to look for a little extra cash to burn. It is not meant to be a permanent career, not for the pay they offer. Although staff is somewhat easy to get along with, it isn't worth the stress of having to maintain a beautiful when people aren't collaborating in doing their part."
bad,This job starts off as easy and fun. Once the managers see you are capable of much more they ride you. The managers are always on you for performance and for little pay. The customer service scores are all that’s on the managers mind. California living isn’t cheap and this job is not worth the headache. The customers aren’t the best and trash the store constantly. The one thing that is great is the amount of breaks. Two 15 minute breaks and an unpaid 45 minute lunch when working an 8 hour shift. Retail is not for everyone. I will definitely never work in retail again. Especially around the holidays!
bad,"A typical day consist of me folding clothes and putting tags on the clothing sometimes going on the floor to fix merchandise, Hardest part of the job would be to help unload heavy packages. I enjoyed being able to communicate freely and I can be myself."
bad,"no words to express.pay was less work more than what you are asked for.,no benefits,Managers treat give you no respect as an employee.hours were minimal."
bad,Poor communication and even worse pay. They don’t care about those that have been there for years and will make the working environment so toxic you quit so they can replace you with someone who will do it cheaper. Then they’ll hire yet another Vice President and pay them huge sums of money while the hard working people underneath them barely get a 2% raise for the salary that is already a lot lower than the average. If you go to HR to discuss issues they just report back to the VPs. There are a lot of good people working there but the company has gone in such a sad direction in the past couple of years since they brought in new people at the top.
bad,Store has a very high turnover rate because of poor hiring decisions. in my tenure lots of employees have been caught stealing from the store. Management is often times lazy and plays favoritism when giving positions.
bad,"Loved working in the backroom in receiving. Downfall is the shift is 6am. Also the hours are very unstable for part time and the pay is horrid. You work very hard and the pay stinks. They push you for time constraints and yet give minimum wage. "
bad,"The work at Burlington is not particularly difficult, no moreso than any other retail job. What makes it more difficult than it needs to be is the management who are confusing in their instruction and unable to admit to their own mistakes, preferring instead to pass blame for any failings along to their workers instead of understanding their own failure to communicate effectively and consistently amongst each other."
bad,it was really bad management and they are unfair. a majority of them are nice but they treat you bad and only care about the workers. I wouldn't recommend working there
bad,will not recommend no person to work for them at all because do not respect there workers  for all the hard work and tell workers you need to work faster and do not care for there people.
bad,"Working as a cashier at burlington was very stressful,the rude costumers made it even worse. The management did the best they could with assigning hours but seemed like it wasnt ever enough."
bad,I stocked the clothing for the men and woman sections. Helped maintain clean dressing rooms and sales floor. During the holiday season I would be a back up cashier and help with the layaway pulling them and taking them to the back.
bad,"Work as a cashier balanced register nightly, clean store nightly.Assist customers with their shopping needs. Re-stock shelves. Pick-up and hang clothes"
bad,"Basic retail.  Poor management, there was a lot of ""playing favorites"".  They were sometimes not honest when describing the job in the interview; I had to do jobs of other people because there was never enough people working."
bad,"Found out this company is no different from the others, only care about making money, not about it's employees or even customers. Not a good place to work,unless you don't care about having a life outside of work"
bad,"busy work place lots of employees partime work."
bad,"Burlington Coat Factory is a discount store and you will be treated as so. The customers do not respect the store nor the workers. You will be cleaning up all day picking up kicked down clothes. The hours are not so great but they could be worse. if the store is not clean when you are scheduled to be off, and its a closing shift. You will be required to stay until the store is cleaned. even if its 2 hours passed your scheduled off time."
bad,"Always messy, clothing and products are always disorganize. Never enough helping hands. Most times floor employees must take action into their own hands. Supervisors and managers lack on leading associates."
bad,"I was here for 3 years, and I didn't enjoy it because of these reasons: hard to advance, managers micromanage, minimum breaks assigned at times managers choose, too many protocols. "
bad,"The day to day procedures are the same. Very LP driven in all departments. Can be relaxed depending on the Regional Vice President. The VP's, don't take feedback."
bad,The work pace is incredibly fast and at many times it feels like its hard to even breath in there. Customers were constantly displeased with the tidiness of the store and associates were constantly complaining about it. Not a very fun place to work.
bad,It's a mess to shop and work in and big wigs assume that all stores are the same and work the same way. Big wigs need to be more involved in there stores.
bad,"Burlington was a challenging job that was both back breaking and insane. the work load is out of this world! in other words, only work there if you're desperate sis."
bad,A typical work day was walking in to loudness. I learned to be more patient with everyone. Management wasn't always willing to help you when you needed it. The culture was not one of teamwork. The hardest part was keeping the store clean.
bad,"From my personal experience, from the first day I started the management team were not very friendly or approachable. They liked to give me a hard time quite frequently."
bad,"I start my day by unpacking merchandise and get it ready to be put on the floor. Then process clothing by ticketing them, adding security tags when needed and hanging them"
bad,"Lack of organization. "
bad,"I worked there for a good 9 months. Managers steal hours as informed by another manager. Didn't seem to get the correct pay I was getting paid 9 an hour but I never made it passed 180$ no matter how many hours I put in. They would give me plenty of hours for a short period of time than cut them again so I wouldn't qualify for benefits. Which wasn't fair because I did a lot of stuff in the store. At one point I was working in the back, assisting customers, getting layaways and cashier back up in the same day with not enough hours during the week.The worst part was having to put of filing my income taxes because they messed up on my social security number. It took a while for HR to fix it."
bad,"The customers in the area are great! They are the most enjoyable part of the job. A high turnover rate plagues the store though, and the management team is very conniving but tries their best."
bad,"Management don't have communication, some are rude.  They do work around your schedule. Not enough pay. Is an easy job. They are on the point system. 12 points and you are fired. If you need to call out, do it. They won't let you leave early cause of target hours. Some employees were cool to work with."
bad,Burlington training is minimum and the employee's are worked extremely hard.  The working conditions are not safe and unfair.  their is no standard of equal opportunity.
bad,working there is good but they don't have hours for their markdown team. But they have hours for managers and cashiers only.
bad,"I didn't enjoy working at this location, managers were horrible and mean for no reason at all, did over time and couldn't tell if i got paid for it. I didn't even talk to my co-workers ,hardest part is to just work there and like going to work and smiling while I'm there. The only enjoyable part about that job were my customers."
bad,If not in a management position do not make this you only job. The company is constantly changing policies and practices without any warning. Not a place to grow.
bad,"Its a great job for somebody in high school that doesn't have any responsibilities, and just looking for some extra money in their pocket."
bad,The mangers have favorites and they get the best schedules. Even if you have open availability they will give you as little as 4 hours a week. They schedule as little people as they can to work the whole store. Like 4 cashiers and 3 people to work the floor. The interview process is easy and they don't do a background check so they hire a lot of sketchy people. Your co-workers can either be really hard working people or really lazy people. There is no way to move up the company. In fact it works the opposite. There are people working there for 15 years that had full time once but when the recession started the company told them they had to become part time. When 2 full time positions finally opened 4 years later instead of giving it to the previous workers they hired two people out of the company and gave them the full time with benefits.
bad,A good stating place to get your feet wet and began to learn and understand the warehouse world. and possibly advance if the oppertunity presents itself.
bad,"Will always love the merchandise I purchase at Burlington and will miss the other hard-working employees I became friends with. The two managers were awesome, however, my supervisor plays favorites. She talks about her employees to other employees and has no respect for the two wonderful managers above her.  Some people do not have to work at a fast pace because she is intimidated by them so the few employees with strong work ethics continually have to kill themselves to make up for the laziness of others. Not everyone in Receiving has to do the ""whole job"" but still make the same wage as the others who have to do everything. There should be tiers...if you want to be lazy you should make the lowest wage. If you are a good worker with integrity and are willing to perform every job function, you should make the top wage in that department."
bad,"I enjoyed working for Burlington Coat Factory but they were many things that was not satisfying my needs within my life.There was no oppurtunity in growth and as well as raises or benefits was not offered. I do believe coporate should be focus more on their employees and opportunities that might interest them in growth within the company. This place is always hiring employees and doesn't give more hours than 25 hours per week making minimum wage."
bad,"This company has a bad identity problem. It doesn't know if it wants to be a department store or a discount store. Senior management"
bad,"its easy work, but the management is terrible, the pay is not well, some co-workers do there work. other co-workers talk all day and don't get the job done. i learn how to be nice to customers and respect. i enjoy the people i work with."
bad,"The Management was terrible, lack of hours, and No advancing there"
bad,"Management was biased,and unorganized. Most of the senior workers and donors seemed to run the donation center, even though it was in an unsafe area and generated a lot of traffic we stilled seemed to always be short handed."
bad,"A typical day at this company involved unloading incoming freight, staging the pallets in the receiving area by departments and processing and delivering the freight to the sales floor in a timely manner. The daily responsibilities also included receiving UPS and FEDEX deliveries, consisting of validating attached paperwork and entering the information into the computer to insure an accurate inventory. Occasionally assisted with markdowns, maintaining the sales floor, regularly cleaned restrooms in custodians absence, greeted and assisted customers at main entrance of store and assisted customers with bulky or heavy merchandise carry-outs. "
bad,This store is sometimes understaffed and they close late. Everyday is different on the sales floor and as a cashier because you dont know if you have help. You do work with cool people and the receiving supervisor is cool..  You have to request time off three weeks before you want the time off and sometimes they wont give it to you.
bad,"When I was working at the Independence store. It seemed like they didn't want you there for longer than you were needed. Many times I was kind of pushed out the door before I supposed to be getting off. There was times where I had a very small paycheck and really didn't think it was worth the gas to even drive to and from that department store. "
bad,"worked as a receiving associate in a basement, like a slaveship. New depart manager is horrible, doesn't know anything makes us work like robots no talking get written up for that, separates employees from other employees. They work you harder than what they pay you for, and take advantage of you making you work in different departments. And the point system is horrible."
bad,"I worked part time in several departments of the retail store.  I usually worked 4-6 hours assisting customers, cleaning up after them, and detaining shoplifters."
bad,"lots of work "
bad,"A typical day of work here starts with getting and putting backs strays that belong to your department that you are working in that day, recovering and maintaining your department, assisting customers with whatever they need such as price checks, finding items in our store or other Burlington stores in your area using our computer inventory system, getting layaway's for customers, or helping carry baby cribs or other heavy items to customer vehicles, cashiering whenever they need you to no matter what you are doing, then, helping other people in their departments when needed if you are finished with your work until your work shift is ended or the manager on duty says you can leave."
bad,Horrible place to work. I rather work at a fast food place. To much high school drama with co workers who are all adults. They dont take their job serious and complain all day. You will not move up in this company unless you have the best connections.
bad,"A typical day: Aggravated because of the frustration that their never enough staff on the floor or long line."
bad,It is easy work and you catch on fast the management had favorites and This one Manager In Particular made me want to ring her neck she was just so rude i mean extremely. I worked there for several months just to have something to do during the day being that my husband is the main bread winner in the house I didn't need to work.  So With That Being Said The Pay Wasn't Enough For All The Aggravation And Disrespect That I Endured.
bad,"The job isn't hard, the people there run it like a soap opera. Drama everywhere."
bad,"Enjoyed most of co-workers but only one manager seemed to care or listen to concerns; more concern about speed than customer service, received compliments from customers with whom I spoke  and had eye contact and compared as much better than other cashiers, that I seemed to care about the customer yet efficient as well; no positive feedback from superiors, particularly negative managers seeming to have reverse discriminatory issues, have particularly negative attitudes and even knowing this nothing done by other management, just tolerated, while persons have negative impact on certain employees; despite excellent references and many years of experience don't wish to put up with what is tantamount to abuse; nothing matters but bottom dollar;disappointed in poor ethics  of company,will leave when other other employment secured, maybe won't even wait; will not hesitate to share this with others; other stores have comparable discounts,Burlington's attitude is extremely disappointing;young employees with employed relatives given more attention and accolades than others;the list could go on and on, very discouraging for hard working non-minority over 30 employees; would gladly provide upper HR with more details, in fact, would like to do so but very limited access to these persons."
bad,"Started the day with Good morning, Then would go thought the workload and find the problem and fix them. Answer Phones, commutated between 3 Warehouse to make sure the workload is set so the can receive for the day."
bad,Terrible decision making from corp and mgmt. Schedules change sometimes within hours. Low pay. Amount of hours very from week to week.
bad,"Assisting customers with purchases, returns, and exchanges,"
bad,"As a former ASM, this company is a freaking joke. I opened my store and worked there for a few years. As time progressed the staffing and payroll became much less than what the store needed in order to just ""get by"". Audits are constantly failed, freight is backlogged and markdowns are missed...all due to lack of payroll and staffing. You the management team, are then EXPECTED to work your off days or longer days to take up the slack, NO WORK/LIFE BALANCE....average hours worked per week are 70, you're salaried at 40. There is no support from the regional team or HR"
bad,My normal day at burlington coat factory would be clocking in
bad,"just not the enviroment i imagined, co-workers are nice and friendly tho"
bad,Good amount of weekly hours
bad,"I have worked for Burlington for 9 months. The supervisor that I most often work under is unfair and she plays favorites with the people that work in customer service. I was hired as a customer service cashier and there are people who are hired as just regular cashiers. She will put her friends that are cashiers on the customer service side and assign me, the customer service cashier to the cashier side when her friends work the same shift as me. The managers are ok but they don't say anything about her behavior so it isn't a very fun place to work anymore. It was in the beginning but now it isn't."
bad,"In general its a fine place to work, as long as you don't let them take advantage of how hard you work. Very flexible when it comes to scheduling and time off."
bad,This job offers little to no training. Excellent co workers.
bad,"Environment is not conducive to success. Proper training is lacking, as is filed support"
bad,"A day at burlington coat factory is an experience each and every day it's amazing some of the people I come across that try and shoplift, I've learned a lot about managing a store and how certain things should be ran. The management team is not ran as good as I know it can be, the store manager needs to manage the store a lot better as well his workers. Two of the managers I believe should be promoted and two should be demoted. The toughest part of my job is standing up all day and not judging a book by it's cover. The best part of the job is some of the people I work with they keep me looking forward to coming in and working with them each and everyday."
bad,"I always stayed busy-doing and learning whatever I could;however,communications among management and between management and employees was lousy! There have been some wonderful,fantastic co-workers I worked with and under! The hardest part of the job was figuring out what various managers/supervisors expected from you. The most wonderful part of the job was meeting so many interesting customers because of the location of the store!"
bad,"I worked for the store over the winter, they said i was a permittee employee, but after Jan 1 2012 they never gave me any hours, said i was still employed jut with 0 hours."
bad,"I was hired at Burlington Coat Factory at the Cutler Bay location as a Loss Prevention Specialist.  The management team was horrible.  They did not seem interested in helping you, they barely spoke English,  and they would gossip behind associates backs.  My Loss Prevention Manager gave me a few pages to read, and when I would ask for clarity,  he seem annoyed.  The overall work environment is toxic, do not  come  here."
bad,"Bad management ruined my experience working for this company. I enjoyed working here, but the upper management sucks & place unrealistic expectations on the staff. The only thing they care about is getting good surveys. In addition to running your department, you also have to be a cashier & get layaways.  The pay is also bad."
bad,This place doesn’t value how long you have been working for them or how hard you work or the knowledge you have not even the amount of experience you have they give you opportunity to move up based on what best fits for them or who they like better.
bad,Unloading trucks you open every box and totes and sort from softlines and hardlines. It was enjoyable because of the few people I worked with. The company is all about costumers happiness.
bad,"Unorganized and the training for a new employee wasn’t helpful at all. Even though the job is pretty simple, the managers just tell you to do things that you aren’t familiar with yet in the store."
bad,"Typical day is very strenuous, never feels like there's a sense of order. Always a mess, customers seem to have no respect for the store since its a budget department store."
bad,the reason i left this job was because i was only getting two days a week i try  speaking with every manager on site but nothing help  other then the hours the place  was okay
bad,Burlington don't treat their employees fair.  I quit because how certain managers treated the employees and the managers have their favorite workers.  I would not go back at any cost.  Unethical.
bad,Low salary for the work LOAD. Schedules unorganized therefore you don't know until the last minute if you have to work. You can't schedule your life for  this reason.
bad,"2nd cashier job. Not the greatest, left after just a couple months. The most immediate issue is that there are simply NOT ENOUGH cash registers for when the checkout line gets to its longest potential. There are usually no more than 3-4 managers in the pretty huge store at any given time either, which honestly becomes catastrophic when the store gets packed."
bad,"management was really unorganized , the company never listens to suggestions , hours fluctuate , no room for progression .................................................................."
bad,They are not consistant with their policy.   Some people get away with policy issues and others don't. There is definately a double standard when it comes to how upper management handles policy issues.
bad,It is very disorganized and hazardous. Management is not that good. There are many times I have been asked about any changes I believe should be implemented and nothing has happened.
bad,At first its okay but then you start dealing with not only the rude & demanding customers but also gossiping coworkers including managers. They were really unorganized and needless to say unprofessional.
bad,I don't have much to say about this company.Worked there for a long time with not much room or advancement. High turn over in store mangers due to unrealistic metrics.
bad,I was really excited to start my job with Burlington. But after being there 3 weeks I have to say it is the worse place to work and the pay is terrible for what they make us do.
bad,"Unfortunately this company does not care about their employees and its clear in their actions. The recent management changes have left much to be desired, replacing home grown off-price talent for department/specialty store managers that lack the understanding of value and are not prepared to lead a team of off price merchants."
bad,The location I worked at had major overturn due to management. Everyone there had poor communication skills and lacked professionalism. Employed for over a year and I just couldn’t take it anymore. Not worth the stress.
bad,"hardest was no staff.  doing 15 things at once. very fast pace, cashiering fitting room stock dealing with your department and other ones, doing 15 things at once clean recovery emoty and cash"
bad,"I stated in my application that I had open availability and talked with managers multiple times about taking on more hours, but they dismissed me every time. The only time I worked substantial hours was during the holidays. So there were multiple weeks where I would only work five hours and come home with a $40 pay check. Other than that, the management was laid back but expected consistency. The employees were agreeable, the customers were ridiculously messy and rude and there is ALWAYS work to do. If you need a job and you can still depend on another income, its an okay place to work, there are definitely worse places to work."
bad,"This location specifically has poor management, and has the least amount of people possible, per shift. Especially working during the closing shift, at times there have only been two people closing, with no security, which is very unsettling. Gives little motive to work here. Main management does not care, and only focuses on what they can add to their pockets. Glad I left."
bad,the employee were nice as well as the customers. they always made sure the shipments were there on time and some employee made sure that everyone felt welcome in the store.
bad,Was there for 8 months and the only thing that I enjoyed were the 10% discounts and the occasional 25% discounts. Management could have treated us more fairly by raising our pay.
bad,Don’t apply  . It’s stressful as hack . Don’t get  paid more then you have to . Coworker get away with a lot of things . And it’s not fair especially at night
bad,"Management  not so good  if a co worker calls in  management leaves it like is wont find replacement for shift leaving the employee that is there especially at closing that employee has to cover half the store by his /her self. "
bad,Please only come here for a temporary job. Management plays alot of favorites. Overall very stressful and was being treated as a supervisor with regular customer service pay.
bad,Management needs a definitive improvement. Lhours are scarce because they hire a vast pool of people and divide hours instead of focusing one good group of employees.
bad,Everything was an extremely fast pace work area you had to get everything done within four to six hour's or get yelled at the receiving manager there.
bad,"THe management is terrible, the hours are inconsistent, and they do nothing to make the employee feel respected and appreciated. Mangers demand much more work than they are compensating for. The managers never schedule enough people to fully staff the store, and expect the crew working that night to do the work of five or more people. Those who do try to work more hours are usually given less hours than others for some reason."
bad,Don’t work here unless you are prepared to stay in the same position indefinitely. 6 years working at the help desk provided me with very few opportunities to improve my IT skills.
bad,"I learned to make multiple items with different shapes and sizes fit in a labeled and scanned box, Then I take a new label and a new box and restart the process all over again"
bad,The place is dysfunctional and its no wonder why the customer service sucks. Employees look miserable and overworked. The friendly greeting is always noticably forced. I am positive people go in the store only for the merchandise not because of the customer service. Im not sure if its management but the store struggles on a regular basis.
bad,"After the first year, I realized that this place couldn't hold on to anybody long enough for them to get their annual pay raises. This place was cluttered and ridiculously unclean. Our schedules for Sunday through Friday would most times be posted on Friday. It was impossible to make plans.  Also no matter how many people they hire, they only put the bare minimum on the schedule. WHY ARE THERE ONLY 3 CASHIERS ON A FRIDAY NIGHT?!?! Emotionally draining."
bad,"I enjoyed the comradery amongst my co-workers. They were very helpful.  But when I needed to know something my peers could not answer, I asked the assistant manager and it seemed as though I was bothering her.   I wanted to speak with the general manager, but she was rarely there.  Maybe I was there at a time of transition or something.  Seemed like poor management t me. ."
bad,"I felt like i worked by myself half the time and got annoyed with working there , and I didn’t like the workplace too messy things everywhere especially clothes and dangerous items glass and etc"
bad,"My direct supervisor was great.  However, the store manager was a joke.  Promises a lot but does not deliver.  Very rude to employees in front of customers.  Also talked about employees behind their backs."
bad,"All the people working at a Burlington are the most amazing team work ever. Even when the managment do not have a good communication, about nothing, including schedules  and their changes, Burlington keeps standing up cause its associates  on the floor & on customer service do their best. It is a pity everybody is looking for another job cause nobody feel safe about getting enough hours to work."
bad,"I do not recommend if you don’t have patience. This is a good high school part time job. Other than that it was pretty easy task. Cashier, very simple."
bad,i had to maintane my job with the rude disrespectful customers and managers too they will count the money and not say how much it is and the customer want return items with a rude attitude
bad,Between management and clientele it gets to become a handful. Although I learned a lot from working their and has now prepared me for my current position I would not go back.
bad,"The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with the customers. The hardest part of my job was no organization, not even from the management. Poorly run."
bad,"i think its a good place to gain retail experience. part timers do not get much hours and there is limited full time space, not many chances of moving up"
bad,Burlington has a lot more departments than just coats.  Burlington also has a large baby department.  Burlington carries urban brands which causes a high amount of theft and shoplifters.  This can be very stressful to deal with
bad,"-hours were longs"
bad,I loved working there but the management sucked. It was like being in highschool with girls twice my age. If you're not in the managers click you're outcasted and over worked and criticised about everything
bad,work hard pay not so good it was a okay place to work. do not be too friendly with management do your job and go home. Come to work on time. Time and attendance is a serious thing.
bad,"When I first started at Burlington I loved the job. However, a change in management ruined the working environment. It went from over 50 employees to 20 in a matter of weeks."
bad,threes no room for advancement. wage increases were almost nonresistant. there was a poor store manager who didn't care for his employees. almost no training on how to work any equipment.
bad,"Its a fun work environment. Can listen to your own music and the people are easy to get along with. The schedule is given to you by text message the day before you work. They expect you to give them open availability until 3pm, but cut you out early around 11 a.m most days and finish the work themself so they don't have to give the receiving team many hours. They don't give you any benefits, just 15% employee discount card that's useless if you don't make a paycheck to shop here, lol. Good job if you need something to help get you a little bit on your feet while u are looking for something else."
bad,At the store I worked at other employees got rud with you if you moved up faster than they did and they made your job really tough to do.Also some of the management would do things just to make this harder on you and not include you in stuff like they needed and supposed to do..
bad,Working here was not pleasant at all. Communication between the managers and employees was terrible. I never knew what was going on and the most of the managers were rude and aggressive. Not a good place to work.
bad,"They hire more people without having enough hours to give to people who have been working for years. A hour of training is not training, especially if you have never been a cashier before. A typical day is feeling like you don't know what you're doing or picking up slack of higher-up's favorites who can sit around and do nothing"
bad,"Stressful, messy, extremely busy on weekends. There were not enough people working at once to accommodate the number of people in the store or the mess. I had to wait almost 3 weeks to get decent hours and was never even trained."
bad,Management does not support staff; very little training; no room for advancement; hours are poorly distributed amongst the staff; supervisors are very unreliable
bad,"Not much room for advancement, Benefits are job discounts, and includes a higher discount on the holidays. Most enjoyable part of the job is seeing fresh faces in the store."
bad,"Management has alot of problems. No communication. Some of the other employees are mean. "
bad,There was Horrible management and the managers didnt care about you. The hours are not that great. The people do Not have friendly faces. The supervised are not great
bad,the longer you work there the more stressful it becomes. Management was never able to lead everyone for some reason. Customers always complained. only positive was most of the coworkers were wonderful.
bad,I worked as a merchandiser stocking shelves and hanging clothes on racks. It was very fast paced but the expectations were unrealistic. You get paid very little to do so much.
bad,"Had fun working for Burlington Shoes. Was a very hands on job, checking in shipments and running shoes into inventory. Deal with customer service issues regarding worn or damaged shoes"
bad,I had a good time working for Burlington but didn't like manger she was very racist towards latinos and basically laid off all the latino employees rude manger
bad,"Endless hours of standing up at the cash register. Lines are super long, management is nasty, they treat you and talk to you like you're in high school all over again."
bad,"They don't care if you are busy in your department, they will take you out of your department and then make you go to a different department to work in it and then make you go back to your department to clean it up after working in a different department all day"
bad,"This job is good for young people that want a job before college. Although this is not a job for high school age, I worked this job my senior year and due to my supervisor I missed all my senior activities. She would not allow me to be scheduled off for senior picnic or after school activities."
bad,"A typical day at Burlington coat factory would be fast paced early in the morning and some days very slow depending on the quantity of work cause we had a fixed amount of hours weekly.At Burlington i've learned organization and paying attention to detail under pressure . when i was employed by Burlington we would open the store and beginnto unload merchandise and organize products to there correct department such as linens, shoes and coats as well security tagging. The hardest part of the job would be maintaining store cleanliness day to day. The most enjoyable part of the job is that theybwould reward you with certificates from time to time with employee of the month papers. As a team the managers would buy us food for doing an outstanding job"
bad,The place was a complete dump and the pay was very little. The only good thing is that employees got weekly pay. The store manager was too laid back and the store suffered because of it. I would seriously tell you to reconsider before doing this job.
bad,"i actually like working at burlington in my position, just wish there was better pay. they street you like robots and slaves, but i got past all that. just need better pay for what they want you to do"
bad,"This job does not related my work experience. I am a new resident in the US. "
bad,"Management is rarely on schedule. They're all super tight so if you have any complaints, there really is nothing they're willing to do. Full timers end up on registers rather than time in their department. The only pro is that they are decent working with schedules. It's also very difficult to communicate in store as often times people will ignore you on the walkies."
bad,"I was a cashier associate during the summer and the actual job itself took some time to get the hang of (since you’re not just on the register, you’re doing multiple things that take you away from being a cashier) but it was nice once you got it down. The customers were nice to be around and ringing them up wasn’t bad. The only bad thing was the management and the people working there. While getting trained for every possible position there is (on top of being a cashier) they belittle you and make you feel dumb for not understanding a task they assign you (when you’ve never even done it before). Also if you’re on a closing shift, you’re basically doing all the other associates work while trying to get your area clean (which is impossible). They are so moody and take the stress from their job and throw it onto the newer associates. They definely play favorites and don’t let others grow in the company if you’re not a favorite. A good thing was if you wanted more hours for the week they were readily available if you asked for them."
bad,"Its good for gaining experience. If you have like 19 or 20 yrs it is nice working there. But I don't think is a lifetime job. It is a easy job, but if you do it excellent they explode you."
bad,Nice staff overall good place to be if you can handle the mall. Brake room was very small for it being such a huge store no designated smokeing area or ashttrays
bad,"the reason i dont recommend people working here is because its poorly managed, i was pregnant when i started i always had to ask for more hours and when they told me i would get more hours i never did, people always stole security didn't care, they barley give  breaks, it took weeks for them to give me my first check, co workers were rude"
bad,"So this was one of the worst jobs I've had. My direct manager was horrible, and micro managed everything. the hours were bad even being a temp/seasonal worker."
bad,very unprofessional for the company to express that its a company that works as a team and doesn't is not a company i desire to work for. the manager got to comfortable with the employees and its was just crazy.
bad,Burlington is a very productive place to work. management is vey helpful to all employees and the work envirement is relaxed and productive. not many.
bad,It was ok but the management was really the problem. They also cut your hours a lot if not full time. But they  never hire for full time positions.  Favoritism plays a big part in how you're treated and what you'll be doing
bad,I feel that thetre was so much drama here and everyone wanted to bd the boss so I got bossed around by everyone. I felt that I could have gotten more hours.
bad,"Based on how long I worked there it's a fun work place very easy work and fun people to be around, but the company is based on who you know or who your friends with there is really no growth within the company really."
bad,Was a new store and management was new also no senior management to help them get up to speed. Many scheduling conflicts leading to high employee distisfaction.
bad,Not much order never know what your going to do when you go in certain people don't do their job you'll have to pick it up. Probably just a personal experience but nothing is promised there. Little to no order
bad,the store just open and the didn't have thing organize and the lead person was never in the area when needed. I would ask for lead they said don't worry about the lead person just do your work.
bad,"I had got into an car accident while on this job and they were nice enough to work with me its just the management is not on one accord , adn never knew where I was suppose to be as an new hire."
bad,They really didn't give me a fair opportunity. They were not flexible with my transportation circumstances. It was a great environment but I did not have an opportunity to meet a lot of people.
bad,you have to do everything even though you only applied for one position whether that is cashier sales person stock merchandising. they never have enough cashiers on at any given time
bad,"Bearly no hours, bearly no days not much benefits. Greatful for the experience help to be tougher helps me improve my customer service skills. Hardest part is a busy day bearly any cashiers on long lines late night closing. most enjoyable part the customer satisfaction"
bad,"Very poor pay, it is negotiable, be sure to do this otherwiae there will not be a raise until over a year later. Benefits are negligible. If it is your only work you will likly still qualify for government benefits."
bad,somewhat on organize throughout the company.  The work culture needs significant improvement and improve job training. There is lack of management support.
bad,"no help for recovery, short staffed, only cashiers got overtime, not enough hours for project, played favorites managers. Low wages ,no benefits, stressful work place"
bad,come in and great all customers clean the front end area before starting to ring customers. get all customers out in a timely manor. help managment with scheduling for the day and keep track of all breaks.
bad,Fold clothes and clean the store clean at the end of the day. Very slow paced work and the hours are not very good most of the time. Only picks up during holidays.
bad,there was a high turn over at the location I was employed and little room for advancement. The management did work well with the employees and offered help through training.
bad,I learned a lot more about customer service that ! feel will help me in other jobs in my life. I enjoyed my manager and she really helped and cared about her employees.
bad,"Burlington Coat Factory is a very productive place to work at, I enjoyed the staff and the managers, they're very helpful and reliable to the staff and customers."
bad,i would get in early in the morning to a very fast pace environment. my job was to put out all the products including clothes and all kinds of  accessories.
bad,"Training program didn't really help explain day to day tasks."
bad,I have worked for this company for over 15 years and feel I am not being utilized to my full potential. I should be a store manager now but they constantly bringing people outside of the organization.
bad,"Management showed favoritism "
bad,This was the worse unorganized place I have ever worked for. The management was ok but the customers made your job 10 times worse. The store was always unorganized and sloppy no matter how much you straightened up and you never get raises.
bad,"with struggles i was having at home with family, work there just became too much. so i chose to look for new opportunities where i feel appreciated and growth could surely happen."
bad,"It is incredibly fast paced, and no matter how fast and/or productive you are, the store manager will expect you do go faster. After working there for 20 months I was the most senior employee in the back of the house. I was let go for absentee points. And the management waited 29 days past when I should have gotten a warning. And in that month, I called in two more times. They would not accept the responsibility of their mistake. So, after 20 months, I was terminated a week after my first 'warning' that was documented. I didn't miss any days in my last week either. It's seems pretty shady to me."
bad,"I unloaded and prepared all store merchandise Non stop working, short breaks, no team work. Management harsh. I learned to take criticism. Unappreciated by management"
bad,"management is not very good here, the place always looks nasty. there is room for growth but it is hard. layaway is a great program but you have to deal with mean customers."
bad,I did not like my time at Burlington. The pay was lower than normal although they paid weekly. Closing was always a nightmare for me. The best part of the job was discounts on store items.
bad,"I did not like working with this company the store manger that I had was a very ghetto lady  but I left this company due to becoming pregnant . I wouldn't Stop correcting ""recommend"" anyone work with this company"
bad,I started out working here while I was in college. They were very flexible with my schedule which was ideal for me as a student. The downside is mainly that the pay is extremely low (slightly over min. wage) and they very rarely promote from within. Good temporary job- but not something you could ever live off of.
bad,The job was not the easiest. The department I worked in was always in complete chaos. It was always one person working the department while helping other departments and helping at the register. Management at the time was poor. The hardest part of the job was maintaining the department while trying to take care of other departments by yourself. The security at the time was poor as well.
bad,Its like your typical department store. they pay minimum wage. tour over worked. no benefits because it mostly part time and ven when working full time hours the benefits suck.
bad,"The store was always busy and messy, fun but hectic place to work at. Management was alright, their was always drama going on with the workers.. overall this is a last resort job."
bad,"I absolutely hated it. The managers I had in Memphis, TN were very rude. They showed favoritism and even though I was young I wasn't dumb. The store was a mess as well. I love clean environments."
bad,"Working at Burlington was okay, but it was really annoying when you had to work every weekend . like they would legit not schedule you all week just to have you scheduled all weekend. That was really annoying. Management was inconsiderate the css would legit be drunk and the store manger knew and didn't do s*** about it. Its is ghetto , stay Away !"
bad,It was a ok retail job. Mangers had no control of anything. It seemed like they all hated there job and didnt care. They did not care about there employees and pay was bad.
bad,"I was with this company for a few months, they had me doing all the departments including receiving. the pay and benefits were not so great. They needed better management."
bad,when you worked for Burlington you had to keep the store cleaned and stock the shelves and hang clothes as well and you didn't get very much hours working there doing receiving
bad,"Everyone knows that working at any level in a retail entity is difficult no matter what place it is.  They do live up to the long dog days of work, and very low pay."
bad,"This job Keeps you productive, it is a good first time job or second job but not a main job. This company is easy to work for and is a fast paced environment. You do learn a lot from here and are able to work in different departments outside of your comfort zone or original field."
bad,"Friendly workplace, boring at times. Low pay, stressful during holidays. Random hours. Not very challenging. I feel if the hours are so inconsistent among the company, then the company should at least feed their workers daily. Free of charge."
bad,"Working here was ok, needed better pay and more hours. Managers should acknowledge their hard workers and recognize the employees who do care. More of an high school student job."
bad,Its hectic. The workplace has no order or structure. The customers genuinely have no respect for the cashiers or workers. To work at Burlington you need to have a lot patience and a lot of determination. The pay isnt that great either the entire store needs to be remodeled.
bad,"I use to like the job at first,easy work and I also like it because you get paid every weeks but the only problem is your never know what time you're getting off and not enough hours so therefore the checks aren't enough"
bad,"Management does not know how to communicate"
bad,"Rude, they dont care about  working you and not training they will throw you where ever when ever, they really just dont care about you at all."
bad,I worked because i had to at the time but definitely the worst job ever. The managers were never professional. Someone was always getting their things stolen.
bad,the management is not good at all but the customer are awesome and the hours are not good at all. They have very good clothes and shoes. When the mall closes the store is still open.
bad,"I enjoy my job the people I work with and the customers.It's a friendly atmosphere with co workers and the customers, they always try to find better ways to improve customer service"
bad,I like working warehouse because i love working around others like to establish myself in a good work invironment and like ware house work it makes my days go faster and i know ive worked a full day.
bad,"In my particular store of experience, it was very messy from customers and you're expected to clean up a large area by yourself (alot of the time) at the end of the night. Management; my manager would get into fits of rage sometimes. He can go overboard alot forgetting that we are working in a dead end position, with little to no raise (eg.10 cents per year). In my store, the co-workers love to talk down about each other behind each others back (which i found very tacky). Not the best experience working here. They also will not give you the *full-time employee* status because they do not have the funds to extend benefits and they tell you forthright."
bad,"Burlington is not the place to work the pay is lousy ,  hours suck "
bad,"This job was not as great as my other jobs. There was a lot of waiting for people to show up with there cars. We would not get a lot of cars and it would be so boring just sitting there. Sometimes crazy people would come and complain and yell about their cars, which would get really intense."
bad,"The work place has great employees with good energy and excellent customers. However not really any benefits for employees who re not the managers or team leaders. In addition to that , employees hard work goes unrecognized."
bad,"A typical day at Burlington wasn't very professional at all. There weren't  a lot of committed workers; always short staff. Managers showed favoritism to co workers, didn't make new employees feel welcomed. I felt like I was rushed to get tasks done. Big tasks should have been done earlier in the day before the store got busy. Overall Burlington was very unorganized."
bad,"This company says one thing and does a differnt thing.  The managers only care about one thing, them.  They make the associates do way to much while they sit in the office and they complain to you that you didn't do it right, or didn't do enough.  They don't give you enough time to do all of your work or help you get it done. They are the first ones to throw you under the bus when it drives by.  Some managers don't think women should be in the store working and that they can't do the job without the help of the men in the store. Be cautious applying here."
bad,"Not a very good job to work,not enough hours or pay"
bad,horrible pay no benefits but a 20% discount the hours was short and the environment was horrible everyone was so rude and obnoxious there was no job stability at all!
bad,"A typical day inside this stressful work place is a typical distribution center work environment. The management is horrible here, anyone can be put in charge wther or not they know what there doing or not. Checks are normally messed up and you have to complain to get it fixed when its the companies fault that its messed up in the first place."
bad,The job is actually easy because all you doing is ticketing all day but it do get boring just standing in one spot all day doing the same thing but you do the job you are getting paid to do that's how I look at things.
bad,It was a good company to work for they just dont provide enough hours for their employees. I had fun working there just could not survive on what was being paid
bad,"Typical day at work looks like friendly but unprofessional customer service to mostly parents of neglected, undisciplined and screaming children. I learned that if you attempt to get help from the corporate headquarters concerning unresolved issues at work, your situation may worsen-- Hours cut so low as if to push you out of the company for seeming problematic. Co-workers consist of 50% friendly 50% unfriendly adults ranging from ages 18-50+. 1% of employees are professional. Hardest part of the job is staying consistent in an environment that is consistently eroding. Most enjoyable part is being employed."
bad,"At is a great job for people who do not have responsibility at home"
bad,They let me go. i had health issues but told them before about it. loved working before i was let go. co workers were very nice.
bad,Typical day price checking and handleing the register . The hardest part of the job would be long hours standing on your feet. The most enjoyable part of the day was helping out each customer.
bad,Friendly co workers but drama tends to follow. Busy non stop. Management is iffy. Lots of standing and/or walking. Time typically goes by quickly because you are so busy.
bad,A typical work day is basically the basics of retail work. Aside from my actual position I got to experience other positions. Management and co-workers were normally friendly and helpful which made each day easy. The only hard part was trying to reach the markdown goal for each week because of missing items. The best part was the weekly pay
bad,"Good company, could have used better management."
bad,"a typical work day consist of processing freight which also includes merchandising sales floor which includes Pricing,sensoring,and adding hangers."
bad,"this is a hard company to work for. lots of work for little pay . only store managers make good money, it is a good place to start a retail career. but you shoiuld move on after"
bad,"It was my first job but not my best there , I didn't learn anything there but clean and organizing departments. I help with customers at times but most of the time I didn't do much, the managers were very unhelpful and the employees were rude."
bad,"Burlington Coat Factory was a bittersweet experience, I gained alot of regular customers and positive feed back. Management does not back there employees. BCF stiffs you for raises and does not give benefits."
bad,"Overall, i did not like that job at all. I believe i've only worked there for about a month."
bad,I organized merchandise throughout the day and the night of my shift. I also rang up merchandise for customers.
bad,I worked at Burlington Coat Factory for about a year and a half and the turn over rate was high as far as staff and management.
bad,"replenishment of shoes and assisting customers, Assist customers in departments and assist their needs."
bad,"typical day at work was very fast paced and busy. co workers were very lazy, managers very unprofessional"
bad,"This company seem to have no real direction or purpose, it was a discount chain trying to be a department store."
bad,"They only hired me for a week to help clean up the upstairs basement which use to be a JCPenny. i was only temporary, then they put me on call.... and never called back"
bad,"I worked in a not so safe location where we had high theft and crime."
bad,"It's a pretty easy and straight forward job. You do have to lift some heavy stuff, and you do have to work fast pace. It's not a bad job, but I hardly get any hours."
bad,"Work was very demanding with constantly having to clean the store and being over worked. It was difficult when co-workers would not work together, but it was a challenge to ensure all customers had a positive shopping experience."
bad,"only busy during the holidays, messy store, but pays the bills"
bad,Get your feet wet and learn the business in this environment. It will be demanding of your time but can put you in a great position for future growth depending on where you see the course of your career moving.
bad,I was one of four managers within building and carried a load equal to the store manager position. My co-managers responsibility was far less than my own and there was a severe lack in both leadership and team work. The associates were a fun group of people that I enjoyed working with. The training program was obsolete and caused difficulty in people learning their jobs properly. The chaotic and stressful environment lead to high turnover and scheduling issues.
bad,basic retail merchandising. The other employees were a joy. Management was always in fluctuation.
bad,"GOD AWFUL< NO HOURS, MINIMUM WAGE EVEN WITH EXPERINCE, learned nothins, co workers slack, busy work, no rules for fitting room"
bad,"I learned many different ways to merchandise."
bad,"I had done a lot of work and effort in Burlington Coat Factory Receiving.  I was in charge of office computers, input of inventory.  I was responsible for scanning in central trucks as well as UPS and FedEx deliveries, to ensure all items were accounted for.  I was in charge of printing paperwork for checking in product using contracts."
bad,"In this position I learned to work with this different types of people, patience and to give customers the best of me."
bad,Didn't really like working here the store was never busy and just alot of dead time
bad,"I clock in see what needs to be done usuaiiy unload truck process process frieght learned to use telzon gun,process contracts co workers need continual training because of high turnover rate managements hands are tide by upper management as far as hours for employees to properly staff store one of tougher parts of job not usualy having enough time and personel to do what needs to be done and not knowing your work schedule week to week. good part of job most co workers and bosses are good to work with ,it's not dangerous or complicated its indoors and shifts are mornings to early evenings."
bad,"Great for a teenager. Not something I would want to do now. The job is typical retail, but management was not great so the entire store fell apart."
bad,"The Workers there are enjoyable. but Management is A little Inexperienced and hard to get along with,"
bad,"Employees worked good as a team. I started as a cashier only working the cash register, moved to Customer service were I learned to do  layaways, returned items, used computer to look up items and answer  "
bad,Other location were better to work at.  Store lacked management and professionalism.  
bad,I really liked this job. I just didn't like the people that I was working for. I did like the fact that if I finished with my work I could go home in which I had a part time job at the time and I was able to juggle both with no problem. 
bad,"The job could be better if managers offer more hours and a higher salary. My co-wokers are easy to get along with. A typical day at Burlington is lifting, standing for five hours or more. More importantly intracting with customers. Making sure customer service is a excellent. The most enjoyable part of the day is when a customer tells a manager how excellent the store associats are and complement the store. I really don't have a hard part of the day. Working at Burlington I have learned how to deal with people and attitudes."
bad,This was my first job out of the military and was meant to be a temporary move. What I can say is it is like any typical retail position overworked for little pay and no job security at all unless you are cool with a manager.
bad,"Unfortunately the business is managed through a complete lack of communication. Business runs because of the staff, not the management. It is a very backwards way of running a retail business. in a typical day 90% of the staff will complain about the working conditions, staff, and customers. i learned to focus on the customer so as not to become like the rest of the staff. The hardest part of this job is the pay, one is provided the lowest of income to supplement the highest of compassion for people who would rather leave their own children unattended for longer periods of time than legally obligated. The best part of working for the company unfortunately do not exist. This is a horrible job to have, unless using it as a portal to better employment opportunities. "
bad,I loved my job at first but after awhile the head manager would change the schedule of the week 2-3 times a week. Every employee found that ridiculous. It's so bad that we all had to call on our day off to see if the schedule was the same. So many employees quit and got fired that I started to be scheduled as the only cashier for the shift. That's the hardest part of the job because they made me responsible to do 15 jobs at once by myself. 
bad,"Not enough hours to be even considered part time. Management was very unorganized, they would say I work tomorrow, so I arrive at my time that I was assigned,  then right their they tell me I'm not working. They were suppose to train me for the cash register and only did 30 min and said to start working the register. I did not know what I was doing. I would tell them that I was confused and they said it was my fault for not listening when they trained me. The co-workers were very good people and they helped me out. The hardest part for me was being recovery. working on both floors cleaning everything and organizing. The enjoyable part were the few people i made friends with while working their."
bad,"I would say my time with Burlington Coat factory wasn't too bad. I made a lot of friends there and had an easy schedule. We did have a couple great managers, but we also has a couple with Integrity issues. I had worked at another Company for almost 3 years in Loss prevention and that company had a very well developed training program for not only the LP associates, but everyone in the store. It was frustrating to come to this company with my skill set and not be able to use it. The crowd was a bit rough at times and the store was almost always understaffed. I did enjoy a lot of my co-workers and some of the customers who came in to shop."
bad,a typical day at work is unloading a truck un pack the clothes out the price tag on them and get them floor ready
bad,Not a place good place to work had a rough time working with managment
bad,Assisting customers with their retail needs. There was no room for growth within the store.
bad,A typical day at burlington coat factory as the Customer Service Manager would be to make sure that the store is ran smoothly throughout the day. Handle any issues that may arise and make sure that the customers leave happy.
bad,Very fast paced dealing with over 100 customers a day. Very detailed and kid friendly
bad,dealing with customers
bad,"A typical day wasn't bad except for the verbal abuse going on in the receiving area. I learned new computer system there. managment turned a deaf ear toward some employee concerns. Co-workers were mostly agreeable. The job was never hard, a times tedious. The most enjoyable part of the job was doing good work as part of a team."
bad,"If you can find another job, do not work here! Associates earn minimum wage and they work you to death. Regional Managenment is a joke. No respect."
bad,"Rudderless company with conflicting directions from management. Out with the old (reliable and dedicated employees) and in with the new (antagonistic and power hungry) management. This place is akin to working in a tomb, waiting for the final nail on the coffin to be hammered in. No rewards for a job well done, just a blame game place."
bad,"Providing each customer receives with outstanding service by providing a friendly environment, which includes greeting and acknowledging every customer, maintaining outstanding standards, solid product knowledge and all other aspects of customer service. Maintain an awareness of all promotions and advertisements. Accurately and efficiently ring on registers and accurately maintain all cash and media at the registers. Communicate customer requests to management. Enter all media from register into the tally program. Maintain orderly appearance of register area and supplies stocked. Any other tasks as assigned from time to time by any manager. Etc."
bad,"The company was very unprofessional in its dealings with its employees, gender discrimination became heavy towards the end of my tenure."
bad,It's a good job just if you are working part time you don't get a lot of hours and half the time they cut your hours. They have favorites and the full time worker get more hours. It's not worth being on your feet most the time
bad,Working here small payroll they can’t pay sometimes I will not work a week. I am part-time employee. Hard work they want you doing something all the time.
bad,"The managers only seem to care about the money coming into the store, not about employee wellbeing. Training in certain departments is lacking, if any at all, which causes seasoned employees to pick up the slack. Scheduled hours always seem to be at a bare minimum, so most employees are doing 2, 3 jobs at a time, for minimum wage. It can get extremely stressful for these employees."
bad,"Unless you like being treated like toilet scum, do not, and I repeat, DO NOT WORK HERE! the store I worked at had the worst management team I had ever worked with. I was a supervisor for the store and I was doing the work of all of my superiors.The entire store worshiped division and gossip which killed the morale like the plague. Lastly, the pay and benefits are a complete joke. You will survive better working at McDonald's than here at this sweat and tear factory."
bad,There's plenty of potential for the company but just a matter of setting the example at one company passing everyone to the following companies our pay is very low a very close to minimum wage
bad,"A typical day at work as a cashier was to be only at the register's area. I learned how to speed the process of completing transactions, layaways, and returns. The store wasn't managed well. The manager will get their complete hours. They weren't best at communicating with employees. They had poor problem-solving skills. The hardest part of the job is to prioritize tasks due to always being understaffed. Additionally, part-time employees would only receive a maximum of 12 hours to work The most enjoyable part of the job is getting paid every week and getting discounts."
bad,Pay was disrespectful. Hours were cut daily even if the work was not done . Had to be there 6am just to be sent home at 11 - 12 . Paid weekly. I hated it . Only stayed about 2 or 3 weeks .
bad,The job is very annoying especially because I would close almost all the time and would be aggravating. If you are closing you leave earlier than you are supposed to making their target hours but you’re not receiving your hours  and they never ask you what days you are available to work before making the schedule. You get paid weekly and make 9.50 which is not enough to live off on. The managers look for open availability tbut how can you not have a second job with living on this tiny salary smh
bad,Chaotic madness and a hurricane of a store. The area it was in wasn't the best and people would always run out the store with arm fulls of merchandise.
bad,Their job ethic culture sucks! They work you like a slave for not enough pay. They don't sincerely care for their employees. They do not go by what they say they represent.
bad,Very good environment to work in but the manager there is very unorganized. Training wasn't very good...I was hired as the customer service lead. After 3 weeks I still didn't have the knowledge of my job description and wasn't trained properly.
bad,"The only positive thing about this job is you have a great work/life balance, because you hardly get any work. During my interview, I was told I would get at least 24 hours a week, but usually more. I've been there for about a month, and the most I've gotten was about 25 hours, and only because I spend two days training as a floor associate before they realized I was hired for receiving. We usually get 10-15 hours a week, 20 if we're lucky. Pay is $9/hr. We are supposed to work Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, but in reality, we work when they tell us to. Each shift starts at 6 am. The hours we get are based on how much payroll corporate allocates to us. They figure out how much payroll to allocate by taking how many pieces the truck is, averaging the time it takes to work each piece, and then most likely cutting that time in half. We have never come close to completing a truck on time, no matter how many people we have or how fast we work. We work about 3 days a week, and in the month I've been there they've told us twice to not come in cause they don't have any money to pay us. The work isn't hard; it is very hands on and you're constantly on your feet, but no matter how hard we work, it isn't enough for management. Everyone on the receiving team gets along well, mainly due to our shared hatred of the job. None of the different teams in the store (receiving, sales associate, cashier) get along, and if anything is wrong with the merchandise, (out of place, not sensored correctly) it is automatically the fault of the receiving team. Overall, I would definitely not recommend this"
bad,"Burlington pays pretty well and sell the job incredibly well in the interview but don't be fooled lol. The store is always messy, you are never properly trained on how to do anything in the store(It's more of a trial by fire or sink or swim type of thing.) Lunches are only 30 minutes even if you are working a 9-10 hour shift and the management(At least at my location) were complete garbage with an exception of one key holder who was quite nice. I don't want to go into too much detail about the job but honestly unless you are 35+ with no social life, don't work here. It's garbage"
bad,"No Communication, management needs professionalism, rules change accordingly to manager on shift, materials not always available to complete task. Work hours cut randomly and extra hrs given to favoritism."
bad,"The management was not the best, the schedules were always a message, but the co-workers were alright. the lunch breaks were also very short and barely have time to finish eating."
bad,"A typical day involved us to clean the sales floor and assist customers with finding items as needed. The main skill that I learned while at this job was how to improve my customer service skills. The management team was decent, however I often felt underappreciated and unrecognized for the work and effort I put out. The string of communication between the managers and the employees was very poor and there was very little guidance in terms of expectations which made the job difficult often times. What I most enjoyed from the job was the team I worked with and the valuable connections I made with other employees."
bad,The pay is not a livable wage.  The hours are awful and doled out based on preference of the managers.  Benefits are terrible.  No opportunity for advancement.
bad,"work here starts off with coming in at around 6 or 7am, 3 or 4 times a week, during the holidays they make you come in at 5am, there is a schedule posted every week it is just a reminder of when to come in, the time you actually get to leave is based off of the truck size and how many employees you never know when you get to go home, some days you work 2 hours and some days stay for 7 hours. we get harassed by the GM when we didn't hit the carton per hour workload only cared about us if we worked our a off just to meet the CPH we would literally have to sweat and run and get yelled at to hurry up just to meet the CPH everyday."
bad,Very hard to get hours. You're lucky if you get 15 hours a week. pay starts off at $8 but they raise it to $9 after 6 months. Customers are rude. Sometimes you'll be doing a lot of work while other employees do nothing. Definitely favoritism in the workplace. only good for if you're desperate for work and have no bills. it can be fun if you're an outgoing person and don't let the customers get to you. they hire anybody because people often quit. pay and hours are terrible.
bad,The ant right money not good and communication is off to many days off not enough hours.all they care about us money i dont have nothing positive to say
bad,"When I first came into the company I was expecting a good wage. One that a single mother could afford to take care of its child compensation. Thankfully I am not a mother, because with the wage of this company I wouldn't be able to afford a good living to any child. They give you one day a week and 3 if you are lucky. The only thing to look forward to is the 15% discount that you can't even use because your check can afford only the gas to your car to get to work  there.  I don't recommend this job to anyone other than students looking to improve their experience. I use to work as a stocker in the mornings and as a cashier. The managers are good but doesn't cut the poor lack of hours they give you. This company should feel a bit remorse for having to put up their employees thru so much pain with that paycheck. Its a million dollar company why not give more hours. The positives tho is the amazing co workers I use to work with. The company does not deserve those amazing associates."
bad,"No place to move up. You will stuck in your job title forever. The pay is horrible, Management and corporate does not care about you. There is about 5 full time positions in the store, I grantee you will not be one."
bad,"i was working as a part time,a tipical day of work began with the recovery of the section assigned by my manager, for example i worked in men section so i had to recovery the shirts section and to help the customers, measuring them , giving advice about the styles etc"
bad,Managers are talked down to and treated poorly when not meeting metrics such as customer service scores or weekend hour requirements. So much so that I've known managers do unethical things to meet these metrics.
bad,not a bad regional team.  Stores are run down.  Culture and moral aren't great.  Benefits and work-life balance aren't ideal.  It is retail after all.
bad,I applied fresh out of high school. It was fun at first until i was promoted to full time dept mngr. after that the store managers were not helpful. but the employees would always be willing to help each other out.
bad,i liked working with my coworkers but there was too many problems working here  the customers at this location were always difficult and confrontational. The store was always getting robbed not very safe .The hours are not too great at the moment i am working 8 hrs when im supposed to be working 20-30 weekly all because of payroll cuts and they are still hiring new employees .
bad,"Poor Management, No Hours, Workplace was always disorganized, Shady Managers, No communication, Everybody for themselves, No teamwork what so ever. Asked for help and they act like I was bothering them constantly.  Still being paid minimum wage, Registers always breaking down."
bad,I loved the opportunity to meet people from all over the state of Maryland.  This job afforded me the opportunity to learn how to communicate effectively with people of all cultures and backgrounds.
bad,Great place to have your few first jobs. They pay you an okay pay nothing too mich or too little but its a chill working environment amd teaches you alot.
bad,The worst working atmosphere I've ever been apart of. There is no standard of excellence and quality work is not incentivized or rewarded. Terrible treatment of salary team members. Will never work here ever again.
bad,"I had open availability, so of course, I was only given a 10 hour work week. This job at minimum wage was not enough to support myself. If you are looking for a job as a supplement to your current job then I would apply."
bad,I did receiving for a few years and the hours r not enough and da pay is minimum wage. This is like pocket money. Nothing you can live off. Great for a student or someone jus starting out. Management is real poor. Nothing professional about working here.
bad,"Mostly taking apart boxes and inventory, the days were very long and the breaks we very short. often i didnt know what to expect from the work day every day was diferent but not in a good way"
bad,"This company has potential, managers treat their workers unfairly. The job is fairly underpaid considering how much actual work the workers actually produce."
bad,The Burlington that I worked at was horrible and unorganized in alot of departments. Clothes and shoes was everywhere inside of the store. The bathrooms was unsanitary at times as well
bad,"This place is great to work at if you work part-time but other than that I would stray away. First off hourly pay is horrible compare to the amount of work you have to do. Also management is terrible but to be frank it is mostly regional teams fault. They bring in managers who are untrain to the company. If you are looking for part time this place is good for you, also if you don’t have any work experience. Other than that stay away from this place."
bad,"When I first walked inside my new place of business I noticed it was pretty cluttered. I have an OCD blessing and I seen an opportunity to not only fix something but make it better. During my short period of time working there, I changed and updated a system that was broken in weeks ""Alone"". I never complained because the lord blessed me with the will and strength of ten men. I've managed security, stockrooms, and sales floors with enough support from fellow managers, it felt like a team. The employees were friendly and greeted me with open arms. The work was adventurous, everyday was something new or a continued project. What I enjoyed most work there was the customers. I loved every single one of them, mad or happy. The goal I set everyday was to make every mad customer happy and to make every happy customer happier. It became difficult when I enforce a policy and no superior support it."
bad,"I really enjoyed working here for the first couple of weeks. I have really bad social anxiety so it really helped with coming out of my shell. Unfortunately customers are very rude and management doesn’t really do much about it, you kind of just have to take it. I planned to become a full time employee but positions were given away to others that I felt didn’t deserve them at least twice. I was told that I called into work too much and wasn’t experienced enough to take a full time position even though most employees are expected to go out of their way to help in other departments that aren’t even their own. I worked really hard to try to move up in the company but I felt I was taken advantage of multiple times. I eventually had to get a second job because part time wasn’t cutting it and they wouldn’t give me a full time position and then I eventually quit all together because it wasn’t worth it anymore. The only thing I miss about working at this place was the employee discount."
bad,"The merchandise is great, but the facility is dated and staff is minimal. Needs more streamlined mangement and employee policies. It once was a great working atmosphere, but things have gone down hill."
bad,"Burlington Coat Factory is a decent store with good sales and products, but the staff is usually a hit or miss. While I respect second-hand department stores for hiring people of various backgrounds, it's a shame that this store was so boastful yet very lacking. Not only were they not mindful of who roamed around in the PUBLIC bathrooms (I was an intern at the time when a random man stumbled into the ladies bathroom in his drunken stupor), they weren't as quick to do their jobs as they should have been. There were staff members who seemed too passive and too lax while working, but the ones who were a larger problem were the ones in charge. The store manager himself was inconsiderate and displayed favoritism while one of the MODs (managers on duty) was not mindful of the rules I had to follow as an intern. Aside from these major issues, there were some nice staff members and there was always work to be done."
bad,"I've worked in a lot of retail stores, but nothing like this.  How Burlington stay in business is unknown to me."
bad,Working at  Burlington Coat Factory was a horrible experience.  The management was horrible and biased .  Supervisors chose favorites and put others down .
bad,"In the morning there was always a big punch in line and you had to hurry to your station. This was my first job so i learned how to ticket items very fast and to do seeding at a very fast past."
bad,"It wasn't a bad place to work, but I didn't like how they did the scheduling. They didn't go by your availability and that can be stressful when you have school."
bad,"They love to burn associates, by that i mean work them till they quit! they start off at min and expect 15hr work. Management can never keep to the same script, word changed daily from upper management and favoritism is horrible there! No say so in who they they decide to help or advance they just want whatever is convenient. And don't go to HR for anything it just gets pushed to the side and nothing you say is in confidentiality."
bad,Sorry but this company is overly stressful. They want the job done but they only schedule you to work 4 hours a day for four days. Trucks come in daily and the expect freight to be worked. To much favoritism and low pay.
bad,Pay wasnt enough. Other employees didnt work as hard as others which made working more challenging and others had to pick up slack way to often. Managers had favorites.
bad,Great place to work if you like warehouse jobs very busy and sometimes stressful but overall the staff are very nice and willing to train u and work with you they make sure you have the job task down to the T and coach you along the way with no problem
bad,"I was hired in January and didnt offically start working there until March. I wasn't put on the schedule until April. I was told I was hired as part-time when in actual it was oncall which they didn't mention until I had gotten my first ""shift"" which was training. "
bad,"I was the top producer in my department and was not compensated as so. When I asked for a raise, I was given much praise but told that they couldn't afford it. They want employees to work long hours and not compensate them as such. I moved on to another employer and was paid twice as much immediately."
bad,"bad management, no appreciation, hardly anyone on the floor, over worked.  this company is horrible to work for, they don't give you enough hours and benefits sucks."
bad,"Working the receiving department is great since the work flow is Monday through Friday only, with a supervisor who messages late in the day prior to work to release information regarding the next day hours."
bad,Upgrade all stores systems and cash registers.  Balance the work among the employees.  Upgrade  training methods to ensure a better understanding of what the company want from each employee.
bad,"I enjoyed the atmosphere at Burlington. The people I worked with were amazing. But, this has to be the most unorganized management team I've ever dealt with. They were nice and super accommodating to my availability. But, they had very poor communication amongst themselves."
bad,"I worked here briefly while I was pregnant with my daughter and I found the work environment to be VERY unaccommodating to my most basic needs. Bathroom breaks and needing a stool to sit on was highly frowned upon. Additionally, I was given an unofficial promotion as cashier supervisor and was never given the benefits and pay for the position."
bad,"The current upper level management within the store I work at now is not that great. One manager is an arrogant know-it-all who cannot take any suggestions. This manager places a lot of stress on everyone else without offering any assistance in getting the job done. Training to do the job effectively is poor and inconsistent. Employee turnover is extremely high.  The co-workers I work with however are great. They are fun to work with."
bad,"I usually just come in and go straight to my desk and complete my assignments on time ,being here I have learned patients and dealing with diversity ,I work with 1 other person and we work together well, dealing with different leadership and being able to be a help to whoever needs my knowledge about the company"
bad,"A typical work day at Burlington is very fast paced and tiresome. Working in customer service is physically taxing as you have to run up a long flight of stairs to retrieve lay-away items for customers as well as place them in the proper section. As a customer service cashier, you'd have to answer phone calls to assist customers as well as perform exchanges and returns."
bad,A typical work day was ok. As a loss prevention officer my duties were simple. Perform my tasks and go home. Really that simple. Its a real mediocre job.
bad,the job is okay they need better managers an cashiers...more respect each other everyone plays to much at the store to many people dont do there job right .
bad,"And that's about the only pro as far as working there goes. There is no room for advancement and when you do get a chance to advance, you then realize you get double the work load for only a couple of quarters more per hour. The managers were great people but the work load of this store was amazingly stressful, especially when considering you only made one more dollar than minimum wage per hour. Appreciation was never shown for hard work and efforts therefore I need a company to show me that appreciation in return for my hard work and efforts in productivity."
bad,"I get to work every morning by 6am to unload the truck, after we're done around 7am we take everything out to the floor to process it by ticketing and censoring all that's necessary. After we get everything out of the boxes, ticketed and censored we put it up on the floor where it belongs or make a spot for it. Once everything is done and put up we go back to the receiving room to finish ticketing and censoring the shoes and clothes. I have obtained an amazing amount of knowledge and experience with having my job. I am a part time/backup cashier as well as working part time on the markdown team. I have the knowledge and power to do make tags, returns, layaways, and attend customer service when needed. The hardest part of the job would probably be waking up at 5am, and there really isn't a part of what I do that is necessarily easy... but having a good team that works together definitely makes the job a lot easier. A change in management would help the store greatly, but my supervisors and co-workers do an excellent job doing what they do."
bad,A typical day consist of random task not necessarily included in your job description. The store in which I worked was known for highest theft rate in the mall. One day you could be working Men's Suits and the very next day you could be thrown into Women's Shoe dept. Co-works all come equipped with  stand-offish attitudes which make you feel unwelcome.
bad,"I went to the two day job fair for Burlington and had two interviews in Sept. 2014. Second interview that day was with the actual store manager. I told them I was currently employed and had steady work there. I was only willing to leave that employer to work with Burlington was because I heard they where a great company and much closer to my home."
bad,The employees are great and willing to help. The upper management is horrible with a very high turn over. the job does have opportunity for advancement but after you work as an employee you won't want to advance. The good store managers leave and the ones everyone dislikes stay because they don't take employees seriously.
bad,"Working at Burlington Coat Factory I was in the customer service department. The job was easy, I did returns, exchanges and I also did regular purchases. Depending on my hours, I either got a 15, or a 15 and 30- minute break. I wont say I didn't learn much, but I really didn't. I already knew how to operate a cash register and I was pretty quick at picking up things. The management was horrible. The co workers, although some were nice and I got along with, others were too immature for the work place. you ever work at a job and they start doing hires and you just feel like they hire anybody? Or been at workplace and wondered, 'why did this person get hired?' it was like that. The hardest part of the job was the pay. They pay you nothing. And the most enjoyable part of the job, I guess getting paid weekly."
bad,"No Work life balance as a Manager with this company.  You had very little payroll to use to meet the standards that were required of company.  Therefore it fell on the shoulders of the salaried managers to complete most tasks."
bad,Was an ok job for the people that I worked with. ..Management was never in tuned to the workers. ...no matter how hard you worked it was never good enough. ...it must just be the Saginaw store....Co workers were fun to work with. ..job was ok....but plan on working with management that really don't care as lo as you show up....
bad,Get to work and get assigned your responsibility for the day whether it be the sales floor or cash register. Not really much communication among the management as far as training and setting examples. Hardest part of the job is getting over worked and taken advantage of for minimum wage. People have walked out during their shift because of lack of responsibility on the count of supervisors and management.
bad,"This was my first job, I learned how how to use the cash register, and customer service. Also how to deal with different types of people and what to do in difficult situations. Did not really like my co-workers, were always gossiping. Overall, an okay place to work."
bad,on a daily basis i assist customers. I am a part of the markdown team which includes scanning item bar codes to find clearance items through out the store. I also assist receiveing team to push out merchandise to the sales floor. Put up displays and maintnance the department store to look its best.
bad,Management was so bad at the store corporate came and changed the whole store mangement.
bad,"Co-workers were unresponsive to requests of aide, refused any type of small talk, and made the job truly miserable. "
bad,Supervise shift associates and closeout registers. Handle returns and complaints of customers.  Count out registers and verify that all monies are accounted for.
bad,"I'm not quite sure why I'm no longer employed with this company. Perfect attendance with no tardy for the nearly 2 yrs. I was with them. Assumed leadership position without the title or pay. I was subjected to a documented hostile work environment because of my attempt to protect the brand. Trained all the incoming new hires in my dept. including 2 that are hearing impaired. I have been recognized in the company newsletter for outstanding work in driving sales along with being employee of the month. Burlington policy of changing their scheduling module to force full-time employees to accept positions you didn't apply for and have absolutely no interest in or take a part-time position in the job that I personally thrived in according to their own standards is akin to bait and switch, which not only is short sighted but allows for a hard working, loyal and dedicated individual such as myself out in the cold the day after Thanksgiving. Happy Holidays To Me"
bad,only work here if you are desperate for a job the only good thing i expierenced at bcf was helping out my customers
bad,meet new people. learn alot about retail. fast paced. friendly shoppers. growing experience.
bad,"A good company to work for, but doesn't pay enough. The receiving job is simple enough to learn and interesting because you get to see all the new merchandise before everyone else. Management is solid, employees are friendly. Company does award stores regularly for good performance which usually means lunch for the store."
bad,"basic"
bad,"This was my first job, I enjoyed working there when I first started, however, within my first 6 months I realized that there was a lack of communication between managers and employees. Also there were some favoritism between employees and supervisors. Overall, I am still appreciative that they gave gave me a chance to work there, it was my first real job and I am thankful for the stepping stone they gave me."
bad,"No day is the same , always fast pace enviorment never a dull moment. Learning on the go is a must , there is little hands on training everything over the years have been self taught. Most of upper mangement executive are new to there postition and are still learning their jobs. My coworkers offer great support as a team in accomplishing croporates directives of daily task. The best part of the the job ist that there is always change for the better of the bussiness needs."
bad,The people where great and because you got to see the cloths.typical day short handed one employee doing multiple task and that is fine but you don't get recognized for the hard work and efforts you put into. The manager were great its the cooperate office
bad,Everyday I go into work and do the same thing. I work with about 5 other people in the back of the store unloading store merchandise off the truck and processing it throughout the day. The management at the particular BCF I work for is not exactly the best. Some of my managers are very lazy and play favorites with other co-workers. The hardest part of my job is lifting and carrying heavy boxes which I have no problem with. The most enjoyable part of my job are my co-workers. Everyone gets along great.
bad,It was a good experience for me. I got a chance to interact with the customers alot. Wish there was better management. That's all
bad,they hire to many people and not enough hours. they dont like to get rid of slackers. they dont pay well. there is barely any full time positions. they make promises they cant keep.
bad,"I loved working in the receiving area. The old management was the best & they actually cared about their employees. I miss working for them."
bad,"I took this position at a time when I desperately needed a job. The hours were great during the Christmas season, but then the week after  I was only scheduled for 16 to 18 hours and it was hardly worth the commute. They advertise a competitive wage but $9 is far from competitive, and I have extensive customer service and cashiering experience."
bad,Scheduled 8-12 hours a week on-call the rest of the week. 4-6 hours each scheduled shift. I absolutely love my co-workers. They make each work day pleasant
bad,Open with new store setup start to opening very stressful worked overtime and working 10 shifts.  Manager was over the top exceptions  from everyone Over worked and under paid
bad,Extremely unorganized company. The pay is not competitive and the training was nonexistent. The store I worked at was poorly managed and stressful at times
bad,"We don’t get paid enough. They push credit card applications and speed (which is fine for me because I work fast) but generally, the pay is not great and you don’t get enough hours either."
bad,"being a cashier at Burlington  is a zombie job"
bad,"Management has gotten focused on meeting payroll dictated from on high. If the store meets goals, that is not reflected in payroll. Employees are expected to do the job of twice as many people. Full-time employees see more and more tasks added to their expectations. In the end, even if I was sick and using sick time included in my benefits, I was harangued about running up points towards termination.Supervisor's were expected to do the full job of a full-time associate and work as a manager. Raises were in cents and not dollars. Even on my best review, I never received more than a one dollar raise, and I had the highest raise of anyone in the store. When visits from higher ups are expected, then stress towards employees, especially full-time employees gets increased. Naturally, turnover is very high."
bad,"What can I say about this place that I’ve spent the past 3 years in?"
bad,"Store always had a ton of people in it and the management initially was very good at balancing the needs of customers and workers, however I left due to new management coming in and making it increasingly difficult to not dread waking up to go to work"
bad,"If you're looking for something to do while you're in school or a second job, this would be it. Don't see how people stick around though. If you work on the floor and depending on the store, you'll get burned out pretty quick. Women's fitting room is one of the busiest areas other than the register and it's highly stressful. Manager and cashiers expect you to do 3 different tasks at once while you're maintaining your own department."
bad,"The job as a custodian there is easy however it's everything else at Burlington that's problematic. For one there point system is downright unreasonable , each absence whether it's excused with doctors note or not counts as 2 points towards termination,each consecutive absence adds an additional 2 points on top the base 2  and a total of 7 points gets you terminated. Which means you cannot afford to get sick here. Also this may vary  but at my particular location the job culture was very negative it was a battle every night  I had one manager doing his job properly but then one toxic manager underneath him trying to undercut and sabotage workers  telling us not to follow the main managers orders. You can only deal with this for so long until you have to correct the toxic person that what they are doing is not only disrespectful to the main manager but is disrespectful to you the worker who only wants to do his job as he/she is directed to do. It's not much you can do about this type of scenario because the culture there creates the type of comfort where employees feel like they can behave however they want without repercussion.I literally witness two employees come to blows in the breakroom literally over nothing. If you must I highly advised that  if you do choose to work for this company only do so until you find something else."
bad,"I believe Burlington is a great employer if they would allow one to work full time enough to qualify for benefits rather than making sure to keep your hrs beneath that of a full time employee. perpetually waiting for career advancement, employee recognition"
bad,I left the company due to lack of compensation and the number of hours I worked weekly 70 to over 80 hours weekly sometimes over 100. I worked there 8 years ago and have little to say about the company.  I am sure many things have changed.
bad,"A typical day at work is attempting to do sstt and not getting anything done because the cashiers are moving extremely slow which effects all the full timers because we cant meet our sstt deadlines. It effects the full timers we are called to get on the register every few minutes, it is also always extremely hot in the store i don't know if the air is broken but the customers also complain because no one wants to shop in the heat its uncomfortable.I have learned that during fourth quarter the management team is under a lot of pressure which they also put the full timers under pressure that its sink or swim basically you keep up or you wont make it. Management is horrible they don't know how to communicate to each other one manager tells you something and another one tells you something they give you the run around and wonder why you are not caught up. They only pick on me about small things that aren't done in my department and start to tell me i need to catch up and im behind and its only two of the managers that are doing this and i feel as if all the other things they say to me i feel very uncomfortable and also feel like they are discriminating. The hardest thing is attempting to do my sstt when constantly called to do register because the cashier are not working fast. I do like working with my other coworkers they keep me going especially if i am down or having a bad day."
bad,"When I was working here it was a cool job and they had great  a staff, they also don’t like to promote employees fast or give them a raise need to fix that"
bad,"For a first job, it was decent. Loved my team members and immediate supervisor. Store management was poor and would change things and not notify our team, then yell at us when we did it wrong. Don’t know the hours or days you work until the day before. Only 1 or 2 breaks per day, on your feet the rest of the time. Job is interesting at first but quickly becomes very boring as you do the same things every single day.  No room for advancement."
bad,"My role was in receiving, which was 6a-12p, Mon-Fri. Sometimes the deliveries were smaller and the shifts were shorter, but that was average. What was bad about Burlington was how they treated internal issues, and the pay was terrible. If a co-worker stole or was late every single day, they wouldn't do anything about it. They had to, as they put it, ""let them dig their own grave"". They waited until they either did something so bad that they could call the police, or they waited until they could give a verbal warning, then write them up 3 times, then give a final warning and meet with them, THEN they fire them. Because of this, we were frequently understaffed in the back. They would hire young unreliable kids (18/19 year olds) who didn't care if they were late or didn't show up at all because they lived at home and didn't have bills. There would be days when there were 3 or 4 people working in the back when we were supposed to have 9. This makes it very stressful for the people who care about their jobs. Also, because we can't get overtime, if there aren't enough people, and you can't finish the truck in the allotted time, you still have to go home, and save the rest for either the cashiers, or for the next day. They won't let you stay to finish. That makes no sense to me. Also, don't expect much of an annual raise. I worked there during the remodel, and even though some of us worked our butts off, the max raise anyone got was 25 cents. And only 3 people got that raise. One person got nothing, even though they helped with the remodel, moving heavy displays. It's very discouraging."
bad,"No structure. No chain of command. No communicate within managers and team members. No annual pay raise 20 cents is nothing at all.      "
bad,The store manager is very lazy and don't do anything but literally sit in his office. The store supervisor does all his work just about. He doesn't know how to talk to people and doesn't give enough hours to survive in this world.
bad,Working at Burlington was the most stressful Retailer I worked for there were Some nice employees & some nice management other than that nothing else .
bad,"Their receiving area is one phone call away from an OSHA visit.  The amount of work and time constraints they put upon us are unrealistic.  I feel like a invisible person, when  corporate comes in they don’t speak or talk to us in the rear. It’s like the don’t even acknowlege us as what make the stores function, like we’re unimportant."
bad,"i was always closing by myself and when it was busy, i didnt get much help from anyone. Weekends were always crowded up front at the registers, very poor plan of attack to get things moving properly. people i worked with were always nice."
bad,"Extremely unprofessional from upper level management, to the receiving team. The companies leading representatives (District manager, Store owner, HR) would enter/exit the building without saying a word to you (even after spoken to). Management in my case, refused to adjust my availability, being a full time student; for the start of the new semester. Employees are only allowed to send a request, that needs a managers approval. Before points even began to accumulate I verbally stated my need for a schedule adjustment, & even after having documentation of each occurrence, Human Resources  refused to favor my case of wrongful separation."
bad,"A typical day at the store included cleaning up my department on top of picking up the mess of the full time employee of the department that never really did anything except rearrange the shoes by colors. You typically didn't get just one department at this location, you usually had 2-3 on top of having to do back up cashier/layaway. I also  put away the layaway orders and would retrieve them once the guest(s) came in and paid for them. I don't know if it is still the same with having multiple departments per person since I left at the end of August of 2015, but it was a stressful time when they were understaffed and had everyone up front. It seemed that management was afraid of the general store manager (who is no longer there) and would side with her when she had an issue, but then would turn around and compliment your work ethic and say that she wasn't completely correct with what she was telling you what you did wrong or something."
bad,burlington is a good job to work for if you are young and need a job the hours are not a full time employee are if you are paying bills and rent  good part time job
bad,The management team does't have a clue in the world as to what they are doing.  They treat their employees like dogs and talk down to them like they are children.
bad,"The job is fairly easy if you like cleaning up after people. Flexible hour. However, you are asked to do to much for the pay you are giving. Corporate doesnt supply you with the things you need for the job to be completed as they want. can be very stressful"
bad,Burlington has good discounts for any ones shopping needs . 1/2 Hour breaks. 4-8 Hour shifts 3-7 days a week great merchandise for the entire family and house hold goods
bad,This job is very fast paced especially on weekends. You will be on your feet the entire shift. Low pay and long hours. Huge store so if you're closing you'll at least be there an hour after closing.
bad,"how to put this delicately....I was the only white person their. I have heard the N word more times in one day than I have in my entire life. the work atmosphere is not professional, nor will you find any help. I feel very bad for management, as they do not know how to handle the culture up their."
bad,"Work was average management, they don't care about your family life. The building was old and musty and falling apart! Store manager was very moody on a daily basis. I liked Burlington as a hole, but it dose need some corporate change! The daily life, open close, get staffing organized. Freight out on the floor and merchandised properly. Check corporate emails regularly though out the day."
bad,"A typical day at work was lifting and positioning boxes all day until clock out. I didn't learn much from the fact that you just stack boxes neatly so it doesn't collapse. It teaches you responsibilities because sometimes you might receive multiple trucks. Management was alright. It was multiple split managers for different work positions so they just check on you. I liked the vibe some people gave off here, real friendly. Hardest part about the job was lifting heavy boxes on a hot truck. Also, you couldn't listen to entertainment (music,sports) while doing so, which is understandable sometimes. The most enjoyable was finally getting a lunch break and clocking out."
bad,"Corporate does not care what a store needs,they believe that they know what best for any store. If your applying for the Loss prevention,please think twice. There is no chance of promotion, the raises and super low, i mean low. When you complain they say your the issue on why the raise was low. If you wanna be a greeter, expect to work only a day."
bad,"Management was horrid, disorganized. The store didnt care about it employess. The point system sucked that was in place. it was like a revolving door."
bad,Workplace culture is very adversarial.Extreme lack of communication between shifts and departments. Lack of transparency between management and employees.
bad,"I got hired at burlington coat as a loss prevention associate, at first all kool because they told me I would able to choose my own schedule and days off. I thought I was also going too apprehend people as well  but, they where all lies you can't even make a stop or  get b time from working to get yourr days off. The managers and the people at burlington will make your job harder because they pull u all kind of direction. Listen to me you don't want this job not what you think it is I can guarantee you that"
bad,This job is a perfect job for a college student. Raise rarely happen 2 years of work with above average employee ratings and no raise or what so ever. The hours are flexible making it easy to work with school or 2nd job schedule. Employees are amazing. Always making everything lively and enjoyable environment.
bad,"Unload truck and sort through products, stock hardlines on floor, size and stock clothes, while we stock clothes and other products we help customers with their needs if they ask for anything or if we see that they may need help. Sometimes we would relocate product around the store and set it up in a nice professional display. Management has never been real nice to any of the employees, but the job itself was fun and enjoyable. The hardest part of the job was trying to find someone in charge to help with questions that some of us had, most of the time customers had questions about something and if we didnt know the answer to it we would have to find a manager.  Most of the time they would be outside smoking."
bad,"Conference calls, money counts, change in safe and counts, interviews, onboarding, merchandising, setting shops, unloading the trucks. Keeping all staff members on lunch schedules and productivity schedules."
bad,Not enuff hours as i thouht they would give me ... Couldnt deal with getting paid 130 each week. But overall everybody is pretty nice and laid back its just the paycheck that was killing me.
bad,Started as a cashier and had advancement opportunities to a CSS. Management is terrible and schedule is always messed up either they have one person up front or have just a cashier in customer service. Poor hours if you're a cashier and always end up doing other people's jobs. Management isn't organized and lacks understanding of how much their employees do.
bad,I liked working at burlington. I love the fast pace and all the customers . Working with people is what I love to do.  My co workers were a pleasure to work with.  Overall a decent place to work .
bad,great co-workers. It feels like family. Managment sucks. not respectful to there co-workers. Only want you for weekends. will cut your hours at any minute. just really want you for the holidays.
bad,I overall like the job at Burlington the people are nice but the management is below average and make bad judgment calls occasionally.
bad,"It's a pretty good company overall, but they don't offer many advancement opportunities.  The managers are nice, but if you're a good employee it's nearly impossible to make them happy, because they always expect more.  Management makes promises, but doesn't tend to keep them, and getting time off isn't easy.  Once you get it approved by management, they will often still schedule you until you bring it up to them multiple times more.  Co-workers are nice for the most part, but like any job there's the good and the bad.  Most enjoyable part of the job is the pay day."
bad,"All I will really say is that Burlington isn't an enjoyable job. the job itself, yes, but the people who run it ruin it, such as management. Other than that, 45 min. breaks are quite enjoyable."
bad,"A typical work day included being told that you're not good enough and that you will be fired. The most enjoyable part of work was actually working. Management had poor leadership skills, my coworkers were a pleasure to work with it. The hardest part of the job was listening to the demeaning speeches from upper management."
bad,"They are really flexible with associates who are in college and days you need off but other than that I hated working here. Management sucks, they don't really care. They try to act like they do but they really don't. They suck at scheduling, making one cashier close on a Friday night and then expect back ups to come up and help out but then they can't finish their job on the floor. The computer system sucks too. Pin pads were constantly off line and not working therefore our computers were really slow, then you have impatient and angry customers you have to take care of. Management lacked communication with one another. The holidays were the worst. The only thing I really liked about this job was my co workers."
bad,"The company's goals and values are very ethical. I love working for Burlington. However this particular branches management team is poor. I love my job, my coworkers and most of all the customers. A typical day at work is maintaining a safe and clean sales are, and occasionally, I am a cashier. The hardest part of y job is working on a Saturday night alone because the floor is huge and it gets really hectic. The most enjoyable part of my job is when customers ask me for my opinion and talking with them."
bad,The work environment is bad since there is to much gossip and favoritism. They give very minimal raises and pay is not good at all. after working so long with only 20 cents raise I just had to look for something better because even supervisors do not get paid enough. they want to give you tremendous amount of work for very little pay and overtime was mandatory for everyone with no exception. DO NOT APPLY here unless you are desperate.
bad,time is so valuable. Not all my co-workers are nice to me. Hardest part is when the manager came and treat us like a robot with no batteries that drain. I've learned how to be patient. Although its just my part time job but still i enjoy doing my job.
bad,There is a good deal of opportunity for position advancement at this particular store. The work is fairly simple and conflicts between employees are handled well. The downsides are that the pay is minimum-wage and the style of management found here can seem authoritarian and disrespectful at times.
bad,"This company does not care about it's employees at all! They will work you in the ground for a small amount of pay, will even have you working 2 departments at the same time. And when closing expect you to recover and replenish both departments by yourself!  The discount is the lowest in retail history only 10% which is only sales tax here...what a waste! It's just not worth it...oh they will call you in on your off days and if you have children you will close every shift while teenagers and senior citizens get day shifts!"
bad,The store management team is not the strongest or most organized group of individuals but the staff makes up for their short comings.
bad,Management is horrible. Co-workers are lazy. A typical day working at Burlington is horrible. Management will have you work in three departments by yourself for your shift. Sometimes they won't have anyone work in a department for the morning shift so the department is a mess and there is re-shop that's built up all morning and it's left for the one or two people who have to work the evening shift. The managers do nothing but walk around a criticize. Management shows favoritism towards certain employees. Certain employees can not follow some of the rules that are in place and not get a citation for it. A few things that I have learned working here is good customer service and how to sell to customers. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers who believe they need to come first when there are 2 or 3 customers ahead of them in line. Management needs to be able to communicate. What one manager says to do a different manager thinks it is not important and assigns a completely different task. Customer service supervisors don't know how to manage. They will call for backup cashiers but don't realize some backups are the only people in their department. By the time the backups are done the store is a complete mess and we stay well past our clock out times just to finish and make sure the store is clean. If you are a college student they will try to work around your schedule but more than likely they will schedule you on days they shouldn't therefore adding up points against you because they scheduled you on a days you have class. This store is just disorganized and is
bad,"maintained extensive knowledge of products, created life long friendships and new experiences"
bad,Not the best job in the world but you meet nice people. nice if your a student . Not ideal otherwise
bad,"Its a production environment. I help unload shipments by stacking and organizing boxed. I take merchandise out of boxes and price, tag, sensor, hang size and organize. I help maintain a safe environment by keeping fire exits and walk ways clear of debris."
bad,Never a bored moment at this job. My days went by rapidly each day I clocked in. I had a project to work on each day. This job required flexibility at all times. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting customers of different culture and fulfilling their needs in helping them choose the merchandise of satisfaction. I learned to accept people just as they are and not to be judgemental against anyone. My co-workers all was very hardworking people most of all they were easily to get along with. Very fun co-workers lots of energy.
bad,"Fun enviorment! Employyes there are to immature to work with,goes for management as well."
bad,"I was there for seven years while there I hardly got a rise. Management would give a person not enough hours but wanted a laundry list of things to get done. If you weren't able to finish the projects because of needing to assist customers, you would get wrote up even though they said you're always suppose to help customers first. I did like the employees, they were like family and I still come back to visit but I wouldn't ever work for the company again."
bad,If you have a family don’t work here this isn’t for you. Mostly during holiday season they cares less. Management never listens to the associate there.
bad,"They don’t give you, your first 15 min break. You have a lunch then your 15min . started at $8hr during  holiday season . Long hours and a lot of work . No real training .."
bad,"The store location I work at has some poor management and favoritism is huge. You get lied to a lot and miss out on information, and management blames you. There is a high turnover rate because they give a few hours (12 hrs), and they overwork you without being paid decently. Most workers have two jobs there because of this, and really only stay for the discount."
bad,the job was okay easy work but the manager jim and sklyar sucked they would say i needed to  work hours i said i could not do during interview .  my checks was  short and jim was very unprofessional about it. they changed the schedule all the time i would think i leave a certain time  the next day the schedule is different no set schedule
bad,They are a good store to work for just not when it comes to doctor notes you must be able to lift up to 50 lbs or more and have a flexible schedule but over all good store
bad,The associates make the place tolerable . Lack of communication and leadership. Corporate cuts off payroll so there’s never any associates to clean and help customers.
bad,I gave 10 years of my life to this company. I worked through so many changes at this company and would still be there busting myself. Except they restructured their management model. The people I worked with and the store manager(s) were great. The district manager is totally incompetent and has no grasp for what goes on in the building.  The same can be said for all management above that level. And if those managers don’t like you -there’s nothing you’ll be able to do about it. They play favoritisms and choose their favorites with a quick first impression and don’t want to get to know you. Of course they rarely come to your store anyway!
bad,"P.O.S. & credit/debit card terminals malfunctioned often. Slow servers impacted automated tracking system, training sites and the scheduling software. Very compliance oriented company and everything was tracked."
bad,"No restrooms for about 2 days. Raw sewage, plumbing issue....had to use neighboring businesses bathroom.  Parking lot HAD NO LIGHTING (lights were burned out) for 3 months.  The only good thing about the job was work was easy and customers nice."
bad,"on a typical day was crazy busy "
bad,Fairly easy work. Good for younger people or those who have retired and need something part time. Messy inventory being that is a discount store. Lots of customers stealing. Management was serious but okay.
bad,Supervisors does not show any professionalism at all.  You have to remind them your break and lunch time.  If you are a cashier they expect you not to move from your register while lines are busy even if is your lunch time or if you need to use restroom. Very disorganized staff.
bad,"I really enjoy and like most of the people that I work with the coworkers are fantastic depending on who it is. I really do like my manager and supervisors"
bad,Supervise team in processing freight in a very fast paced work environment. It has a Great work schedule with holiday pay. The hardest part of the job is encouraging associates to speed up their work in exchange for lowering their daily pay. People should be incentivised to work faster. Any business model like this will have a high turnover rate.
bad,Th pay is way too low for the work that we do. It's hard work that leaves you extremely tired and its very stressful to get everything done in the small amount of time that we're given. There's no air or heat in the backroom so its cold in winter and hot in summer. Only work 3 days out of the week for 4.5 hours at 8.25/hr. Honestly it isn't work your time unless its a side job for someone who doesn't have any bills.
bad,"Mangers are indecisive, dont know what there doing .The place is messy no organization but they will work with your schedule. Love the meetings only if the managers stay on one accord"
bad,"While this company looks like it has a good future from business reports and retail forcasting; the reality is that when you work there it is very different. The regional team looks at numbers only and rarely try to help the store get better. The store would communicate issues but the feeback was not always positive. Much time was spent on the operations and only a little time left for merchandising. "
bad,When working at Burlington I learned a lot of things with warehouse jobs I was a picker packer and I enjoyed being there but due some circumstances I wasn't able to continue my job there and I had to search for a job elsewhere
bad,"Fun and friendly work place it's a great first job. "
bad,"Did not like the management, poor leadership not much direction for employees.  This is not a place for someone to advance in a career.This is an environment to obtain a check."
bad,"Not the easiest place to work. Management is more than challenging and less than encouraging. No support system training is sink or swim. Definitely not diverse by any means. Culture is very ""clicky"" and not inclusive."
bad,Retail is retail. They are no different.Experience was mostly positive. My last regional was not great. Micromanaged everything down to the time you could go to the bathroom. Why hire managers if you are just going to manage over top of them?
bad,"I learned very little, but i new how to use a cashier i came into the company with experience already. Supervision was not helpful nor management. Low wage no opportunity to grow."
bad,"The managers didn't seem to care about anyone but themselves. The other staff was very friendly, but extremely stressed."
bad,"Was recruited to work as ASM to open up a new store location, lost job 8 months later due to company downsizing. Very unorganized, ever changing environment, with not so great changes at all. Associates who are liked get their ways with management, accountability is missing, double standards and way to high expectations for a pay they offer. Just like any other company, cutting costs in everything, limiting salaries, hours and resources, even though their last year sales are up comparing to the year before. Favoritism widely spread. When desperate for employees, very poor choice of new ones, had to work with very racist, lazy people."
bad,I would arrive in the morning and find out what forklift I was on and go get it. There were orders that you had to fill so you would transfer pallets of pick items until the orders were filled.
bad,"Typical day was showing up at 6 am and unloading, unpacking and sorting anywhere from 150 to 900 boxes until 7 am. Then we split off into our departments and merchandise until 9 am when we take out break. Work in the freight department for the rest of your shift hanging and tagging the clothes to be put out onto the sales floor."
bad,"My typical day at work consists of working more than one department at a time,due to management hiring people with poor work ethic.I've learned to be a self starter at work.The majority of my coworkers stand around and talk to each other,as the store gets untidy and chaotic.The hardest part of my job is hearing customers complain about our bathroom facilities being disgusting.I have asked my managers if I could clean it countless times,and their response was that they would do it and I shouldn't worry about it (it didn't get done until hours later)The most enjoyable part of the job,is insuring that the customer leaves happy with the merchandise (or a similar product) they were seeking to purchase."
bad,"Working in a safe and great work place is the best thing but, sometime it may not be great still i make the best out of it. Having a team that gets the job done properly without complaints and work together is also a plus."
bad,"I have spent about three years with the company now and I feel as if things have only declined over time. Coverage is the bare minimum. Associates are paid at the minimum wage to try and do the jobs of three people. Management is self-serving as is the company itself. I am disgusted with some of the products that we try to sell because they don't want to lose money on them, yet every week they continue to slash prices. "
bad,"They pay less than any retail store, Mirco manage meaning every decision is questioned and turned into a lengthy process. The hour are horrible. Their is no organization or communication."
bad,"the company seems to be going through changes constantly."
bad,I worked everyday with my coworkers on the sales floor. My job was to arrange inventory on the store floor and returning merchandise to appropriate place in store. The hardest part of the job was making sure all the customers were satisfied when they left the store. The most enjoyable part was working as a team with my coworkers.
bad,A typical day at work would include doing whatever it takes to satisfy  customers need and maintaining excellent shopping experience. The cons is that Management always takes customer side in the event of a problem and almost never an employee side which crates a negative work environment.
bad,"Good for just starting a job"
bad,The hardest part of the day is dealing with extremely rude costumers and the fact that most of the time there is only two cashiers open during the week
bad,I learned that you have to watch yourself in the retail business because anyone will step on toes to get advancement.
bad,They don't accommodate to any employees unless you are full time which isn't fair. as well as they don't give more hours when asked for yet still hire on more people.
bad,Store is busy at all times and customers tend to be rude. There is a lot to do and no one got to leave until everything was clean at the end of every night.
bad,"My experience was critical. When management was needed, the manager knew nothing of the systems to help. It felt as if a small problem turned into an overdrawn problem because the manager did not know how to fix the problem to help the employee and customer."
bad,Don’t do it. It’s ok then boring then nothing then fast an crazy and nobody puts away hangers always dirty and y’all can’t even keep your snack machine stocked
bad,"Was a very stressful and complicated work place for me, i feel we were underpaid for all the work we did. I would have probably liked and respected it better if management were more understanding, sensitive and respectful to employes as well as our needs and efforts.  And put up a reliable schedule, as i and as well as many others do have a life and responsibilities beyond just work."
bad,In my store it was a constant experience of drama in the work place .many of the managers were rude and disrespectful and had their own hidden agendas people abused their power constantly.
bad,If you’re in school it’s good place to work for the would try work your schedule. But for job career for the future no I do think it’s good place to work for. Cause only doing part time most of the time working 12 to 15 hours a week.
bad,"A typical work day is staying in your department and maintaining it clean."
bad,"My managers are okay, the company just doesn’t  want to give hours. The stock team needs to work fast enough for a job of 3, just by themselves in a short amount of time. It can be a lot of stress and frustration.  Also, I do not make enough money to cover the bills that I have."
bad,"I learned a lot and gained experienced as one of my first jobs. It was't bad at first, but learning how poor management was made the job even more challenging and a but unfair to me. A smile will not appear on my face while working, but in the end I appreciated the job opportunity since in the end it made me a stronger person."
bad,I do not recommend working here unless you are calm under stress or have tough skin pay sucks management is ok but the customers are horrible honestly if I was paid what I should be paid for my position I would stay
bad,"As my first job; I feel as though it is a really good job to help you understand the demands of both your customers and your co-workers (Though most co-workers can't do their job correctly. Everyone argues, especially the supervisors, and though the cashiers complain to management nothing gets done. They have a point system for working and if you miss a day you get 1 point, weekends 2. At 12 points you are terminated. I find this very confrontational especially since the management removes/adds points which doesn't seem appropriate or fair. Overall this is an okay job for beginners solely because of how DEMANDING both the customers and supervisors are."
bad,"Burlington was a slow paced enviornment. people where somewhat friendly. the job was filled with so many different people from different countries. The energy in there was great. The job was pretty easy, nothing hard at all. The hardest thing about the job was trying to keep enviornment clean while customers shopped."
bad,"Retail sales ,with competitiveness with others stores. Collaborative with co-workers to meet the needs of the customers. A fun fast paced environment."
bad,Decent retail management position. Pay including benefits were fair. opportunity for growth was there. Long hours expected all year for salaried management.
bad,"DO not work as a team all the time, communication with manager needs to be work on.hardest partys the holidays.the most enjoyable day is Easter. i learn different department"
bad,"You deal with long lines and impatient customers depending on the area you live in. "
bad,"The people who worked there all were friendly towards me. I felt welcomed by them. They allowed me to work independently, and this helped me as an individual wanting to venture off on my own."
bad,Honestly  it was so much work with not enough time for anyone to get it done at the time. Co workers was easy to get along with and very understanding. Management was unorganized. My supervisor was a good supervisor
bad,The pay at this job is really unexpectable yea u get paid every week depending position but if your a cashier not as much ....I got 3 words not worth it..
bad,Unloading the truck. Stocking the store. Helping customers. In charge of claiming any broke items. Making sure store is clean and ready for opening. Giving great customer service.
bad,Working for this company was a wonderful experience. I met new people and actually gained a lot of respect from loyal customers .
bad,Burlington is a steady paced work environment. I learned how to keep a drawer and a tidy work space. Thhere was always something to do which makes the day go by quickly and the managers were easy to get along with.
bad,It was a great environment and people got along there. Just a very unorganized store. The manager that fired me got fired the following day. In which I was happy about because I was wrongfully fired
bad,"The job environment as a whole is amazing, nice clean area to assist customers. I learned what work goes on within the receiving department also as a cashier and floor associate. The hardest part of the job was being a cashier and trying to close out all transactions promptly to avoid long lines and getting layaway transactions processed! The most enjoyable part of the job was being the cashier also with being able to interact with many different types of people. The co-workers were great as long as the day wasn't too stressful. Associates in the receiving area seemed to be more relaxed and easy going than the cashier associates. Could be that the front of the store was more stressful than receiving. Some of the management on the other hand could really use an attitude change. The management should learn how to speak to their associates and not create a hostile environment and keep it pleasant."
bad,employees run the store...not the management team. The managers do not work as a team.
bad,"no thanks."
bad,"handled money, answered questions that were important to customers, stocked shelves."
bad,a typical day was about 5 hours in the early morning in which you busied yourself putting new murchandise out on the floor for customers to see. its alot of busy work that was only seasonal not many full time opportunitites available.
bad,it was not so great of an experience. very unorganized and the employees were not very warming. It was not enjoyable going to work each day because i never knew what my title at the job was and had little to no training.
bad,I can't say to much I was only (Seasonal) mostly shoes Dept Men Dept . Helping customer and answers questions .
bad,"No hours no consideration  3 days a week need more organized supervisors and detailed oriented workers "
bad,Lots of drama involved with working for this company from management down to the cashiers. Very disorganized and don't expect anyone to go out of their way for you.
bad,"A typical day of work as a cashier would start with a brief discussion with my manager about the work I was expected to do for the day. Sometimes this would consist of the manager telling me what register I was working at and nothing more. Other times I would learn about another department that I was going to help for part of the day, or a project at the front that I was going to be in charge of. The days that I spent in other departments were usually right after large shipments, where my manager would need help getting as much merchandise to the sales floor as possible. The projects at the front were typically displays that I would be organizing or new promotional items that I would be putting up in place of old ones."
bad,"the store is horrible! the turnover is super high because they put people by themselves to cashier and clean the floor. customers constantly complain how they can't find anybody to help them on the floor and why are there only two cashiers on a friday night! you can tell the managers what bothers you and they don't do anything about it. there is favoritism. they do not appreciate their good employees who come to work, do their work and don't call in. even if somebody calls out, they will rarely call someone else in to take that person's place, so the work is pushed on everybody else. they'll still get mad at you even if you had to go help the cashiers and the departments you are responsible for isn't done."
bad,"Was a department lead loved my job. Had so much pride in my work that I shared it on social media. Until some new management stepped in...constantly getting talked to like the lowest form of garbage and told constantly about that managers past career titles in compare to my current job title, constantly changing my department around and didn’t know what was going on, I kind of just lost my love for it...got talked to about it started to pick up myself again....I even went to talk to upper management about the manager  no one cared to listen  so the countless times of me reaching out ended up on me just emotionally quitting the job that I loved some much and I walked out...."
bad,"I held this job for about a month, and left a few months ago. My time at Burlington was okay, to say the least. "
bad,"although it is a very self explanatory job it can get very tiring and repetitive"
bad,"I was hired early on this September on the spot which I thought was awesome. My issue is that they had me come in for 5 hours to do online orientation off their computer, do everything on workday and then nothing but silence for more than two weeks. Then they scheduled me to come in doing cashier on a Saturday? One of the busiest days I got no training previously, didn’t have me come in any time when it wasn’t busy to get hands on training, no walk around of the store and then after watching someone for 2 hours but during this fast paced environment being told 50 things in an hour and a half where the line wouldn’t go down they put me on register and just left me alone. Kind of kept checking if I was okay but nobody shadowing me through the whole process. Then they kept asking me questions like if I remembered what queueing was, if I knew how to do layaway, if I new how to do gobacks and that I should remember since it was on the “online orientation” it was literally my first day ever actually working after WEEKS of nothing. I have a lot of experience as a cashier in food service and little knowledge in retail but when retail stores do this kind of training it’s not only disheartening but it’s embarrassing because then I’m looked at like I don’t know what I’m doing. Then, I got attitude for how I was scanning and bagging but they didn’t decide to help me out when I had a guest come to my register with loads of clothes they just kept saying “don’t do this, no don’t do that, no you shouldn’t do this at all”.  So I left and will most likely not return. I don’t appreciate when training"
bad,As a professional with extensive Supervisor experience making over $17 per hour.  I was only offered $13 an hour with the company as a Customer Service Supervisor.  Mangers were unwilling to pay for this experience and said good luck.  I feel that an employee in this role should be compensated accordingly based on experience. $13 per hour is not a livable wage in the area I live in.
bad,pay is minimum wage and the hours are low less than 20....they use you...being the cashier is the worst cuz floor ppl be talking on their phones...management is really unprofessional and don't appreciate ur work at all....the only good thing is they pay weekly and the discounts...I would only recommend if you need a part time and uber money!
bad,In my honest opinion I would not recommend to work here. The level of respect show here towards its employees is very little. I feel uncomfortable with the environment and work space.
bad,"It was a very slow paced and relaxed working environment. Definitely, not enough hours and the pay is kind of gross (very low), but it is a lot better working environment than some. The work with you on leaving early if you need, changing days, etc."
bad,Burlington isn't a bad place to work but ever since they changed managers it has just gotten terrible. We were promised changes and have yet to get that.
bad,It was fun while it lasted but then things starting getting a little sneaky around the job and everything started going down hill. If you wanna work in a company that’s going to slave you and then turn around and not give you any hours at all.
bad,"There is no comucation at all. there goal is money, no orgaination,,there integrity   is not well at all. you don't get feedback. there's no leadership at all"
bad,It’s a good place to work and maintain abilities on the cashier or learn organization abilities. Work is not stressful depending on location and there is a lot of clothes.
bad,The co workers I had were nice people management lacked in empathy and caring for the workers regardless of how hard you worked. There was good times though I learned things there so it wasn't terrible
bad,As management you are required to work too many hours. They never have enough help to run the stores. Their store policies lead to many unhappy customers.
bad,"I am a dedicated leader with 10 years of comprehensive management and logistic experience. I am keen to apply my ability to train, manage and motivate"
bad,hated this job. management was awful. hours were not enough. pay was too low. no job security. never got breaks on time. lots of dissatisfied customers.
bad,id clockin and grab a radio and go to my area of the store and pick up items off the floor that didnt belong then i would work in the receving area and i woluld help unlolad trucks and re stack boxes onto palets and bring them out onto the floor to be put away
bad,"job was okay if you just need a job, the management was not great at all, and there was no room for moving up in the company. environment was okay but customers and managers made it worse"
bad,"I did like what I was doing but the rate pay was too low "
bad,They don't offer hours over 16-20 a week. Management are a bit overwhelming always yelling are you done yet. Would be ideal job if more hours were given.
bad,"The job is easy, yet they make it challenging. Why? I have no idea, however some of the employees are very hard to work with and they really don't know the meaning of working as a team which makes your job a lot harder to do."
bad,"Standing and addressing customer issues. Ringing out orders, sometimes taking bags to cars of patrons. Linens would be other customer contact and layaway is required"
bad,"The day I got hired, everything was fine up until early September, new management was hired and they were very rude especially to females, if you want to work here I recommend you to not let management walk over you, because that is what they will do."
bad,"I love the job but the hours and the pay is horrible, some of the communication with the mangers is horrible , they'll make sure their hours is straight before your is , that's at any store , the store would helpful if you was actually happy about the pay rate and the hours.."
bad,"learned a lot "
bad,At first i thought that i was going to be working as a cashier but on the third day i was to work in the back putting clothes on hangers for countless hours in tedious work. If it involved chemistry i would have been fine.
bad,I did not learn anything here that I had not already known. Management was rude and talked down to all of the employees besides a select few. It was impossible to do anything right here.
bad,"low hours,horrible management ,nasty work atmosphere,very stressful for a minimum wage job. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. rus me or o in there and ask the employees yourself."
bad,"It could have been based on the location but as a department lead, my job was secure. Sales Reps didn't have job security which caused myself to take on the role of a department lead over 2 departments, having to help other departments close, cashier, customer service, and shipping and receiving. It became overwhelming and not worth it."
bad,"Working at Burlington is nice, however, the management does not work with your availability. You may be called in whenever someone calls off, as long as you come in, management won't have any problems.  The customers are friendly as long as you smile and greet them properly. As long as you stay productive and help clean the stores, you will get no complaints with management. There is not many chances to advance to full-time and the most hours you get when it's not busy can be 15 to 20 hours."
bad,"clothes always on the floor, carpet is filthy, very unclean environment to work in. decent prices but quality of merchandise is poor.  management very unfair when original store manager left."
bad,Very stressful company in the management sector. Alot is required of all people and it can be draining but they work around your schedule if you are in school.
bad,management wanted you to be available when they wanted you to but overall the it was a pleasant place to work.  wasn't given enough hours to work and they sent people home early
bad,"A typical day at work is enjoying the environment of my co workers and  Management team, I enjoy helping Customers that way at the end of the day I now I have meet my goal which is to delight he members 100 percent, that is the best part of the Job knowing that I did my job 100 percent. the hardest part of the job is not being able to satisfy A customer due to limits that are out of my control."
bad,"I had interned at Burlington several years prior. When you are a college student and you need to gain experience, a place like this really comes in handy and is extremely helpful for one, maybe even two summers of experience. But my memories are not fond and I did not seek full time employment."
bad,Easy workplace but slow. Co-worker were nice but we hardly get to talk to then at work. I felt it was a kind of job where you just do your job and go home.
bad,this was my first job. i expected more of a professional level & mannerism. it may have just been the location i was at. but this is where i developed most of my work ethic
bad,Work days were stressful and rarely got lunch breaks due to one of the head managers. Most of the customers were friendly and easy to deal with. Some customers were extremely difficult to the point of needing a manager's assistance.
bad,"led a team to make price changes and doing inventor,tagged merchandise that had lost tags and arranged clothing racks and  placed new merchandise seasonally."
bad,i would suggest this company for high school/college students maybe some retirees its very part time other than that its in a convenient location to shop or whatever
bad,I loved my co-workers. We always had fun and got the job done. My supervisor was always there to answer our questions and help out. It was an ok place to work. There were a few bad eggs but nothing serious.
bad,Burlington is a nice place to work. Work hours are flexible. Managers are accessible to the associates. Enjoy assisting customers with finding what they need.
bad,Burlington has awesome customers and has merchandise at unbeatable prices. The appreciation doesn't go too far unfortunately. Understaffing creates for tension on the business' customer service as well as the staff itself. Would undeniably like to see it turn around so maybe some day the chain reaction will happen!
bad,I was trained to work in three different departments which made working there tolerable because standing in one spot and performing the same routine over and over can become monotonous and lead to a decrease in work production.
bad,"This company pays very little, but management expects miracles. There are constant changes in leadership and job duties, but the work isn't hard."
bad,"I worked at the customer service desk and as a cashier. Assisted customers with finding products they needed. Management did not create an environment for open communication where employees could express real concerns. Many of my co-workers were hard workers, friendly, and made the work environment less stressful. I enjoyed interactions with the customers the most. Hardest part of the job was working with people that did not hold their weight."
bad,"A typical day includes: "
bad,"I worked here before it was purchased by an investment group.  Their processes and priorities were off.  This was a company that had a lot of great ideas, but didn't know how to pull it all together."
bad,"It was my first real job, it was always crazy busy. It was a love and hate relationship with work, but i enjoyed that it worked around my college schedule."
bad,"sell from catalog"
bad,As a cashier we are watched constantly. The only break we get is for lunch and there is someone over our shoulder watching us. God forbid we miss one of the things we are to say to a customer at checkout because our scripts are so long and customers don't want to hear it.
bad,Store management intern. Shadowed store managers and worked in all aspect of store operations
bad,"The job is alright and I like my co workers. But, the management is terrible and they are sometimes disorganized."
bad,"A typical day at work would be me being all over the store doing multiple tasks. I learned how to communicate with a lot of different pictures and how to problem solve on my own. Managment, some of the mangers were very helpful.My co workers were wonderful we always helped eachother in the place another lacked in. The hardest part of my job was constantly having to go back over the same work i already have done.The most enjoyable part of my day was helping the customers."
bad,"everyday at work my job was busy because I was a supervisor who had my hands full doing four people's job without help or support from upper management, my co-workers and customers are the main reason why I pushed myself to go to work until I started having health issues from being under stress being the only person making sure the job gets done, I prefer not to work in any retail stores at all you can't have a life."
bad,The managers don't communicate so they are always yelling at the employees to go somewhere do something or go to lunch. Terrible hours for school goers. Not a friendly place for newcomers either.
bad,"A typical day at Burlington is get there at 6:00aracks m I work on unfinish racks.  Then unload the truck after that either sort box or work on the table ticketing, hanging and sizing clothes. I enjoy working but it just pay little of nothing that's why I'm looking for a better paying job"
bad,No room for growth in the company but it is a good place to get your foot in the door for customer service experience. Some of the coworkers are not as friendly as others but the main thing to do is get your work done in a timly fashion.
bad,"the leader ship is terrible... as a new employee i just got thrown in to learn on my own the ins and outs of a burlington employee if it wasnt for my own common sence of great customer service i would have prbly just gave up and been a terrible employee and sales associate. but my attitude is positive and i strive for betterment in my work ethic. its just a shame that management does not care to recognize the good emplees within the store. "
bad,Assisting customers with checking out. Provide customers with excellent customer service.
bad,"low pay, not enough work hours, the hardest part about this job was doing the inventory because disorganization."
bad,Too much work with no time. takes to long to get promoted but the job isn't hard.
bad,Assist customers with items that are being searched and balancing the correct amount of money into and out cash register.
bad,"A typical day at work is putting away a never-ending amount of merchandise, while helping customers and resetting the floor. Co-workers that are not interested in getting things done fast and efficiently, who would rather engage in bullying and gossiping. Management does not care and are no help. Good Luck."
bad,really enjoyed working in a place where I can communicate with people and help them out. If you work hard enough its easy to move up in the company.
bad,"under staffed, un-organized and very sketchy on policies, different standards per store "
bad,"I enjoyed my job helping people and as well as my co-workers, but the managers were very unprofessional. Nobody knew were we were suppose to be or doing, managers never stuck to a plan, one manager will tell you one thing and that would get you in trouble with another manager."
bad,"It had nice people, it was my first time learning how to use a register which was a good experience, management was kind of crazy near the holidays, the most enjoyable part was break, the most hardest was learning how to use the register and not being trained long enough and correctly, and employees lacked on keeping the store neat."
bad,"I worked there in the summer of 2011, but they stopped giving me hour because I was starting school."
bad,A typical day I deal with customer all day in shortly manner. I learned when dealing with customer is that they are aslways right. The management is not that great but I take it in and put on a smile. My co-workers is okay to work with at times. Honestly their nothing hard about my job being a cashier but the most enjoyable thing about my job is whenI can engage with customer and make their day.
bad,this place had the worst management very disorganized co-workers clothes would be throne on the floor
bad,"Burlington Coat Factory was a great way to exercise my customer service skills. I'd come into work, greet my coworkers and get to work. Each day, I'd work the cash register and rotate between that and working the floors. This consisted of cleaning, maintaining and aiding within my station at all times. I learned to work in a timely and positive manner, while multitasking to help customers in need. This was probably one of the more difficult parts of the job, but it's helped me growth in areas that I may have been week. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the interaction and support of my management and coworkers."
bad,this company was not very organized and the manager is hard to get along with.
bad,Working in receiving its very fast pace ! They ask you to do more than they are paying you . Its inconsistent because they may say you work 3 out of 7 days but really they only need you for one. There is also no communication between staff i say this because i say about 45 minutes away from my job and they had me drive there twice and sent me back home because there were “no hours” ..
bad,"Nice Managers.., but a lot work, pay between $9.00 & $10 per hr, with experience very low pay,.,"
bad,"I didn't feel respected by my management team, really the issue seemed mostly to be corporate but it's hard to be sure. "
bad,"A typical day at work is like coming to work with an instant headache. There are clothes all over the store as if the workers from the morning time did not finish their work."
bad,"I learned a lot about currency working here.  A typical day here was mostly laid back.  I had to open accounts, that was always hard, but possible.  The management were good, they left you alone if you did your job right.  No complaints."
bad,"It is an okay place to work. If you need like a Part-Time job so you will not feel bored at home, but it is not a great place to work if you need to make ends meet. The management there is not bad but also not great. I have meet a lot of great people working there"
bad,FedEx is a busy and hard labor place to work. its a fast past environment that you have to pay attention to so you don't get hurt. The management and co-workers are great.
bad,"Assited Customers with purchases. I also did layaways, returns and exchanges."
bad,"they had me doing all of the other employee jobs plus mine for a low pay. I was the cashier but on some days I was stocking, security, sales floor and maintenance. that place is horrible!"
bad,Good place to work for some extra change but not for a career. Met some cool people working here.
bad,"Management is good in my opinion but communication could be better. My department has no set time to get off, I was at work one day until almost 5:30pm and I clocked in at 7am. Teamwork is almost nonexistent, most of the other workers are busy doing other things so they can’t keep up their departments. If you’re a “good” worker you’ll get hours but you’re only being used. Good luck"
bad,"Working at this company was a success it was also fast pace required,great team work ,working Together  as a team makes everything work out right fine ."
bad,I open or close the store. I've learned to have even more patience. This is the worst job I've ever had. Customer have no respect for our store. Hardest part of job is recovery and most enjoyable is schedule
bad,"I learned how to unpacked the products, scanned them and put them in clearance. The people was really nice and kind. I work hand to hand with the supervisor and learned how to process everything in deliviring the products."
bad,"A typical day at work we would receive a shipment every morning. We'll pull & organize boxes, label clothes, purses, shoes and anything that needed to be tag. Push them to their correct department. Take regular breaks & lunch. Agreed & accept longer hours. I've learned to accept negative comments due to the fact that there wasn't enough training in every department in the store. Management never got the chance to listen to what I had to say about being trained. It was a very busy paste every day so I like that I always had something to do. The hardest part was trying to fit in with employees, but again I loved the fact I had retain experience to I did very good working along or with a team member."
bad,"Great management and coworkers. Working there was fun."
bad,"this was a very fun place to work, and working with these coworkers was great because we would always get the job finish.but the pay raise isn""t good"
bad,"Burlington is a good job for those who are attending college. The managers will work around every school schedule. The managers are very nice, however the pay could be a little better."
bad,A great place to work. They work around your hours. Great discount. Everyone working there are great people. Always room for advancement. Hardest part about job is dealing with upset customers.
bad,"The company has the interest of people at hand,that is why they provide job opportunity for those who are willing and ready to work.the company are trying to help those who want to work"
bad,it was a nice place to work should've stayed but i got a better paying job the hours wasent that good but good workers and staff
bad,"overall cant say that burlington is the best company to work for because if it was the case i wouldnt leave to seek better ,its ok for people with little experience , not for experience  hardcore LP"
bad,"is was always busy, the store was always packed, and always something to do all the time you never got tired of working. people always asking for help."
bad,"Working wit the public loved it how to greet your customer and make them feel comfortable, He was wonderful to work with, my coworker got along very well, Is when a customer walk out angry is making a comstomer smile."
good,"my job is easy but when it comes to the store manager he makes it hard. "
good,"Let me begin by saying that the schedule does not apply to flow team members. The shifts were typically 4- 4.5 hours long, 3 days out of the week. Without warning you could be told, not asked, to stay and work an 8 hour shift instead of your scheduled 4 hour shift. Extra hours are normally a good thing, but not when they’re being forced on you at the last minute. I’m not even sure if I should call them “extra hours”. They basically just move your hours around. You may work anywhere from 4 - 18 hours a week."
good,its a nice place to work at they just need some work there. they need to treat people better they need to be more oraginazed. they need a more understanding of things
good,Working in Burlington was very productive. Their was always somthing to do. You were always moving around engaging with customers. Also trying to keep the environment clean.
good,At first I liked it but they went through 4 store managers within months.Very unorganized back stocked about 4 months. They had no compassion when I lost my baby and let me go the day after my surgery even with a doctor's statement.
good,"Rush to assembly line and catch production on belt to apply tags to products."
good,"The manager was very flexible when it came to scheduling but very stressful when it came to working. There was a lot to do and the managers doesn't like when you stand around. You can never get things done since there were multiple tasks to be done by the end of the day. Every year, there is a pay raise which is good but it always end not making a difference because of the minimum wage going up."
good,"Everything at this location was broken. There were leaks in the ceiling all over the store, the bathroom was a mess, and the computers were always going offline and rebooting making a 5min transaction almost 40 mins.  The management was a joke. The merchandise always had some sort of defect."
good,"Burlington could treat employees better, give better pay rate to their employees. Better incentives to their employees. The mangers at certain Burlingtons can give more support to their supervisors and the other retail associates in the store."
good,in my time working there I was given hard times from the other workers and felt threatned by my coworkers did not know if I was going to get into a fight or not on any given day
good,after working five years it was kinda ok but not that many hours the management wasnt that good the manager was worst no races 4 years
good,store flow and products messy. underpaid over worked. retail store without any structure. high turn over rate. short lunches
good,I enjoy worker at clothing but the manager was so rude the co-workers
good,"A typical day at Burlington was entering the facility receiving your assignment and going to your department. I learned myself worth at Burlington because working there certain managers are very disrespectful and overbearing, and I realized that no job is worth you to lose yourself respect and dignity. The hardest part was going in to the job and not being able to express the disrespect that you feel that you are receiving because you are afraid of losing your job. The most enjoyable part to me about being an employee at Burlington is being able to help customers and knowing that I put a smile on someone’s face is priceless."
good,I gained some valuable information in my position. I really enjoyed working for the company. The hardest part of my job was the schedule it went from great hours to very few per week.
good,They do not give you enough hours so if it's a person that's looking for a lot of hours applying for this job do not waste your time you don't get a lot of hours you get paid every week I have had some bad experience working there looking for a new job as of now like I said they do not offer enough hours in one day if you want to be a cashier then you should apply there they get the most hours
good,Organizing items to their proper department. I was able to learn about the Point of Sale system and how to handle cash.  Knowledge on how the accounting department works. over all it was not the best work environment but it is perfect for someone who is just starting in the work field
good,"Job requires extreme patience, having to put up the clothing and stock everything and also receve the next truck, the back is very hot, pay was no good, made 80$ every week."
good,You’re not guaranteed your hours unless you’re on the flow team. Managers laughed at my face when I asked for more hours. They will cut your hours if payroll is too much.
good,I was so confused at first no direction from management no hours consistently scheduled.  I liked the associates it was just no consistent hours scheduled each week based on my availability.
good,i like my job just that it was a temporary job and everyone got treated differently depending on how everyone feels and how well you do in that day everyone got treated differently..
good,They don't pay enough for the work that you do. You don't get enough hours and no benefits. Plus on top of that the discount for employee's suck. They say there is a chance to work your way up within the company but that is a lie. They hire from outside the company and not within like they say.
good,"They do have great people there, but the work place feels really depressing. The works just look like they really do not want too be there. they need to figure a way to make a positive place"
good,"The staff was alright, my supervisor was a nice person. They paid you alright, but not enough hours to actually make anything on a weekly paycheck. Health safety was a concern of mine, that should be brought up to OSHA's attention, to be frank. Overall, it wasn't the worst job I've had"
good,Handleing money and putting items away and also helping customer get items if they needed them it was a good company to work with and i did enjoy the co workers there
good,"The management is a joke, the work is not guaranteed. You can never be sure if you will have work the next day, the supervisors are completely oblivious to everything. This place shows a large amount of favoritism. The rules change continuously as well as the way you administer daily tasks."
good,"I worked there for a little over a year. Personally I feel management of store 477 is mediocre, they are mostly new to the company as well as the store so I do not have much experience with them. I was a floor associate who had the privilege of being trained in almost every department the store had, as well as cashier and customer service associate. There are lots of mixed feelings between floor associates and cashiers due to the managers not treating them equally. Cashiers are generally treated a little better and more likely to be promoted than floor associates, much more likely. There aren't any particularly difficult parts to the job, dealing with customers can be unpleasant at times but not too far out of the ordinary. The workers usually hired have usually get along generally well though and there aren't too many problems with that."
good,Clock in and ring customers. I learned that you have to treat people you would like to be treated. Management is the worse
good,"greet costumers,organize clothes, cashiers, customer service"
good,"A nice place to work if you need a part time job.  "
good,I made some good friends working here but the workers are just plain lazy. And management has no control over any of them. The only rule we had was to make sure nothing was on the floor.
good,"sorry place to work for, really no word could describe it, okay maybe hell."
good,there was a lot of drama in the work place. They couldn't keep managers. I learned how to color coordinate and put merchandise away by name brands. Also learned how to set up departments by floor plans. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and helping those who need help.
good,"I enjoyed working here up until the hours started dropping and we got a new backroom supervisor. She screamed and cussed and made you feel stupid when you asked a question"
good,Management doesn’t appreciate the work you do. You get your hours cut all the time. You’re never moving fast enough or doing anything right. Even if that’s how they trained you. Same work every single day. Not paid enough for the work you do.
good,"I would explain my situation to them how the hours were inconsistent and I needed more, all they would day is ""you have to go through b time"" which was unfair cause it was confusing to me so ik it's confusing for elders too. This job is for people that DONT pay bills or are on assistance."
good,"Another place where not a lot of hours are offered, you get paid weekly and your pay is so little which leaves you with nothing. no opportunties to move. a lot of favortism. people stealing and security can not do anything."
good,Don't go there if you want hours to work. Always cutting. Manager does not believe in in store advancement. Always hires new managers from outside Burlington.
good,The hours were ok but pay was really low. Customers were disgusting if you worked the fitting rooms you will find almost anything nasty in them and HAVE TO clean it. Coworkers were alright no complaints there.
good,company was terrible to work for and would never recommend any one to work there.  the management and the store in general was very disorganized.  the manager there now needs to listen more.
good,"Working here was a headache. I was part time, with a maximum of 20 hours a week but was working over 30 every single week, even when I asked for time off during Finals. I was constantly the only cashier there, or if they overstaffed, I was shoved to do leftover work where hours dragged on. Breaks were inconsistent, employees would take their breaks late and this would set you back. The management was poor, there was one manager I liked but she went on maternity leave. Coworkers were mainly nice enough, barely any stayed long enough to make an impact. At the time I left, almost all part-time and some full-time employees had left or were leaving soon."
good,"I've already said it, several times and then several more times and apparently I have to sy it several more times, oh, and several more times,...…  We need to pay our rent!"
good,It is a very busy store with almost non-stop customers.  When I was not busy with the cash register there were always other things we could do like straightening shelves or stocking shelves.  The most enjoyable part of the job was talking with the customers and I loved the fact that I was never bored.
good,They don't offer very flexible hours and try to persuade you to work weekends and closing shifts. They're one of few places that still has a point system which constantly puts you on edge.
good,"It is simple. I hang clothes, work registers, customer calls to different departments. Aiding customers in search for clothes, advice, and customer complains."
good,I learned to process merchandise and put the new items out on the floor. I seen how everything works and I learned a lot of things but Burlington's is just not right for me. I'm in school and they don't care about your personal life or the life you have outside of work.
good,It is an okay job if you only need part-time however the store i worked for was full of favoritism not a good match for me low hours and not enough room in store for what we did
good,"Not the best place to learn core values, respect or to understand the business to much friends only helping friends thing."
good,I would work there again. it was fast working environment the co workers were easy to get along with . I love working with clothes . and the customers were grate.
good,"Had horrible experience of working at the BCF cause the manager couldn't manage the employees, hours, so many employees just come and clock in and go out do their grocery shopping and etc."
good,"responsibilities were to ticket merchandise throughout the store, customer service is always keen, to keep good business running"
good,Ok part time job. If you are not in receiving then you don't have set hours and it might not be any work life balance in that case. Management is a little poor. If you like being on your feet all day then this is good.
good,"Manager will talk behind your back. Use the heck out of you. No reconnection  of your hard good work at all. I'm done!....I'm definitely gone!.....I'm not gonna lie this is the worst place to work. Watch your back, feet, knee and head. Cause they don't give a fluck."
good,"Working there is very repetitive. You work 4 hours a day for minimal pay. It is not worth it. No incentives, no advancement and barely any recognition."
good,Management liked to micro-manage the LP department even though we had our own separate department from sales. Dealing with a lot of theft while just one person is working gets pretty tough.
good,the hours at burlington coat factory were horrible not to mention it only minimum wage there were opportunities o grow within the company but you would have to had been friends with the upper managers to even get a chance to move up.
good,"Good place to buy, good quality ,  everything is in order , friendly people ,not a good schedule but accesible days off, the managers were friendly not the whole time but  the enough"
good,"Management was not good at all, and worked very little hours.  Hired to many people with the purpose to only give part time jobs, and management didn't treat their associates very fairly."
good,"low pay , too many employee turn overs, work shifts are very unstable, moral is down due to lack of store commitment to their employees , over all nice people"
good,"Horrible management ( lots of favortism) "
good,"Convenient, work on the register, keep the floor clean, leave around 10:30-11 weekdays and weekends. Helps you grow in customer service with the customers you meet."
good,Ensuring that all customers find exactly what they are looking for and check out in a timely manner with excellent customer service. Reaching plan of the day and having a successful day.
good,It's a regular retail company in the bronx. The pay isn't very good an the hours aren't a lot.
good,Store manager has no regards to others personal lives. He thinks he is better than others. You have to stand up for yourself not to be walked over. nothing is extremely hard about the job. Its the work expected vs. The pay. Most of the co-workers are exceptional.
good,"Some people worked at Burlington full time, I commend them because it was definitely not easy. It was only tolerable for a season at best and the hours were unbearable, not family friendly and the staff was not at all friendly to work with; with the exception of some."
good,Their management was really bad except one manager which was the store manager. He was very nice and professional. I been in Burlington coat factory for 5 years but the company was more like who ever comes later get the most hours. They don't appreciate their employees regardless how long you been with them. I feel really bad for the people work there because they have to deal with unprofessional managers.
good,"There are no typical days in BCF. If i were opening the store that morining my resposibilities were but not limited to grabbing all till's putting them into registers, counting my customer service till, making sure the amount is correct. Making schedule for my cashiers for that day for two floors. Making days schedule consist of scheduling lunches and breaks. Maintaing short lines on two floors all while assiting customers with concerns and problem they might have. Calling other locations to find merchandise, getting cashiers change, giving key scan, fixing down registers all while running to basement to grab layaways. If i were closing that night im responsible for taking cashiers off at a timly fashion, counting till's assigning cashiers to clean up designated areas as well as helping any dept that needs help. Management at bcf is constantly changing as are the policies. My coworkers consisted of long time employees and brand new ones. Hardest part of the job was the changing policies and customers not taking a no for an answer. The most enjoyable part were the customers who appreciate your efforts."
good,Loading and unloading merchandise from semi trucks. I learned how to do inventory and merchandise products for consumers. Management at Burlington coat factory is no all that good it's to many ups and downs and confusion within management. Overall besides the managment problem it was very fun working with all of my fellow co-workers.
good,"I like what my job entailed. Which was to tag clothes, to do cashiering, amd heavy carrying off diffrent things. I like some of the managment but like a lot of places there is that one you wont agree with. This manager always had attitude and threaten to fire people including me because ""I was not good enough in her eyes and that she was better"". I got that a lot. To be honest I'm surprised she still has her job as manager. But another thing was that i pretty much work for a year and no raise. But the other employees where ok. They pretty much did there own thing."
good,"Burlington Coat Factory has wonderful things to offer their customers; employees not so much. Operations would run smoother for employee and customer if basic needs such as supplies and timely posted ( and covered) schedules were up to par.  This company is a good learning place for troubleshooting and customer service experience, but not a company I put long term career faith in. The technology is also EXTREMELY behind ( i.e. registers and return process, both bad for customer service). If you want to learn how to do the right thing but take seven steps in the wrong direction to get there, then this is the right company for you."
good,I wont say much on this particular job. It was just a typical retail store with regular business hours that all other retail stores have. Management wasn't very understanding to my type of schedule but then again its not the kind of job that would be adjusting to ones time anyways. This is more for when your a young lady with no responsibilities.
good,"Working with the public is fun and getting to know them and your co-workers is the best part of the job. I learned that getting respect is you have to respcect yourself and others as well. The hardest part of the job is getting all the merchandise out to the floor, when you have truck loads coming in everyday. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help the custome to find what he or she is looking for."
good,Typical day at work consisted of being a cashier and proving great customer service to the shoppers.
good,"A typical day was moderatly busy, sometimes unorganized, but a good place to start out in the job industry. Co- workers for the most part were very nice and friendly people."
good,this place is not for me the customers are aloud to destroy the place and you can do nothing about it and uper management will not give you what you need to keep the store clean
good,"Okay so these guys do things so oddly as an LPA they constantly had to move fixtures which would ruin CCTV angles. A couple of managers I worked with refused to follow up on certain violations and one threatened me for doing my job. They expect most work to be done up front (such as investigating potential fraud) and all of this can viewed by members of the public if one isn't paying attention to their surroundings. "
good,A typical day would be clocking in and starting to pick clothing up from the floor and reracking them. I learned how to work better in a team and to keep retail organized and coordinated.
good,No one was able to get promoted or a raise unless you knew the manager previously at another job. People who got  recognized are those who worked at a previous company with him or those who didn't put forth an effort got recognized over those who work the hardest
good,"This job is very easy as a cashier. It involves cash handling, tagging merchandise, organizing items into the correct department areas and providing excellent customer service."
good,"this is a ok job for an high school student unless you trying to be a manager or something ."
good,"Working there itself is fun. This particular location would rather keep hiring new, barely wanting to be there people rather than invest in an actual good employee. They fired the hard working single mom that was 5 minutes late a few times (excused, too!) and kept the chick that drank at work and was slurring and reeked of alcohol while out on the sales floor. Go Burlington!"
good,"The job was simple, recover, restock and pretty much pick up after customers whom tend to never put merchandise back in place. Holiday season can be very stressful, you may work some days till 11pm or midnight. Start pay was $8.25/hr, while across the street Ross start pay was $9. Some days there never seemed to be enough time to fully recover your area on your shift. Unless you were full-time, everyone else would usually get afternoon hours. The most hectic shopping hours, with the most work to be done."
good,My old area supervisor use to make .e train the  new Lp associates/agents. In new locations. It was a very stressful situations at times because often. Use to see people walk out with luggage. I got assaulted a d almost let go. Luckily I co ered .y ends. You need to have law awareness and establish law Enforcement communication. It was great in those respects. But the pay was low a d very stressful with new leadership. New leadership gave no support  and often talk behind your back. I caught my manager calling me a lier and the lp manager almost got fired.
good,This is a horrible place to work. Management does not care about their employees. Any concerns that are brought to their attention is quickly dismissed.
good,Its a mess. We do too much for so little. The management sucks horribly. I like whhat i do but not the pay or hours for it. Im looming for something better
good,"One of the most mismanaged places i've ever worked , the manager was rude to every worker she came across and was very ungrateful to her team. Expected workers to perform at an optimum level but refused to acquire better training for the staff."
good,"Its so sad to see how a company cares less about its employees and how management is the worst in NJ . If you have other options for jobs, take another job because this place doesnt even pay you enough for everything they make you do and they even get upset at you and tell you to work faster once you are already doing different tasks they personally asked you to do. So sad."
good,He needs more training on scheduling.  Unfair scheduling and not enough hours. I enjoy my job it's just not enough hours offered. I would be willing to stay with more hours and less late shifts.
good,I worked as a loss prevention associate for almost a year not happy with the way I’m treated or paid expected to do a lot in little time left on your own a lot with no one to help most of the time
good,"Your days range from too much stuff to do to nothing to do. You have to make tags and ring on the register as well as still maintain your area. Its a pretty nice work environment most of the time; honestly speaking it can be a bit much at times Even though your job descriptions says one thing they often have you doing 4 different jobs in a day. Its chill. But the thing is certain managers will cut your hours days before your shift change your schedule and not tell you about it, They over work the few people who do work well and dont pay enough. Your chances in moving up in the job are slim, even when your a dependable associate. Also they give bad raises its only a few cents. The customers are extremely rude it doesnt take much to make them upset."
good,My ex manager sucked and was the type to use to rule book to his advantage. Burlington could be a good if they pay more attention to the customer feedback and associates feedback try to collaborate the two for solutions
good,"•	Handled all issues from customers until a manager was absolutely needed "
good,"its a okay part time job, it would better if they didnt give our hours away. they could offer better overtime. i like the fact that they do work with you if you go to school or even need a day or two off."
good,"As a whole Burlington is an OK place to work. The pay is OK. Management is OK. Staff is often over worked, and under payed. I love my job here, but the pay isn't enough for the work that I do."
good,"clock in, check your areas for anything that needs to be done. clean and maintain department organize. i learned to read skews and communicate with walkie talkies"
good,You aren’t properly trained for your job. Management will work you to death while they sit in their office. A lot of favoritism among management and associates. If you aren’t liked they are a lot harder on you. Little to no PTO yet managers seem to have PTO.
good,If you have a tight schedule or you're a not a night person I do not recommend this job. Its only good for desperate times. I notice that people start to drop out like flies every couple of mo ths and I've been here for only one year. Getting earlier hours is next to impossible.
good,"Store was very messy. Always short on staff for the floor work. Employees followed the rules they wanted.. Employees ""longtimers"" rude rude. If brought to management no action was taken. Things are lax do to management  not holding personnel acctable."
good,The customers wasn't the nicest to deal with. They like to trash the place so your constantly picking up. Always on your feet. Management was ok. Associates was ok to work with.
good,"It wasn't very fun. There is a lot to do and a lot of work to take on to make minimum wage, you go home tired and aching and you are on your feet all day long. You get a break though."
good,"my job was just to get there before the store opened to get ready and go through to mark down items that were going on clearance, and some times helping reset the sales floor. The management was absolutely terrible though.. I thought I could stick it out, but I got tired of being talked down to daily so I left. The job overall was very easy, and little to no experience required."
good,we are uncertain on what time we get off every day. they are very understaffed in the receiving area. the management team don't communicate with each other
good,Not too much if a bad place to work but if your a parent then this is not the place to work.  It doesn't give much to feed a family on nor do they pay that good
good,"With this job, there were numerous times where staff was disrespectful, as well as customers. This job drained me so much. I do not recommend this job to anyone."
good,I just think Burlington as a company has a lot to work on. Managers need more training and if things were better a lot of people would still be there. I don't think it is a bad environment but it just has a lot of work.
good,I enjoyed working there. The management took time to make sure you settled in and was trained correctly. If you wanted to learn new areas or new skills they tried to accommodate your needs and wants.
good,Burlington is a overall great company management is lacking sense of payroll and appreciation of the employees. Would be given a certain amount of payroll hours for department but were never used in the area
good,"Crazy hours as a full-time. Management is ok depending on which one you work with. One of them is h*ll to work with.. Full-time floor associates are in charge of a department and ""trained"" (not really) on register, price checks, layaway pick up and if closing in charge of recovering 1-2 other departments plus your own. Full timers have a task to do everyday (unrealistic) tasks plus attempting to also have to do the others things mentioned earlier. If your not lucky and have to work with that manager, chances are you won't even get your job done due to him/her making you do other peoples (stock room) job. For example putting out clothes or finishing up with markdowns that were not completed the day before. Anyway many employees quit or are thinking of quitting. Cashiers come and go constantly. Many of them are thrown into the register without enough training. Its rare to ever get a full weekend off. Its an ok job. I personally hate it! Oh also your on your own, the term team-work is nonexistent to other employees."
good,"I would get to work in the morning, and there would be 5 pallets of freight in my dept.  I would unpack the freight & place it in its home.  Sometimes my mgr. was there and sometimes she wasn't.  If I worked the afternoon shift I would still help with the unloading of the freight, because 5 pallets is a lot of pallets!  I learned to be creative because I was in the gift dept.  So I had to find places for frames and vases and figurines.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with all the broken things (i.e. statutes, vases).  When we unpacked them and found that they were broken, we'd have to get them to the Claims Dept."
good,"If you're planning to get a job after school just for some spending money, this is the job for you. I would not recommend anyone over the age of 19 working here. You can do better.."
good,Once we had a new store manager everything was up in the air. Everyday there was a new rule or a new infraction and no one told us until it was to late. I got wrote up for a rule that had changed and wasn't told about it.
good,"While working here, I gained a lot of retail experience. Management was really bad it the place was very unorganized. I also didn't get paid enough money."
good,"My typical day at Burlington is a busy one. I first check in with my manger. Normal I work on the floor which means I clear the fitting rooms, pick up clothes from the floor or put things out. Sometimes I work as a cashier."
good,The management is constantly changing and it seems almost impossible to work your way up. The employees harassed me about my age and held little regard in being a team.
good,"Treated badly, given to much work to finished in a day, and got paid worse."
good,"Allows drugs, doesn't make sure heat/ac are apporitate for employees in the year that i worked here it was wither to cold or hot which made people sick at all times.  the manager that i worked for was rude & disrespectful to the employees"
good,Company does not promote from within and does not have a good work/life balance. Managers work between 50-60 hours every week. Benefits expire and there are many blackout periods when you cannot take days off even though they are your days.
good,"This job was fun and most of the day was spent doing returns and exchanges, Stood day with but that wasn't so bad. Frequent new manager was a big issue."
good,in between mangers   it was a place were it wasnt team players  love working just not at burlington i was looking for more than just a job
good,"Very laid back, in the beginning it was awesome to be there. No goals, no targets, it was just you get in and get out. Depending on who you work with, you can have a real blast. But other than that, the place was so-so. Pay wasn't bad but wasn't good either. A real let-down was management. It has changed quite a bit over the years and couldn't imagine how it is right now. They got rid of the real PEOPLE'S managers and hired incompetent people who actually would scare customers and employees away."
good,"I enjoyed working with my co-workers, and checking customers out."
good,I loved the people I worked with but the management isn't so good
good,"learned how to do refunds, credits, take payments by cash credit and debit cards. Managers were ok there weren't rude or inconsistent. Got along with most of my old co-workers. There really wasn't a hard part ."
good,"A normal day involves unloading trucks,  processing everything on the truck to be floor ready, merchandising  and pushing everything to the correct spot in each department of the floor, hang, tag,and sensor all clothing items according to the department, cleaning up the receiving room, checking things in the computer NJO system."
good,The Job Overall is Great but the team is the Management is Horrible.
good,"If you have ever worked in retail before, you know that there are many, many employees hired, but by the 3rd month of the store opening more than half those employees are gone."
good,This job taught me how to manage people that have different backgrounds
good,"A typical day at work being a sales associate has you running from one end of the department to the other getting things such as a different shoe or a different size in the same garment. Constant movement from facing the shelves to assisting customers. Facing the management team was scary. The store manager was a sweet woman, stern but kind. The assistant store manager was rude and very unfriendly. Didn't like any new employees and made it a point to belittle them, and threaten to fire them for not working harder than her. Co-workers I had were some of the best people I've ever met, making friends with them was one of the best parts of working at Burlington. Hardest part was being away from my daughter for long periods of time. Not getting to tuck her in bed at night was the worst."
good,I felt that this position was too demanding. They needed a more experienced management system. The hours were flexible but not to my needs. I enjoyed processing the merchandise and felt really good when I could help a customer and be appreciated for it.
good,A typical work day would involve massive amounts of work coupled with little help and low pay and low employee moral.
good,When working on the sales floor you do more work than for what you are getting paid. Management was ridiculous and childish. The only thing that kept me going every day were my associates.
good,There was a lack of communication between the store managers and the district mangers. I waited 3 months for a ear piece for the walkie they never fixed the loss prevention's cart.
good,"I cannot say I hated it it nor loved it. I personally did not like working with customer service so much, but I enjoyed organizing and stocking shelves."
good,"Not a bad place to work. Just wish they would give hours to the people they have, instead of hiring more people. Most workers are lazy, there are a few that work hard. Management is lazy, except the assistant. Very little training."
good,Pocas horas. 9 la hora. Tienes que llamar todos los días para saber si te toca trabajar el dia siguiente.  El mismo día que trabajas te dicen a que hora debes irte. Por lo general de media hora a 1 hora antes. Aceptan a muchas personas y luego no saben cómo agendar el trabajo. Si necesitas pagar Bill no recomiendo esta empresa.
good,"Management changes frequently approx every six months or so. There isn't that much room for advancement unless your willing to relocate. The pay is bit better than average retail businesses. However, the environment and success of the store depends on how well your team performs and more importantly how management treats and coaches your team. With a good manager, everything was fun, fulfilling, and productive. Without a good manager, your have a lot of turn over, bad attitudes, and people are not as likely to go above and beyond."
good,"Managers don’t care, they are rude, they make fun of you, and joke about serious matters. They are just extremely unprofessional. It makes it a hard place to work when the managers act like high schoolers"
good,"You can find something better than here, you get worked to the grit and nothing get appreciated; and the store manager always tends to avoid  confrontation. Bad management skills."
good,"a day as a cashier, can be stressful, because managers showed poor judgement when making schedules. Would occasionally leave only one cashier in the front, and managers would complain about slow prosuction."
good,"Okay, place to work for students or retirees if you like retail in a discount store. Hectic, stressful store always a mess. No room for advancement. Part-time hours only."
good,"Your hours depend on the incoming freight and how fast it's processed which means one week you could be working a full 40 hours and the next you may only get 20. The pay is not enough for how hard you're worked. If you're a decent employee, you have to make up the slack for other employees who would rather be on their phones. Terrible turn over and management is ineffectual and conflicted."
good,Manager is horrible no hours people I work with are great assistants managers are great easy job I enjoy my job and working with the public and my coworkers
good,"you clock in do your work go to break back to work and store manager doesn't care you have to do your job with or without assistance,  sale manager only cares about her bonuses"
good,"management miscommunications, under scheduling during peak hours at times, extended holiday hours reaching past midnight, issues and concerns being dismissed or not addressed."
good,i just think for what we do and what time we do it that we should get paid way more then we do we pick up very different things that may hurt us and we put our life on the line for $9.00 and i have to wake at 5 in the morning just to make work at 6 in the morning why cant you all care about us like were not sacrificing things for you guys
good,"Employees does the hard work and with little hrs and little pay while the heads reap the benefits and pay."
good,"Durring grand opening everything was stocked nicely and very pretty, but there are lots of items that not what people are looking for and end up staying in the store long after they become clearance. This causes inventory to explode and the store becomes a mess"
good,"Overall my experience at burlington was good, good hours, and coworkers. Besides a particular manager that made working with very difficult as she loves to power-play around the cashiers and treat newcomers as dumb. I feel the high turnover rate with new employees may be due to the fact she creates a very tense and awkward atmosphere."
good,Easy place to work. Weekly pay with about 20-30 hours a week. Random schedule every week. Some of the managers are much better than others. Getting a day off on the weekends is impossible unless you find someone to cover for you.
good,Head Cashier for the registers. Got cashiers change or bags what they needed to provide good customer service. Scheduled lunch and breaks. Cleaned out outdated layaway. Solved problems between cashiers or customers. Made sure all cashiers went to break and lunch on time. If needed also rang customers with excellent customer services.
good,"If you enjoy being busy, underpaid, not listened to, and constantly taking attitudes from customers about the store being messy, understaffed, other employees being rude to them or ignoring them, this is the place for you!! The cash register system is very easy to learn and get used to, the rest of the employees were wonderful, but not enough to deal with the customers who were rude, the hours were trashed, and i definitely was not paid enough for the amount I did. "
good,Nothing to write home about.  No real opportunity for advancement.  Wages tended to be lower than most other retailers in all store positions.  Low engagement with high turnover.
good,keeps you busy and on your toes but needs work with management.  provides great experience opportunities as well as learning different sales strategies not to open for schedule friendly home issues always short-staffed
good,Typical retail job on 14th street. Wear comfortable shoes for sure. I learned major conflict resolution skills from observing supervisors along with experiencing events of my own dealing with conflict.
good,"Nice employees , management poorly operated. No opportunity for advancement. Hard work, floors stay a mess. bending picking up constantly. Point system for tardy or call ins. No time off, no extras"
good,A typical day at work was helping out customers with their needs & fixing up my merchandise making sure my area of work was tidy and neat. Always looking for someone who needed a helping hand.
good,"Some of the people I worked with were nice, if you don’t plan on buying lots of clothes with your discount it probably isn’t the best job. Not many full time job opportunities."
good,"A typical work day is cleaning up, help restock sections learning new policies for the company. learning hoe to greet customers in a friendly manner. Learning how to correctly produce and ring up orders accurately and quickly. I learned a lot about management and customer personalities that you have to have a strong sense of patience. The work  place is great if you want to remain in the same position and don't want to further yourself. The most enjoyable thing about my job is that I truly love engaging with my retuning and repeat customers and you always make them smile and have an enjoyable shopping experience."
good,"Working at Burlington Coat Factory taught me that the retail business is difficult. The hardest part of the job was being on your feet for long hours and only given 30 minute lunch breaks for every 6 hours you work and an additional 15 for every 4 hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to brighten up customers day by getting in and out of the store as quickly as possible. When it came to  management there was some unprofessional ism that came along with it. I had a manager yell at me over the phone and disrespect me that wasn't the Burlington quota of ""one big happy family"". They wouldn't accommodate me in any way when it came to working around my school schedule. I learned a lot from my supervisors they taught precisely, adequately,  and competently. When it came to my schedule it was never a set schedule.  I was on-call and they only showed  the schedule up to 2 weeks worth never the whole month."
good,Get to work clock in then go to the back and we start unload palettes normally 7pallets after we did that we toke them to the floor and we put all the products away then ones we did that we spend  about a half hour in the back hanging up clothes and senoring them getting ready to run racks
good,"Fast paced which I love but the work load was crazy "
good,not great work hours   stores not bad but  the hours are given out really crazy  one week i got 2 days of work the next none so not the best  but the people are ok
good,"For a company that boasts about how much it loves and cares for its employees, I have to say Burlington has been my least favorite place to work. The work itself is easy and does not require too much thought, but that is just about the only benefit I have yet to see in my 3 years of working for the company. "
good,"Colleagues very, very nice"
good,"Ive worked for Burlington for almost 2 years. The new manager is TERRIBLE! You get minimum wage and about 4 hour shifts 3 or 4 days a week! They hire anyone, and dont fire anyone, even if you've walked out on your shift 3 times, unless youre a dedicated worker, but they dont give any warning or even a write up before just terminating you!"
good,The job itself wasn't that hard but you had to make sure that every items had a tag on the products before going out on the floor. Made friends that will you have for a life time
good,If you really need work they are always hiring. Most of the people are great to work with. They are not very organized or concerderat. They pay is okay depending you situation.
good,It was at a time when most jobs were on the line because of benefit cuts which was ok for me because I was not going to stay long anyway due to family.
good,"Truck schedule is not always fixed, the hours aren't concrete, and there is far more stress than a part time job should have if you work in the back with receiving."
good,"I started working at this job, the summer after my freshman year of college. It's a really easy job to make extra money but not as a career choice. People are constantly quitting and calling off work which makes everyone else work extra hard. Burlington really needs to hire more people."
good,"It is okay for one's first job just like it was for me. My pay was very unfair, but  i had no choice because i needed a job. It was a stressful time in my life and working here didn't make it better."
good,"Burlington store was a very easy, fast pasted job with poor management. This job would be a lot more fun and productive if management was more professional. Things were very unorganized and not very well put together, along with being very low staffed. I would not recommend this job to anyone I know."
good,"Assisted costumers with purchases. Processed payments by cash, personal checks, and credit cards. Balanced cash drawers at the end of each shift. Maintained a neat and orderly department"
good,Stressful and doesn't pay well. Burlington doesn't seem to take care of it's employees. There's either hours or no hours. Nothing is every guaranteed.
good,"I only advise working here if you're short on cash for the month, or if you need extra funds for the week. As a customer representative it's your  job to either issue refunds or deny them. It seems like a simple task, but store policy isn't upheld at this location, if you decide to not take back items that were worn, have stains, or they smell, customers will complain to the store manager who in turn demands from the employee to take the item back. But that is only one example."
good,The managers did not treat you right and they underpaid you by a lot. We would work very hard in there and not get any recognition. We were not payed very much but expected to work as though we were. Very difficult job to be a part of.
good,"This place expects way too much out of their employees for the pay they offer. In 3 years, I went from 9.00 to 9.68 and no insurance was offered at the time I was employed there."
good,Employees are nice. They are always hiring. A few in management are nice and good to work with. Hard to get hours. Hard to move up. They don't train so you have to learn as you go.
good,"The place was alright, customers were for the most part alright. the items sold were clearly the factory rejects and not the best quality. employees were annoying and some would even argue with customers to the point of almost fighting. the main upside was i met some amazing people."
good,"Work days at Burlington Coat Factory were good. It was easy to communicate with staff and managers. Interacting with people was an enjoyable part of the job. The hardest part was to accomplish all goals on time, because they did not have enough staff."
good,"This is a place to get to feel for the work environment. I wouldn't want to work there after having other jobs, they simply don't pay enough. The managers don't follow the rules they do whatever they want and my overall experience wasn't good the laid the wrong people off and wanted them to come back and it was just very unprofessional."
good,"Great for a summer or temporary job. "
good,"This is a great place to work to improve customer service skills. My patience and problem solving skills while working under stressful situations have been enhanced due to dealing with all kinds of customers. I have assumed leadership responsibilities while working directly under the supervisors and managers of the store to improve and maintain productivity and customer satisfaction.  I am the go to guy when their is an issue in productivity and this allows for more flexibility around the store. However, I am a college student and prefer to work in fast pace environments and my title of cashier holds more responsibility than those of my coworkers who are bound to the cash register during their entire shift. I would not recommend this job to anyone who is looking to support themselves due to the low amount of hours given and few full time positions available."
good,"Co-workers only like to gossip and not do work. They also like to boss people around when they aren't managers. Hardest part of the job was dealing with my co-workers. Enjoyable part was getting paid."
good,Burlington was a good place to work. I enjoyed working with the public and serving others. I enjoyed being a cashier as well burlington has so many great deals and lots of customers to serve daily.
good,"My day starts off either unloading the truck for the people that starts at 6 am or just bringing out the merchandise to stock them for the people that came in at 7 am and the co-workers were really cool but the management wasn't really great. The thing I enjoyed most though was talking and laughing with the other co-workers to make the environment fun but gets shut down. the hard part about the job is only trying to go fast pace since the day I started and then get faster from there. what I learned is to tag clothes and shoes, have a clean environment so that nobody would get hurt or step on something dangerous, and to work in a fast pace"
good,"timed on getting things out of receiving then timed out on floor putting things out have so much to get out in too little time example what would normally take an 8-9 hour day is expected to be done in 41/2 to 5 hours  busy seasons we sometimes get 26 to 30 hr week once busy time is done hours drop 12 to 14 if that at times"
good,I enjoyed working at Burlington but I saw no room for advancement. The hours vary and that does not allow you to have a balanced work life and home life.
good,Burlington Coat Factory was my first job.  It was a very easy job.  My duties were to cashier/Customer service representative.  I also helped the other departments.  I learned how to do lay-a-ways and returns. I really enjoyed my discount.
good,store manager was a thief and even with security proof it wasn't good enough for corporate I would never want to work at a company that allows managers to be  a thief and steal from the company
good,"So Unorganized, Low pay and No Hours . Some Managers Work with you. When it Comes To holidays We were a huge family and had pot lucks."
good,Great place if you are looking for part time work where the days go by fast. Easy to find tasks to accomplish. Working the holidays can be a struggle (like most retail jobs). Not the worst place to work.
good,"Management can be challenging to deal with at times. You get to work in all aspects of the retail side of the company, cashier, sales, and receiving. Limited flexibility when it comes to school."
good,"i have learned while working there time management, how to re-organize a floor flow, speedy recovery, great customer service, how to organize new merchandise to catch a customers eye, how to count and count down a register til,sizing merchandise, re-ticketing merchandise,mark-downs"
good,I would help people find what they need.  I would do all the wall projects.  my manger in my department was amazing person to work with or even be around. I did not like working for this company but it was a job but I really liked working with the people.
good,"Merchandise and customer service was a typical day, what I learned is to multitask, the management was fun to work with and co-workers. what I enjoy to most was the merchandising"
good,Its ok again if you like to work with retail. I've worked there since the store has opened on 14th union square. The head bosses are completely disorganized. The hours aren't good.
good,"Learning to interact with new customers everyday. Answering the phones being a back up cashier, doing price checks, and organizing the sales floor and fitting rooms was a lot of foot work, Busy fun working place."
good,"pay is low"
good,To many Chiefs not enough indians.... people really couldn't do a good job due to upper management not being on the same page..
good,its great for those who like department stores but its a bit mess and work..
good,store manager constantly throws subordinates under the bus out of fear for her job. Regional team looks for reasons to make life more difficult for store manager and it flows down hill from there. Used to be a great place to work now its Kohl's.
good,I worked for Burlington Coat Factory for a short period of time. Burlington main focus is to always treat the customer first. Well not all managers believes that. Most not all but most of them manager are childish and don't put any effort in at all but plays on his phone watching sports.
good,just overly horrible experience bosses are rude and unwilling to help employees with anything
good,"Nice co-workers, Managers are good, pay is not good, no benefits for part time workers, not enough hours, prices of clothes are good, great discount"
good,"The customer base is interesting and sometimes hard to deal with. Management and the employees are always kind. While the lack of hours is sometimes unfair, you have fun with the people you work with."
good,It is a very busy work that is nice because I learnt to work efficiently with the public. I love to work in team and I have good work relation with my co-worker. The hardest part of my job is when the customers  want some staff that is sold out in the store.
good,"room to grow, no room for your check to grow. work you like a slave during holiday and cut your hours in half after"
good,The most enjoyable part about the job is interacting with the customers and helping them with purchases. It is a job where u have to think more than physically work so it is not much of a challenge to me. The store is doing poorly in sales so lately everybody has been getting less than usual hours.
good,Standing for long hours dealing with customers that just want the lines to go faster. I really learned customer service and hands on cash counting.
good,"There were too many supervisors to be efficient, they all voiced different things that counter-acted with the other so it was a great sense of chaos and lack of leadership. Some management was also very rude and careless toward employees or poor at communicating. Customer service supervisors were dependable and knowledgeable and demonstrated better leadership skills than management most times. Co-workers still managed to be professional and knowledgeable about their departments, especially with the help and support of other associates, despite lack of communication with management. None the less, good retail experience, especially for a first job, no discount retail will ever be easy and Burlington is no exception."
good,"A usual day at work would consist of keeping shoes clean, helping customers price and size. My co-workers are awesome they work hard and keep the work day exciting. The hardest part of the job would have to be keeping the floor clean. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be seeing happy customers leaving the store."
good,"Very disrespectful manager. Just because you got promoted to assistant store manager doesn't mean you should treat the employees like they're nothing Ms. L "
good,I didn't really like it there because they wasn't paying well enough for the work that had to be done.  I worked in the wearhouse from a temp agency and the agency was very unorganized.
good,I am very customer oriented and I feel like the rest of the company lacks that.
good,"The daily duties of the merchandise team is to prepare each department by organizing and making room for all merchandise to be placed on the floor. We also mutitask in customer service, assisting management and cashiers."
good,management don't care for you at all
good,Not all Burlington Coat Factory's are the same but the one I worked at was definitely not the best. The management changes often which leaves the team members without any real direction. The store in general needs a lot of improvement
good,Burlington is a good place to work around the holidays but after a while the hours die down.
good,A typical day at work consists of unloading freight from incoming trucks. The management team is ok although at times there is a serious lack of communication. I sometimes enjoy my co-workers even though not everyone pulls their weight.
good,all of the co-workers nice to work with. needs improvement in management
good,Still want to work there as a second job since it is part time. But need a full time.  Glad they gave me a chance after not working over 20 years to get back in the workforce.
good,It was an okay job but they would not give me the hours i asked for they would give me less and less days only because one highering manager did not like me
good,"the management is not good and lacks the appreciation for their employes, grants favor and a lot of favoritism which is unfair to those who work hard and do not get compensated well"
good,You are under paid for the work they require one to do and that's why they have very little staff and their not willing to go up on the pay make it your 1st job
good,"Dont work with out jesus honey. omg the lines and that place is something else.i worked pt. They will over work you and then its almost like your useless if you cant work those hours. IF PREGNANT DO NOT WORK THERE. IT WAS TERRIBLE. People call off and maangers dont care about you, they didnt wanna give me breaks and i didnt work for a month and had to go through corporate to get my job back. i would recomend finding school or additonal work. burlington is not a reliable company but i stayed for a year. it was still a blessing from the lord. this was my expereince."
good,"At Burlington's they train you for a couple of weeks , once you are hired you go ahead and start your following day with schedule. You have to be a self starter."
good,"It's not exactly a hard job. Just serve customers, put your hangers and clothes away, and make sure the store is organized and well put together. What makes the job hard is management's poor approach to, well, managing. There's no clear communication on company policy, certain managers are unnecessarily harsh and rude, expectations are way too high with the resources given, and when company policy is mentioned (usually in a ranting and aggressive meeting), no one actually follows up or enforces the rules. Example: we were told that, upon moving to our new store, layaways would be shortened from 60 days to 30 days. My first day back on the register after moving, someone did a layaway and it came up as 60 days. I asked a supervisor about this to which she snapped at me, ""Don't just repeat everything you hear!! Layaways are 60 days!"" Funny, because a few days later layaways WERE shortened to 30 days. The system must have needed updating or fixing and that person, by sheer dumb luck, got grandfathered into the old system. Not to mention someone from THE CORPORATE OFFICE was the one who told us about the new layaway policy. Did I really deserve to be snapped at like that? No, I think not. I could go on and on with examples like these from dress code to job duties to training all the way down to our no doubt illegal ""no water"" policy, but I digress... If you work here, expect to make your own decisions and ignore a lot of grief from management. The only solace is that write ups are rare and their bark is worse than their bite."
good,"they are great working environment would recommend to friends & flexible with school hours, also the employee discount can be a little bit more higher 15% does not due much"
good,"I very much so enjoyed my job and position. I was seasonal and expected like other Holiday jobs that days and hrs would be cut. A wk or two after Christmas the schedule would come out and I would have 2-4 days at most. Then I'd go bk and look at the "
good,"Worked part-time at this location as an Customer Service Associate and became an Customer service Supervisor in a 2year's timing. This job was under paid very understaffed, unorganized, & favoritism among Management with giving out hours which made it a little stressful. The pros would be working around your schedule & would be a good part-time."
good,"This is not a typical loss prevention job. You will not be doing apprehensions. Only full time Loss Prevention Associates work on catching shoplifters. However, it is a decent opportunity to get your foot in the door if you want to start a career in loss prevention."
good,"Regional and district managers expect too much from the store leadership team. Which in turn puts too much pressure on the hourly associates. Causing constant turn. Not enough payroll to execute programs, and then expect managers to stay until done. Which is impossible because it's never going to be done. Too stressful."
good,Management is really bad. They don't care about anyone but themselves. I wish I had never gone to work there. They can't keep workers because of the way they talk to people.
good,"I like allot about Burlington. I like the associates, managers I came I  contact and so. But I did realized early on that my role had a lack of great District Management. Allot of the LP's are scrutinized by management on cases. Company policies are stupid. No real management. Great thi g I was able to do my own schedule.  I often worked alone but with constant  communication with the store manager. 2 things that I like about the lp position.  Working well with the associates is key for the job. Not a bad thing."
good,The job is cool but the pay literally sucks. And I have never heard of a company talking about saving payroll as much as this one does. Who lives off $100 a week? Beside a teenager who doesn't have bills to pay?
good,"Interacted with market vendors."
good,Horrible management cant live off hourly wages low cut back on hours management sleeping with employees dirt floors employees are very great just the management is poor poor poor
good,If you didn't start at Burlington in the 1990's then you only get part-time and no one can live on what they pay and there are no benefits. Low morale
good,was not here long enough fast paced environment only allows competition between co-workers. typical day at work was breaking boxes and pallets merchandise was packed according to instruction of lead.
good,"I disliked the management they was rude sometime, barley had any hours sometimes was barley enough to pay my bills had to get a second job just to make ends meet"
good,Constant chaos with little to no benefits basically working everyone to death with no regards of their employees well being. Overall friendly but communication is very bad.
good,I love working for burlington but if your like me and your looking for a career then please keep looking cause the main problem with this company is that they don't promote from inside that much and then when they do they want you to relocate
good,"Retail can be tough, but this job often seemed impossible because we were almost always short-staffed. Having only two people on the floor in the morning and afternoon made it hard to ever get anything done, and the closing crew always got the brunt of it. Some days you will get pulled in every direction and it can be stressful. If you're on the floor you usually have a designated department, but you can get thrown wherever they need you."
good,If you ain’t a favorite to certain managers then you ain’t going nowhere they are very unfair and the director looks like he doesn’t know what he is doing sometimes
good,"when management changed so did working environment. I enjoyed working with customers and helping them, enjoyed my co workers, favoritism is a big problem with current manager, saw a lot of it but I went to work and had no problem because the good outweighed the bad"
good,it's hard for me to talk about this place with high regards;. n that note if you are a hard worker and sometimes need help you will find yourself doing a lot of things yourself or with little help given from coworkers. sometimes hours are given out for when they need people and someone is always willing to show you how to do something to get you started. Projects were always time consuming and sometimes never completed or would get changed after anyways. it a decent place to go if you are in dire need of a job.
good,"Honestly the job is not that bad. Although they are sometimes not considerate of life situations and flexabilty of times, but all around its not a bad job you develop good relationships with people."
good,Putting away merchandise from night before or helping putting new merchandise into racks.  I learned how to run the register.  Hardest part of job was dealing with a disorganized manager. Most enjoyable part of job was interacting with my customers and few of the associates were nice
good,It was a stating place to work. I enjoyed working there. Coworkers were friendly too. Job growth wasn't there and no training was available for advancement.
good,"I worked part time, they never have enough people working. Everyone calls off or quits and it is a very busy place. Management is nice, but aren't helpful and don't know what they are doing."
good,"Fun fast paced work environment, this was a temporary job as needed job experience and staff can be friendly. Its a job and you can make it fun or stressful based on your outlook."
good,"Terrible scheduling, and terrible location to work at. There is really no way to move up when being a sales associate and it's really no place to stay permanently at."
good,this job is just to pass time. i dont want to hype it up like its a big deal because its really just slow paced retail. nothing more to say this specific location was averaage
good,"When i first started at this job i had a great store manager, i was getting hours and i was even promoted because he seen so much potential in me. but when when he transferred to another store our location went downhill, we had the worse store manager, he made it hard for me to want to come to work. i hated it there because of the new management."
good,"If you're looking for a part time or seasonal position, Burlington is not half bad. They are a company that's expanding and have been making improvements to their stores for years. They are a wholesale retail company, and operations vary from store to store. Management and associates are courteous, kind, and respectful overall and is very team focused."
good,Its okay i loved the job its just the raise and its stressful and sometimes they dont wan to work with your schedule.. But you get a 30 min lunch and 15 min break.
good,Fast paced job. Learned how to process inventory. The coworkers were friendly. Management was not very friendly. The hardest part was never knowing what time you could leave.
good,"When I work there the management was rarely around. You worked multiple departments of the store. Most of the cameras didn't work. Very  messy floor layout. "
good,"The management plays a big role in why Burlington is so unsuccessful in keeping employees. The stores turn over rate is sky high, They was never trained properly them selfs to train the workers. They are very unprofessional  and don’t have the proper knowledge of anything. Burlington is also very loose with any rules and regulations they never follow protocol unless corporate is coming to visit. Everyone complains all day! Very sad company to work for."
good,"You get paid minimum wage (what do you expect) Typical day as a cashier would be ringing out customers, returns, exchanges, answering phones, etc. Manager comes over and gives you some side task to do when it's slow. 4 hour shift: paid 15 minute break, 6 hour shift: Unpaid 30 minute break, any additional hours after an 8 hour shift is an extra 15 minutes to your break time. Pretty straightforward and dreadfully routine. Always worked with your schedule, you're promised at least 12 hours a week, so it's a great job for students. But don't put your heart into it because there is close to no room for advancement with them. Managers are condescending, it all kind of gets annoying after a while. Coworkers were great though! Funny people. Be expected to get asked to stay longer because there is always people calling out because sometimes this job just sucks."
good,we always had terrible customer service reviews and poor cleanliness reviews because of so many employees who were never trained properly. so long time employees always picked up their slack which never let them learn right so it was a cycle of people doing terrible jobs and blaming others for it so it sucked and i left since no one wanted to do their jobs right
good,"Working with Burlington was an OK experience. It was very laid back until people messed up your sections. The position I held was Seasonal and they chose not to hire me as full time, but it was OK to say the least"
good,this store has poor supervision and they do not care about there employees. they would yell at the employees and threaten our jobs if we did not get anything done
good,"However the employee are not treated fairly at the airport rd. Location, I was fired for something a manager did but did not want to take responsibility for it then I was told all managers stick together sad but true"
good,"you wont make money here unless your a manager ,really a job for someone just getting in to retail ,no room for growth or development do to the fact they never promote from within"
good,"Stressful, busy, and if you can't multitask, you're essential dead on arrival. The current manager cannot schedule for a darn and while there are some great people working then, they expect about 3 persons worth of work out of one person, for a pay that only adds up to less than 15000 per year. Full time."
good,basically helping customers with their purchases and offering different options if we didn't have a certain item learning to deal with customers of all walks of life
good,"I really enjoyed working at Burlington as a customer service cashier. the job was really fun, but i barely had work life balance i felt like i never had time at home, mainly because i was always working extra hours because people would call off. I did not like how they gave promotions at this specific location because i felt like i worked twice as hard as the people that they were giving promotions to and i was working there longer. I really liked management they were always engaged with the employees and made the job easier for us. they were nice people. the thing i liked most about working at burlington was that i was able to get to know new people and develop relationships with the customers who shopped there often. i really learned to come out of my shell and interact more with others and i really liked that part about this job."
good,"Burlington is good to work at if you are retired, going through school or when in between jobs. The environment is very settle. Workers work as a team to ensure productivity and customer service. Unfortunately, the turnover rate is very high for non- management and management positions."
good,"Great working there till attitude problems started flying, management played favorable to some employees, no hours,have to say customers service was the only good thing they had"
good,"i worked early in the mornings and unloaded the truck with the rest of the staff. it was long and slow work and the same work every day, you would work Monday through Friday bright and early to load up the floor, did not have to deal with customers for you would leave right as the store was opening."
good,"Burlington is a wonderful new store in Dover. Working there has taught me a lot. The only downfall is that they need just a little more structure and organization within the company. There are a lot of great people, customers as well as employees."
good,"Come in to unload truck, separate truck, stock and prepare items.  Never knew when we would get off or if had a lunch.  Some of the supervisors were very good at their job but there was no set hours or even days that would be worked.  No advancement."
good,I enjoyed working with the other employees on  a day to day work schedule. Everyone works as a team but you cant ever get threw to the managment if there was a problem. That would be my biggest concern about the place is that when ever there is an issue its usually was never solved and it was hard just to get a few minutes to speak of the problem. Ive learned alot about merchandising and organizing for the seasons; putting clothing options where they belong in the sportswear department. Same for the accessories department. hardest part of the day was cleaning and picking up after everyone once the store was closed for the day. The most enjoyable was was getting a chance to work as a team with the other employers. Im a big people person when it comes to my everyday life even including my work life.
good,El ambiente laboral no es muy confortable puesto q los managuer no suelen premiar el esfuerzo. Los trabajadores no son bien valorados .
good,Lots of contradicting policies. Very hard no over time policy. Pay is well below what someone with experience should be making. Will pick an choose when to act on a case when turned in. And in same motion mention how case numbers need to come up
good,When I first started loved my job. There were changes in management that were not good for the overall store I worked at. Morale suffered and drove lots of good people out of there.
good,Worked with the company for two years and the best i could say about them is that your fellow employees are willing to help if management doesn't which is a way more then it should.
good,"Honestly I work in the majority of field that are available at Burlington Coat Factory and they wont everything done within minutes, which is possible with multiple people; except most of the time your on your own.  They also cut hours from employees every month or so, to the point where I was working maybe one or two days half shifts (4hrs). The management is terrible and the previous manager was sexist to women, to the point where he would yell at them and make them cry. The only good parts about the store I work at is that most of the employees are awesome people and easy to get along with."
good,There was a lot of complaining customers and there was an overload of work compared to the amount of employees. But the job was easy and it was easy to go home and not think about the job at the end of the night.
good,"There wasn't to many hours to be had I work 20 hours a week , that the reason for me resigning. the lack of hours really through me off I would love to work for a company that will give me full time hours."
good,"Plenty of hardworking, honest people, but the system they use is terrible. Its sexist based and is incredibly difficult to operate in the allotted time one has to do the job. It was always a race against time."
good,"To me work there was really difficult due to how management was. I loved my job an enjoyed working, I just wasn't sure if management felt that way as well."
good,Unloading trucks and dropping items on sales floor was the typical work day. Management did what they could but barely met goals as store condition steadily worsened. Co-workers were fine although there were mutiple altercations throughout my tenor.
good,"Company ran with a guideline, that in the past  year is more like a mold.  No one can vary from guidelines and first level management outside store is very micro managed."
good,I felt like the wrong people were put in undeserving positions due to family members and personal relationships with other managers!
good,"A typical day would be me and one or two other cashiers if im lucky. assisting customers and making sure there experience here was well. Depending on who im with we'll usally get thing done at the end of the night , The hardest part was maybe working with those who didn't do much but wonder around while trash, hangers , sensors , donuts , floor , and ETC needed to be done. Seeing what iv done and how clean and well I would leave things wa my favorite. knowing the when I come in the next morning things will be right and ready for me."
good,it is a ok store for most part just to work in advancement is very slim for warehouse worker it is very hard to move up the team is ok managers are fine but only about numbers
good,"Most of the Managers at are very nice and appreciate the work I do for them. It is a really nice place to work.  We often have meals provided to us, which is awesome and the discount is very generous."
good,Staff was not supportive of the change Loss Prevention brought to the company. However overall Its a great company to work for.
good,It's okay for a first job but I wouldn't recommend working here long term my co workers are very friendly and it's a nice place to work but it doesn't pay a lot and you don't get many hours it's a pretty easy job but also very boring and you have to stand up all day the only time you get to sit down is during lunch or on break the manager is nice it'a a pretty decent job for the most part the only bad thing about working at Burlington is the pay it's only 8 dollars an hour and less than 30 hours a week and a lot of work for such little pay also the hours are very strange and they don't give you holiday/overtime pay very cheap if they would increase the pay and give more hours people would'nt keep quitting!!!!
good,Working for Burlington coat factory as a cashier was sometimes great but other times horrible. I love the people follow cashier and also the customers but the management was only interested in who was in charge. there where way to many managers telling the same people to do different thing and it was no trust between management and staff.
good,Can be a great company but is in need of a little work and promotion. Seemed as if there was never any room for any improvement
good,A productive and fast paced environment. Must be able to complete every daily task and set department for the arrival of the next delivery for the receiving department
good,From day to day i meet so many different people with so many different cultures . This makes my job very exciting and interesting
good,"The work environment is beautiful because I get to meet people from all over the world, My biggest problem was the company being short staffed. Many days I would have to back up from my own work responsibilities in order to run the register. Management was not that friendly either."
good,"Everyday was busy with only 4 full time personal on the floor including myself do to hours being cut, usually had to watch 3 departments while managing  a cashier position on the register. Managers were okay they understood we had alot to deal with as long as we were able to do our jobs and attend to customers. Hardest part of the job was usually working a lot of the departments at once."
good,Unethical practices within the local store management team.
good,They need to get a better training program. management needs to be available. i loved taking care of the customers
good,Burlington is a good job to work at if your a high school student or either looking for a second part time job to make a little extra money.
good,"Learned in which ways not to run a business and how to prevent negative reactions from customers and employees "
good,"work there for 4 years..."
good,"A typical day at Burlington I see myself working customer service and the purchase line because most of the time its only one person scheduled. I really haven't learned anything, I wasn't even trained correctly. I learned everything on my own. Management team hasn't been steady, its' been manangers in and out since I transferred. My co-workers, well some do their job and more but others lazy and only do whats required then. The hardest part of my job is satisfying the customers as quickly as possible. The most enjoyable part is the customers!!"
good,"I would not want to stay working here for more than four years, honestly theres to much confusion, no communication, favoritism, and little attention from management."
good,"This job showed me I can adapt to any situation thrown my way."
good,Very unorganized. Alot of changes were happening so that could have been the problem. Other than that the working there was very enjoyable. Liked working with customers. I learned alot about customer service mainly how to handle situations with a professional approach. Hardest part about the job was keeping up with the multiple schedule changes during the week.
good,"A typical day would include assisting clients with shopping ventures and purchases. It was nice to meet new people, see the latest trends, and assist managers in appreciating customer satisfaction. The hardest part of the job was the lack of available hours to the floor staff. There were very limited full-time positions available. The managers were very nice, open door policy that was available for employees as well as flexible scheduling."
good,A typical work day was steady with enough work to keep busy. I leard how to operate a palet jack and scan inventory into stores system. Managment wasn't the best at treating equals but they did their job. I enjoyed the steady pace and amount of work to keep busy.
good,"But location was very rough and very rude coworkers. Most of the employees only spoke spanish, so if you didn't, then they would treat you very rudely. Management was lacking."
good,They eliminated my position Low pay. No corporate vision.
good,overall work environment reasonable. Team work greatly encouraged. Great learning environment for those who are employed in retail for first time.
good,"I worked in the junior department. I helped customers with fitting rooms, cleaned fitting rooms distributed merchandise to sales floor. The hardest part of the job was cleaning the fitting. Customers would leave clothes on the floor, off the hangers, they would steal items, so it was hard for me to deal with. Will not be able to work in the clothing industry."
good,if you have a family and bills to pay then you would want to find a new job... they work you very hard and the pay is very small you don't grow fast and management has no clue what they are doing...
good,"Enjoyed my time working for the company,but its now time to try something different."
good,have been working with this company since November 15 of 2010 to this point i have not received any benefits raises or better job opportunities to rise up in the company.
good,"As a former employee, and yes I stress former, I can attest to the fact that the company tells you great things, but they do not actually follow up on many of those things. For example, ""Core Values"" are supposed to be the new backbone of the company, yet the evidence of ""Core Values"" is not really visible in stores until the time comes to ""hold someone accountable."" As a former field executive for the company, I was a part of this ""smoke blowing"" but when I would no longer go along with what was being done, I became an outcast, as did others."
good,"was chaotic, make up rules as you go, corporate gives you rules to follow but when enforced you're written up...hardest was dealing with managers who had no clue....enjoyable part leaving."
good,"Burlington is a great store with excellent products. Although, during the time I worked there, our staff and management wasn't very efficient. We lost thousands of dollars worth of merchandise yearly. Apparently things have'nt changed, I keep hearing stories of their own staff stealing merchandise."
good,This job was more of a bitter sweet to me . We had good days and bad days like most jobs. I thank them because I got more of my retail experience front them. You learned to deal with bad/good/impatient/patient customers.
good,This is a great first job for someone but definitely not a place you would want to stay long term. Management at this location was not the best. They play favorites a lot. Customers are okay for the most part.
good,"Pay is a joke,you can't get an 8hr day in either. Great prices if you make enough to buy something. Hard to stock shelves with no organization for proper placement, like a traditional store."
good,"Good pay for seasonal, however you start out virtually with no hours until they call you. First month on call basis then afterwards they put you on schedule. Don’t tell you that you are on schedule until they see you’re late for a shift and call. On call basis puts you in a weird position of just “waiting” not able to make plans accordingly because they may call you any day and time. Managers do not communicate with each other about new trainees. Also, disregard what email says, you’ll be put in any spot they need you. Training for position in email is given but you won’t really need it."
good,I was so happy to start working at Burlington because I love shopping there and I love clothes/fashion in general but I was blown away by the wonderful and diverse coworkers I got to meet and their acceptance of LGBTQ people was important to me because I'm trans and I've had alot of trouble finding a job where I felt like I fit in.
good,"Fun environment depending on who you are working with. Typical day consist of coming in, breaking down boxes of merchandise to sort. Once sorted, we take the items to the floor for proper placement."
good,"Mostly pt positions. Promotions tend to be bias, and hours are given to friends, especially if they are same culture and bilingual. Okay if you're in high school or like working mostly nights and weekends"
good,"I am only a seasonal employee so the atmosphere is very stressful because it is a brand new store.  Employees are nice, and so is the management.  But since it is only a temporary job, the stress level is high for everyone because none of us know if we're to have a job once the season is over."
good,Wasn't trained before I was thrown into  management. The pay sucks and you get paid weekly so your check is pitiful. I got talked into being a manager but when I got the position no-one bothered to train me
good,"if Ure basically looking for secure foundation, Burlington wasn’t the place. They raises are .50cents a year based on 50/50 evaluations. Meaning you get evaluated and the whole store is evaluated and the way she specified if the store doesn’t get raised in numbers then neither do you as an individual. I that was completely awful to hear. The pay for receiving is $10.10 experienced/no experience. I thought that was completely unfair. So I said I would give it try. I quit the 4th day. There hours aren’t guaranteed and you will work on a time and speed just to wake up at 5am start work at 6am and they want you gone before 12. They don’t give you 8hrs and if you want extra hours they want to use you for double the labor"
good,"Sm was lazy and was unaware of the non sense that went on in Burlington , never recognized the personnel who worked hard for him . Always trying to degrade employees and make them feel like they were not capable of doing their job"
good,"I had fun working at Burlington they had sustainable hours they paid on time and had good wages. However, the work was a little hard on the back and shoulders, but they made sure that you stretched before starting the job"
good,No benefits for part-time employees. Management don't work they just sit on their butts all day telling you what to do. They retaliate against you too
good,"Not much to say. It wasnt for me. They could do better efforts in training in management and customer service. Also, wages could be better, too.  Management wasnt the best and good workers overlooked while bad workers were rewarded. The job is best for students and seasonal work."
good,"I've been with Burlington for two years now just to get through school. In just two years, I've worked with two managers and currently, the store is not doing too well. Management is horrible. Lack of communication, low hours, and routines are always changing to the point of inability to keep up what's going on with the store and its employees."
good,was dissatisfied with the way I was treated by corporate management. After working with these people for iover two years I had earned some odd amount of raises and when minimum wage went up to 9.50... I was not given my hard earned raises on top of that minimum wage.
good,It's an ok place it needs more hours more days to work and no racism but overall it's a nice working environment some people are nice but others are not
good,"I was hired to be apart of the truck crew, and on my first day, I wasn't trained how they did their truck. They just showed me where we did it and then just said, ""Alright. Start."" It didn't end up working out for me so I asked to switch to the floor where i still wasn't trained. It was just, ""You ever cashiered before? Yeah? Start ringing."" Some co-workers were helping along the way but if I was trained how their system worked, I wouldn't have to have kept asking. And for the floor, again, wasn't shown anything. It was just, ""You're in men's department."" It would help if their was proper training"
good,"Management is always moody and the assistant managers all show favoritism. Store manager is awesome! If the assistant managers would learn some people skills Burlington would be a better place to work, and maybe associates would stay longer."
good,This company is a utility for young people entering the work place.It is a fast paced environment that requires a steady mindframe of patience and tolerance. It serves as an extension of knowledge and skills being honed in to better facilitate customer service and develop that rapporte acumen that helps to build growth in an individual.
good,I would clock in then get a list of to-do`s for my department. these action would be carried out to the best of my ability. I learned that no mater your position all jobs are for everybody and being in my position I would be sure to pick up the slack so all would get done. I would speak to management about needing another emloyee during peek times since I was the only one in the department. Most of the time this went unheard.My fellow employees would go out of there wy to try to help me we mhad a great work culture. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep up on my own. What I enjoyed most about the childrens and baby department were the customers.
good,Stressful environment during the holidays and management wasn't much help. Lack of growth within the company. Hardest part of the job was dealing with unpleasant customers and having to maintain a positive attitude even when they were beyond rude.
good,"The only reason I stayed at this job is because my supervisor was awesome. Once my coworkers slowly left one by one, I quit. I worked with a lot of petty teenagers. DO NOT work here if you have bills. This job is ideal for somewhere right out of high school or a college kid who needs a part time job. The hours always get cut, the pay is very low, and they are cheap and refuse to give raises higher than a couple cents. The only enjoyable thing was my co-workers when I first started were all awesome. That's everyones answer - the people. Otherwise there's nothing really great about this company besides that and the job is relatively easy. A lot of people don't like the point system, but I honestly think it's great. I've worked at places before that only allowed 3 absences and your fired. They are easy-going in that way."
good,"It's not a bad place to work but I just need more hours and they want one person to do too much work but they are relocating and I don't know if the commute, which is further, is worth it for a part timer who is getting less than 20 hours"
good,Management and staff was friendly and helpful. Lack of hours. Inconsistent staff knowledge and  reliability. GM made me feel uncomfortable and stressed. Poor scheduling and lack of training.
good,There is a point system in place but my boss is constantly changing my schedule. If I go by the schedule I would have been fired twice. It's annoying.
good,"I loved working at Burlington, the few problems I had were management. All of my co-workers and I got along (except for one) they are typically fact paced during the holidays and on saturdays and some sunday afternoons. My managers were very rude (the store manager was the worse), however they did work with my schedule they are very understanding when it comes to your schedule. They rarely gave out overtime. The discount was good 15% goes up to 30% on every holiday. I did like that they gave us an employee survey that showed that they listened and cared."
good,Working at Burlington taught me how to deal with difficult people. It taught me that just because someone is in a position of power does not make the professional.
good,"This job I personally did not enjoy. The management was not secure and efficient. This was not a promoting job."
good,"Horrible company to work for. My friend also worked there years after I did and she had the same complaints. Not enough hours, rude associates, horrible managers."
good,Don't receive many hours they change weekly and often. Easy to learn your job description. Managers are easy to get along with and employees are very helpful.
good,"My experience here was okay. I didn't love it but I didn't hate it...much. The one thing I liked most was getting to know the other employees. "
good,"BCF was one of my favorite stores for good clothing and good reasonable prices. But it is honestly a place, location, store that no one didn't really respect. Management was poor with almost all supervisors and manager was nice when she wanted to be or needed you to cover a shift. But during the time pay was good."
good,A typical day is I would give costumers product information and sell them the product. I learned how to sell in many different ways. Management was not always on point with their work.
good,"Not really a cool place to stay at. If you are good they'll give you hours, otherwise you won't get much.There are chances in advancement but you have to be a good and loyal worker. Getting to know a little about every section of the store can get you a long way. Full time positions aren't open as much but when they are they make sure to post it and offer the position before hiring outside."
good,"The new manager demanded more speed and was always talking trying to tell the crew that more speed was needed never fast enough "
good,It was ok. One manager needed to go. Which she has been fired since.8 hrs. On a register was to long especially when busy. Not enough breaks to refresh your mind. Store needed some major cleaning out of bad enployees.
good,Burlington is a good place to work for kids in high school or just starting college. It is a weekly paying job & tends to pay ok depending on how many hours you've worked during the time period.
good,Excellent opportunity for a college student or retiree.  The work schedule is flexible and hours are not consistent. There are weeks that you may work 20+ and others less than 20. Receive freight and process merchandise according to store procedure and stock shelves.  This position may require you to work different tasks other than assigned or hired for.
good,They will over work you but don't pay much. You will work multiple position for lttle pay. Not enough staffing scheduled. Need better management. Big turnover.
good,"So far working at burlington has been alright. However when the holidays ht, things get hectic. Lines are super long and I feel like we dont get paid enough for the stuff that we do."
good,Burlington is a great place to start work experience. They are very understanding of your situation. Good way to get income but not great place to work for cost of living.
good,"Was a fast paced job that demanded physical activities such as lifting boxes, moving pallets, and placing overstock in back. Requires your attention to keep up with time goals. Was given task that were not done as expected."
good,"I was hired on as ""on call"" which should of been a red flag because they high rate of turnover at this store perhaps. At the register you are timed on how fast you check someone out which was new to me which put added pressure on myself. Some of the assistant managers were rude and the worst I have experienced in my job career. Being ""on call"" was fine, but I would only sometimes get 8 hours a week , I was going to look for a second job but was told I cannot change my availability for 90 days. I had some really nice co-workers, and the GM was great. Overall this was not a fit for me, but for some it can be."
good,Management was iffy. Employees were awesome. Store was always messy due to high volume. A typical work day includes a lot cleaning and constant back-up needed on registers.
good,"Only store manager is the bad apple. Looks at all the work that needs to be done instead of all the work you have accomplished. A typical day at work starts with a long list of tasks, not a hello. After giving you the list of tasks to do, she will tell you to do something else completely unrelated from those tasks that will require a good chunk of your work day so you won't have time to finish. One time she congratulated me over the local communication because my department went up in sales (sarcastically), then when everyone else started congratulating me, she made me thank someone who worked in my area 2 hours out of the week for straightening an aisle."
good,The managers try their best but they aren't always so fare or competent. Of course it depends on the indvidual but Id recommend something else. if you could find a better job it is reccommended
good,"Having worked for BCF on and off for close to three years, I did learn how to better manage my time, how to work closely and efficiently with others, customer service and various other skills. My managers were for the most part good people, but probably wouldn't cut it at any other company as leaders. Coworkers were usually decent enough people but lacked motivation and/or work ethic. "
good,"Doesn't pay enough or offer a raise. If the money ey was better the job would be great. Has a great management team.                   "
good,"Honestly, a good place to work if you're young. Don't expect a career unless you really like dealing with unreasonable customers. Not a bad place to start though. "
good,weekends are mandatory. hours are not set. random shifts. close one night and open the next morning. store manager is not very nice to customers or employees.
good,The people at the job make the job fun but it’s as fast pace job I worked all over the store so I knew how to do everything in the store I liked the hours I do work there the pay just wasn’t good enough anymore for me but it is a good company to work for
good,Burlington stores is not a good job to work at if you have bills rent to pay the hours for a part time are 8-12 per week who survives on that the only time we get hours is around the holidays which can be very stressful we don't get benefits at all and all departments have only 1 full time person there is no opportunity for advancement and managers have their favorite employees I would not recommend any one to work for Burlington once you start they give you 20+ plus hours to get you hooked but then hours decrease dramatically
good,"I loved working for Burlington! They had such an involved team of workers. Supervisors were very kind and understanding as well as promoted growth. The most difficult part of the job was working with the store manager whom, in my opinion, was extremely unprofessional and inappropriate.  Other than that, I wouldn't have left."
good,"To work at Burlington you have to be able to multi-task. Assisting customers with finding merchandise, returning merchandise to correct spot, and making sure the selling floor is clean. The managers are great to work with and understanding in certain situations. Being able to get the job done within a certain amount of time can be the hardest part of the job at times. I enjoy the job because I get to meet a lot of amazing people"
good,"Overall I enjoyed working with the staff at Burlington, loved merchandising all the fun merchandise received, not only clothing but my most favorite part of the job, was merchandising the Linens Department especially around Christmas, it is so much fun for me to build stories with the merchandise received, and a real joy to see the sales increase because the customer likes the displays."
good,"Burlington has given me the opportunity to experience what a busy retail store looks like. I learned how to organize clothes, measure men for suits. I learned how to sensor clothing the correct way and well educate myself with how to work a cashier. Ive also learned how to manage my time and multitask efficiently."
good,What I enjoy most about Working at Burlington is the employees and customers making them happy and making sure I meet their needs meeting new faces every day
good,Working there was great with exception of upper management. They would implement new rules without taking employees into consideration. We were the ones that were on the floor but that seemed not to matter.
good,"I worked in receiving, it is fast-paced and a lot of work. The amount paid does not compare to the work you perform. It's hard to keep employees because of management and  low pay."
good,Productive very fast paced. You get to meet a lot of interesting people by helping them pick out clothes or even help them design their home. What's fun is you shop while you work!
good,Basically I was to unload the truck first thing in the morning then I would have to unpack an tag each item ....put it out on the floor then I go home
good,Ok place to work at easy work nothing to it just lots of patience customers always want discounts even though the store is already marked down. And employees discount is pretty good
good,"Long work day hours; issued 15 minute breaks when by law 30 minute breaks should be granted working 8hr work day."
good,management needs more training. working here was not a good experience for me at all. I've gone back in to shop and everytime I go in they have a whole new staff.
good,"There are not many opportunities for advancement at Burlington. The workplace culture is horrible because  there is poor management. The work is easy, but, hiring is poor."
good,Its cool if u are in to fashion and want to get dress for different occasion. Would be a good job for someone young going to school that likes shopping
good,"For management, the compensation is not that great compared to other companies.  The ""work/life balance"" is talked about, but not executed.  Training for management is non-existent."
good,"Management was ok"
good,When i first got offered the job at burlington i was made promises that they did not keep. I loved my job at first but slowly became concerned after new management. Myself as well as others are not evenly paid for what we are now being told to do in addition to our job. It seems as if this store has no constant and its causing a lot of confusion and unprofessional work environment.
good,"it was a horrible place to work for. the custoners could be so rude, the managers were very incompetent, the hardest part of the job was dealing with the managers for me, they were rude."
good,"I like tje associates, but store manager is no good. Tje pay does not reflect my work. I like making the store a safe place to be so i enjoy my field. Just no room for advancement"
good,"There is an old jamaican woman who is the supervisor of the stock room... she is the devil. the single most unpleasant and rude woman in NYC. Constantly yelling and calling the store managers to ""handle us"". Don't let her make you miserable."
good,the management was horrible and it was alot of work for just alittle pay and the hours was horrible as well and it was alot of work to keep it clean but it had good products
good,"Great co-workers."
good,"I mostly worked over holiday seasons, to be fair, but often we would stay 1-2 hours late clearing misplaced items and returning store to passible at the end of each shift."
good,"There is little to no communication between the employee and the management, management has little regard for the employees they hire for the temporary assignments."
good,"I have been working there for under a year, and it is an okay place to work. Unfortunately, I feel where it may fall short is management of not only scheduling, but also the higher up management not handling the needs of the store. A typical day is opening the store as the only cashier on the floor of a two location registers for multiple hours until the next scheduled cashier comes into work, and that can even happen on a busy day, It is a fun welcoming environment, which does make the job enjoyable, but due to lack of scheduling, it tends to make it more difficult to enjoy being there."
good,When the company went public it all went downhill. They only care about the bottom dollar. Otherwise the different stores try their best to make employees feel like they are important.
good,It taught me not to take any type or amount of income for granted. I appreciated the chance to learn and interact with customers on a daily basis.
good,"There is no way to grow within this business nor at this location. The scheduling is not what it should be. The employees schedule is always changing, not set schedule from week to week. "
good,i really enjoyed the atmosphere and the people that I was surrounded with at work. I made several good genuine friends while working there. Everyone was willing to help me with whatever questions I had about the job duties.
good,Most enjoyable part; good store managers that will compliment you if you are doing well and will work with you on your flexibility.
good,"In my couple of months that I was employed with Burlington, I felt a great honor being employed with them, I believe I had a good manager but a poor choice of a supervisor."
good,"that sales winter coats ,New born baby thing to  crib ,clothes and shoes .It also sales adult clothes and shoes .the store is really big it also has good costumer service .You will come there to buy 1 thing and leave out with a couple of things ."
good,Money isn't the only thing.  Promotions went to the people who joked around with the managers instead of cleaning and putting out merchandise.  Managers like people to just take orders and not have any ideas to increase sales.  Older employees are marginalized in favor of younger employees who do nothing.  I Learned that in todays work force it is how you play the game not how well you do the work.
good,"A typical day at work required me to handle and process shipments, and stock merchandise. I learned a lot about how receiving departments work in retail and department stores. My coworkers were friendly and easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was getting done in a timely manner, because our shipments were always large. The most enjoyable part of the day would be after merchandise was stocked when productivity would calm down."
good,"this was my first job in retail/warehouse position. Work was fast paced and hard; didn't mind that so much, but it would have helped if the communication from supervisors was better. Supervisors were never appreciative of any work done."
good,"Customer service is a must, smile and greet customers as they come in to the store. Handle cash with care and help customers with what they are looking for"
good,They have poor management and communication skills for their employees. They don't pay attention to inventory. They only allow 15 hrs a week.111111111
good,"Burlington is not the most clean store to visit. There are a lot of items, and a high volume of people who come through so things aren't very well organized. There needs to be more staff members so that things can be kept clean and orderly."
good,"I really don't have to much to say about this place. It was an ok place to work. But it wasn't for me. "
good,Low hours low pay..stressful moments when receiving supervisor is yelling at the crew or.another coworker...no respect...little or no training...very high turnover on employees..breaks are extremely limited and depends on supervisor's mood on when you get or if its 10 minutes or 15.....
good,"My job here was very easy and fun. I basically kept all the clothing racks tidy and organized by size and color. I helped with price checks and phone calls. "
good,I would come in and start prepping the food for the day. I learned a lot of things about the food health. The manager wasn't equal with men and woman.
good,"set up , clean up, customer service, take all items and boxes off store truck, sort all items out and process items to put out on company floor,"
good,"Burlington is a fast paced job, The store manager at the time was nice at first. I worked in the back doing receiving and we had an unbearable supervisor. She was disrespectful and she likes to yell at people as if she was their mother.She also had a bad attitude and once snatch something out of my hands and threw it in the trash while yelling at me. Working in the receiving department was not enjoyable but i did work on the floor a couple of days and the supervisors there are nice and the environment is pleasant compared to receiving."
good,"If you like working in a place where customers treat you like you're nothing but the piece of gum on the bottom of their shoe while they bring havoc and throw their clothes and sometimes their baby's diapers all over the store, and not get paid anywhere near enough for the work that you do, this is definitely the place for you."
good,"This is a fast paced environment. They just did a bad job at scheduling staff. For example, busy days were under staffed and slow days were over staffed."
good,"This company's managers expect a 10/10, but reward or treat their employee's like 3's. "
good,"Constant sudden changes to the work schedule inferences with schedule planning of associates.There seems to be no room for advancement within the company."
good,"Full time job with part time hours. This was my first retail job and I have new found respect for the employees in said industry and I respect them not because the job is hard; its quite easy compared to my previous employment but the sheer tediousness of it all. The frustration of having to clean up after grown men and women due to their lack of courtesy and blatant laziness all while smiling and providing excellent customer service. All day people.....I never understood why people can't put things back where they found it or at least bring it to the counter so it can be restocked at the end of the work day. I should have been a maid with better pay and benefits , no offense BCF."
good,"-Clean very messy sections for the stores constantly "
good,I do a lot with out much recognition. I do more in my job title with a mediocre pay raise and bad hours. However getting paid every friday is the only con that I can think of.
good,"it was a friendly environment"
good,"count safe, count drawers, direct team members, schedule lunches and breaks, supervised all workers in front end of store including layaway. Hardest part of job was to keep breaks on time when days were extremely busy and we were short staffed. The most enjoyable part of my job was the connection with the customers."
good,I love the days of helping customers with finding products and participating in the growth of the company and playing a part in in sales productivity.
good,I enjoyed working for Burlington Coat Factory but they were many things that was not satisfying my needs within my life.There was no oppurtunity in growth and as well as raises or benefits was not offered being I was there for four years.I do believe coporate should be focus more on their employees and opportunities that might interest them in growth within the company.
good,working for this company was a great way to increase my retail experience. Its was a great opportunity to meet new people. Overall I enjoyed the time I worked there and the people who I worked with.
good,"It depends on what location your at , that will determine your experience with this company.The managers are very one sided and set in their ways and are habitual liars."
good,"The work environment is not exciting enough. However, the managers and employees are good to work with. The average day at Burlington for me consist of cleaning up the sales floor, and working the register."
good,it is a job  good for someone starting out. pay is not worth the the work. you are a cardboard cut out. you are only there to catch co workers stealing
good,at first i loved the job until i got to know management. they really need to get it together. coworkers are great and a nice store
good,"Greeted and assisted customers, answered phones, stocked new shipments, and various cleaning duties.  Also measured men for suit shirts and suits."
good,"Very fast paced, a great place to say in shape in my personal opinion ( I was always on the move). I didn't like that you can be offered full time hours, but be able to actually become a full time associcate"
good,"its somewhat easy during the weekdays, weekends are crazy especially on events (xmas/valentines/etc). Management is weak and all over the place. Co-workers are fun and easy to get along, having to constantly be everywhere is hardest part. Usually 1 person in every department, (men, shoes, kids, etc). security here sucks, everyone steals in the fitting rooms."
good,"This company lacks communication skills between employees and management, too many conflicts over lack of communication."
good,"Typical retail job. Decent hours. Gets hectic during the weekend. Managers are often times lazy, if you have a technical problem involving the computer system such as changing your availability then good luck. They will tell you ""the system I down"""
good,"Former receiving associate. Loved the job but they wanted way too much done with very little help. Ex.9 bins done by 1:30 or 2:00 with like 2-3 people at the table .4 hour shift receiving associate never got more than 25 hours. The pay sucks and they need a whole new management team accept for Donnie & Deb they do more work then anybody in that store. There's a lot of favoritism so don't go in trying to be friend no matter how cool someone may come off. It was fun while it lasted. & if you work in receiving don't TRUST ""LISA "" she literally starts so much s**t and plays victim & she a old a** Thotty smell like fish to lmao"
good,learning the sales associate trade. was fun but i only worked there a few months so i cant really say much we mainly put clothes back on the racks and helped customers find products Ran to and from the registers to help the Customer find the right product.
good,a day in the life of working at Burlington would be behind the cash register cheerfully assisting customers in  purchases
good,"I was not giving any training before I was put on the floor, I was thrown out there to learn it on my own. The store is very unorganized and is in need of a better management team, that will all be on the same page day by day."
good,"management does not have good communication skills, the hours are not so good, its a very easy job to do. overall it a job so it works with your school schedule"
good,A typical work included but not limited handling money transactions all while providing great customer service to the customer. Co-workers were friendly and we all worked as a team to get the job done.
good,"My typical day at work is sometimes conclude  Come into a mess in my fitting room cause they either don't schedule anyone or backup cashier are ringing. I try to cleaned up the fitting rooms put away merchandise, say hello to the customer & also pick up the floor. If someone need's  a price check or mis-mate outfit i go found it for the customers or anything else they need me to do. I learned more about clothing names and displaying them on 4 ways. I always learned something new everyday. Some managements are great to get a long and others like to multi-manage you.  The hardest part of this job  is I have one huge department and trying to make sure everything goes in the correct place. But also making sure its clean. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping out customers, when I get a chance put product out and displaying them on 4 ways. I like my co-workers we all work together."
good,"The ability to work in team is one of the best things to successfully to do an efficient job.  Its an excellent job to work at, while you gain useful experience and to learn new things."
good,The work place was not fun. I did not enjoy my time there. Since I was a new comer on the job people tried to take advantage of my kindness. Plus I tried to change my availability. But I could not because I tried to ask for help and then nothing happen.
good,"I have learned a lot about sales, worked very fast, they are under staffed so it can put a lot on you"
good,"Very Routine, decent people, not enough pay, not enough perks horrible store manager"
good,"Typical day was cashing out customers. I learned how to use a cash register and credit/debit card machine. Management was ok, not always the best. I enjoyed working with my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was learning how to use the computer to search for items that had no tag and didn't have any others in the store. The most enjoyable part was the people I worked with."
good,"typical day starts off with recovering merchandise from fitting rooms, register, and the sales floor."
good,"Job was great fast pace."
good,Just bad overall management. Co workers were nice but the managers were a completely different story. They would talk smack behind your backs. They felt stupid when I actually caught them saying it.
good,I worked here through a temp agency.  Management was really bad and full of young individuals who had no idea what they were doing or how to run and manage a business
good,"You come in morning. Everyone greets you, even security staff, most of the days employees and managers welcome staff in with open arms. Then you get your assignment then off you go.The hardest part of the job is the amount of freight coming off the truck and how many people are there to help me unload it. I've learned different software on the computer updating the inventory. I enjoy the scenery because its downtown Philadelphia, and come across so many different personalities."
good,"I worked all hours, I was front end manager.  My co-workers, some were great, some were not so ok.  I learned to schedule in retail, different departments.  The hardest part of the job was there was always someone not happy, a cashier, a department head, a customer.  The most enjoyable part of my job was I love working customer service and making people happy."
good,"Its a good place to work for some people. You get the interact with a lot of different people day to day. Co-workers are usually friendly and willing to work with you on different things. The hardest part of working would be dealing with a lot of different task at once. It can be kind of challenging at times, but their are co-workers around to usually help you if you ever need it along with management. I enjoyed management the most they work with you and are very open and trust worthy."
good,managment needed work on how the approach their employees.
good,"Alright Co-Workers, Comfortable Surroundings, Work isn't too complexed i'm relearning how to use a scanner, make labels again."
good,"....unrealistic metrics"
good,"this is not a good place to work."
good,"A typical day at work for me, is organizing my shoe department. Finding mismates, doing daily recovery reports, and price checks."
good,They often have a decrease in hours after the holidays but that is normal for retail. They start everyone at bottom far as pay. They do have benefits.
good,"I would clock in using my card, and then head out to the floor to see if any department projects were being done in my section, if not, then I would clean anything disorganized. If a customer had a question, I would help that person to the best I could to make sure they had everything they needed."
good,Great place to work for a student! Its a fast paced working environment with lots of chances to grow and advance while in school.
good,"While being apart of the Burlington Coat Factory I have learned to complete certain tasks and truly come together as a team. A typical day at work is handling returns and exchanges and also regular purchases. If we have hired any new cashiers I would make sure that they are trained on all specifics of our system and see that they understand all policies and procedures. My co-workers are what make the scene more manageable, we all pitch in and make sure all tasks are completed before closing each night. The hardest part of the day is figuring out our schedule, sometimes it would be changed and us as employees will hardly be notified of the changes, and also if any other rules or policies are being changed in the store. The most enjoyable part of the day is when I can help out a customer who has been given a hard time and needs a simple task taken care of, when I give them the feeling of relief and want to come back to the store.  "
good,"In one word, I would describe a typical work day at BCF as ""hectic"". I could only imagine it being like that in almost any retail work environment. In my time with BCF I have learned the true meaning of team work and why it is so important. My coworkers really cared about one another. I could describe it more as a work family. We were always working together to get a lot of projects done faster and more efficiently. Some management members were easier to talk to than others. Those individuals built a stronger closer relationship with us. Most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers. We had our regulars that would come in and shop daily. Interacting with them sort of made they day go by faster. "
good,I believe they pay the employees very little for the work that they do there. 
good,I am currently the fastest cashier there. I generate most sales on the cashier. The co-workers are not work oriented. Learned more about customer satisfaction and self awareness. The cashiers have to do almost the whole work for Burlington while stock workers walk around and are dependent on the help of cashiers.
good,"Folded and ""recovered"" sections of browsed over items. Monitored shrinkage. Handed out tickets for fitting rooms, maintained fitting rooms, put away returns. Assisted customers in suit sizes and measurements."
good,"A typical day working at Burlington Coat Factory I would clock in, go to my register, log in and help customer's, then get kicked off my register by another employee and told to go finish their job that they left incomplete on the sales floor. I learned how to use a scan cash register and effectively help customers with purchasing what fits them best. My management was not to ""management"" oriented; they did a lot of complaining about their employees to other employee's, if you went to them with a problem as the rules say to they tell you to mind your own business. My coworkers got through by doing the bare minimum, half the time they would take breaks whenever they saw fit instead of the scheduled time and whoever was still their was left to clean up their mess. The hardest part of the job is knowing that while you're doing all this work theirs people who will take an hour worth of paid breaks within a 4 hour shift and the boss tells you to mind your own business when you bring up your concerns. The most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with the customer's I love people so being friendly and hospitable was easy."
good,"A typical 5hours/day at work. Learned somewhat about merchandising and dressed up Mannequins on display at showroom. I admire the Management because the StoreManager was always been fair share. I loved my elderly co workers, reminds me of my Widowed mother. The hardest part of the job was putting away clothes from the fitting room especially when I'm assigned in the Sportswear department and the most enjoyable part of the job was the overall Recognition on my performance."
good,"Some of my daily tasks included merchandising clothing displays, dressing mannequins, and rearranging fixtures to fit the needs of the company. I also ran the fitting room where I had to aid customers in finding the correct merchandise to suit their needs. This also included putting unwanted clothing back to it's proper place using specific model numbers, and cleaning my entire work department. This job did become quite repetitive, which was probably the hardest part. However, I still had the chance to work with a variety of people, which is my specialty."
good,This was a good place to work because I met differnt people every time I was at work
good,"I learned a great deal about the meaning of customer service being in a mixed area. A typical day was mainly how to make it easier for customers to come in, shop and enjoy their experience. Working with the public can be at times difficult but it makes you into a better people person. The time I spent there was awarding because since Iam a fast learner, I was able to get promoted very quickly so my hard work was not unappreciated."
good,"A typical day at Burlington Coat Factory was usually caotic, and generally fast-paced. While with this company I indeed learned what it takes to work with the public and multiple co-workers in strenuous situations, and have become a master at holding my composure. The most enjoyable part of the job was by far working with new people constantly"
good,Working on the cash registers. I learned how to handle money and work with people and customers. Management was good for the most part. Our schedules changed all the time so it was hard to plan around my schedule and having a baby that was hard with her doctor appointment also hours would go up and down for example i had 35 hours one week and they redone the schedule I had 14. The hardest part to my job was working around my schedule. The most enjoyable part of my job wa working with the customers.
good,"Typical day was helping put out merchandise, pricing, helping customers locate product, and working the register, in charge of handling break schedules, and maintaining a clean work environment. Learn different ways to handle each upset customer. Our Management was professional, and taught us different aspects of the Job. Hardest part was putting more product out on the floor."
good,"Is and fun place to work/shop! although some coworkers are very rude and do not do there share of work properly, it is an ok place to work part time"
good,Overall I like the company I just need benefits and better pay.
good,"There's no opportunity for advancement. Depending on the position, you'll do quite a bit of work for little compensation."
good,A typical day at work starts at 8am.
good,"it was an okay place to work for an while,but not somewhere to work forever"
good,if you arenhaving a bad day it's good to work with people that can cheer u up
good,"The place is alright, in the location I work at, part timers are required to do jobs of others (such as receiving and or full timers) when we really aren't supposed to do so"
good,The work environment is very comfortable and management is very understanding. There is not much room for advancement. It’s almost like pulling teeth to get a good schedule and trying to move up in the company.
good,Job was very stressful and the main manager was very rude and would find reasons to yell at you. Never felt comfortable at work.Would not recommend this job.
good,"This can be a great place to work but only in certain departments (corporate).  Work life balance is hard here in some areas   Merchandising, Finance, IT, marketing seemed to have the best balance"
good,A very suttle working experience friendly associates and fast paces working environment you are challenged by dealing with many personalities but all in all the interaction within this business is well balanced
good,I would actually work there again only if they give me all my 40 hours. All my cashiers was high schoolers so it felt good training them so not only they can leveling up as being a cashier so can I.
good,"Inconsistent. Drama seems to be the number one focus for some of the employees. Not a horrible place if you are a high school student, but for anyone hoping to advance and work your way up, this is not the job for you. Horrible inconsistent hours, and pay is not fair."
good,It was a good stepping stone as a first job. I would go recommend working there to anyone. They are a nationally know company so you can find one in any city.
good,"Not the best, not the worst. Nobody wanted to really do their jobs. People wouldn’t show up for their shifts and wouldn’t receive any sort of repercussions (so it kept happening). Managers picked favorites and this made the typical workday more difficult because they chose people they didn’t favor to do the extra chores around the store."
good,"The building blocks were there, high turn over rate and a lack of competent management made it really hard to succeed . The environment could have been better, it was hostile at times and fear among employees caused a lack of accountability, and the the high turn over caused stability issues. But the building blocks are there, and hopefully management will learn from their mistakes and grow."
good,"Long hours and they do not recognize hard work and effort that mangers or employees do."
good,"The manager has a tendency to go over budget on hours so hours get cut frequently. There is a lot of favoritism. There is also a lot of conflict and gossiping. I enjoyed the job because of customer interaction, but a lot of the coworkers are very conniving and bossy."
good,"hectic but fun, learned about all the different fashions, the management was great, culture was fun loving, dealing with theft, The customers. We all worked together as a family, we had each others back."
good,"I worked at Burlington for 5 years. I went from part time to full time. The customers were rude, horrible and disgusting. They are always right and even when it goes against store policy, the manager will go against it and go along with what the customer says. The customer can call you every name in the book and your manager will not back you up. My coworkers were amazing. I loved them all. The pay sucked. Being a supervisor 1$ more than a cashier is ridiculous when you have more responsibilities and do more. When corporate came, everyone had to be on their toes and change how they worked compared to when corporate wasnt there."
good,Burlington is a good place to work at but can lack hours occasionally. The best time to work here is during seasonal openings. The workplace is great but could use a little more diversity.
good,Burlington will quickly hire you if they need you. The hiring process is simple and they're pretty fair when it comes to scheduling. I received a lot of overtime when I worked part-time. Corporate seems to be well involved with the bottom line.
good,"The job is laid back and easy but the hours and pay suck "
good,Eficiente. Amable.servicial responsable.con mi horario
good,This place is a joke. No room for advancement. No hours. Management talks about everyone. The only great part about the job was helping the customers.
good,the associate atmosphere is good. they ban together as a team. Burlington has pot luck lunches and fun activities on certain days on the month. associate recognition wall too.
good,I would start right away by putting the racks out and hanging the clothes and making sure it was in the right place for the customers to see and being able to buy the product.
good,It's an ok place if u just want 2 to 3 days a week.if ur looking for a lot of hours they give u an discount they will throw u on the Register when ur not ready.likd they don't care ...and u might get ahead if ur liked a lot of favortism.so basically ur just a number....
good,This is a great place to start off as a young person however as you start to age it would be stressful and hard on your back and feet. They need to take better care of the management team since they are normally older and have a family.
good,Great place to work at if you customer service jobs work was easy and the employees were helpful and friendly.Good job for someone who is in school trying to make a little extra money
good,"As a sales/merchandise clerk I opened boxes, tagged and displayed stock items.  I organized and returned stock to correct area.  I greeted customers and showed them where certain merchandise was.  The culture at Burlington was not evident and hard to recognize.  The hardest part of the job was working with management showing favoritism. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers and employee discounts."
good,"Terriable structure & customer service. There was me since of priority. Nor was there equal opportunity for all employees. Just a temporary job, that can't stay clean, nor structured when it comes to service"
good,"Putting fires away all day long."
good,Very fast paced and sometimes very hectic but overall it is your typical part time job and the employees and certain managers make it worthwhile and bearable.
good,"It’s good to work there but the management doesn’t work as a team, not everyone there likes to work as a team throughout the store. Not everyone likes to help out"
good,Burlington is an okay place to work if there was enough hours given. Have to call to see if there is work. but I love when they have their 30% discount.
good,I'm currently a new employee here and so far management has been amazing and working with me on days I need off. As well as back up payment types through the company. The most enjoyable part of the job for me is meeting new people and interacting with coworkers. The only thing about the job I have been having trouble with is the dress code because I currently don't have money to but new work clothes.
good,"Enjoyed my daily interaction with co-workers and customers. "
good,this place is an okay environment to work in if you are not planning on staying her for very long or for a first time warehouse job. They never offered advancement opportunities and the pay is not ideal for a person trying to survive. If you want to gain warehouse experience then sure this is a good place to start. But if you are looking for a permanent/ Career opportunity then this is not the place for you.
good,"What I enjoy most about working for Burlington is seeing the smile on customers faces after helping them.  My work days go by fast due to staying buisy which I very much enjoy and the workers there are kind and enjoyable people to work with.  It's nice seeing all of the different nationalities working together so well there.  The staff are very generous with food for the employees and caring.  They make sure that all of the employees are well taken care of the very best that they can.  I just don't agree with the pay that I am receiving there, the lack of benefits, and the few hours that a lot of employees can only receive unless you are available for late shifts.  Overall I say Burlington is just great for a temperary job for people."
good,Alright place to work to start off with . Suggestion is to stay there until you find something better . Great for people without responsibilities. You can’t live off the pay but you can ask for more hours when needed people always call off .
good,typical day at work  was cleaning and putting up merchandise.. and helping customers.. the workplace culture was great because it was very diverse..the best part of the job was the discount
good,"With working for Burlington's Coat Factory, you where required to do markdown such as scanning clothes to make sure of accurate pricing. Long standing hours and short breaks."
good,"you wont get called in much and you may get replaced quickly.  some people are nice some are impatient. very boring and repatative.      "
good,"Management needs to do a better job, good employees are overworked, low low compensation much less than other retail stores, small employee discount, no benefits ffor part time employees"
good,This job is more for people that does not have children. You do not get any hours of work during the week. It is the easiest job ever but you get bored because you do not get any change.
good,Overall it was a great experience. I learned a lot about retail and customer service.  I unfortunately had to leave this job due to a scheduling issue when I started school.
good,Burlington was a good place to work for the most part. I loved working retail but the managers in retail are never great. Burlington is a learn as you go type of environment but it is very easy to pick up any task there. They always gave me good hours and we could even pick up extra hours if we wanted to. There were no playing favorites there. The managers were absolutely horrible though.
good,"Very easygoing job the managers are nice but they have their favorites, and they will not work with your schedule unless you have school which sucks and hours could get cut back a lot so the only time you get a lot of hours is around Christmas."
good,"Fast paced environment, hours constantly changing up and down. Management and corporate will constantly drive metrics and place goals on you. You will definitely need to be flexible."
good,"hour aren't guaranteed, immature management. Easy work flow but they always expect more. Will provide hours to specific people. play the favoritizem game"
good,"Being patient with the customers is very important."
good,"Good for students, or working mothers. Only able to work 12- 20 hours per week. No room for advancement. Very unorganized as a whole. Not good for those wanting to grow in with a company."
good,Fast-paced environment. Busy most days. Customer Service is a must. Management is friendly with an open door policy. Registers and other sales equipment easy to use. Employees are knowledgable of product and pricing.
good,"Answering phones, standing. I learned how to use a register. Management doesn't leave thing's open in order for you to find a department you'd more so enjoy."
good,"This is a part-time job. Productive and rewarding place to work."
good,I loved my job except for the Store Manager.  I loved setting merchandise and working with customers.  I love being busy and having no down time.  It was fun to go to other stores to help also.
good,"what I learned is accounting, I like working with my co workers, a typical day at work is socializing with co workers about work new changes, doing  project but there I never enough to finish it and there is never enough co workers to help out. leaving early is a plus and not working the holidays is a also a plus."
good,I enjoyed working with Burlington but soon found out they don't train you and management doesn't hold anyone accountable so as a supervisor makes your job near impossible.
good,"It was a short time but had a good team to work with. Management team was always available and friendly. They were also very flexible, but the downfall was not enough hours."
good,"When I first worked here it was okay.  Recently corporate fired our store manager.  She sometimes a bit stern, but she was fair.  Now they hired this new guy who is a bit off the wall, he hardly smiles and is constantly angry all the time.  Customers complain about him. The funny thing is they want you to bring smiles, but they keep not giving  any of us a reason to smile."
good,Offloaded three trucks a week. Also ran the register as customers where done shopping. Working is back was a fast pace. Had to get the merchadise out as fast as possible.
good,Though youre surrounded by coworkers your job is very independent and you will be standing for long periods of time. The management doesnt really give you a training period they really just toss you int the mix on your first day.
good,The key holder's at my location are rude and back biting. They do not support the associates in anything unless they really like you. The actual managers are quite helpful to an extent.
good,"Put back merchandise from the day night before."
good,"Typical day at work is good. There are your good and bad days. I wish they had offered full time sales associates. I came in as temp for the seasonal holidays and became part time. Nobody told me. Needed more hours and wasn't paid enough, not worth the distance."
good,It was fast paced especially on holidays because not only do you have to check them out in a quick manner but also you have to ensure that they are appreciated and not just someone you want out of your line.
good,"Could give more hours, don't schedule u to work, bad attitudes from a few of the employees, they overwork you sometimes, they want you to do a lot on to of your hectic workload"
good,"It has good balanced work days but not too much growth. Overall i would have to say the job is good for those who have more on there schedule such as school, family or another part-time job."
good,Burlington is a nice store to find deals. Working there has taught me a good bit. However they need to bring more focus to their departments. If it wasn't for the signs I would've thought this was just a discount warehouse with Burlington's name on it.
good,"Receive freight and convey shipments from the shipping/receiving platform to stockroom"
good,"A typical day at work was mostly cleaning the floor and greeting customers. I learned everything you could learn while I was working here. Management was not the best, but everyone isn't perfect."
good,"i hated working there soo much. The managers sucked, little hours, unless you were full time, and just about everybody was part time there. Some employees weren't bad."
good,"but don't expect advancement and for the volume done staff was very under paid with high turnover.  A background check was done, so they said, and 2.50 months later I was fired because of my background"
good,Good work system with alot of business going on also fast pace type work. Hours there are not the best even with payroll so i would recommend this job to students.
good,"-I have learned how to be a confident and effective buyer through my training here. However, the work/life balance is lacking and the stress and hours of the job aren't manageable in maintaining a balanced life."
good,Supervisors not looking out for the employees just numbers is all they are considered no or lack of communication. A lot of favoritism sadly by some shift supervisors pic there favorites to due certain tasks.
good,"I really really enjoy working for Burlington and it's really fun especially your colleagues who are supportive and fun. Management though is a mess, they keep on telling us productivity but how can someone be productive when all the tools needed are not available to you? There is a serious problem with replenishment of stocks like hangers, sensors etc."
good,As a markdown Associate and cashier my time at Burlington was alright considering it was my first real job. The place gets extremely busy and the lines become long and impatient. When that happens our area in the front become clustered and the store is unorganized but through it all we clean up everything and make Burlington spotless in the start of a new work day. I just wish the pay was higher though.
good,Good work environment but there is a lot of security over the workers due to employees stealing but they tend to treat workers like their in jail with all of the searches. Employees are searched and watched more than employees
good,Low priced clothing; Quality clothes for a good price. Discount clothes from a good designers. Good service for a quality store.
good,do not want to leave a review at this time. store has changed since i was employed there. Management has changed several times.
good,"Normally we just put all everything out and ticketing everything too. We make tickets, put sensors, maintenance our area clean, we work with clothes, shoes, items for home, men, women."
good,"The people are probably the best part, mostly. "
good,"Good co workers, above-average pay, not bad benefits. Management   is not that committed in guiding employees to develop them into leaders. More of a ""do as I say"" thing."
good,"Poor management, Poor communication between management and employees. Huge workload, friendly staff. 2 breaks, busy holidays, and very high expectations"
good,"Fun atmosphere for a regular part-time associate. It is unfortunate that there is a very poor communication ability in management so, I suggest not applying for anything more than a regular associate. If you have a busy life and/or you are a student, bring it up during interview so as to not cause any problems in the future and keep bringing it up on a regular basis as management forgets."
good,Burlington is typically busy with not a lot of employees. I have learned to balance my day. I mostly enjoy the people I work with and try to make it an enjoyable and fun day.
good,The job Is honestly really easy and quiet enjoyable! The only issue Is the poor hours and the manager isn't too understanding. Other than that the people are great and so Is the service.
good,"No job security just the same thing every day "
good,"Started working late mid/late August of 2016 part time (after applying for full time position)."
good,A typical day at Burlington is very busy. My co-workers make the best of it. They are very fun people to be around. I learned a lot about customer service. The only bad thing about working there is that the managers expect too much in such little bit of time.
good,"Working here was enjoyable during the holiday season, however business slows down a lot afterwards causing hours to be reduced."
good,"•	Support sales plan by maintaining appropriate inventory levels throughout the company’s 500-plus doors "
good,"Good hours, decent pay. Growth is available in this company. Many shifts to chose from so good work/life balance. Management tends to change hand a lot here though."
good,When I begin to work for this company was great! As the months went on things began to go down the drain. The mangement begin to ask private life questions. They wouldn't cooperate with things that were going on our personal life. The store manger catered to certain people in the store.
good,"Good experience, yet not lot of hours assigned and with a very changing schedule.  Not much opportunity to growth, even when solicited.  On the other hand, the store environment is very likable and the merchandise is of very good quality at a very friendly cost."
good,Management needs to communicate better with employees and stop the rift raft that goes on behind there backs.  Also corporate tells the stores how to run the business but don't know what is good for each store.
good,"The managers were okay, but they were more about constantly hiring more people rather than keeping the employees they had."
good,A typical day at burlington consists of long lines a mixture of satisfied and angry customers. There will always be tons of returns  but the people I work with are amazing.
good,"Even management, who are usually great, don't make enough money. The atmosphere is very positive, easy going in most cases, and really fun. They have great employee recognition programs, awesome discounts for employees during holidays, however, the hours are not consistent."
good,"I have spent most of my working years at Burlington which I do enjoy. However, I have been hindered from certain positions I feel I qualify for. I am looking for a company where I can continue to utilize my skills in customer service."
good,I enjoyed working with my co-workers. Working at Burlington was my first retail job ever and it taught me a lot. Also taught me how to deal with customers and multitask.
good,The management team made it difficult to advance in the company. The hours were too long and at times the work was quite hard.
good,"Working in Receiving is not enjoyable.The company only pays you min wage which is $8.05, You have to get a 2nd job because of their  pay but atleast you get paid every Friday"
good,"When I first started at Burlington I really enjoyed it. I got good hours, was working a deparment I liked, and had great co workers. Then they started hiring more and more workers to where part time hours got cut from 16-24 hours to anywhere from 6-16 (if you were lucky) . Every one was complaining about this but nothing changed. The manager to say the least isn't the nicest, and makes you feel like you have no idea what you're doing, or that you just arent good enough. The full time workers have great benefits, but full time positions are almost impossible to obtain due to the fact they only have 5 or 6 positions and they are all filled. And they are very unorganized. Over all I would not reccomend this job."
good,"When  first started the job it was fun and a learning experience because i have never worked in a store that big before. Towards the end management hired on a bunch of new people and gave them the hours and cut the whole staffs hours to compensate the new hires. That is another reason i stopped working for them, when they did that literally ever body complained but nothing was done. I would not recommend this job to anyone who is trying to raise a family."
good,"As stated before management works well with your schedule, however they do not provide many hours to their employees. Work hours are short."
good,"I've been working there for almost a year.  I started out as a cashier but I switched to a flow team member.  You just get tired of doing the same everyday and dealing with really rude customers. The back is pretty easy. The work I do I believe should be payed way better.  You have a certain time frame no matter what,  so your literally are moving as fast as you possibly can,  and if you don't you do get called out and if your just not fast enough they will just move out from the back or give you less hours until you quit.  Hours in the back suck you can't live off it they get better doing Christmas time. My store manager is awesome and so are the assistant managers.  My direct supervisor needs more direction and clarification to make our life easier and efficient."
good,Burlington is a very strict workplace. Barely receive hours in the week. Co workers were very nice. Hardest part of the job was sharing equipment. The most  enjoyable part is interacting with the customers
good,A typical day of work consisted of restocking every package and making sure they have the right number of merchandise inside. Had to finish up the 1st shift work they didn't get to. The co-workers were pretty serious and only complained about their feet hurting and no short breaks. the hardest part of the job was sanding for more than 6 hours without a break
good,"Nice management, awesome co-workers, a great place to be if you like moving a lot. The hardest part of the job is the schedule is not always posted on time in the break room and the schedule often changes. The most enjoyable part of the job is the co-workers, everyone is friendly and working is fun when you have awesome co-workers to work with."
good,"Easy job, but no opportunities to move up in workplace. The managers are easy going. Supervisors seem better... Little amount of hours."
good,"liked working with customers and co-workers, a lot to learn if your new."
good,"A typical day at work is fast paced. I assist customers with any questions they may have. I market merchandise to appeal to the needs of the customers. I answer phones calls from customers wanting assistance for example I answer any questions they have about a product. I perform tasks such as putting away returns, clean up any items dropped on the floor and arrange products to keep the appearance of my department organized and neatly placed. We are short staffed at the moment therefore I have to help with price checks in other departments also run cash register to keep the lines flowing quickly. Our management team consists of four different mangers that run their own sections of the store. their personalities differ. Overall I am satisfied with the manger that is over my department she is always willing to listen to any concerns I may have, any questions I may have are answered to the best of her knowledge. My co workers are always eager to help with anything that is asked of them. I think the hardest part of my job would have to be time management due to the fact I am being pulled from my department to help elsewhere therefore making it a challenge for me to complete the tasks I need to perform, besides the customer service aspect of my job. I wish there where more hours in my work day sometimes I feel 8 1/2 hours is not enough. I would have to say the most enjoyable part of my job is dealing with the customers. I get a lot of fulfillment in seeing a smiling face knowing I did my best to assist them in everyway I can think of. Customer interaction is definitely my favorite"
good,"The hours were not to my liking. Noticed that some employees had a better pull with the managers. The pay was ok, but should have been more. I liked that my family and i could recieve discounts on items."
good,A typical day for working at Burlington for me as the accountant would start around 7 am. I would count the safe and the tills form the night before and prep the front end of the store for the start of the day. During the day I would balance the night cash for the bank drop and other paper work that is needed for the office.
good,"I love working for Burlington. The pay is 8.75 an hour and the job is not really stressful however management can be a pain, I would suggest as a part time because Burlington cut many hours frequently."
good,"I learned new things day by day with this company management is great co-workers are great good teamwork"
good,"They were undergoing new management and had conflicting task assignments . I would often get told to do one thing by my department supervisor and then would get attitude from the merchandise manager about another task i should have been doing. Terrible communication between management, good people just terrible leadership skills. Expected associates to crack down on theft but had a policy against it..?"
good,"Things were all good because it was a new store until we started making and passing sale goals. Now its chaos."
good,Lack of empowerment throughout company. If you are not a yes sir/mam person.... Not a company that wants you to think for yourself
good,"It is one of the jobs where you get hired and get comfortable easily. If you are a cashier, it is the easiest job. They obviously care if you clock in on time but they lag about your clocking out on time. Usual shifts end 15-30 mins after your intended time to clock out. We have a one line process with gets some customers aggravated but it moves a lot faster then expected with 2-5 registers open. Co-workers are easy to get along with and very open to each other."
good,I believe under proper circumstances this could have been a very promising position with a prosperous future. i am grateful for the experience and knowledge that i gained.
good,When I walk thru the door safety for the customers and employees are number 1. They have us do so much paper work and auditing that there's no eyes on the floor. But we do the best we can
good,"I really enjoyed the individuals I worked with.  However, I did not approve of the low wages and the refusal to work with certain people with their scheduling needs."
good,I am a customer service cashier who deals with different obstacles everyday. They range from simple returns to outrages customers. I have to make decisions on if discounts are appropriate for the damage merchandise. I have to deal with layaways and make sure they are properly placed. Management are very unorganized but they are helpful to an extent.
good,"While I love the management team I have worked for with Burlington, the company overall has out-dated practices, and cares little for more than their bottom line."
good,Its good working at Burlington Coat Factory because its great hours for me being that I'm currently enrolled in school.
good,"A typical day at Burlington for me would be also very busy, especially with the holiday season. There was a lot of days were I rarely would take a break because it would be so busy, the best part about that was because we were always busy my shift would go by fast. I enjoyed everyone that I worked with and was kind of sad when I left because I was only seasonal and I had made some good friends there."
good,"Typical day was full of surprises and changes never the same thing twice.  Most of the people i work with were great, liked the fast pace nut seemed to be spining wheels in the dirt on alot of things."
good,Change of mangement is consistent the store itself is said to be shutting down . lack of hours . There is no advancement in this certain Burlington so becoming a manager is out of the question. There barley any full time employees there because they don't want to give benefits. This is coming out of there own mouth. Not mine. But one thing i will say is the mangement was honest with me and for that i will always respect them for
good,I learned many skills and how to properly handle stress while working here. I enjoyed working with my coworkers as well.
good,Great people and a decent company but  the pay and lack of benefits are not suitable. This is a good job but not a good career.
good,"A typical day at work usually consists of the team startup meeting to get all associates up to date on product coming in the door, the amount of product that needed to be received before leaving and any goals that management wanted completed. In my time working at this warehouse, i learned how to use multiple warehouse computer programs to efficiently complete all tasks that are asked of me. The hardest part of the job would be favoritism. There was no room for growth if you were not considered to be a ""favorite"" amongst management and HR. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the amazing associates that you meet on a daily basis."
good,"Customer service, sales floor in baby depot, and help set up the store for grand opening."
good,overall a very good company to work for. I wfriendill recommend it to a
good,"it is a wonderful place to work in retail. Its a multi race environment. I learned many skills patience, customer service and working in a fast pace."
good,"A typical day of work would be to greet all the customers and make sure it is nice and fast check out. I learn about the register and to double check at all times. for example, when counting money because the newer bills tend to stick. Management wasn't all to good they would take they anger out on you no matter out you did. the hardest thing working at Burlington was to not let what management and the customers say to you get to you. the most enjoyable part of work at Burlington when you clock out and good home."
good,"This job is okay. I work my absolute hardest but i am completely under paid for the amount of work that i do. Not only does it not interest me, but i am looked down upon there."
good,"The inside management is very efficient they help you a lot, corperate however is a little distant ."
good,At this specific store was not for someone that likes structure. I was not trained properly. Schedules were made the day before the week started. Half way through the week the schedule would be changed and management would not inform you of the change. I was told that I could play on my phone as long as if a customer came to me I set it down. The employees were nice. It was just an unorganized clusterfudge. :\
good,"I loved my co workers and some managers. I liked the customer service we provided. I worked as a fitting room attendant, sales associate, and worked in receiving a couple times."
good,"Some of the co-workers were not so friendly."
good,I enjoyed my short time at this job except for being looked at as a number and not a person by one manager.
good,"A fun place to work no place for advancement management are sometimes show no respect and regards to employees  a place to meet wonderful co workers a time consuming job multitask, when its time to go home end of shift"
good,"average nine hour day, pretty smooth and coordinated, I learned to become a true team lead and view a lot of different situations as a leader. got to know 96% of my coworkers in my department individually, to have a better understanding of their daily lives, we do spend more time without co workers and our family's at home, we have to make the best of it. and with that comes the hardest part of the job have too lead a physically and mentally team to be a 100% when going through this. but after all the hours and work, going home knowing I just received all those good to the store makes me feel proud"
good,"The day can be tiring and demanding, but it can also be fun based on who you work with."
good,"I really don't like this job, im really not enjoying working at this workplace"
good,It's a good first job but the pay is horrible for the work and the managers are a little unprofessional.
good,"A typical day involves using a Telzon gun to mark merchandise down, It's fairly easy once you get used to it and every week you are in a different area although sometimes if there is no markdowns for the week you may end up sensoring the clothes in receiving. Best part of the job learning to do something new and meeting new people."
good,"This is a high volume retail store. I am on my feet my entire shift from servicing customers at the customer service desk to, stocking the floor, recovery, customer service on the selling floor and processing new merchandise received that day. My co-workers work just as hard and are great to work with. The hardest part of the job, is that it is very physical and am usually pretty exhausted at the end of a shift. I have learned more about customer service and the retail industry through my experience here, the management and my co-workers."
good,"Started out as a good place to work. but the lack of employees, it placed people that weren't hired for that position, were forced to work in the position..  lack of good hours and pay. some employees were rude as well as a lot of customers.. the store wasn't always clean and never wanted to use the restrooms."
good,I appreciate this job for the experience i acquired while being an employee.
good,"A typical day there was as normal as any other retail store,greet customers picked up after customers,i learned how to color code my clothes,and give the customer what they want ask for,I think the Management could have been better in the way they managed their employees.my co-workers were pleasant to work with ,cause they understood the meaning of team work.the hardest part was locating misplaced items.the most enjoyable was giving the customers what they wanted,and seeing them smile as they left the building."
good,"Checking out customers returns, exchanges, lay a ways, and regular purchases. I gained more communication working here with co-workers and customers also."
good,"working at Burlington I learned to work with different groups of people, from different places. My co-workers all loved me because I was always willing to help others and kept a positive attitude. the most enjoyable part of my job was greeting the customers."
good,"I ran a 11 millon dollar store with a team of 65 employees for the last 7 years.. I Managed all the phases of the stores operations and hiring. Drive sales reults, managed the customer service desk and all cashiers. Manged the overall execution of all operations and receiving SOP.. Coach, train and develop team to deliver an outstanding shopping experience in a highly professional way.. I managed the overall scheduling process, maintaining integrity of all scheduling functions and ensure schedules and payroll budgets are compliant with company standards.  "
good,"In the morning check the e-mail to find out how many boxes of merchandise we are receiving."
good,Ok place.  Not great pay.  Lots of back stabbing.  A few nice people.
good,fun experience job.
good,"A typical day at Burlington varies. The economy and retail aren't the same as they use to be ten years ago. Most stores were fully staffed and management assisted as much as they can. Now, the sales floors are stripped to the bone, while management assumes miracles can be performed."
good,"Picking up after customers, making sure everything was hung up and in the correct department."
good,"Working in a retail enviroment, assisting customers. Team work with empployees. Supervising Cashiers with any help. Handle Cash sales."
good,i enjoyed my time there. burlington is a great producitve enviromernt
good,"I worked a lot more than was scheduled, and the store manager was unreasonable to work with 90% of the time."
good,"I enjoy helping customer and ensuring the lines move quickly while never lacking in customer service. Management was always changing, but the your coworker are very encouraging. The pay was lacking but the job was enjoyable."
good,They expect you to work and work only with no outside job. I was young when i had this job and probably not the best place for that age group to work. Management was very untrustworthy and not quick to reconize you for your hard work. The best part about that job was the boss was never there so i got to do things on my own tirms.
good,"Ok place to work, but management has their favorites. and all my other rating stem from that."
good,"On a typical day I would receive truck orders that contained clothing merchandise. I had to sort, sensor , tag and organize merchandise. I learned the importance of organization in the workplace. I had a great supervisor and my co-workers were very cool people. There was not a hard part to the job it, it was a fun experience"
good,"This place felt bland and there was no real energy or connection between all the workers. It felt like everyone felt obligated to work for money and that not really did they want to work because they actually kinda liked the company. There was one good manager but, the other two assistant managers were very bossy and would overload certain people with too many tasks which just was not reasonable. However i can not compalin to much because a job is a job however my main issue is the basic fact that it was such a minimum pay of $7.25 and that you didnt receive to many hours. Besides that and the very dull bland work enviroment I would have to say it was a decent retail job."
good,"typical day at work, i stand there and sensor clothes for 5 hours and go home. I've learned how to do my job quickly and efficiently, and to not look at the clock too often. Managment is better than a lot of places, but could be better. My co-workers are cool, but gossip a bit too much for my liking. Hardest part of my job is not getting paid enough. the most enjoyable part of my job is being able to listen to my own music."
good,retrieve any products to be put out for display and set up displays; some customer service and cash register. manager was great to work for/with.
good,"Fun place to work. Interesting customer base. Typical day at work will be open store, count safe, check emails, have morning meeting with sales and customer service numbers. The hardest part of the job was having enough staff and management being on the same page and communicating to the staff. The most enjoyable part of the job was satisfying the customer base."
good,"True team work in all that the was done in the store. Operations of the store entailed checks and balances. Add sets and any in store promotions. Receiving daily merchandise, equipment maintiance, scheduling,managing of 32 associates, customer service issues, lay-a-way program. responsable for opening,and closing of store. Any alarm calls at middle of night."
good,"A typical day at work was busy and interesting. I learned just how important a company's sales and loss of valuables/goods affect payroll. Management for the most part was very communicative and understanding. My co-workers definitely helped the day go by quickly. The hardest part of the job ere the long hours I had to do, due to shortage of employees. The most enjoyable part of the job was my job being in loss prevention was fun to me."
good,managing up to 500 locations at any given time.Rewarding sometimes when a store acknowledges you and your hard work for keep the location up and running.
good,It is a good work experience. It expanded my knowledge in retail and merchandising new items.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of the usual stocking of the sales floor, and re- organizing the stock room. I can't say I learned anything new because I previously had experience in a stock room environment. My co- workers were friendly people and steady workers. The hardest part of the job was keeping the small isles clear for the customers while still trying to get my job done. The most enjoyable part of the job was being comfortable doing something I knew I was good at."
good,"The co-workers are really great. The hardest part of the job I would say are would be the customers. Sometimes, because no matter what you did to help them they felt like it was never enough. Those customers are sometimes the hardest to please."
good,Burlington is a great place to work.I enjoy working and giving excellent customer service and meeting new people.
good,"BCF, is a ok please to work. When I was there the company benefits was not that good, work life balance was not that good. Also compensation was not all that good."
good,"There were good hours here, but my store location in Whittier, CA. had scheduled me 39 hrs. a week at one point, but kept me overtime on average about 49 hours a week because I was taking care of the Accessories Dept. by myself - they scheduled me one hour less than is considered full-time so that I would not be eligible for benefits, and they also did not acknowledge my added work responsibilities in my job title or by raise (I was still considered a ""store clerk""), which is why I left."
good,Not a good place to make a career. Highly stressful and demanding with little compensation nor recognition
good,"Management could be alot better, The pay rate could be alot better, other than that my fellow associates are awesome And work really hard to keep the store cleaned and maintained"
good,"CONS:"
good,My job is only part time at Burlington.Do to lack of work .They hardest part is working on the register by yourself and only get 2 days on schedule because the labor is high.
good,"Not a good team work place, Talk down to you"
good,It was poorly managed and the employees get overworked with minimum pay. On the plus side you'll have hours because of the really long shifts and people leaving the job
good,"I work in recieving where I lead teams to process merchandise, help flow merchandise and help count inventory for the store.. I also help with controlling payroll for my staff"
good,co-workers were lazy and slow.  they complained or just stood around most of their shift.  took longer breaks than necessary and more breaks than needed for a short shift.
good,They expect us to do things outside of our role. They just expect us to do a lot. Not a lot of people so always the customers are angry. Very flexible hours as long as you tell them two three days in advance they will find someone to take your ship.
good,"I was hired for seasonal and worked a lot of hours around the holiday. Once the holidays were over the hours were only 12 a week. I enjoyed working with some people there. However, I disagree with management. There is one good manager still there but things need to change there. The pay and benefits are low and limited. Its a good “side” job."
good,We start each morning processing all the product we recieved by truck. We then start putting out the products on the shelves usually before we open for the day.
good,"In the beginning it used to be a fun workplace, but the pass few years not so much. I learned that upper management does not take care of their employees. The work place culture is very stressful. The hardest part of the job is keeping a smile on my face.  The most enjoyable part is when i am given time to do my actual job."
good,"Burlington   is a fine company, depending what location your working at, every store have there managers that is not always working by the company policy, and that makes the workplace very hard to do the task, its a lot of favortism,"
good,Everyday was similar but different cus certain people had different days and shifts so it was interesting. But you could be put in the back of the store to work and on the floor which was two different work spaces.
good,Burlington is a job for young adults between the age of 16-22. The compensation is not a direct correlation with the work. The best part about the company is when they offered all employees a 25% discount.
good,"The interview was pretty easy. I was asked about my past retail experience, if I would go out of my way to help customers, how well I work with others, my availability and when I would be able to start. "
good,They always forget to tell you when you can get your 15 min or lunch. You are stressed out when there are many people in line and all the registers are full with backup cashiers so u got to hurry up to get the line down and them once you start sweating from all the fast movements it doesn’t get any better than when the ac is no good. We are getting paid $12 an hour and get around 25 hours or less a week
good,Some managers play favorites and nothing’s ever where it’s supposed to be and the raises suck . And the hours vary and  they will give you 40 hours one week and 10 the next and no warnings
good,"I like my job very much, I’m a part time employee 12hrs weekly, my team are all part time employees the problem is the hours are not justly given, some have 30-38 hrs the same week that others have 12 or even less."
good,"In a typical morning shift, markdown merchandise. These shifts are nice because the store is nice and quiet and you can work at your own pace."
good,"Burlington is a great place to work, but the drama is a problem between associates and they string you along with promises if you're good so you stay."
good,"While I was promised 30 hours a week, I'll be lucky to get 15."
good,"I have been working in Burlington for more than a year, part-time.  My co-workers are great to talk to and the managers are always there to listen if you need something.  I just wish there are more hours for the employees."
good,"It was a great retail experience.  The only part i didn't like was the fact that they didn't give anyone full time position.  They only offer part time, but when they needed someone to stay they forced you"
good,I have learned soooo much from working with Burlington Stores ! I was such a bitter sweet job . i had move up the ladder fairly quickly which i enjoy and having a well rounded management team was awesome
good,"It was an ok work experience. There were ups and downs but overall and ok job. The management was not the best, and it was hard to take days off even for sick days."
good,"I left Burlington to relocate to Quincy area. Manager was terrible but overall it was a decent place to work. They also had terrific health insurance , 401 K and vacation and sick time."
good,It’s a great place to work at. I met a lot of people and I love my coworkers. I love working Burlington but they play with the schedule and I need some more consistent and better pay. They start you off at 9.50 an hour.
good,"I found the District management team to be disorganized and communication poor.  We had conflicting direction on merchandising, staffing, promotions and company policy.  Each manager would come in  and critique the store and people differently."
good,"As a cashier, you do end up standing in a single spot for long periods of time without mats so be sure to wear comfortable shoes. The order that takebacks would organized in was very good, it was a good system. The manager on duty would pace back and forth between the cashiers to make sure everything is going well. There are some wild customers, and there were multiple times I was made uncomfortable by customers hitting on me, but some customers were really nice and fun to see when they'd return to shop more."
good,"Dan muy pocas horas de trabajo, depender de la llegada de un camión para trabajar brinda un ambiente de inestabilidad"
good,I love working with people but sometime in retail it can get very hectic.  I really enjoy the customer service department you. get to meet alor of people
good,"Management teams very from store to store, so if you are lucky enough to get a good store manager, your entire store will thrive.  If your leader is not so good, you won't find yourself happy to be there.As associates you have to figure out a way to create a team culture.  Not all management teams buy into that concept."
good,I would only recommend temporary job. Not Paid enough to live. I think its a good job for someones first. Or to have some extra money during the holidays. If you want to work here i suggest having a second job.
good,"Fast paste challenging but at times fun. "
good,This is a great first job experience if someone is looking to make some money who is just out of high school or if anyone needs just a little extra income.
good,"While Burlington was the retail company I've ever worked for, I would describe it as a typical retail job/company. The best part of the job was a discount I got through my Cell Phone provider"
good,"when i first started working here the company was privately owned and the compensation and benefits were not bad over the years the company was bought out by larger corporate conglomerate company know for down sizing, they no longer hire full time  and almost all new hire are at part time minimum wage usually getting only 12hrs a week with the possibility of be called in when they have call off to pick up hours because of this they have a very high turn over rate and the seasoned employees pull most of the weight and are constantly having to help new hires they do not give enough hours to properly train new associates and a lot weight is put on the few full time associates that remain , they focus on satisfaction surveys and theft for your raises and under staff constantly they will cut your hours in the middle of the week after you have already planned accordingly even call you off as your getting ready for work corporate structure ensures that only the upper management and ceo,coo, and corprate office staff are compensated well beyond there fair share while leaving  employees struggling  with no ability to even meet the cost to live in the area they work"
good,"A typical day at work was not knowing what was going to come next, being customers or employees. The manager would make you feel very unintelligent when giving you a task. The most enjoyable part was break time, you got away for a good 30 minutes. The hardest part of the job was dealing with coworkers who talk about you behind your back and being talked down to by the manager."
good,"Management was great .co-workers got along fine,there was always something to do or help out with and discounts were good and the lay away plan was exceptional."
good,There is no loyalty here! I worked for then for about 5 months I was loved by the other LP and I got fired because a supervising cashier gave me back more change then I was suppose to get on a return I made without a receipt and she got to keep her job I felt like it was a setup and if you think about it she could be doing that with friends and family but also at times the don't have many cashier's on the clock and one of the LP guys in a wheelchair sleeps and let's people walk out the door with unpaid items people act like they like you when they are out to make themselves look good for management . Don't believe go ahead and apply and a few months after working there you'll be writing a review saying something similar.
good,days can be long. If you work alone a lot of pressure is put on you for both LP and admin tasks. No direct supervisor but managers at my store always wanted me to do tasks that are not my job.
good,My overall experience was 1 to 2 years and I was a rehire the second time around. But if the store is slow with sales this will not give you any hours
good,"- a typical day at work included waking up early and stocking"
good,Working at Burlington is great for anyone looking at part-time positions or who are barely starting out with jobs. They have different working shifts as well as new techniques to teach new employees how to advance in certain areas.
good,"Working for Burlington is stressful. Most of the time everything will be fast pace,and employees will have to learn quick. Moving on is a option i have to do because i feel advancement is very slim."
good,"Poor management supervisors don’t communicate well with employees, low pay and not enough work hours this job is for a side job or someone looking for extra money"
good,"Overall good first job, It taught me information I needed to know and gave me the experience I needed. I was hired for the Christmas season and had minimal hours."
good,Its a fast pace environment they want you to be quick on your feet and get customers out fast  some days will be ruff and some days will be good  the hours are some time bad depending on what we make a week some people will get more hours then others
good,"The place played a role for me during a time of my life, but they put too much hours in weekend and less during week days, The paid is the minimum of the state."
good,the most enjoyable part of the job were the customers.  I met some really great people working at Burlington Coat factory.  I was there for seasonal help so I interacted with ALOT of different types of people.
good,"Burlington seems to be a store that shows itself to be above your usual minimum wage retail job, but in reality, it doesn't place much higher. Hours are given sporadically, management is indecisive at times, and tasks given usually exceed the time you have."
good,"work load is not consistance i have learned a lot about my work and still learning it,s a lot to take in, but i,m welling to keep learning the system. I just do as i,m told I dont know about managment other than following orders. Make sure i,ve heard them correctly. Most of the workers are young and learning how to be responsable.Most seem to get along. The hardest part of the job is the work invirment it,s a old building that need,s to be restructerd and cleaned up.I,ts hard to do a great job when you are not given proper setting and implament,s to work with. The most injoyable part of the job is the oppertunity to make a dif ferance know matter the challage with a good attitude. I,m greatfull for the oppertunity to work for your company. I,m 79 years young and i do my, that's what i get paid for and nothing else.  Thank you for the oppertunity."
good,"it wasn't bad when I first started out then management got worse and the other employees started slacking off on their jobs,  took to long at lunch or break would not watch time.   Some employees never showed up for work or  some just would call in with  excuses all the time so I had a lot of work to do before I could leave so I got frustrated and ended up quitting."
good,"I have overall joined my job at Burlington and I applied as a seasonal employee and then offered a part time position and at first it was fun and I never really had a problem with anything there. But I tried calling in one time because i was sick and keep in mind I've only done it a handful of times and the manager on duty told me just take some medicine and be ready to work. So anyone wanting to work there its not bad for a job, you get paid weekly and a double discount every now and then but be aware of the way you get treated."
good,Was promised more hours than given. Poor management in some areas and lack of communication between managers and employees. No enough money coming in from the job to fit my needs.
good,"There part time is super part time  you may work 1week no work the next week part time there is basically like you on call."
good,It's okay I feel like the employees are underpaid for what they are requiring but other than that it's a pretty chill environment if you love working with others
good,There's always something going on in the store. Whether it's a customer with a hard request or it's the mess that the employees are always stuck to clean at the end of the day. But that's normal for Burlington.
good,Besides making new friends the management was bad most of them were rude and some didn't know what they were doing they would promote people that slacked off
good,"Pros"
good,"I enjoyed working here. My hours were somewhat consistent. I enjoyed working with my coworkers, they made it more fun. The customers here normally sweet but sometimes you deal with ignorance. I would recommend cashier position unless you want to be on the floor picking up clothes for a long time."
good,"It was an interesting place to work. First time working at a clothing store. Depending on the department you're working in and the manager your under, you can advance but it is a major retail company. Pay and hours are so-so. Coworkers are decent for the most part. A lot of young employees. Decent for part-time students, flexible and understanding of personal life. I'd recommend this job to people for quick money."
good,Can get very busy and stressful at Christmastime and back to school shopping when most people are most apt to be clothes shopping. The need to pay attention to accuracy of the individual transactions and to be speedy so customers have a short wait in line makes the day go by at an exhaustingly fast pace.
good,The people were cool. First job so I didn't know what to expect but I can't complain. The customers were always rude though. Stayed open really late. sometimes we wouldn't get out until after 11
good,"Sometimes when there are a lot of customers, it gets a little hectic, but other than that, it's a pretty laid back work environment with friendly staff."
good,"I come in the morning to pick up my go backs for my department, do that and clean it for a beeter shopping experience. After i m done with doing that i make tickets for the clothes that dont have any tickets. I also try to take out my merchanise from the stock room make sure its nice and filled for the customers. I am also a backup cashier."
good,Burlington Coat Factory stores has the best products that money could buy but the employees an the manager where I worked were rude disrespectful an unprofessional.
good,I thoroughly enjoyed the time I spent at Burlington.  If you work hard they will notice and you will get promoted.  They definitely like to promote from within.  They struggle to find quality long term employees.
good,"it was an ok job, you get promoted kind of quick if they see you doing your job. fast pace and easy to catch onto new task. just watch yourself because they are always watching you."
good,"I feel like it was a good place to work at. I was third shift everything was always smooth. it was other shift that were the problem. The company would allow second shift to stay on busy days, and it would mess up work flow for third shift. Beside that all was good."
good,"I love the atmosphere, Management team are great.  You definitely learned a lot in this company. the pay is good and benefits are good too, but the working hours are long especially for management and the we are not allowed to take time off during holidays. I understand its the time of more business but it will be great if we could alternate holidays so we can be we our families."
good,"Working there was fun because you were always busy but the management was always on your back for things you didnt do, which caused the workplace to be more stressful and not enjoyable to go to everyday"
good,"I may have just picked the wrong store, but one of my managers was drunk at work a lot, and the head manager sexually harassed female employees. HR didn't have anything to say when these were reported by employees."
good,"i have learned how to be more organized fashion tips how to spend money wisely"
good,"Terrible pay, long hours. Too much work for too few people. Management tried their best I guess. The most enjoyable part were the holiday discounts. I hope they improve."
good,Burlington has a great variety of items and clothing. You get a discount at Burlington when you're an employee and sometimes an extra discount on certain weekends.
good,"i'm still currently employed but plan to find a better paying job but it's good for someone who doesn't pay bills because they still live w/parents, anyone else would have to have a second job.  I'm only getting decent hours due to peak season even though when I got hired I was told it'll be Mon-Fri 6 AM - 2 PM and now I'm learning that I'll probably only average out 12 hrs per week once the season is over."
good,Your hours are never consistent and management wasn't really looking out for the employees that actually wanted to work there. It was a good job for a 1st or second job. Co-workers were nice and you do develop a family type bond. However you can't really pay the bill with this job.
good,Decent pay. Good discounts. Flexible schedule. Both fast and slow pace to keep good work balance. Not best management but good enough for starters or someone who likes retail. Store prices are awesome. Diverse place to work.
good,The position was an entry level position with limited growth. Was offered a position in my field that showed greater potential of advancement. Would consider for part time opportunities.
good,Pleasant place to work as a temporary job. Wouldn't want to work here permanently. Management can sometimes be unpredictable. It's nice that the work tends to be varied.
good,"Excellent place to work for a limited period of time; however, some employees with excellent customer service skills did appear to have a good chance of getting promoted."
good,"Team work was fair, busy environment. I enjoyed helping customers with their needs. I put up, and turn in laways, distribute merchandise. Hardest part of the job was keeping sales floor tidy all the time during a rush of customers. Most enjoyable time i had their was seeing a pleased face helping the customers, working with coworkers to complete closing duties. Manager at the time was very rude,and  horrible with scheduling. I learned the value of customer service and  the importance and outcome of helping a customer and the duties of performing beyond satisfactory customer service."
good,"As a summer job I only worked for 2 months. I could have stayed, but I was concentrating on getting out of high school. IT was a decent work environment. My duties were re-stocking as well as engaging the customer to see if I could be of assistance."
good,"Hours were low, didnt really work everyday its good for part time and school students ... there wasnt Any chance for advancement but was a pretty easy job"
good,a typical work day consists of doing the same thing . when it is slow you do nothing but sort the colorful nubs from the hangers. barely can socialize with your coworkers but the css talk among each other and sometimes ignore you when you need help or have a question asked by a customer.
good,"Go in at 6 am, work the load, get it out on the floor"
good,"- a typical work day at is fun calm relaxing "
good,"For this job, I was in charge of dressing rooms and keeping the floor clean. After a little while, I began working on the register. I did not work here very long due to the fact that I was unable to have the availability and because they did not tell me my schedule for the following week."
good,the job was ok cashiering was ok the return policy caused a lot of customer service problems I'm glad that it has since been changed. The managers were pretty nice.
good,They don't give you the tools you need to succeed. All the equipment from the registers to the computers to the phones always break. Its all outdated and very frustrating.
good,"An average part time job with few bumps along the way. Coworkers and managers were easy and pleasant to work with. As per the norm, corporate intervention interrupted the normal work flow and made life a little bit harder."
good,It was a typical cashier job. It pays minimum wage and is a part time job. I do like it pays weekly. I do not like the timing of the breaks if you even get a break.
good,It's was a  cool job I was in shipping I worked hard for awhile I liked it good people friendly environment  I was able to get alot of hours in and good pay
good,This company had a nice discount and workable hours for people with children. Hours were often cut so most would need other jobs. The culture was pretty decent.
good,"each day varies, it could be a busy day or quiet day. Management is fair, easy to go to if you have any problems. Workplace is ok, work can be fun but like every job it has its momments"
good,"It was an okay company to work for. The supervisor that hired me at the time was very nice. He was willing to work around my school schedule, which allowed me to work and still stay in school. I enjoyed working with the customers that needed assistance in the store."
good,"cashing out costumers, i learned that you can grow with a company like burlington, learned to be a team player,also learned alot about the business in rertail."
good,"I would have to say  Burlington is your typical clothing store , I am in the back tagging clothes most of the time and? or helping other associates with the floor."
good,"I Learned to not take things personal when customers get upset , I try to keep them satisfied and want to come back to the store. The Management is moderate, could be better. Don't give enough hours."
good,Burlington coat factory provides a very fun and social working environment for its employees. Also their prices are very affordable for both customers and employees. I enjoyed my time spent at Burlington coat factory and would love another opportunity to work for this company again.
good,It was ok working here but they gave you short breaks and didn't  work with my personal schedule and my children. The front end wasn't in order. The backroom layaway area was cluttered making it hard to find people's layaway. The elevator was broke so you had to carry heavy layaway packages down the stairs.
good,"As a layaway associate I was in charge of 1000+ layaways along with 2 other associates, work was very routine like. On slow days we would go to other departments and help other departments. I would normally get 6 to 7 hours a day and get 30 minute breaks."
good,"It was a busy workplace, we had to help a diverse range of customers which was amazing. We could've had better management, they sometimes could've helped us more with keeping the store organized"
good,There is never the same day at Burlington. Some days are bad and some days are worst. Rarely any goods days and when there are you will typically get behind because that was a good day.
good,"Always on your feet."
good,they expect you to work like a machine underpaid not enough hands for a full team they expect you to do a job with only 5 people when you need 8 people to do the job in the right amount of time.
good,"•	Responsible for taking money in the form of cash, check, or credit card patrons in exchange for services and goods"
good,"It was definitely an unforgettable experience after high school. Being that this was my first job it taught me a lot about responsibility and communication. The management had its downside, but there was good as far as respect goes. My co workers were amazing and I still keep in touch with some today. The hardest part was when everyone wouldn't give their full potential. The most enjoyable was learning about routines, and working as a whole."
good,Burlington Is a very unproductive and unorganized company that shows a lack of concern and appreciation for its hard working and dependable employees.
good,enjoy working with the people i work with. breaking down trucks is alittle busy. but you are not offered enough hours to make a living
good,"Easy work place, cool environment, hard working individuals . i have experience in numerous departments in warehouse. Trouble, flat breakdown,  and fragile"
good,"Markdown team only gets two days a week... period. My first day as a Markdown Team member my manager said to me "" your still on that?"". Well yeah... I'm the only one marking down All the men's dress shirts and underwater one at a time. Then, you only get 30 minutes for lunch, which was suppose to be at 12pm but I didn't get until 2:0 clock. Then your suppose to have 2 15 minute breaks , I got one which was almost at the same time my shift ended. I walked out after my day ended. I was told I was full time 5 days a week at my interview. Lies."
good,"I was a part of the new hires for the grand opening for one of Burlington stores. It can be challenging at times. It was very productive, there was always something needed to be done. The workload never ends."
good,I have been at burlington for a month now as a cashier. The pay is awful but I am promised a raise after 6 months. Easy job but can be really busy on weekends and sometimes managers on duty forget to give out breaks to the employees. Customers can be rude but most customers are great! We get a 10% discount and they give you 5 discount cards for family members only. The Co workers are funny friendly and helpful we all laugh with each other to get through the day.
good,I did not like working at this Burlington because it was not a professional workplace. The employees where not treated fairly.
good,"I preffer not to mention any comments, either good or bad about the Burlington stores. I do not have anything to say. I'll just say that it has been a bittersweet experience working there for almost three years now."
good,I read I understand what you want from this store team work.it a great store it a place where I can see my self working.getting a long with people been on time come in with a smile and getting the work done
good,"Over all the people there are very friendly, the managers are very helpful. I learned a lot while working there, but I feel as if I could of been doing more. They barely gave me any day and my schedule was never steady."
good,"I learned a lot working for this company, they use you according to your strength. I was sent to multiple locations to help with the overall merchandising due to lack of management in those locations."
good,There are a great deal of adhoc projects in addition to your normal weekly tasks. Summer hours take place between Memorial Day and Labor Day where employees are encouraged to leave at 3 PM on Fridays. There is minimal structure in place for advancement.
good,"I hated this job, we never had the right shoes for floor sets and everything was unorganized. It was an unprofessional waste of space. The employees were okay until they decided to revamp the store and they got rid of the very personable manager and replaced him with a person who not friendly at all. He literally ran people off by his nasty attitude."
good,"Very fast pace job. Retail is very busy and stressful. This company used to be a very fun place to work for but once management changed, the job became unbearable. I grew and learned so much with the company but I no longer feel like it is a suitable fit for me."
good,"Cashier at the job, didn't like showing up to work. Bad pay. Didn't learn much going to work everyday. I didn't like the management of the store at all."
good,"Its okay for college student or first time jobs, Not enough hours or pay. The Management is demanding and do not work with the employees to get the job done. The staff is very low and underpaid"
good,Flexible hours and competitive pay for off price retailer.  Hardest part of the job is short staffed and long hours.  The enjoyable part are the people that work there.
good,Not enough money or hours for the work that's required. Management really do not care about your feedback on problems or ideas.
good,"hard work, I did not enjoy work here under staff all the time. At time I work here would not have recommended to anyone, but I sure it as changed"
good,Depending on the manager working it could be a very hectic day getting pulled in a million different direction when knowing you had thing you needed to do. Most of the managers were great but a few I hate to say were lazy and wanted to everyone else to do their job. The hardest part of the job was being understaffed and corporate not giving anymore payrole so we at times had to do double the work. BUT. I really did enjoy all the coworkers I worked with we made a good team.
good,Its a good job overall if you are not a student. The management team was not sympathetic to the schedule of one that is still in school. They want you to put your job over everything else.
good,"Come into work and was assigned a section, and was told what was expected of that section. I learned how important a clean store is. Management was the best part of the store. Co-workers were fun to be around enjoyed working with them. The hardest part was keeping the store clean. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customer interaction."
good,"The store had a great turnover with managers."
good,"A typical day involved answering questions from customers about items and departments you were not familiar with, and then having to guide customer to the proper department or person to further help them, while maintaining a positive attitude. Management often didn't know all the information they needed to know, and co-workers often filled in the information. Co-workers were mostly good people. Hardest part was dealing with rude, messy people. Most enjoyable part was the co-workers."
good,"At Burlington coat factory I've learned many things and over came many challenges. most important thing I have learned while working for the company was building a partner ship with my fellow co-workers. Our management team is very helpful, whenever I needed to request anything or had a question about something I got the help rite away. As for the hardest part of the job its basically maintain at a fast paste to make your co-workers happy and be appreciated for it at the same time. The most enjoyable part of working at Burlington coat factory is the company welcomes friends and family to work together."
good,The most enjoyable part about my job is helping customers find the items that they need. You learn a lot about retail and help increase your customer service skill
good,This job was pretty easy to do but their was no stability or opportunities for advancement. This company only offered part-time positions and the available work hours had to be split between all the employees.
good,"overall Burlington coat factory taught me all I know about the retail business, sure the management was a little off but I enjoyed working there for the most place was consumers were GREAT!!"
good,"Burlington was a good job, fun at times but it was never without stressful issues. The position held a great deal of responsibility."
good,well my new management team wasnt very prepared all the time with day to day operations if your looking not to learn a lot on the job work here
good,Working at the Burlington was a wonderful opportunity to work in because it was in my job field.  I enjoy doing customer service and making people smile.
good,During the time I work at the place they didnt provide with the right equipment to work with as well wasnt an appropiate work environment Too hot and no fans or AC available
good,"My job is fairly easy because I am a people-person so customer service comes easy to me."
good,"Audit 12 stores and handled all issues with 174 stores regarding lost and missing sales.  worked with security to resolve any and all issues with sales, lost or stolen merchandise"
good,The hardest was heavy lifting items. The most enjoyable was tagging and preparing items for the floor. My coworkers were great and my manager helped alot.
good,"A typical day at work for me would have been clocking into work on time and reading the bulletin board to see where I was placed to work that day. Usually I would have a designated area to work but if things have gotten busy then I would rotate around the store. Myself and my co-workers have developed a partnership where we would help one another in each other's areas if things became to hectic or if their was a ""slow period"" team work is a must and great communication. The most enjoyable part of working is to be there for your customers to be able to make them happy and satisfied. The hardest part would have been short staff and all the responsibility is put onto you but you try and do the best that you can."
good,Store isn't really organized nor clean most of the time. Managers are sometime lazier the employees. I like assisting customers and providing the best customer services. feels good interacting fir all people from different places
good,"Overall this company was a very great opportunity to learn skills in logistics and distribution, however I felt the productivity and work put out was not gratified in pay for employees as should be expected in other companies."
good,"I was an auditor so I learned how to use an RF gun and along with that how to execute the right product out onto the floor. All of my co-workers were hard workers so we all got along and got the job done. The hardest part of this particular position was when the weather would start getting really hot and working conditions weren't always the best. And the most enjoyable part of the job being able to get along with my supervisors, it really pushed me to always do the best I could."
good,"A regular day at Burlington Coat Factory consists of Greeting and helping customers , maintaining the floor to look presentable & organizing merchandise if needed. "
good,Interact with customers throughout the day. I learned to deal with difficult customers & approach it in an appropriate manner. Fun co-workers to work with.
good,My co-workers are the only enjoyable thing about my job. It's because of they're such great people to work with that I've stayed as long as I have.
good,"Burlington in Manteca is like a Macy's. It is looks new, beautiful tiled floors. Employees all do a great job keeping merchandise off the floor and consistently keeping the store presentable. The employees there are friendly and looks for ways to make your shopping experience there a great one. Burlington has great name brands for low prices. So as a shopper  and employee I enjoy the selections they carry."
good,"This company is an exciting challenge for any professional who wants to make a difference quickly. There is huge room for becoming one of the answers to the challenges that face the company, from retention, to communication and team building. Working toward improving guest service standards is a challenge but so rewarding when you get the buy in of the team."
good,"Even though I was there for a short period of time, I was worth the experience of what kind of work environment I don't want to work in every again. I worked in the back section of the store where the kids clothing was located. There were 2 young ladies one older and the other around my age who worked in the same section as me. Every time I would come in they would be getting off of work, so I would have the whole section to myself for the remainder of the day. I had no help just me all alone. This would  be every day, the work wasn't hard at all I did manage to cover the whole section alone and I was very productive about it. It stayed clean and neat."
good,it is a great job the love the company but there is no advancement that is why I am moving on
good,Pretty easy-going job that requires up-keep and attention to detail in the work environment.
good,I have worked in customer service for bout five years. I like working with organizations with great opportunities. When I go to work I maintain a positive attitude and outlook of things. I don't let nothing bother me I stay focus.
good,"•	Promoted sales"
good,"they didnt want to work with me so i could attend school. However, we were never idle."
good,"Clean the registers; stock them with small, large, and garment bags. Organize hangers according to size. Stock queuing with linens, men's, youth department merchandise. Management worked with your hours. The co-workers there are good people."
good,Very stressful. Good compensation. The key driver is sales they no longer care about what is good for the customer or the employees they only care about the $$$. That became prominent my first week out of training when a girl I trained with was terminated for not high enough sales.
good,"Burlington lacks training and growth and development,I do like the interaction with associates, I have a flexible schedule, The hardest part of my job is working alone during stressful apprehensions"
good,"A day at work was busy , a lot of returns a lot of customers . I learned how to work a register how to cope and greet hundreds of people. The management was horrible, 10 registers open and on 2 people on them while the lines will be all the way into the clothing section, the needed better time management. The hardest part of them job was being one of those two ringing up and returning all those customers the job was hard but it got done !"
good,"Assist Customers with purchases and stock,Manage cash register."
good,a very intense environment at times with low pay scale. I feel that this company requires to much from their employees and does not pay enough salary for what they require.
good,"ive been employed here for two years now and i know the ins and outs of the whole store, managers and supervisors are decided based on who is friends with the whom and really no place for growth here."
good,the employees are very friendly and funny. how ever the amount of hours a week you get to work is very little
good,"Baby Depot, helping customers; management okay; co-workers okay; not the most positive workplace, but people got the work done"
good,"A retail opportunity that extremely contrasts that of mainstream department stores as far as standards, budgets and responsibilities."
good,Its basic work that is not to hard. The pay isn't great. people are nice
good,i really have a great team .... we  sit down make a plan & get everything done .
good,"I never got paid a single check. They're management is very disorganized, and does not call back. They're scheduling is very off as well."
good,"Can be a friendly staff. Trust only yourself to get a job done and never rely in anyone else. Management while I worked there suck. I like 3 of 4 managers that were available. We had a head manager and acted like a child. He was never able to stand up to nasty customers. The have favoritism in the store. If your one of the favorites, you will be moved around as much as you want and get what you want.. There is shared tilling. So if one person screws up the drawer everyone gets written up. Hours suck!"
good,"four hour shifts, they expect a lot of things to get done in that time frame."
good,I get to work punch in then go to the shipping recieving department. I unloaded the trucks and separated the boxes by departments. Then I scanned and recieved all packages into the computer system. I then open the packages and processed the merchandise.
good,"Due to my permanent disability I had to stop working for Burlington Coat Factory. The Labor law states each employees should have a break after every two hours and depending on the numbers of hours worked you can get up to three breaks per day. There were time when I could get a break until it was time for me to go home. Standing on hard concrete floors for five hours without a break, begin to cost me a whole lot of sharp pain in my back and up and down my legs. "
good,I would put away clothes then i would put up clothes. I learn that you have to have to be calm with people because is alot of different personalities
good,Worked well with my schedule of my full time job. Fast pace environment getting ready for the seasonal change.
good,The job gave me experience in retail. I was able to learn a lot from cashiering to balances books. shipping products to different stores. Co-workers were pleasant and knowledgeable about departments.
good,"straighting clothes on racks, dressing the mannequins displays, assist customers, management were very strict. Helping customers was the best part of the job"
good,"I really enjoyed working with co-workers and training new people. A typical day at work was having a morning meeting, working on schedules and assisting other employees. Would like to have seen more support from management."
good,"everything is average customer service, cashier, and stocking getting ready to open."
good,"Working at Burlington Coat Factory definitely had its perks such as great team members, excellent customer service, and employee benefits. However, it was very difficult to get things done through the managers such as being put on direct deposit, being trained for other positions in the store, and receiving paychecks on a timely manner. I loved working at a retail store, interacting with new customers everyday, and of course the employee discounts. The hardest part of my job was dealing with such unorganized store managers. I learned alot from this former job such as how to properly look up items on the catalog through the register, how to deal with irate customers in a more professional manner, and how to deal with unprofessional co-workers."
good,here at burlington coat the work started in the warehouse cleaning get ready to receive merchandise. after that work started but opening boxes get clothes to the selling floor asap. coworkers were always fighting for any. the hardest part was to deal with management under pressure some time they were aware about the procedures and that make complicate the situation
good,"Stock new merchandise, organize merchandise, assist customers, check out customers on the register."
good,"I enjoyed working at Burlington Coat Factory. I was hired as a Cashier for seasonal work only. I was trained very quickly and then I was put on register ringing customers sales. I sometimes I worked Customer Service, but not much.  I really liked the managers.  They were always available if I needed help or if I had questions, and they never made me feel like I was a bother.  I enjoyed my co-workers, and got along well with everyone I met during my brief time there.  There really wasn't anything that I can think of that was difficult.  There might be a unhappy customer, but I believe that it is easy to make them happy just by listening and showing them that you are making an effort to help them."
good,"Good place to work , a little strict but overall great place to work."
good,"i was a good work place, but it was seasonal so i could say much, we just worked great coworkers"
good,"A typical day at work consist of doing daily cash reports. Ordering change, counting cashiers in and out of their shifts.   Ringing register, and helping customers on the selling floor.  Also helping management with payroll"
good,"i like the recieving area, the team we have can get things out in a good amount of time."
good,"Burlington Coat Factory, for a first job was fairly cool. I worked in the youth department as a youth sales rep. My job duties consisted of maintaining the floor of the department (picking loose items up off floor and returning them to hangers or other appropriate positions around the department), collecting occasional ""go-backs"" from front of store, responding to price check calls from cashiers, answering department specific phone calls, retrieving freight from back of store and stocking in various appropriate areas throughout the department. I also occasionally served as a back-up cashier. The most enjoyable part of my job was the people I worked with. My department manager was awesome. The most difficult part of my job was adjusting to the mandatory department change as a large number of people quit from Sportswear and they needed people. "
good,"The work day was full of different tasks which made the time go by fast. i learned about shipping and recieving practices and rules, the managers were easy to get along with. My co-workers were all team players pulling together to get the job done. the hardest part of the job was the physical aspects like lifting or moving heavy objects and the enjoyable part was meeting and working with new people."
good,product placement payroll schedules productivity sales damages
good,A typical day for me at burlington coat factory was answer inbound calls and check customers out. working at burlington coat factory i learned that people love to shop for bargin deals. The hardest part about working at burlington coat factory is standing up all day. the great part about burlington coat factory is fact that you can meet different people face to face everyday.
good,Fun fast past job. The management was terrible. Customers and co-workers where very enjoyable.
good,"Typical day at work start taking care of the customers same cash out, exchanges,returns or price check. I learn how use the registers,check price on the register by the style number."
good,Had the chance to meet new people. Management was nice to work for.
good,I enjoy helping customer but I think the management can be better.
good,"Great way to reach out and network with other people, building interpersonal skills. However from my experience at Burlington Coat Factory, there is little to no opprotunity for advancement in the company."
good,"A typical day at work is usually slow, during the week, but filled with plenty to do. Cashiers, as well as customer service, helps with the distribution of new merchandise. This process usually takes time, as you have to unwrap new merchandise, ticket them, then hang or place them in their designated areas. However, the management here can be could be better. We currently have two new managers, and their managing skills differ from each other. This makes it difficult some days when certain managers may assign a task to an employee, but another manager may not find it as important and assign another task instead. Throughout the rest of the store there is a language barrier. This barrier is various languages which can make it difficult when needing price checks or additional information on merchandise for customers. The hardest part about working for this company is the favoritism that certain employees get from those who have positions in the store. For instance, an employee who is favored can break policy in any way an would not get a citation. However, those who are not favored as high as others can do everything they can through proper procedures, but still get a citation. This is not always the case though and certain procedures are understandable. With this company though the most enjoyable part of this job is the satisfaction of a customer after they find what they have been looking for, and knowing that the company is flexible around the hours of my college courses. There are people who will go out of their way and take the time to actually help customers find what they"
good,"I have enjoy working at Burlington, I have had a great oppurtunity to work in a store that was in desperate need of a consistant, dependable management team. Since I was transferred to the store in Aurora, as a management team we have reduced shrink, turnover, increased customer service scores and have provided the customers a clean and friendly environment to shop in."
good,Continual reductions in payroll coupled with increased production demands and improved customer service. This has gone on for nearly two years and at some point there simply are not the man hours to be successful on all fronts.
good,"This store ran on a wim....Barely!...Very young and un-trained managers, abusing the system. Un-organized. Not a loss preventive store."
good,Nthe receiving team doesn't have a set schedule so you can either work 40 hours or 0 hours. Not steady or reliable income when you have a family. The work environment and the people are fine. A good job for someone with no family or a second job.
good,"Management is fully of energy. A bunch of great people to work with. A typical day at Burlington for a flow team member would be going in early to get the store started for the day, but also leaving early to possibly get to another job."
good,"I worked in receiving and the job is very easy to do. Their agenda at Burlington was the Receiving team needed to go faster and faster with unrealistic goals.  In all honesty toward the holiday time, my ride was unreliable so it was harder for me to get to work, but that was no reason for the assistant store manager to talk to me or speak to me with disrespect. She would speak to everyone else with hhappiness and joy, but when it came to me, she would speak with anger in her tone and say smart comments. Overall it was a VERY easy job, it was just hard to work with SOME of the people there."
good,"Fast pace, very small room for error. Great location and good work hours. Management okay, but, need some communication training. Most enjoyable part of job was making new friends and great sense of pride when able to help a customer or coworker."
good,"It was A good Company to work for. The pay is okay, i really enjoy working with my coworkers and managers. The store have great deals and have lot of different styles."
good,"Due to personal reasons, Burlington wasn’t a job I couldn’t stay at very long due to the pay, although it was an okay job. I couldn’t really complain about anything else."
good,This job was fun for me it was fast-paced but the Associates made it better. They would back us (cashiers) up when we were falling behind. there are a lot of customers.
good,Unorganized didn't really like the attendence policy that was made up by management. Stole sick hrs or used them without your consent.Overall bad management
good,"This is something you want to do until you find something better. The hours are kind of irritating and its constantly stressful. The manager will breath down your back standing behind you trying to pick up the pace. Injuries are treated as no big deal. ""Throw a bandaid on it even though it's a deep cut."" Just do this until you find something better."
good,its a okay place to work could be better. have weekend off sometime plus only work 6 hours on saturday. money is okay could be better at time need more
good,Half of the time management is good but the other half no. Sometimes their unfair or they give you wrong information or won’t help you. Not enough people are every scheduled or many call outs. But the job is very flexible that’s what I love about the job and store manager was very cool.
good,"I worked at Burlington for two and a half years. I got offered a supervisory position within 3 months of working there. There were parts I loved, but also parts I hated. All the managers talked about each other to me behind each other's backs. Productivity trumped associate's needs and I had no time to train new employees. The scheduler would take training hours to use for regular hours because we never had enough hours. I could not correct my employees without being called into the office because someone complained. It was so much stress. Way to much stress for minimum wage."
good,Fun chill place to be ... it some people enjoy working at there job while others don't .  So can't say for others but from my point of view it was 100% a good part-time job for me.
good,"Management at Store 012 is not supportive of his CSM’s or the Burlington mission. "
good,"Working at Burlington has been fun so far. I am a cashier and everyone is nice there and our customers are chill. However, coorporate keeps pushing management to push us to keep selling credit cards, even though no one wants them, and then it is our fault if we do not reach the weekly goal. Also we only get short hours 4-12 a week, but then they are still hiring."
good,"Job was okay. Sopped working b/c of bullying & drama. Don'tget me wrong people were nice, but there were a select few who are just rude and mean for absolutely no reason at all. Especially if you worked up front at the register, which is where most drama happened. Most of the managers were nice though. Weekly pay is cool too. I also left because they couldn't work around my class schedule,  most of the best schedule were given to some of older workers, I mean I get it but it eould have been nice having something other than a night shift all the time. Breaks and lunches are decent though. 15 and 30 min. Overall it's not a bad place to work, but the bullying should be addressed"
good,"First off, the management is extremely RUDE! I interviewed in May to start in June(got the job), it's now July and I have yet to start my first day. I have called almost every day asking for the lady who hired me, all i get back is ""call back later"", a rude manager cutting me off, or no answer at all. After I call back at the time they recommend, she's not even on the clock anymore!!! I am looking forward to working here but this is so messy."
good,"When I first worked there it wasn’t a bad place, until I started school and of course suffered less hours, but during the holidays I was earning more money. Until they checked how fast you were checking out, and were constantly having your speed at the register be a certain way and the fact that you had to push credit cards and they would bug you about it until you got one. I have a friend who works hard and doesn’t get acknowledged by managers. I’d only recommend for pocket change."
good,"When I first started working here, the manager told the employees to teach me but it really wasnt that helpful. They reviewed ""everything"" I needed to know very quickly and they really didn't teach me everything. The job seems very easy now but the manager expects us to finish things at a very stort time. Especially me, who is still very new to this job, still figuring out how to do things and still having a hard time finding out where clothes are supposed to be hanged. The employees are okay for the most part, somewhat kind and helpful but the manager doesn't seem very much helpful at most times. Seems that the manager doesn't have time to discuss your situations or questions. Also has been cutting off my hours and letting me leave work a couple hours before my actual leaving time."
good,It's a good job to be in if your dedicated. It's just merchandising...stock..m warehouse work and customer service.You get discounts on clothing and sometimes they provide lunch
good,"Don't expect to live off your wage. Everyone I know who works here this is a second or 3rd job. Very busy and they're too cheap to hire a new security guard since the old one walked out so everybody steals all the time. Supervisors are rude to the managers because the supervisors are in their 70's but the managers are in their 30's and they argue in front of customers. Hiring process was very easy interview was less than 10 minutes. Discount is 15% off and sometimes they raise it to 30%. The customers are sometimes ghetto but thats what comes with discount stores. Good for working a couple months for a teen during summer or school but don't expect to get more than 15 hours a week (5 hours a shift, 3 shifts a week, $100 a week). Lenient management  for the most part."
good,not a bad place to work but they only have part time hours. this makes it hard to sustain a living and care for my family.  If they offered more full time positions it would be better.
good,Its an okay place to work. The management and some of the coworkers make the environment nice but the pay is really low and the work can be very difficult.
good,They do not organize themselves well. At times people aren't even doing their job. At times managers don't even know what to do. Most of the workers complain all day and it's not a happy environment either.
good,"The job itself is a lot of work you will get plenty of exercise but very low paying for the work being done."
good,"It was not the ideal place to work because of the location, which caused management to cut pay. Overall I can say it helped me to appreciate the basic rules in having a job; being on time, coming prepared and remain professional."
good,A typical work day will involve you reviewing cameras and walking the sales floor. there are also weekly and daily audits that have to be done within a time schedule.
good,It was your typical retail job experience. I wasn’t employed here long. The job was okay the people were okay. I don’t remember much about the discounts or benefits as I never got the chance to use them. If you’re a young adult with little financial responsibilities I’d say go for it
good,"The work environment was fast paced and I didn’t have much training . I worked nights and most nights there would still be a work load for the AM crew, which in turn always resulted in the PM crew coming into hectic  shifts."
good,"they expect you to go above and beyond while paying very little, at first it wasn't a problem until they started short staffing and handing out 10 large task at the very last moment so they could pass inspections. I personally love being busy and working on a lot at once however after a few months of this job I am over it. None of the managers at this store aside from one actually care about the employees and understand the work load. Part of management is unprofessional and lets personal attitudes issues get in the way of proper leadership which has called for multiple disputes in the workplace. The only reason I give a rating of a three instead of a one was because of the other workers there, having good coworkers makes shifts bearable but I definitely wouldn't recommend working here."
good,"Burlington was a fun place to work at,  But it had no Benefits at the time as a employee as a part time work in Kennesaw, GA. I only work there for one year . I relocated back to Miami Fla."
good,You can have a schedule week for 30 hours in a week and than be told you do not have to work one day or go early on your days you work. Sometime uneven to work as team in certain department to get certain things done.
good,"Be ready to be extremely bored all the time!! They schedule you by yourself the whole day until you get off then someone else comes in. You will never get saturdays off, except around christmas time when seasonal people come."
good,A fast pace and busy with customer service. Long lines at the cash registers and at the fitting room.  Walking the floor and fixing the clothes on the rack and organizing different department of the store.
good,"A typical day at Burlington was stressful. When I needed assistance at the register or there was a long line, my managers and coworkers would make that a last priority. I learned how to make every customer feel like they are the only customer I have talked to, I also learned how to process transactions in a timely fashion. Management at Burlington was poor. The management was very caddy to say the least. If there were problems in the work place, I would bring it up to management on my own time but the situations were never corrected. The hardest part about working at Burlington would have to be the management at that particular store."
good,Very fast paced when busy. Coworkers do not communicate some supervisors and managers. Tends to be messy on a bad day. Very flexible work schedule. Paid weekly.
good,"There was not weekend off at Burlington. Burlington is great place to work if you are just looking for less than 25 hours per week, I retired from a job for over 38 years. Just looking for a part time work. You are schedule to work every Friday-Sunday. The store manager is okay."
good,"The costumers can be rude and so can the co workers and managers but there are also good costumers, coworkers,and managers depending on who hires them."
good,"The workplace culture in Burlington is a positive environment. Many employees are taken advantage of, especially the young ones. I had to wait for a new store to open up or someone to resign/quit to receive a promotion."
good,The people that I worked with was great. It was a fast paced company and you always had to be on your toes. some of the management was hard to get along with but they where all laid back.
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with but the management at the store I worked at was very cutthroat, and not very accommodating unless you were a favorite which made for difficult times as far as getting hours and being able to gain experience throughout the various store departments."
good,"I liked Burlington, it was a part-time job. I like the clothes and the discount was decent. I had a good supervisor. The atmosphere was pleasant, my fellow co-workers were happy and friendly. Everybody seemed to get along with each other no drama. I met a lot of nice people customers and co-workers it was a good experience."
good,"All i have to say is that i hand my good an bad days with this store . I would never go back or shop there . it was a HOT MESS. i real do not have much to say just that , they need help and i'll never go back"
good,This job was slow paced and wouldn't let you advance your job title. You have to have patience and great customer service skills and a exceptional attitude.
good,"This job is great for first timers because you get to learn first hand the proper way to carry out your customer service skills. Everyday your job consists of you either being on the register or in a selected department picked by your managers. Your job is to keep up the department, while greeting, and helping any customers in need. Also we are all trained for the register to help when needed."
good,From the outside looking the job seemed like the perfect position to have. If you've worked in receiving you understand that you have to work at a fast pace in a select amount of time. If the management at the location is your job will become twice as hard
good,You could grow and learn  alot if  the company if they had good mentoring program. i would have like stores hours  more family friendly the hours are really long even Sundays they closes at 9:30pm.
good,Burlington offered just what I was looking for a set part-time schedule and the hours that worked for me at the time. I only wanted to work part-time with less then 25hrs per week and Burlington was able to do that.
good,Burlington is a good place to start as a first job. They don’t really teach a lot but they teach a good amount about teamwork and leadership building.
good,They work you like a slave to get production done but the managers are so helpful and encouraging. They need to raise the pay a little.I would return here if the night shift was still available in Edgewater park.
good,working at Burlington was okay job it was just about making dead lines and it was about being on paced also it you have to be willing to work on Saturdays and Sundays
good,Nothing to be excited about. It's a job. You're going to run into alot of different customers. Some come in the store just to get free stuff. It's not a bad job... it's just a job.
good,As long as your full-time you get the right amount of hours that you're supposed to have to work 37.5. But they pile a lot of work on to one person and the part-time people are not given the right amount of hours so most of the work lays on the shoulders of the full-time people.
good,Burlington needs to build its bench strengh rather than continue to hire from outside the company continuously. Its frustrating when openings continue to go to outsiders.
good,i love the staff and type of job but was face paced and i like to enjoy what i do. back flow fast pace.  staff young and breaks are over quickly lunch is to short hrs change often.
good,"its is an easy job more for a teenager starting to work, it does not offer many hours weekly and shift change is very difficult and rare, hours are limited and pay is minium wage which is not evenough for an easy living financially other wise it can be very busy but can also be easy if you follow direction well"
good,Burlington Coats was a good part-time job. The internal culture was good. I often communicate with fellow co-workers even today. The company has experienced a lot of changes.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of scheduling for the week and staying within the allocated hours for my staff, which was the front end and accounting. "
good,"Overall, Burlington is a good place to work to get your foot in the door for retail and customer service. My only complaint is that they don't pay their associates well and there is no incentives for people to work harder. I have a good work ethic, but it was definitely taken advantage of and not appreciated for all the work I did and have done for them."
good,This is a retail job that entails more than usual clean-up and sorting because of the fact that it is a clearance store and customers and looking to switch tags and possibly steal items from the store.
good,"Lack of proper resources to achieve goals and be successful, management must work Long days, 6 days a week and do all projects themselves. No funding for planned projects unless special request made in advance."
good,I'm just tired of them and the inconsistent hours. Everyone else has 20+ hours and I'm only getting 12 hrs a week. That's no money at 8.50. Then they get mad when you call in.
good,you can work all day but they move you around a lot which sometimes makes it difficult. they do work with the schedule and it isn't as stressful if you know where things go.
good,"Nice work environment and the pay is fair. I have no objection to change, I can easily adjust. However, I feel the amount of work I was given was for a full-time position. I made the request and it was denied."
good,At first it was ok and then I just wasn’t working for me the pay wasn’t enough for all the work that I put in had some great co workers but I will not work there again
good,"Excellent part-time job, but with unstable scheduling.  Get 30 hours one week, 12 hours the next.  Never given a full daily schedule, just a starting time.  Start at 7:00 am and work until management DECIDES the day is over, anywhere from 4 - 9 hours daily with no warning.  Very hard to schedule appointments, etc."
good,"Personally, once you first start this job it may seem overwhelming at first but you'll get used to the regular flow for the most part if your a cashier as long as you are not lazy and are comfortable with multitasking. As a CSS or Customer Service Supervisor you will be stressed out beyond belief. If you think customers yelling at you are hard to deal with then imagine having that happen, while you have to keep the entire registers area clean, keep track and send people on lunches/breaks, have at least 3 people calling for help majority of the time, training the new employees, giving sales reports, bag checks, and generally making sure everyone is doing what they're suppose to. Truthfully this is nothing and not hard at all, as long as you can handle the stress and know how to compose yourself in front of both your coworkers and customers you can handle the job with ease despite any form of frustration you have buried beneath the surface."
good,I believe the pay should be higher as being a receiving Associate.We do everything.  $9 doesn’t cut it. Plus in return all your getting is a discount off merchandise.10-15% at that.  Managers are not on the same accordance. Managers of N.Charleston Branch are really nice. Yet they do expect so much out of you but are only paying $9. Once someone gets hired they usually just stay for one check and leave because of the labor that’s required. If retail is your thing then you should have no problem working here. Just isn’t for me
good,A stress free working environment but low pay scale for hourly workers.   Minimum career advancement opportunities in distribution center.    Every day is a productive day!
good,Great as far as flexibility of scheduling. They keep staff at a minimal making a lot of work for employees that are working and as such the employees cannot keep up with all of the work which leaves the store looking cluttered. Pay is barely over minimum and is not competitive.
good,"Working at BF is nice, however, in the beginning my hiring process I was told by the supervisor he was too busy to ""train / show me around"" and implied that I just shadow another co-worker."
good,"Okay place to work, not great hours, but as a part time employee that is expected. Off on the weekends in receiving. Not bad environment to work. Sometimes you will find yourself among a lot of people who seem like they are not there to work. Overall it is a decent place to work."
good,"I enjoyed working for Burlington in Boise Idaho. A typical day consisted of me opening boxes, sorting the merchandise, ticketing all soft lines and hard lines. Stocked shelves.Organized."
good,"Acceptable job to work at , not the best working environment. It could improve in pay. Learned many things from receiving to Emailing vendors. Stressful when its a full day of work."
good,A easy going environment to work in. The customers are great. I learned how to operate on the older registers they have. The hardest part of the job is working at a pace were you can get your work done while still helping with front end at the same time.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is cultivating and developing my front end cashiers to provide outstanding customer service to our customers.  The hardest part of the job is working within the parameters of being short staffed and still trying to deliver exceptional shopping experiences to all customers.
good,"Little communication between management. Hours vary depending on allowance. Cross-train employees to keep everyone at part time, with little benefits."
good,"A typical day at work starts at 6AM. Unload truck separate merchandise from boxes. Move merchandise to store and stock shelves."
good,During my time here I had issues with the management working with my college schedule and health issues. The environment can vary from slow and friendly with coworkers to hostile and stressful all within the same day. While I gained useful skills and enjoyed a large part of my time working for them I would not apply for a position with the company again if an opportunity came up.
good,"Perfect job culture but the management from the Regional team on down to the store supervisors is horrific. First of all, supervisors were replaced very frequently on average of three times within one single year. This company lacks to care about its employees as they do not provide air conditioning in the summer nor heat in the winter. They REQUIRE employees to come in at 6 am EVERY Sunday just to do store markdowns where at some locations you are locked in a stuffy store until the mall or store opens (like at my location in Silver Spring). Management also treats you as if you do not have a right to use your ""sick"" hours which they are required to give employees by law. I would never work at this place again although I really loved the employees I worked with and the family feel that was in the environment."
good,"I feel like retail is the real version of over worked and underpaid. The place is somewhat comfortable, with helping customers and dealing with assiocates."
good,"Under good management and the work will keep you busy. As far as the hours you get, you could be a full time employee with a part time schedule. The pay was not up to my standards."
good,The work force lack of major professionalism... Supervisor bring personal life to work without a care in the world. Always negative and lying. Everywhere you turn around its drama with someone or something. Job is very simple anybody can get it but the head managers sucks. I talked to one of my managers about a problem she told me I was taking things personal... It wasn't that I just take pride in my work. They fire the hardworking people and keep the lazy and but kissing worker.
good,Burlington requires a very task oriented organized day in order to complete the necessary requirements throughout the week.  I enjoy the customers but prefer a more one on one relationship with them.
good,Not paid enough for the amount of work being done. Never got full-time hours. Barely made $200 dollars a week. They are flexible with outside work schedule.
good,"As a stock flow merchandise associate, the first thing we do is sort out hard line and soft line merchandise, from there, we process all merchandise and stock them on their shelves to assigned departments."
good,"A typical day at Burlington. No, such thing. Every day is different, which I like so it is not the work day. Day after day. The day is pretty much going to reflect on the size of the truck load with merchandise that needs to be sorted and go out to the correct department. Management is great at Burlington, caring, helpful and very creative. Hardest part of the job for me was not being  able to finish the truck. The most enjoyable part of my job was being a good, fast and knowing my job and getting it all done. Markdown are cool too!"
good,Nice mangers and coworkers but a lot of work with the minimum payment and no benefits for part time workers they hired you for one position then you fined yourself everywhere
good,Burlington is a fast pace warehouse . They are expanding into the Inland Empire . Burlington will open their third warehouse in December .They will create many jobs .
good,Needs better management but fun workplace. I enjoy my time working here very cool people. I experience many different things each day with customers and even the store itself.
good,"a typical week is 10-12 hours, once you clock in it's the same go backs and slow paced. only picks up during holidays and that's when you can get some hours in"
good,I worked there for about 3 months. Managers were rude and didn't communicate. They would change the schedule and never tell anyone and i'd be late or not show up on accident.
good,"It is hard to understand the company's policy regarding how many hours you are giving."
good,"went in early to help clean up store."
good,"Working at Burlington I have learned alot about management, merchandising and customer service. A typical day at work would be to come in at the scheduled time, In down time re merchandising and restocking is always something needed to be worked on. Walk to the stock room where freight is being processed. If the department that you are covering for the day has freight it needs to be processed appropriately, and taken out to be on the sales floor. During busy times it is the job of a floor sales associate to cover all cashier breaks and also be used as a back up cashier when business inclines."
good,"Extra work hours are available"
good,I worked in the Baby depot  department at Burlington Coat factory. I did enjoy assisting the mother's with choosing the best  products for their babies.
good,"Fast pace , well I work in the Flow team area, a little stressed. Unloading pallets pushing the Flow to the floor. Processing clothes shoes pushing clothes,shoes to the floor."
good,"Burlington Coat Factory is a tolerable job, not something much to make a career out of. Not a thriving company so hours are short often. However, it keeps you busy when you do work. A lot of picking up after other people, it can get annoying but the coworkers are very friendly."
good,I learned a lot from working for Burlington Coat Factory. If I had stayed I probably would have had my own store. At the time I worked for them Burlington really cared about their employees.
good,A typical day requires constant customer service interaction.  While this particular locate is a HUGE CHALLENGE to keep clean the employees and management are fun to work with.
good,"Burlington is a good place to work if you need job security. They rarely fire people, even if they're not a team player. The wages are fair, but could be better."
good,"I feel as though backroom workers deserve far much more pay. Starting rate should atleast be at 10.00//hr. The work load and stress of getting everything unloaded off the trucks, boxes open and merchandise tagged/sensored/processed and put out is A LOT for 8.00/hr."
good,"Good place but we had too many managers here, about 5 at once!... Hard to keep track of updates and changes when everyone is saying something different."
good,Management is extremely unprepared and unprofessional. They hire people without thinking therefore not getting good people for the job. They will also run you and others off by being horribly rude to you in front of customers. They randomly change the schedule sometimes without you knowing and half of your coworkers play around and refuse to fo their job. At least that's how my store is ran.
good,"The store manager is the worse.  I worked there for 3 years and I never once heard him say a good job.  I was a cashier, customer service supervisor and did cashier paper work.  The workplace is a mess. They treat you like a slave."
good,"When working at Burlington I was constantly harassed by one of the managers, overworked, run dry by management as they placed me practically everywhere. I found the store to be disorganized and poorly managed. Though they knew I was going to college they would schedule me during college hours and then write me up and threaten to fire me. In the end I had no choice other than to quit because college is much more important then a poorly managed dead end job."
good,I handle cash and check customers out. I also help customers with any extra assistance. I like meeting and chatting with different people throughout the day.
good,Great place for part time job. Slow pace and very balanced with hours depending on your schedule. Great place to start off with a quick job. Nice people
good,"You got to play your cards right with management that's how you get ahead. Floor manager will talk smack and spread rumors even discriminate but she's in good with HR so she won't get fired aside from that loved my coworkers and miss them dearly."
good,"Burlington is a good example of an off-price retail store in a large box setting.  My experience there was acceptable, but the work/life balance and job itself were just not to my personal taste."
good,"A typical work day will be recovering from the night before, getting your specific department back to order for shopper. After that you'll put out new merchandise while greeting customers and straightening throughout the day. Make sure nothing is on the floor and all put backs are done at the end of you shift. "
good,Working for this company gave me a new outlook on customer service and helped teach me more patience as well as dealing with different types of personalities
good,"This particular branch was great in regards to being number one. However, from the corporate office, it pushed too hard and compensated little. So many worked hours on end and when a change in shift was needed, you were threatened to lose those hours. The store was immaculate, yet the compensation was not rendered justly."
good,"Good place to work, good fast working place teach you more with learning how to put stuff in the box showing us how it the items not on the paper to write a problem note on the box"
good,"Assistant buyer's pay rate in Burlington is comparatively lower than other similar companies. There is no work-life balance at this position. The assistant buyer position requires a lot of personal time input. However, the working environment is very friendly."
good,"Good part time job with good management and co workers. Typical days depends on position. Clock in, start your shift, hop on the register and be friendly with customers until shift ends."
good,"As my first job out of high school, it was a good experience. It was a job that was only seasonal so the hours weren't what i expected. I learned how to be more independent."
good,"the management is the problem, in my opinion, they have not found out what they goal is. it is an easy job with few problem and it has its good days . I work part-time so I can't say too much about the benefits, but it is an okay place to work overall."
good,the job was good. the hours were getting cut due to hiring more people for the holidays. but after a while even the supervisor and manger were fired and unorganized schedules were being done. it was chaos.
good,"This place is nice but eventually its depressing. People left and the work just was distributed to the rest of the team with no replacements. "
good,Working there taught me paitence with others and how to approach customers . my store manager was very helpful with any questions i would adk my co workers has supervisors werent there for me pretty much i had to learn on my own everyone js fighting for hours so is a very compettive place
good,A typical day revolved around providing customer service to all customers. It is connected to a shopping mall which keeps a good flow of customers throughout the work place.
good,"Like every company they strong leaders and ones not so fit to lead."
good,Working at Burlington there was always something to learn. Retail is always changing. Management was always kind and understanding. Co-workers were like family.
good,great to get warehouse experience but here hard to move up a lot of favortism. all managers have there own little group they only help they dont value there workers pay sucks for everything you have to do.
good,"Even though I felt like there were times when the job was productive and fun, there were also times where i felt growth wasn't possible."
good,"I worked in Linens and the Shoe Department. First at this location they hired people to work overnights,because of the state of the department. It needed a major overhaul. I was head floor associate from day one. I worked directly under the floor manager. I was in Shoes first and then moved to Linens to assist with the re-conditioning of that department. In addition to this, I assisted customers daily with purchases from both departments."
good,The job is easy it's just a lot to do. There are great team members that makes overnight a piece of cake. The only problem is the pay is little and  the hours are little and I have been there over 5 months and still didn't get my evaluation for a raise.
good,"Not as organize it should've been , it started smooth but then became not as good job short of staff and people stole from so much my location they couldn't give us raises."
good,"This company is a good starter job, but not really a place you would want to work for a long period of time. The current location I work at is under new management, and things are definitely for the better. Decent employee discount with ""extra discount days."""
good,"Typical retail job, the new management at this location is by the book, which is nice.  There are more hours to pick  up as the holidays get closer to us"
good,A lot of work and not much pay. Not the best place to work at. I have learned to provide good customer service because customers have little to no patience.
good,"At Burlington I was in charge of shoes, we picked up the floors, fixed the shoes looked prices up, processed the merchandize found the right size for the customers, found misstates, worked as a cashier when needed. I learned several skills to take on any assignment necessary or any challenge thrown my way such as fixing the escalators, the registers, the servers, the box that plays the music. the hardest part of the job was that most of the time we work alone while having to fix three departments (kid, ladies and men shoes) help customers and work at the registers when called. the most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfaction when someone found what they were looking for and the pride of knowing you finished near the impossible when everything was fixed at closing time."
good,"A typical day at work with Burlington Coat Factory is very busy. You have to deal with a lot of difficult customers throughout the day. That is the hardest part of working for Burlington. My co-workers made it a bit easier though, since i started working there they were there to teach me the ins and outs of the company which made my progression easier. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting the occasional customer who appreciates your hard work. It's always nice to get these customers because they let you know that your good customer service doesn't go unnoticed. While working there, i learned that patience is key when working in customer service. If you don't have patience it can be a bit hard on you in the long run, especially when working with difficult customers."
good,"A typical day at work consists of keeping busy trying to maintain all areas in your department, and keeping all customers satified with their visit at burlington."
good,"Burlington Coat Factory was a fine place to work for the most part, I left for personal reasons. Management could have been a little more helpful instead of bickering among themselves, and they could have used more employees on the floor to make sure the store was kept more clean, but not bad."
good,I liked the fast paced environment but missed working with customers being that I am a people person wasn't able to do much customer service in a warehouse
good,I learned how to put a store in order to get the store open. I enjoy marking down the merchandise to see what I can buy. The management is helpful when it comes to questions being answered. I like my colleagues from the front end to back of the house (receiving).
good,"Great people, mediocre with the way management was overseeing things at the store. I wasn't trained properly just thrown into the fray but my co-workers got me up to speed with how things are there."
good,It is an okay company to work for . They expect too much from the full timers . lunch time break could be longer . if you are retired and looking for a part time job this is your place .
good,"Management was good, pay was not good. Hours were good, but stress made it unbearable. As a full-time employee, I had good benefits, as well."
good,"The job it self was very nice but the communication lines between the managment and staff were hardly ever clear. For example, there was a dress code in place but if you ask one manager they would say follow the dress code step by step and if you asked another they would say you could follow it but if you want to wear one thing that is different but still looks approiate you can."
good,"I loved my store mananger at State Street, however majority of my fellow coworkers were very lazy. When a project and daily goals requires team effort and your team isn't pulling weight the job gets stressful."
good,I love being able to help people find what ever it is that their looking for. this job allowed me to do such I worked with a team of well grounded people which made every day even better.
good,"I started at the company as a cashier. Everyday was different because some days there were rude customers and other days I met people from all over the world because my store was in the middle of the city. "
good,"My experience working with Burlington wasn't so pleasant. I loved my managers and co workers but I felt the corporation expected entirely to much from what little staff they had. They were very short staffed and never wanted to hire new people although they needed the help, they expected one person to work a three persons area and complete the task within the few hours you worked."
good,"I operated the shoes and accessories departments. I'd set up displays and ensure sales floor was neat and clean. I'd mark and display all clearance items as well as handled all customer questions and concerns."
good,Worked here as a student. They were very flexible with my schedule. The pay was not great but it was enough to pay for books and things that loans did not cover.
good,"I've learned, and am continuing to learn a lot about the retail industry. This job is very helpful showing the ins and outs of a retail store. Usually, in a typical day, I am either assigned to a specific project to do, or work with the team to get the store at great expections for not only management, but most importantly the customers. I work with a few  people that have fun personalities, which keeps the enviorment interesting. The management also have fun personality, but also can be strict on what needs to be done. The hardest part of the job, is sometimes the projects that are assigned, and keeping the store clean. There is lots, and lots of movement on the floor I have to do, which can be extermely tiring. Also, it is hard balancing my outside life with work, because of the hours. I am part-time, and sometimes schduled full-time hours. Which can be nice, but I can't do it all the time. Or I close one night, and get out really late, then have to open the next day. That is also tiring not getting a full night of sleep. All for little pay."
good,"Productive and Flexibly.I truly enjoy working with all of my employees.This job is very steady and as much as I enjoy it, I just need more from a work place at this time in my life."
good,Burlington Coat factory is an organized company. The management team do not communicate with each other well. They are very last minute when it comes to letting the employees know important information.
good,The supervisors in this job treat interns like slaves. You're not as equal as the regular employees in the store. Supervisors speak to you how ever they feel like it because you're not a employee.
good,"A typical day at work is normal business"
good,Burlington is a fast paced place to work. There are always busy days and plenty to do. Though on slow days it can be pretty boring and less things to do. One of my managers is just the worst and is horrible with people skills and yells at everyone all the time and make insulting stabs to coworkers. It's seriously a mystery why he hasn't gotten in trouble with HR he is horrible. He kicks out customers with crying babies and is not at all willing to compromise with working around your schedule even if you have classes. Many have quit because of him... Everyone else is nice though and easy to get along with.
good,Working at Burlington there are a lot of expectations for so little money. We got payed  every week but the pay wasn't enough it helped out a little with the expenses I had.
good,ok regular cashier things that you do. count down drawers at end of day.
good,"A typical day at Burlington was doing opening procedures ( checking Emails, performing deposit from previous day, checking and editing payroll, looking at reports, assigning associates to various jobs etc..)"
good,"It was a good place to work as a job rather a career. Co workers were friendly. Under staffed some of the time, which led to more work for people."
good,too much overtime to many young kids i really dont remember i havent really work there in such a long time so i really cant say much
good,You must be self motivated and must have thick skin. Its a ok job if youre looking for work experience. youre lucky if you're promoted within 1-2 years.
good,It's a great job to enhance experience within the Loss Prevention Department.
good,"Typical day at work consists of running the cashier while informing customers on the great deals and discounts that we had weekly. From time to time, the other co-workers and I would take turns stocking certain items in our stock room as well as organizing and cleaning merchandise on the sales floors. My co-workers were really great, hard-working people who made the job fun. Management was kind and helpful for the most part. A lack of concern and consideration occurred during difficult times. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers and keeping the store organized and clean on holidays. The most enjoyable part of the job was working side by side with my co-workers."
good,"Making sure customer are happy. shipping and receiving, Doing displays and managing the dressing rooms"
good,I can only speak about the distribution center as I have never worked on the retail side. If your a go getter there is opportunity for advancement.  At the entry level the pay is not great (just above minimum wage) and you work hard inside the warehouse! They hire a LOT of temps so it is a revolving door system.  I'm a yard driver and the pay is fair and the work can be stressful at times but overall it's managable.
good,This was probably the most difficult job i had. this job definitely got really crazy around the holidays. The customers were very impatient and some were very rude but still held my composure as the nicest cashier as possible. The time we stayed in the store when we closed was entirely to long
good,"A typical day is giving out daily assignments, informing people of any special projects or events coming up.  Making sure all areas of the store are covered to provide optimal customer service, cash handling and getting the store ready for opening the next day.  I have learned that every person learns and takes direction differently and that I must know this about each person and the best way to handle each employee.  I have enjoyed working with my direct management team and all my co-workers.  The hardest part of my job can be balancing tasks with customer service when we are short handed.  I am a very detailed oriented person and working in my department gives my enjoyment and a sense of accomplishment."
good,this was a good job if your into retail and sales environment kinda jobs
good,"I review a lot of video surveillance of activity in the store. I do store audits with EAS sensing, re ticketing and sizing merchandise. I've learned a lot in time I have been there about Loss Prevention. Management team and co-workers are good. I'm not very big on doing audits. Pretty much getting to be my own boss and do my job at my own pace."
good,"A typical day is surveying the sales floor, light to moderate recovery, followed by go-backs and customer service. Continuous go-backs, recovery, and customer service till end of shift if no projects are requested by management."
good,"Making sure the store was clean,connecting with the customers."
good,"Easy work, staff is really cool. I clock in, put out and organize merchandise, help customers find things from time to time, help out the cashiers when needed...etc. Hardest part would have to be the constant standing and walking, but you get used to it after a few weeks, I enjoy revamping sections of the store like organizing the socks for example."
good,"A typical day at work would be comprised of organizing the merchandise. I learned that in retail it is important that the customer can find the merchandise fast and easily to make shopping as hassle fee as possible. Co-workers were friendly, generous, and welcoming. The hardest part of the job was recovery at the end of the day. The most enjoyable part of the job was feeling accomplished after a hard day's work."
good,"its a great place to work, but there are some things management can work on."
good,It Was Ok Being Able To Interact With Customers And Most Of The Employees Was Very Friendly and Team Oriented
good,"lack of communication from Management staff-to many chiefs and not enough Indians. Everybody had there own way of doing tasks so you were consistently re-working same projects..work hours fluctuated from 3-8hrs a day some people received 3hours a week, (not worth the gas )..The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting so many people on a daily basis and gained many friendships with repeated customers.."
good,The job gave me experience in retail. I was able to learn a lot from cashiering to balances books. shipping products to different stores. Co-workers were pleasant and knowledgeable about departments.
good,"A typical work day would include unloading all pellets from each delivery. Scanning and taking inventory of all products. Merchandising and restocking all products. Through this company I was able to receive many developments: such as customer service, production, sales, prioritizing, and time management. My co-workers were wonderful and helpful. The hardest part of this job was at times a lack of communication between staff. The most enjoyable part of this company would ahve to be my co-workers and having the opportunity to meet so many new people that kept a smile on my face."
good,"I worked in the Men's Department at the Burlington Coat Factory that included being a customer service representative throughout the department as well as being a cashier at checkout. Duties also included keeping merchandise properly stocked, returning products to proper area and keeping department maintained at all times. I worked with a great group of all people from all departments and management was always helpful in any situation that came up from customer service to helping schedule around school."
good,My time with the company was valued by my administrative parties but did not suit my career goals.
good,"BCF is a work in progress. I suggest a little more structure and consistency. I like the fact that there is always plenty to do and lots of different scenarios and opportunities that help increase leadership growth. A typical day is filled with a normal workload and various unplanned situations that occur during daily operations. "
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was working with co-workers and working as a team to help the company's growth and success.
good,"great work environment great people to work with, we were able to have fun while still fulfilling all duties assigned to us. Hardest part of the job was convincing the customers that sometimes there was absolutely nothing that could be done for their complaints on returns. the most enjoyable was learning the different aspects of the job and working together as a team to accomplish everything."

good,"Typical day at burlington coat factory would be coming into to work , going behind the registers and checking in with our supervisors or manager, shortly after we would begin our shift greeting customers answering questions and also ringing up items returning and doing layaways at customer service. There was nothing hard about the tasks of being a cashier, the customers were the best part of everyday ."

good,"*Organized the floor displays and racks"
good,"Traveling, gain new experiences,"
good,Management is okay the co-workers are great people to work with.

good,"I enjoyed working for Burlington because of the people I worked with; in fact, I went back two times after leaving the first time (always only left for personal reasons)."

good,Merchandising the departments. What sells in certain areas and what does not.
good,"Working at Burlington Coat Factory had its pros and cons. I have been working there for 4 years and 9 months, and remained a cashier the whole time I was employed there. Some of the customer service management were great as well as some of the head management. The most enjoying part of working there was meeting new people as well as meeting their highest expectations in providing them with great customer service and getting constant compliments from the customers. The hardest part of the job was seeking favortism amongst employees in the workplace and receiving no growth opportunities for long term employees, as well as the hours werent steady,"
good,"Burlington Coat Factory is a great place to work, for a single person without responsbility and dependents. They have flexible hours."
good,This company needs more stucture and the my coworkers was good.

good,"A group of people that work well together and strive to build moral. New management, however seemingly willing to learn and succeed."
good,try to fix any clerical mistakes made by the cashiers as well as other associates.
good,"Managment was very sloppy at this job. Although I was only working seasonal this was a job that made time go by extremely slow so it felt as if I work there for years. A normal day consist of assisting customers in the lady’s and juniors department. I enjoyed working in my department because, I enjoy fashion so I loved giving customers my optioning on what looked nice on them and further more ."
good,"I learned that no matter what the situation maybe when dealing with a customer that the customer is always right. The most en]joyable part of my job were the kids because they would always come into the store with their parents to find shop for certain occasions whether it was back to school, parties, or to go on vaction; but their parents would always disagree with what they wanted to wear and they would always ask my opinion and I would always think of some kind of way that parents and the kids could leave the store happy."
good,"From day to day I worked in the shoes and accessories department where I cleaned up after customers, assisted them in any way possible, recovered m areas and lastly placed new merchandice out on the sales floor."
good,"Although this was my first job experience, I know that Burlington Coat Factory is a weaker company, comparably to its competition. The managers were extremely disorganized, incompetent, and rude to employees. They played favorites and lacked appreciation of workers who truly care for the company. My co-workers were very nice and supportive, however. If management were better, it would've been a better work experience."
good,I was only seasonal but i've learned alot about being on the merchandise team. their job is a non stop job..you have to make sure everything is out on the floors and shelves and try to maintain the overloads. the people i worked with were very friendly and helpful and really new what they were doing. a typical day of work can be a long stressful one or a fast but steady pace depending on what the assignment is. There isn't really a hard part but just being there on the team is challenging.

good,very bizzy store mangment changed very offten on the other hand it was a nice place to work

good,Moderate slow moving enviorment easy to work n interact with employees.
good,"This company was is a clean, fun and interesting place to work for. Burlington Coat has a variety of things to shop for from clothing to household items."
good,Great company to work for! I was able to further my skills in working with a point of sales system. The environment was very diverse and inclusive and overall a great fit for all who works there.
good,it's a pretty stressful job and contains lots of work put into for low pay. great for learning new skills but no growth promised within the company. having to be comfortable with stopping shoplifters and dealing with law enforcement.
good,Nice Company Benifits.Lack of management interactions on a daily basis. Not used to management not connecting with employees on a regular basis. Most time worked alone.

good,I finally got the pay I deserve even though it's a little too late for it but ok. Flexibility is soo easy. No one will shame you for taking a month off especially if you have been there long like I have. If you just do what they want you to do your good. They do not train you so get some help from your fellow workers. Work here at your own risk. Just don't stay as long as I have. Lol
good,Idk it really was putting a toll on my body after a while.. no one seemed to care but I did.. it was okay tho I enjoyed every second of being there and working with amazing co workers.
good,"It's a decent job if your like in college and just want to work."
good,"I enjoyed most the friendships I’ve made there and I was able to work with my daughter and some of her friends  we were like a family. I loved that it was fast paced. The only thing that was negative is how they treat their hard workers versus their workers who don’t want to work . But, I’m happy I worked there because I earned 4 great friendships."
good,I worked for Burlington for a year it was super stressful had no help in the most popular department.. then when they hired a person to help she was always pulled to other departments
good,"Work is easy but no getting paid enough. I learned about ticking pricing, I processed shoes in the back, the workplace culture is very helpful, there was no hardest part of the job and the most enjoyable part of the job is the workplace culture."
good,"Burlington is a nice place to work. Other staff were friendly. Lines were often long but breaks are given in a timely manner and the job itself is all around easy and if you have no experience on a register, it's simple to learn."
good,Good first time job for someone who looking to get into warehouse and To gain work experience. Very different from every warehouse Due to Lack of management and also poor Leadership
good,It’s a good place to work. there are very friendly people and staff. The work is very fast paced but if you put ur mind to it you can do it. It’s a very easy job.
good,Managers are very understanding. Co-workers are very helpful and very nice. The job was pretty easy always had something to do while waiting on customers.

good,"Its okay had a good experience but would like something more fast pace it's a good job for someone that's just getting In the work field its, I highly recommend"
good,Working at Burlington was okay. The hours and payment wasn’t bad at all. It was just poor management and to much drama and im not really there for that so I wanted to leave the job.
good,"The faculty in Burlington  need to update their training program. MANAGERS should attend a monthly meeting requiring their abilities to be managers, such as the appropriate procedures to speak to an employee in a respectable manner."
good,i would work retail again if given opportunity it was always busy meet all kinds of people  learn more about the retail world and customer service the hours are very flexible and they work with you
good,I enjoy working at Burlington.  It is a good place to work for retail.  If you are looking for a starter career it is a good place to start.  I have worked there in various positions.
good,"The pay sucks for the amount of work we put in. But my fellow co workers make its little moe exciting to work there.The job is a little stressful and if you live more 15 minutes away, then the job is useless."
good,Cool great experience and good to work there they give you discounts everyone would qat work and do they job customers are crazy but hey we live and we learn
good,"I worked at burlington for about 6 ish months, in that time I met many people, my co workers were fun to be around, my Direct supervisors were really nice and supportive, the customers were extremely liveley and colorful, assistant managers were on point, and the Store manager had unique ideas about Employee and customer interactions"
good,I think that Burlington is a good place to learn new things at the cash register and makes you more comfortable talking to costumers and working with co-workers
good,"I dont know what to say about this company. Turn over rate is very high lack of respect is given and people with the same position as us like to feel as though they are above everyone, and this job is toxic."
good,"Fun place to work they just need to pay more and give hours. They also need benefits for all workers, and they need to promote within and not just hire new people for roles an old member may have wanted."
good,I liked my job at Burlington when I first started then it was horrible hours not flexible working crazy odd hours of the day day after day then one week you’ll be off for 5 days straight. No company picnics or games no fun at all it’s a job to get you started but as far as a career there’s no way you can move up. Employees are nice after while and management are okay here but all in all I wouldn’t stay here longer than needed.
good,"Working at Burlington, was a great experience. This was my first job, I got to experience what the retail life actually was like . In the beginning I used to freak out when I was ringing up, but eventually you get the hang of it. I’m thankful Burlington gave me a try. Discounts & family discounts. It is very fast paced, but you get used to it. The employees are friendly & have a kind heart."
good,"Dependable, on time, hard worker, and very flexible. I am a people person, I help out others if needed. I am a team player and I will finish any projects I have that they will give to me"
good,"A typical day at burlington would be starting your day emptying your return bins. Adding sensors on items, placing items in the correct location, daily replenish, backup cashier, & more. Working at burlington has helped me become great at customer service. Its a great job that gives benefits an discounts to there employees."
good,"This was a fun environment to work in, all the people there were so nice and really knew how to treat a worker. Would recommend this company if you want to start out in a retail place."
good,"Managers could change a lot. People were friendly. Different hours day to day and week to week. Pay not great. Part time, no benefits. It is a retail store."
good,"As a college student, my schedule changes and has to be altered due to exams or class changes or things like that but it was difficult to get issues like that resolved,and when they did get fixed, my hours would decrease."
good,There are too many people for the job that has to be done. This creates a problem when the truck is small there are not enough hours for everyone to work more than 2 - 3 hours a day.  The people that work there are a good team and want to do a good job.
good,"The Company overall is a good company to work for. They start you off at a really low hourly rate compared to most LP Departments though and when you do get raises they hire people at a few cents less then you and expect you to train them. Management at my store was shaky and very wishy washy on every topic. "
good,Working at Burlington was overall a pleasant experience. I worked in the distribution center not the retail store. We were given raffle tickets and discounts
good,"I enjoyed the time I worked for Burlington,Burlington gave me my first start with retail and I developed some skills since I've been there now I'm ready to take it to the next level."
good,"Definitely need more room for advancing in management positions. Need more fulltime opportunities and better pay per hour. The employee discount is good, 15% regularly and 30% during certain times if the year"
good,I enjoyed working at burlington coat factory. All managers were great ! I only decided to leave and find another job just because of the fact that i was only getting about 20 hours a week
good,"Putting up the freight and trying to wait on customers was a little challenging, not enough employee schedule to perform the task and often times its was it would leave the customers a little displeased"
good,"Not for me, but great people at my location, just short staffed, lacked training, but easy to learn. Great discounts and weekly pay."
good,"Dealing with these customer was awonderful experience for me and also the associates, the management team are so superb I which every workplace was like that."
good,the location i was at was horrible. never again will i work at that location or for that store manger. pay was horrible. store manger got mad when someone took a break.
good,"Pay is above minimum, paid weekly on Fridays. Management works you hard and doesn't care if you are sick or injured. All management cares about is saving money. Some weeks you get 30+ hrs and some weeks you might get 12"
good,"Overall good job, just need more pay , for what associates do, we do tend to be in a lot of different places at times . And it is a little stressful ."
good,"I work in all the departments in the store. I’m a sales associate then they move me to cashier. Depending on how the store is, is where they place me at."
good,Burlington is a good company and everyone works as a team . It has  vanish and this vanish it all depend on the amount that has to be process.. Burlington is a hard work  environment
good,The Hours are very flexible if you are a college student. The pay is not so bad and the raises all depend on how the store does annually. The management team is sometimes the hardest thing to deal with but if you can get through them then your work experience should be good.
good,I thank burlington for giving me a job when i needed it but i think they didnt value their employees and it was not much advancement in the work place
good,"If you're looking for a well off job in the Sweetwater area at the Dolphin, I can promise you that is is well enough for you. However, the hours they provided me as a new worker made me feel extremely stressed out and personally I found myself often lost as to when my lunch break was, and many of the things that should be basically taught. I would work at another store in that mall were I you."
good,Ok place.  They want to help you be independent t.  However they lose sight of helping individuals grow in their careers.  It’s a constant reminder that seems to go unheard.
good,"Schedule is not done on time, the flow team supervisor uses overhead PA to give instructions,never addresses employees with respect no break time because ,you will be leaving in an hour, she sent associates on schedule to go back home simply because they were not on her backroom list without asking her supervisor, this is not the way a company should be run.Schedule is not made on time, but if the employee shows up according to the schedule on the board, they are sent home,oh sorry you are not on the schedule, and why was the employee not called /emailed to update the change?These are flaws that make a good company look bad.If not favored by the operations supervisor , you don't get the hours.The store manager is okay but it's time to step it up,time to ask herself why do trained employees leave the store that frequently and what can be done to make changes in leadership? Hope this helps to improve the business, JJ"
good,"Something was always getting stolen, there was too much favoritism,  many employees had an attitude. Stayed overnight to clean up the entire store, would leave late."
good,"a collaborative workplace environment with strong teams, complete autonomy in buying respective area."
good,Lack of teamwork favoritism from management to employee communication between employees and management needs Improvement open door policy not follow through hard-working employees are not appreciated
good,Working at Burlington as a cashier has given me an experience to interact with customers and understand what they need. I also work in any department they need help with.
good,"This is a great job for a teenager with free time, that’s it. They don’t pay enough period. They expect a lot & are focused on the company’s gain more than employees (that’s just my experience)"
good,"Buen patron, suben el sueldo anualmente dependiendo de tu evaluación"
good,"it was very unprofessional, it was always dirty, you had workers who never wanted to do their jobs, managers always sat in the office even when it got busy. the didn't wanna deal with rude customers etc."
good,"The hours per week have been less than stated.  The most hours in a week I've worked is 10, and was told 15-20 or more a week.  Training is minimal.  Personnel ae friendly and helpful."
good,Good place to work for extra money in summer part time. Workers are pleasant good atmosphere. New location with more room and good selection. Really enjoyed working here.
good,The job required alot of work and did not pay well or give enough hours. Also was lied to about the pay I was supposed to start at and when I confronted the Manager she was embarrassed to answer my questions or approve the amount we had agreed to in the interview.
good,A typical workday consists of checking out customers and keeping the sales floor clean. Managers are not good with communicating to their employees. The staff are friendly and are great to work with.
good,Good company to work for and will assist when you need any family time. They assisted me with keeping my job while taking care of personal issues. I am grateful for that assistance
good,"I worked at two different locations. The first one my store was great, the manager was totally cool with working with a schedule that would help me balance my life at home and work evenly. The second store the manager won't give me a schedule that'll work with my needs as a mom I'm always working weird hours. And I wasn't trained properly on the department they assigned me. I guess it's a hit or miss working in retail, the hours I'm working now would be a better fit for someone with no kids."
good,"Being my first paid job, I enjoyed working at Burlington. The holiday season was always hectic, but the coworkers made most days bearable and enjoyable. New employees can expect a relaxed workplace most of the time, but there will be times, usually on the weekends, where it'll be packed and you'll have little else to do but ring at the registers. I have the good fortune of having a great and understanding manager which means you actually have flexibility with scheduling. Advancement is certainly possible but don't bet on it unless you've been there for a few years and/or have significant previous experience. I wouldn't trade my experience at Burlington for anything, but I certainly wish the compensation was better."
good,"Es un trabajo donde no se brinda el suficiente apoyo al emplead para que pueda crecer,"
good,"I was working there just for money before my first child was born. Stocking, price check, inventory, and cashiering."
good,"Expected Better Hours, Most Employees Have a Second Job Or Go 2 School. Minimum Hours Per Week Is 12, Unless There's No Truck In Which Case They Drop."
good,"The hardest part of the job is having to do 10 things at once but normal in retail."
good,"In the store and time that I worked for the company, there were many good things about the company and a lot of frustrating things about the company.  The job needs to get done and as a salary person there were weeks that we worked up to 80 hrs in a week.  Getting positioned filled were an issue as mgmt. positions had to be run through the District Leader which took additional time to get these filled.  Meanwhile, you had to do your job plus the job of the areas that didn't have a mgr. in them.  On the plus side, we all made the best of the situations and uplifted each other during these times.  Teamwork was strong as a store and we helped each other out when needed.  Return policy was very strict at the beginning but was changed later which helped with getting new customers into the store and drive the sales."
good,"its a cool work place . when you go on break , you can look through all the beautiful cheap clothes that they have . very busy work place as well . people love to shop at Burlington"
good,Working at Burlington was a headache the only good thing were the customers. They have there favorite employees and were not fair with the hours they give out. The sales floor is disgusting because they lack employees.
good,"loved assisting others early in the morning to make the team get the ball rolling, we would occasionally run into issues with the store being too full of merchandise to the point where it would so hard to load any newer merchandise to the floor of the store because none of the last products had been sold, the management tried to assist as best as they could in this area of problem but even then this problem was constantly happening at the location I was working at"
good,"Burlington was a great job to have. I loved the work environment and the people that worked there. I did not agree with how some business was ran, but overall it was a perfect part time gig."
good,"Enjoyed team, peers and my store managers. Hours are long, job responsibilities and duties are increasing.  Manpower is decreasing. Not a good work/life balance."
good,"Burlington is a stressful place to work, as there is a lot of turnover among employees. There was flexibility with the scheduling, but I had a hard time accommodating my schedule around my family needs."
good,"well basic regular day as when doing your job, I learn what as what I was show to a limit extend. management reliable. the hardest part of the job is dealing with new temps, with no background check and don't know who you working with."
good,"Enjoyed working with the people, however, the pay is not good.  Too slow paced for me.  Low chance for advancement  No benefits provided.  No vacation time given"
good,I enjoyed my initial few years with the company but I was glad to move on. I have no ill will towards them but would not want to work for them again. There was no such thing as a life / work balance.
good,My formal company genuinely cares about the people who use our services and the staff who work hard to achieve great care and want the best experience for both. They are true to their values
good,Overall I learned a lot in my experience with the company.  From how to start everyday with excellent customer service in fast pace inviroment but also helping with life goals.
good,I worked day shifts so I arrived before opening. You clean up a little but you never know what to expect everyday. Always be professional with customers and everyone around you. The work culture is great but the customers can be a pain.
good,When I first stared they told me to clean all the mirrors in the store which I thought that sucked. The job got better I was upstairs in the women's and home department.
good,Friendly hard work on time is important work as a team ask questions if don’t have the questions tell management know when you can’t make it to or if you get sick or emergency
good,"Burlington is a welcoming work environment, managers are understanding and helpful when mistakes are made. Coworkers are friendly, kind, and respectful."
good,fast paced.....was great in beginning but then turned into a place with favoritism and drama that made it hard on a daily basis.  Turnover was very high after first year. Very enjoyable working with public.
good,Not a pleasant place to work.  Not very organized.  Not trained well.  Not many hours.   A lot of miscommunication. Not enough staff to cover all of the departments.
good,It was a fun place to work. Could be stressful at times like any other retail job. Managers are nice and will work with you if any issues. They are flexible with the hours.
good,"it was a unique place to work , you had your days that was great and days that was crazy especially around holidays but overall you could always come hole with a smile on your face"
good,The upper management expects so much of the store level employees and don't provide them with the tools they need to successfully do their job. Its a very stressful work enviorment.
good,Working for Burlington is one of those “first” hjobs type of feel.  It is about what you would expect working for retail a lot of work for very little pay. Management expect more than what they offer out of you. Favoritism among management.
good,Have to be hands on with every customer and also be very very attentive also have to be flexible in hours never a set time of work one week 20hrs next week 12hrs
good,The managers and supervisors have their favorites. They pick on you to do the other peoples job because they are standing around taking pictures or talking with their favorite people. Management takes the supervisors word over another employee.
good,"typical day at work while working in receiving would be removing items from freight and move items to appropriate pallet and then take items to their appropriate department. And then ticket, sensor, flow out clothing. it is a pretty demanding job as management has time constraints and you have lots of freight to flow out."
good,"Great team the whole time I was there as an employee. Learned a lot about asset protection, auditing, and layaway. Never really had to work long hours. I just wish the pay would have been a little better and the management team over asset protection."
good,An excellent department to work for considering most Lieutenants and below. Due to today's current political climate it is a challenging and stressful occupation. The members of your team are doing the right thing for the right reasons. The department's reputation is carried on the backs of the officers that do the work. The senior leadership are very disengaged from the actual work done by the officers. Fortunately the working staff truly care about the profession and work extremely
good,A place with no real management the people did what ever they wanted with no punishment. The old managers were too lenient with their employees. Not a good place to work if you want to work in sales
good,Was not satisfied with there rotating shifts and lack of recognition for there employees. There system on raises are unfair and unreasonable. I felt when I was in the shipping and recieving Dept. We were being underpaid.
good,I enjoy in working at the Burlington Coat Factory .They show me how to change the price on tags. And I also enjoying working with other people and helping the customers on what they need and show they where they are
good,Burlington is just an average job with no real end goal in sight. Depending on the management it could be great or awful. The job is just basic as every otheer retail store job.
good,"I have  been working at Burlington for 3 years "
good,"The company as a whole was not bad working for , just some of the management team was an issue . There are things that I felt could have been handled differently then what the manager did but I was just an assistant manager and my opinion did not matter to her"
good,"Very dynamic, fast paced atmosphere, results oriented high expectations and lots to learn."
good,its a big store with dirty customers. high prices and ugly clothes its not a place i want to shop or go in to its either low on items really dirty and bad services. That's not a place I would wan to work.
good,"worked on my own coworkers were helpful."
good,The job was part time so there were barely any hours offered. Besides the pay it was pretty laid back there and there were a few days we would have a rush
good,The job was hetitic working in the baby depot. You get a discount on the clothes & baby items. Well organized  with the lay out of everything . Ok pay
good,Good people to work with but not the most organized with their products. Easy to move up and go into different departments. Good about breaks and time off requests.
good,"While working at Burlington, I experienced working long hours with sometimes no break. Pay was decent, and as long as your willing to undergo rude customers and hectic scheduling, this is a good starting job."
good,It was ok for a first time job the coworkers are friendly and mangers are nice work is ok overall for a first job it was a nice stepping stone into the work force
good,"Poor Work Life Balance.  Long Opening and closing shifts. Budgeted hours are tight, Inconsistent truck schedule makes scheduling a team a bit challenging."
good,Working at burlington helped me with time management.as well skills of sortment.I would recomened others to work at burlington wharehouse.creating a good work enviromemt.
good,"It was fast paced but mellow, management would pop in and out and check on us but not super involved. The other employees were pleasant. The job itself left something to be desired but it's steady."
good,Low pay. Ninety percent of employees are from temp agencies that do not speak english. Hard to comunicate with employees. Safety concerns with language barriers.
good,No comment at this time. You need to work there to understand. I haven't learned anything new. Part time worker only get 12 to 13 hours a week. If your looking for more hours this isn't the place for you.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of getting to work on time and heading straight to the fitting rooms to put away clothing back on display, as well as making sure the store is clean and neat, hardest part of the job was when we had to rush to get the old store completely cleared out so heavy lifting about 75 pounds. the most enjoyable part of the job would be communicating with customers and helping them find merchandise as well as providing customers about their savings."
good,"Working here can get stressful and not give you weekends to do what you like to do. Sometimes not get enough hours for the week, sometimes you work 10 another time you can work 28"
good,I enjoyed the customers I enjoyed my job all the associates were great everyone had a team work ethic the store manager did a great job with morning meanings I left the company to pursue a management position with another company
good,very easy and laid back job you put away cloths make sure people dont steal and help people when it is need and cash them out so they can leave the store
good,I was on sales floor not sure what my job was not actually trained on anything. Cashiers got into arguments in front on customers on sales floor.  Very unorganised
good,I read reviews before I got this job and learned that many people thought management was poor and managers favoured certain people over everyone else. Hate to say they kind of do.
good,A typical day would start at  6 am but end by 11 am with the unpacking of dozens of boxes. Its good work for a teen just starting a job and needs low hours but has the chance to work more if they want.
good,"Alot of work load. can be very stressful at times. "
good,A typical day for me at burlington was unloading the truck early in the morning. That was just the start of the day. Burlington was a very fast paced place to work and you had to work as a team to get the job done. My favorite part of the job was getting a chance to meet new people and learning the job.
good,"Rude managers but that's a given at any store. Definitely recommend cashiering over sales floor work. "
good,We got paid every week which was a bonus because you were never completely broke but hourly pay wasnt too great unless youre part of management. The bad part about the job was that people would throw clothes everywhere so if youre closing your hours are unpredictable.
good,"I enjoyed the team I worked with and the customers.  At the time when I started the company had just change ownership.  There were a lot of changes in the store operations during this change, which cause stress on the management team. It seems that things are more stable and the company also went public."
good,"Overall, none yet. The hardest part is trying to elevate our systems and standards to that which we elevate our clients to. Some expect that we would be best-in-class on all things Human Capital, but that is tough and something we are working on."
good,"a typical day- helping customers find items, working the cashiers, putting go backs away, cleaning up all day"
good,I worked mainly as a cashier and most of the time there is a long line so it is our job to get the line down and give customers the best customer service we could while performing their transactions.
good,"I like work with my co-worker we as a team did good, we all got alone with each other. as a team player I learn a lot working in at Burlington, we always help each other."
good,I really don't enjoy the workplace environment at Burlington. There is a lot of gossip and ill feelings towards others. I will say that it is a busy store and takes a lot out of you standing for such a long time
good,"It was an ok place to work. It was steady and once used to it, it was easy enough to do without really thinking or trying too hard. Wasn't many hours though"
good,I would mostly come in and do the same thing each day. I only worked 5 hours so It wasn't bad and I got to choose my hours. I had to wear all black as a uniform . I helped customers when needed and restocked and reorganize for my 5 hours and would do the same in repeat each day.
good,"You do not get any work hours, I work less than 20 hours a week, They push you to work fast so that they can tell you to clock out early before your 4 hours is up."
good,Ensured customers met all expectations and made customers shopping experience a good one. Very fast pace and exciting place to work. I would recommend this job for anyone looking for something temporary.
good,Burlington management was a joke they went through many different managers and supervisors. they had ridiculous demand on the employees which was not a happy place to work at. especially during the holidays
good,"-they expect too much for the small pay they give its workers."
good,It was an okay job but not for me.  I lived the people I worked with.  Everyone was pretty nice and the bosses were fun to work with.  Overall I liked it
good,"Wish the people were more friendly, very stressful place to work. Fast pace, hard work very tiring. Many departments to work in some good some not so good."
good,Great workplace environment very productive and very customer oriented. Management skills at a minimum for product production. No opportunities for success.
good,"If you are looking for a position that will teach you about retail, this is where to go. If you want to learn about being a cashier, as well as being on the floor, they will teach you both. If you are more interested in just being behind a register, this is not the job for you."
good,"A typical day started at around 5am and ran until about 2 or 3 pm. Management was a bit chaotic at times as Associates had 3-4 supervisors above them (Store Manager, Ops Manager, Manager and Team Leader) who would sometimes give conflicting directions."
good,Great place to work and great people to work with . I loved the hours I worked and the people that I met while at work . Apply there you won’t regret it
good,People go in and out of that place like the weather changing.  Looks like it has gotten better in the past years.  Stores keep less on the product causing less mess.
good,"Burlington as a whole worked well, they worked with my schedule, they were understanding and the managers were always well spoken i have no problems with them"
good,"It's a retail job that's much like any other. The management is aggravating and hours are only moderately predictable, but the job itself isn't that hard."
good,Training of management needs to be taken more seriously.  If this company would invest in training their talent with in their building and promote this would be a great place to retire with.
good,Fitting rooms need to be updated and kept clean constantly making sure there are no censors removed. Management did not lead by example. Culture in the work place is fun and inviting.
good,Work fast pace with a balance of my school  work. The life of work at night and ring customers up with clothes and shoes and other items. Love speaking with other people and helping them with what they was looking for.
good,"I worked for the company it was totally different that it is now so I can't really speak on much. it was a little more upscale when I worked for them, they had moved to the wood wall hanging instead of the h racks. We wore descent clothes and not khakis and a black shirt.  Just different"
good,Receiving/Put-Away: Unload inbound shipments safely and move product to storage locations.Efficiently stack and store the merchandise in the appropriate areas.
good,Its great that you get paid weekly but the pay is garbage for the amount of work you put in daily in a large store. Also i was a supervisor and the pay was only a dollar more than the average sales floor employee. Overall great people to work with but the benefits and pay lacked tremendously.
good,worked in shoe department ran back and forth from cashier to shoe department store was not organized at all my department manager was always stressed because of her management crew so that made my job stressful but now its new management so it may be better
good,"This was my first job while attending high school. Learned a lot about retail, specifically about professional clothing. Learned how to measure for dress shirts and suits."
good,it wasnt the best place to work they made sure you got less the 20 hrs a week.. I never saw a pay check sub when I worked there.. its so unorganized!!
good,"I enjoyed helping the customers. The worst part was the fact that we were constantly under staffed. It was a big store and you, most days, had to cover two or three sections."
good,"great place to work"
good,A typical day at work was relaxed but yet interesting .Management consisted of  great people. The hardest part of the job was not being able to satisfy every customer.
good,i love working at burlington coat it gives everyone the oportunity to grow in the company and i love customer service but to poor working hours and i had to relocate
good,Working at Burlington Distribution Center was only difficult only in the sense that the company employees treat the temps unfairly. The job is very easy but its hard to reach quota when the company employees take your boxes.
good,Working there was a great place to see how retail stores work. They teach you all you need know about retail. From management to workers on th the floor.
good,"A typical day at work was not stressful however the majority of the clientele/customers that Burlington attracts are extremely hostile, angry and low income."
good,The environment was not friendly and often we were under staffed with not proper equipment. I learned to be more independent from working there. I enjoyed the freedom but did not like how unprofessional some managers were.
good,"I have a lot of fun working at Burlington, my coworkers are great, management is friendly & helpful, they're pretty flexible when it comes to availability issues, but all that niceness comes at a cost, no matter what position, you're starting at minimum wage, even if you have prior experience. You only get 30 minutes for lunch, so if you want to enjoy your food, you have to do it quickly."
good,"A typical day is steadily productive, if not very productive. Most definitely will have your feet tired and ready to go home by the end of the shift. I've learned cashiering, customer service, phone etiquette, noticing theft and how to better prevent theft, team work, inventory, making price tags and marking down prices, layaway, and leadership. Management is very open to the needs and schedules of their employees and are more than willing to work with school & personal schedules as well as health issues and emergencies. The workplace is very very friendly. Everyone gets along with each other and all the employees are happy to help one another. The hardest part is working through the holiday season. The most enjoyable part is the employees/work environment."
good,The best thing about burlington was the people i worked with. They all were friendly. I also enjoyed talking to the customers that would come in everyday
good,I enjoyed working with the people at Burlington.  My manager was awesome and I hate that I had to leave.  I feel the pay should match the work that is being performed.
good,"They're friendly!"
good,The job requirements are greater than the pay. The company expects a lot from their employees and does not compensate accordingly. associates that show promise can advance and rather quickly as in my case. The turnover is very high making training ongoing and very difficult.
good,"Productive but stressful. Must be ready for busy weekends, and sometimes weekdays. Cashiers have many responsibilities. Hours seem long, but not if you are working hard."
good,"Great for a high school or college student, great part time job, not for someone who's career is going in a different direction, you will interact with all backgrounds"
good,great starting job or second job and great employee discounts greeat staff and great management no isssues here id go back if need be they are nationwide so its job security
good,The store was too huge and there were not enough employees to balance off the work load. There was a lack of communication amongst the managers and the employees.
good,"have to be fast when working in current positions. good job but hours were very late, supervisors very good people and cool and understandable. I learned a lot especially working with scanners"
good,"Was not able to grow professionally. At the same time, one person was asked to do the job of 3 more. Unrealistic goals for sales and productivity. Corporate greed above anything else."
good,"I don't mind working there. It can get annoying because of the managers, customers and other employees. They don't give you all the hours you want, so do not expect to work there full time"
good,"I worked for Burlington.I stared out as a cashier and went to other areas of the store.I worked and ran the cash office as well as working and running the recieving area, I work on the sales floor and was manager of several departments I finished my career as the CSLM I learned to merchnish and payroll and learned some items on the computer."
good,"All jobs can vary even from store to store, but the Burlington I work at is pretty easy work. Managers for the most part are easy to work with and training is pretty good if you ask."
good,I did cleaning through a sub contractor at burlington. But it was a nice environment and very workable.I would recommend it to any one. I would definitely work for the company.
good,"Poor communication overall. I was an LP and thevstore manager was not my boss, apparently. If I needed something, I had to get in contact with someone who barely came to our store. It was justvso informal and really annoying."
good,"I loved my coworkers and sure, the workload could be intense, but we did as much as we could and the overnight managers were understanding. There's really not much to say about it."
good,"Majority of the time it was high pasted , the scheduling wasn't too great and as a part timer it was hard to make a living. I learned to work quickly because the scheduling was always understaffed. I found myself doing above my job duties. It was a very stressful environment because of poor management."
good,Need better management but it’s a nice job. You get paid every week & you get serval breaks. Good hours during holiday season but they cut your hours when they hire new people
good,If you are a hard working individual this is the perfect job for you. There is always something to do to help time pass and most of the employees are easy to work with.
good,I worked in receiving I unloaded the business truck with the company items.The job was very laid back and the staff was very friendly. I would really reapply to work there
good,Typical day always busy early afternoon until closing time. Friendly coworkers. The only problem was getting to open an account to see my paystub online nobody had any answers for me on how to help me.
good,"Good place to start out in to gain work experience. Not so much if you're trying to make a living, poor pay. They don't offer any benefits and the amount of work is not worth the small amount they pay you."
good,This job was very good when it came down to most things like weekly pay and even the hours were pretty good. But there were times when the hours were very insufficient.
good,"Come in with uniform clock in, sign in to a register, and count your till. Greet customers ask them if they found everything they are looking for. Ring up the items tell them there total and ask if they would like to pay cash or credit. On some down time clean your area. Sometime go on the floor and clean up, pick up the clothes, put them in there correct place."
good,"Not too many incentives to do a good job, management hardly recognizes effort, not a great discount., Overall, I felt I was extremely under appreciated for the work I put in."
good,What I didn't like was the fact that us sales associates had to help the cashiers but the cashiers didn't need to help us and they had a point system so if you get sick a lot. You're in trouble.
good,"El trabajo para esta empresa fue excelente , estuve poco tiempo pero trabajar con ellos fue genial."
good,Usually I worked on register an dealt with customers. I wasn't a huge fan of being on the register because there wasn't a lot of training before I was put on the register.
good,"Working in this establishment, a typical day is going to your floor manager and they tell you your task of the day. Working here, I have learned about customer service and how to help people find what they are looking for. The management was great, if you had any issues, they were willing to listen and work with you. In the work area, the diversity was good and they were open to any and everyone. The hardest part about this job dealing with rude people who don't clean up after themselves. The most enjoyable part of this job is helping others."
good,my job was asset Protection. The company doesn't put enough resources or man power into an important part of their day to day operations which is security.
good,Good company to work for if you are young and just stating a family.  Teaches you customer service skills and cashiering skills. most of the job consist of cleaning
good,"I learned management plus from the yrs begin, some days were busy some was slow, the most joyable was dealing with customers, nothing really hard to me"
good,"Some days i worked out on the floor moving inventory in or off the floor. Put price tag on items after unload trucks with forklift, also did inventory on things coming in"
good,Most relaxed place in retail. My coworkers where amazing also. The days went by faster with my team there. During the holidays it was crazy but we always made it enjoyable.
good,It’s good for kids that are in school and want to work 3-4 hours and 2-3 times a week................ pay rate is bad. You can be the best associate and they won’t raise your pay.
good,its a great start when your a teenager or retired. no advancement. work day here stocking clothes making sure the store is clean. customer service here was a plus.
good,"Too much co-op required in a fast pace environment."
good,The managers play favorites. You cannot get full time it's almost impossible. Worked until close and had to open. The discounts we're nice and enjoyed fellow associates.
good,Working here was a great opportunity. Fast friendly customer service and always willing to help. Customers come fist with fast accurate customer service helping every need.
good,I just think the pay is not good. They was paying me $9.00 per hourly and I think they should be give you a pay in the $11.00 per hourly because this job have more responsibilities is not only be a cashier you learn to do every job since the register until work with the merchandise in the back.
good,This job taught a lot about organization. Also the staff was very respectful. This job also taught me to have respect for costumers even when they are not that polite.
good,met some very nice co-worker as today I continued a friendship with.  management was not stable.  Every year had a new store manager.  pay was not great.
good,"Great place to work. I love the managers when I worked here, but the have new management now. Co workers were great a very supportive. Getting paid every week was good"
good,"Burlington coat factory is a retail store. It gets busy during the holiday season, so you will defiantly work harder & much longer hours during that time."
good,It was a job. I went to work and made my money to support my kids. Kinda boring though but it’s all good . A job is a job ya feel me. I got a better one tho
good,Management just needs better communication. It was a good place to work overall. They worked with me and my schedule when i had to switch my work times.
good,As a receiving associate there are a variety of tasks to perform on any given shift. I enjoy the physical demands of the receiving department. i enjoy meeting challenges of multi-tasking.
good,It’s okay. Very fast paced and the management was okay. Co workers were okay they were a little rude. Good job if your patient and a fast learner  needs better management.
good,work in the back. Setup all the clothes. And my father has a heart attack. I had to movie back to new jersey to take care of now deceased father. I miss it
good,job after high school easy slow at times super busy during holiday times its ok still open great for summer jobs or after school.some of the people i use to work with are still there so i guess its got some stay around if your in the right position.
good,I liked working there I had to quit to take care of my children at the time my middle daughter was going through some behavioral issues and the manager told me my job or my child so I chose my child
good,Very fast paced. No room for someone looking to 'just' work. You can grow but you need to be focused and diligent. The budget is tight.  Hard to accomodate everyday needs.
good,It was nice meeting new people and assisting customers. The only thing I didn't agree with were the hours and the pay. For the regular employees it was part time and a lot of work to get done in a short time.
good,Depending on who the manager is you may get decent training. The employees I worked with in the store were great but upper management will take advantage of you.
good,good experience always making sure everything gets marked down in order for customers to buy. and also ensuring that racks are neat and in place. i got the whole retail expirence.
good,over all not a good neighborhood and no good communication with associates and managers. have to be there more than 3 years to even move up in the store.
good,"Most adapt on the fly. Training can use some improvement, but if you can adapt with little training, can be a place for work experience. High turnover rate."
good,"Fast paced, active work place, many employees, packing picking, shipping, inventory, hardest part was 12+ hours on feet. most enjoyable part was taking a lunch break"
good,"Affix label to incoming merchandise from suppliers to input quantities into system and determine correct location for routing to storage or shipment areas."
good,"beginner job experience considering the fact you get paid minimum wage. good place to work if you like shopping for a wide variety of things, staff was a bit lazy"
good,Working here is fun but the pay sucks. Not a job that pays the bills.The manager are friendly and sometime helpful. Working here has alot of up and down.
good,"I didnt really like being a cashier all day long. It was better to be on the floor rather than just standing at the front end, bagging the customer's items."
good,Burlington is a great company to work for. My Team is great!  Opportunity for growth is a bit hard. Good for those who are looking  for a part-time position.
good,It was a job for someone looking for their first job. It was boring and didn't pay great. They always stuck to the bare minimum wage. Didn't care if employees came in high and gave few hours.
good,I am not one for retail but this enviorment was very busy and very fast work place. Some people in the area where very rude but still smile and great them with positivity
good,I wasn't thrilled the the company not its morals therefor I chose to leave the company once I moved and find a better job in pay and in ideals as well.
good,Not a bad second job.  Needed better camera system to do required work.  A lot of times we were short handed and management did not want to pursue charges.
good,I have to say the hardest part of the job was trying to recieve more hours. Every week would not be the same amount of hours. There would be some weeks at 12 hour then some weeks at 28 hours.
good,"always busy, stressful too much too clean, getting out at 1am and made shure to satisfy the customer. learned how to organized displays and maintain my area and kept up with the go backs."
good,"Terrible management, receiving pay is very low and it's part time, it's not the best to work at. if it was more hours it would be a better place but unifortunily it's not"
good,"It's fast-paced and a lot of hard work . Supervisor wasn't really hands on, was always gone. My co workers did their job just as well as I did. It wasn't hard to catch on to the work that was being done, that I had to do for the position as well."
good,Fun job very fast paste very easy and everyone is real respectful including managers and supervisors. I would have tried to make a career at Burlington if there were more hours.
good,"Good workplace culture"
good,"my experience wasnt the best because of a lot of factors, but i love the company itself and still shop there. Im not going to say every store will be like the one i worked out, they're a good company"
good,"nice slow past everyday ts thousand of people with different of attitudes of all kinds,my crew numbers n manger's are cool also we get discounts on our food the hrdest part is rush hour time most of all I love to hear yes thanks everythings in here"
good,All I remember is a dirty store all the time and lazy management. Hours were all over the place. No security in store and a lot of stealing goin on. I did meet some great people.
good,Burlington is an OK company to work for.  However at the location the management as well as the HR team is not on  the same page. There is a lot of back door sneaky things that go on at this location
good,"The staff and mangers are friendly & willing to help when need, hours can be slow from time to time, goals are met 60 to 80% of time for store benefits"
good,"The manager was excellent. The pay rate was low as the minimum wage in Kenosha, WI is still $8.25. Overall, it's an average retail job, with pretty consistent hours per week."
good,Needs better communication between management and associates. Should also implement a thorough training process. Room for improvement in regards to training employees.
good,I have worked for Burlington many years ago and I am quite sure things have change tremendously since my time there. I would highly recommend a friend or family member to work there.
good,"It was a fun experience to have the ""up close"" customer service experience. You learn a lot having to be knowledgable about your products you sell. Overall, it was a pleasant work place."
good,If you need the money and dont have a job for the holidays then go right ahead. As a place to grow and make a career out of i wouldnt not suggest it to anyone.
good,"Paid once a week. Receiving very laid back. Once inventory received, it needs to be priced and sensored if over a certain amount of money and put out on the sales floor."
good,"Its a slow pace job"
good,"Your on your feet all day, the management staff was really tuff but I worked there back in 1995 over 21 years ago, I'm sure they have changed significantly by now."
good,Often short staffed but ok place to work I enjoyed my time there with the staff I had. Moved on to a better opportunity pay wise but would recommend to others
good,It was a nice place to work but a bit unorganized. I didn't like the layaway process the customers had to wait long periods of time to receive their belongings because of the cluttered closets.
good,"fast paced environment, helps you get the beginning fundamentals of a staring job. very little opportunities to advance in the company. low hours are given"
good,did not like this job for having to be there the sun was up and having to unload a ton of boxes in a couple of hours and getting all the supplies on the floor the pay wasnt good enough
good,"Busy, fast-paced and under-staffed most of the time. Breaks were fair. Great place to build teamwork and patience. Closing up was a pain, due to the abundance of clothes. For the most part, it was a good part-time job."
good,"the hours were all mixed up they wouldnt work with my schedule "
good,They have a sense of family orientated vision but lack a team effort the managentment isn't that great for people of work there  some are treated unfairly
good,"Every day is diferent. You learn a new rule, a new task and meet a new employee. Management are always keeping up with the newest fashion and trends and allow it to show on the sales floor."
good,"i didnt like this job at all "
good,Decent company to work for. Work life balance in a concern and question. Micro managing superiors make for difficult working environment.  Great pay and good benefits.
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with, they were all friendly and helpful. Overall, their team effort is great especially in the busiest time of the year."
good,"through out my time i was there i went through pretty much all of the departments in the store. i learned about how the business sales work, i answered phone calls, i worked layaway."
good,I loved my job. No matter how many hours we ever ended up working I always felt like I accomplished something. I learned something new every night and got to know the store just as my original goal had been.
good,"I would describe my experience at Burlington Coat Factory as your average retail job. The challenge often times is working with difficult customers, but all in all, I didn't find my experience there all that negative."
good,A typical day at Burlington was processing merchandise and placement of merchandise on floor. Learned all aspects of warehouse functions and worked some short days as some were longer just depending on the number of boxes received.
good,"Working at Burlington, I learned how to talk and handle customers with care. It taught me how to be friendly towards others. Overall it was a good job experience."
good,Ok company to work for. They need some management improvement. If they change the management and give more benefits and higher minimum wage for the workers
good,Always opportunities for extra shifts. Job advancement opportunities  and employees appreciated for their hard work. Managers  rewarded employees with breakfast and lunch for associates.
good,"Overall the employees are very nice people. The store had its days where it would be very messy and hard to put things back in place. The lines would be very long, they need longer times to teach cashiers."
good,"I appreciated the opportunity to further my level of job experience however, the store that I worked at was ran poorly.  I would not work at another store owned by this company."
good,Okay place to work.  I worked here for a year and ended up quitting.  I was lucky to work two days a week.  The store was always a mess from disrespectful customers.
good,"I learned a great deal about the company and customer service skills and leading a team. I was happy that i was moving up with the company, however after time it does seem like the company is a little cheap and it does not have a great benefits to its employees."
good,"I enjoyed working at Burlington mostly for the associates I worked with and management. There were some days the job could be very demanding and other days very slow. Personally, I learned a lot from this job and developed great communication skills as well as patience."
good,"mainly enjoyed working with co-workers, and seeing familiar customers. The benefits are not good except for the discounts."
good,Good job for college students but must be willing to work night and weekends. The pay is not that great but good for a part time job. Must be able to work during the holidays
good,checking in boxes of freight and unloading hanging clothes labeling getting ready for sales floor. Hardest part was not enough hours in the day. most enjoyable was putting stock out on sales floor.
good,we unloaded the truck placed all items on pallets then sorted them into boxes then put the boxes on carts rolled them out onto the sales floor then stocked the racks
good,"doing the regular job as cashier, we have to deal with difficult customer but the manager help us out if the situation is out of control.  I learn to be patient and understand customers"
good,i was employed through the summer youth program so there were many other kids my age which was pretty troublesome. Everyone thought they didn't have to work so there wasn't much effort going on.
good,Burlington factory is a very fun and  Productive workplace. Everyday that i arrive to work there is always a task on at hand that always keeps me bust for the entirety of my schedule. the only problem is that the pay there is not much to talk about.
good,"Alright communicated with customers about their needs. Gained a lot of insight into store operations. Company's culture was standard, pay was minimum wage,"
good,It's OK not bad every company I'm sure needs room for improvement this one needs a few within management  and better organization but that is where I fit to make things better
good,Working at Burlington Coat factory was a really relaxed job. Yes at times there where situations that could've been handled differently but overall it was OK. Management and workers there have poorly communication.
good,typical day at work was helping customers that came in the store. I learned customer service. management was helpful. the work place was a good environment to work.
good,"started there for an internship  but after learning there is better works place i wouldn't recommend it for a long time job to grow yourself , not really organized"
good,Customer service requires extreme patience and understanding.  Dealing with different customers each day and having to be flexible to the changes and needs of the store are important.
good,"A typical day would be clocking in, setting up to process and stock all merchandise then when that's done process the clothes and shoes. The hardest part is just how fast paced they want you to be."
good,Friendly co-workers. flexible hours. worked around me school schedule. Hardest part of the job was sales goals. They are sometimes unrealistic and hard to reach.
good,Friendly enviroment to work for. For the most part friendly associates to work with. Worked part-time hours but was able to work a good schedule. Management was friendly
good,It was a good place to work at after i got out of high school and was managing college at the same time. Really enjoyed the staff i was working with except one supervisor.
good,It was a cool place to work they had great workers and a good experience people were nice and it was a great environment I had a bunch of different experiences there
good,"Working at Burlington Coat Factory, Was beneficial for me as a human being, but also disappointing to see such a big company do so little for hard workers like myself. Waking up at 400 and getting started working at 600 and getting off at 1400 was excellent. had a job done by the early afternoon and then had time for personal tasks in my day. I'm glad Burlington had such hours, but other employees saw it as rendering, and not worth it"
good,fast paced and thick skin because sometimes costumers can be REALLY RUDE. But its a good place to work in.  Alot of work but it keeps you busy and make sure to ask for help because you will be lost. Especially with the merchandise
good,"a typical day at work. were very busy messy. I learned what you actually do in retail. cleaning, tagging, clean dressing rooms. hanging clothes on its right racks."
good,"Boynton Beach store is poorly organized. Management can be very condescending at times. As hard as I try, no one ever says ""good job"". Bathrooms are poorly lit and rarely clean. There is no formal training. Fellow employees are friendly and willing to help most of the time."
good,"Job was not that great, the management was slow and the hours were not to my choosing making it sometimes hard to handle school and work. I would not apply to work there again."
good,Burlington is a great company for young or older adults who just started working or just getting back into the working field. The job is very flexible.
good,I have  thousands of thing I could say but wont I did not like how the employees were treated  by mangment. If it wasnt the mangment team talking about employees to others that alone is not okay.
good,"The coworkers are helpful and entertain you because it gets very boring at times, very easy to get the hang of the retail experience but the management isn't the best, not a lot of opportunity to grow unless you are there for way too many years and the part time gives too little hours"
good,I helped ensure the men's wear was stocked properly. I helped customers when they needed assistance.  This was a beginning job for me so began to learn my customer service skills.
good,"Burlington has given me a great opportunity, the challenges I have experienced are with staffing, and the support from my store manager. My day is filled with lots of decision making, customer service and working with lots of different personalities. Making sure our customers have a great experience is my main focus."
good,I have to say the time I worked for the company I enjoyed the people I worked with there. Supervisor was very informing on the work that we had to do.
good,I would say working here was not at all difficult. Once you got your task for the day you were set. Management was very unprofessional. Clean workplace
good,"I was not in the best health at the time but I tried my best when working there."
good,"Helped customers find products or prices of an item."
good,"Working at Burlington Coat Factory(Burlington Stores) was a great experience. It was rewarding being able to help customers locate items in other Burlington stores,by locating the items in another location from the computer. Hopefully Burlington has gotten away from the packing up cloths from one season to the next season. That's a lot of wasted payroll dollars!!!"
good,Productive good place to work a typical day at work is greeting and meeting people. You must have a positive attitude and good ethics. Co works are friendly and dependable. The hardest part of the job is cleaning and organizing items after the customers. Meeting and greeting people.
good,Okkmmmmk)mkkkkbgffvbn22 I 322hhhnnnb cuff bracelet the other was messed with 55bbhh and a g of the other was messed up attitudes toward an increase in the number of people are still need da check stubs when you get a chance for something else doe the
good,"A typical day involved helping customers in the men's department and occasionally working registers and performing maintenance."
good,I love the discount and helping the customers. I didn't like people that came into the store to steal.  I love the prices. I loved working customer service. I started out as a sales floor person and in two months I moved up to customer service rep. You move around alot which is good exercise
good,Its a good work environment. The job isn't too demanding its really chill and laid back. Its good for work experience especially for young people and students
good,"Employment consist of providing satisfactory customer service. I was able to engage with different customers and employees. However, due to lack of volume there was not much to do."
good,"At Burlington a shift consisted of ringing out customers and helping them find what they were looking for. Or helping them return something they didn't like. I answered phones and interacted with a bunch of people throughout the day and it was very fun. The managers were awesome I never had a problem with working there other than I wouldn't get enough hours during the week. The Hardest park about the job was "" the customers are always right"" even when sometimes they really weren't and they would request a manager. i learned how to communicate more with working here, I was a hermit hiding under its shell and once I started working upfront I couldn't be and I had to talk to people."
good,I'm sorry but it seems that it's all about favoritism and it seems to be very sexist at this company. I have worked for this company for almost two years as a material handler and in recent events sent me back to ticketing ( which is placing price tags on the items before they get shipped to stores) I don't understand after all this time why send me back!! I have talked to management and got told to pretty much deal with it.
good,management is horrible.The customers are rude and really messy.There is always kids swinging on the clothing racks and yelling.Really the only plus is you get paid every week.
good,enjoyed meeting new customers and learning about the cash office procedures done each day I helped the managers with.i trained the new employees at the cash registers and customer service
good,"I worked shoes and merchandising. I various hours and days."
good,"I enjoyed my time there, I learned a lot from my co workers who taught me. I wish all the best of luck. The hardest part is the constant changing of procedures between managers."
good,A typical day is relaxed. You don't have to worry about keeping your eye out for thieves because loss prevention handles that.
good,"The management did not work as one. This place was unorganized. The co-workers was fine, but had little problems every now and then. There was no hard part for this job for me."
good,Truck starts early at 6 am. You could work 3 hours or you could work 8. Hours change frequently some times more than once in a day. Lack of training leads to problems.
good,It was a good job and it was good but the wage was low. I need a better job in my field . I have to say the hardest time was when the manager have call out and I have to stay longer in my dept.
good,good money but you have to do a lot.  have to check people out and answer phones also clean the store during the day which can get really messy at times
good,"I appreciate the opportunity that Burlington Coat Factory afforded me. It was a great part of my personal story. They treated me fairly, and the pay was okay for the economy in Boise."
good,"The typical day at working at Burlington was very calm, the store was always busy so there was always something to do. I learned how to become more comfortable with talking to the customers. Overall its a good place to work and you'll definitely learn new skills there"
good,"Standard Retail work. Overwhelming most of the time. hard to commit to this company as a career, since no one ever makes you feel valuable as an employee."
good,I had an good experience with this company. Just certain things I didn't agree with. Over all good company. The employees and the manager were fun to work with.
good,I was in shipping. I learned the correct way how to pick up a box how to lift a box. management was good there help out a lot. I had fun doing what I do
good,Management sucked and they did not care about their people. There was always something to be done never a dull moment. The hours were set and the pay rate was acceptable back then.
good,Great place to work for beginners with no experience. I enjoyed having contact with customers and assisting them. This job gives you a lot of social skill experience.
good,It is a very productive and fun enviorment. The co-workers are very positive and helpful. The management is very helpful and kind.
good,"Employees are lazy, not enough hours to go around. Tags on merchandise are always missing. A lot of international customers."
good,Good place to start. Started as a cashier and was taught so much more and moved up to Customer Service Rep.  The staff were friendly and management were on hand employees.
good,Customer service.....did not learn much given my previous experience. Management was very unorganized. Co-workers did not want to do their jobs cause of poor work environment. Hardest part of job was getting things done without support of management. Best part of job was satisfying customers
good,Everyone treats you with respect.  I loved being there because there was always someone to talk to about anything. But the only reason that they did not get a 5-star from me is because it seemed like i wasn't going to get a raise.
good,"Although it has been a comfortable work environment, it has only become comfortable because I became used to my surroundings. the management tend to be bullies."
good,"Slow days, Long Nights Big Messes everywhere "
good,great place to go for a part time job/seasonal. ended up finding a job that pays better. Store manager is very nice and so is her assistant. Lots of Assyrians work here too.
good,"On a typical day at work you would do whatever it is that you where hired to do and help out customers whenever they need help, you learn how to deal with all types of people on an day to day bases, my co-workers were great as well as management."
good,"really its a very good project.i am vr happy for working this..i learned so,much..initially when i build a cube i don't haveany knowledge regarding that..now i am very good in building cubes and writing mdx queries"
good,These company is not a bad job to work at. I think they need system to show when your somebody draw is short.everybody should have their own draw not share draw
good,"Great Location for easy lunch ideas "
good,"Mainly short days, generally only 4 hours a day. I cash customers out when they are finished shopping. Management is ok. I work with a lot of young coworkers, so that in itself is a challenge. There really is no hard part of my job."
good,"The main manager at this particular store made working there very inconvenient. She would not easily work with my schedule for school and made it very hard to get a requested day off. She also made me feel attacked in many occasions, would say my department wasn't clean when only a few things were on the floor, or would schedule me alone in the biggest parts of the store. Overall, I enjoyed the employee, but got sick of being walked on by the manager."
good,". long work days"
good,Unorganized at the end of the day with high demand for cleaning. Definitely need patience. Just be prepared to never leave on time
good,"had long hours, stubborn management, don't do as they say. Break rules to the advantage. Work flow isn't consistent, benefits are okay, long wait if you are a temp-to-hire"
good,the only thing I could say about this store that it only had flexible hours to work the managers were pretty good but their was always something to do I was never bored if I didn't work in the stockroom I worked as a cahier to help out
good,"As a very experienced worker with a strong background in customer service, I have learned how to handle irate customers while still holding up company standards. I have received customer service awards for my work .Management treats me very well, but with my educational background, I need a much more intellectually challenging workplace. I enjoy working with the public, but the job can be very tedious."
good,A typical day was usually busy. I learned how to get my job done quickly and efficiently. I also learned the importance of great customer service. Management was mostly good. I got along with all my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was cleaning up at the end of each shift. The most enjoyable part was being able to make a customer happy.
good,Other coworkers are normally fun to be around. Some of the management is'nt so great but the receiving supervisors are always the ones who are on point.
good,"- I learned at my old job was that no matter how difficult a customer may be still smile and make them feel comfortable at your work place. "
good,"Burlington doesn't pay much, $8.00 hr starting and the biggest issue is that they never give a consistent schedule when people need it. Coworkers are great and management is good as long as you keep away and don't ask anything from them. Typically there's so much turnover that we have to work more and more as the season gets busier and corporate wants everything done in the most ""efficient"" way. That being said if you get a visit from corporate expect for them to treat you like a 2 year old that doesn't understand anything."
good,i learned how to be patient and more friendly management was unorganized what i enjoyed most about the job was  meeting new people and my coworkers i worked with.
good,"Burlington is a good job while waiting for another job to open up. The management was not pleasant and neither was the pay but had great hours, great discount, and the weekly pay was definitely helpful."
good,"•	Answer telephones and give information to callers, take messages, or transfer calls to appropriate individuals."
good,"Fun and diverse on a daily basis,management was pretty good for the most no complaints they were pretty fair. Can't complain about my co-workers."
good,Bosses love to gossip and treat workers unfair. Very unorganized. tell you your gonna get hours but then never put you on the schedule.
good,This is a good company to work for. The hours vary depending on business. The managers were nice and cared about their employees. I would recommend this job to someone else. The pay is
good,"A typical day at Burlington is to look at reports, cash, open and close."
good,Arcadia's branch has always been a delight to work in.  The coworkers and customers are generally very friendly and the hours are good for someone needing some extra spending money.
good,"A typical day at Burlington is usually with long lines which makes us busy almost every day but it goes by fast. I learned that staying positive while working there is a good vibe knowing that the store only gives good energy and does not have difficulties working there. The management is great. I had great mangers who were willing to help us whenever we needed help nor a customer will have troubles and my manager will be there to help them also. My coworkers were easy to get along with and were focused when the job has to be done. The hardest part of the job would probably have to be cleaning up, knowing that we have to put the stuff in the right spot would have to be the worst part of the job. Lastly, the most enjoyable part of the job would be getting to connect with the customers even if it would be a short period of time conversating with them."
good,Burlington is a decent place to work part time if you only need a few hours.  They also provide opportunities to transfer to other stores but they show a lot of favoritism.
good,"There were many times where customers would come up to the registers with items that had lost their sales tags. To find numbers for the product, we would have to call different stores and put in every item number that was on the actual fabric tag to see what we could come up with so we could sell the item. This would hold up the lines frequently and take up to 20-30 minutes sometimes."
good,"I learned how to deal with rude customers in a professional manner. My manger was a great boss to work for, the hardest part of the job was standing on my feet all day."
good,The work and the employees were good but I knew it would be a seasonal job. Not too much room to advance. Overall I was grateful for the chance to work for a company as good as Burlington Coat Factory.
good,"A typical day at work was productive, and the co-workers and customers were friendly. I learned how to do new and different tasks. The management was nice and friendly, and very helpful if I had any questions that I had. My co-workers were nice, friendly, and helpful. The hardest part of my job was to look for merchandise that was getting reduced in price and I went through the whole department and look elsewhere for the merchandise. The most enjoyable part of the job was to deal with the friendly customers, and co-workers."
good,delta fresh in an well ran company that i also love to work for. they treat every worker fair but also there a get change to move up in this company
good,a typical day was boring i go in and wanted off i learned how to work the system management sucke the hardest part of the job was being there i didnt enjoy anything
good,I'm a people person and like working with people.  I worked as a cashier and enjoyed my work here also.  It's a very busy store and also learned to multi-task as a worker and meeting customers expectations.  The hardest part of the job is when customers are unhappy and I do my best to make it happen.
good,"If you like working with freight, the latest clothes & great people, Burlington is the place for you! With the employee discount, you'll look great as well as feel great about working here."
good,"Burlington was a pretty cool place to work, when I first started I had to sort of earn my respect, which I shouldn't have done but I did my manager was very condescending and rude, despite all adversary I remained humbled and worked hard and he promoted me less than a month of being there."
good,I started working here over the summer and I never took the job as overwhelming until some of my co-workers started to leave after hire. I wanted establish a strong work history due to my close completion of my degree program and not being able to obtain any real long work history with a single company.
good,"Customer Service, fun environment, lack of of hours available. Lack of growth opportunities.  Worked there for 9 plus years would not have left if other growth opportunities were available and better job security. During my employment you were never aware of when they would cut a management position out and layoff managers."
good,"I enjoy my job at Burlington, managers are nice,unfortunatly they have extremely high rate of turn over for employees, probably due to the starting hourly rate of 7.25  an hour (if you stay with Burlington for six months,your hourly rate increases to 9.00)"
good,"Provided outstanding customer service."
good,"It  depends on the location your at, some days can be ok, but others days are very stressful. Sometimes you will feel like its not worth it because of the drama and how management speaks to employees, but on the other hand its a job and you have bills to pay.Typical day consist of making sure the store is up to part, by constantly cleaning, knowing the daily sales goals of the day. Being knowledgeable of all items within the store including markdown items and there location. Assist customers with all types of request, train on operating the cash register and layaways. putting together all store displays."
good,Great overal job. Taught me a lot about organization and preparation and pleasing the customer no matter what. Had to be at work on time or you will be penalized.
good,"This job was very fast pace long hours."
good,"the company is good for part-time job not permanent. expected to do a lot of work in short time , you do not really move up. management has poor communication."
good,I learned how to deal with customers and how to work on our skills.i had very good co-workers we were like a great team.what i didn't like when our managers push us so hard over than the limit in hard days or when one of the managers don't understand and feel about how much hard work we do.
good,Work was enjoyable for the time i was there. Better opportunity presented its self so i took them. Overall enjoyable company and employees to work with.
good,"i would go in and get right to business,i learned to always stay busy , as far as management they were not very on top of things, my co-workers were very nice, the hardest part was probably dealing with management and them treating everyone like they were lower then them ..."
good,daily routine the displaying of merchandise. putting the merchandise on the sales floor color coding. customer service. cash out customers.
good,"The first time I got there I really like the job. It was fun and people were nice making it easy to get through the work day. When there was a management change, that's when everything kinda went down hill. The new manager use favoritism to employees, advancement was given to people over others for the wrong reasons. The manager was rude in the way that he spoke to people, he asked for a lot and got mad when your original job didn't get done, and he talked about store values but didn't apply them to his job."
good,it could have done a better job at helping the employees more an making sure the work environment was safer in general. The pay wasn't that great either.
good,"working at burligton wasn't as fast paced as I would have liked, but the employees were awesome and were very helpful and respectful of each other. my managers were ok never really got to know them. hardest part was finding the exact right spot for the items. hardest part was keeping store cleaned and looking good before my shift would end."
good,"We have to packing merchandise, in different boxes and this boxes mean differents stores. The coworkers are very nice."
good,"Burlington coat factory was a good work environment, but management were not properly prepared. Management wouldn't communicate with associates on overtime still a day before Good benefits, every once in a while good employee appreciation."
good,It was a friendly atmosphere. The managers where great to work with they gave great detail of the work that they wanted done.
good,Some days are harder than others. Is a job more for older people. Ok job for someone who needs money and a job for the summer.
good,"resolve customer issues related to exchanges , layaways and returns. answer questions about products and services. process transactions store, i am passionate about working with clients. but i no have reliable transportation to/from work."
good,"I love my job but i dont like the management the way they run things is like a group of high school girls, you dont get your things on time , checks short. Gossip."
good,There have been too many changes since I worked there to be confident anything I could say in a  review would actually still apply.
good,"I enjoyed my job at Burlington Coat Factory. The staff was nice, and interacting with the public is always fun. Management was fine as well."
good,There was always something to do but it was also a little unprofessional. There was times where I felt like I was in High School again with all the drama. But what I can say is I learned a lot. From learning how to work a telxon gun to learning how to avoid ignorant people.
good,Well Burlington Coat Factory isn't a bad company. The Money isn't where it's at or the hours. A hundred and something dallors isn't cutting it if you have some bills to be payed.
good,"I love being a cashier at the store I am at now. I get compliments from the customers all the time. Best staff I work with, very friendly and about there business. I am just not use to unorganized areas."
good,Management was not well organized. Co-workers were very judgmental so it created an environment that was not pleasant. The most enjoyable part of the job was working as a cashier because of the customers.
good,"A typical day working was standing for 4-6 hours a day at a cash register or on the floor dealing with customers. Very fast pace."
good,Good place to start working. Paid weekly. Helpful management. Strict employment selection. Employment and placement assignments are great.
good,The work day lasted long only because of the customers. The store manager was awesome. She took her time with the employees and learned us individually. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customer attitude.
good,If you like your days to go by in a blink of an eye this job is for you. You're constantly working and before you know it your day is over.
good,Overall this job was okay a seasonal job. The hardest part of the job was the store organized. The other employees were very helpful in training the new employees
good,"It was an okay job, however it was boring and management was confusing, and the uniform was terrible. Most co-workers were fun and great some had a bad attitude."
good,"A typical work day included transacting customer purchases in a timely manner, maintaining the cashiers work space and providing good customer service"
good,"A lot of traffic in and out of the store,  good chance that you could stay late past your actual shift.  Good for students as well, not really something I would recommend as a career."
good,"A typical day at work, is assisting customers when needed at all terms. Management was fair. Co- workers were very helpful when needed. Most enjoyable part of my day was the customers"
good,"its a nice environment to be around, and the coworkers are very helpful. it is a good way to be more expierenced. and it teaches you a lot about costumer service."
good,"Since I worked here about a year and a half, they didn't give me a raise but were a bit flexible with my work schedule. People are nice, and you must work quick and push out as much merchandise and sales as much as you can. Management could be better. I learned how to be on the sales floor and help customers in the men's department. Pushing out merchandise from the back and place them properly and neatly on the sales floor to present customers. Also worked in the back with the receiving team to scan, tag, and do lay-away."
good,good employees and great customers. Its a great place to work not a lot of hours given but its a good time with great people
good,Burlington has teach me alot even when it came to handleing money. The co-wokers are hard workers who take their time to help everyone out.
good,"A lot of time you are given much more work then you can handle in a given shift and then you are pressured to get it done when it is nearly impossible. They will have people helping you that either do the job wrong or just slack around the whole time and do nothing. Also when closing and you get off at a certain time, they make you stay later which is absurd."
good,"A normally day working at Burlington Coat Factory can be a good day at times. Normally you have one person in the department before you get there.  Either you on cashier or in a department. In a department you have to pick up clothes and put them in the correct order. Making sure everything is put up neatly and in the right place. The one thing that is the hardest about Burlington is there’s on one person in a big department. Sometimes it is okay, others it can get bad really quickly. The most enjoyable part is getting paid every week. I’ve learned a lot of things working at Burlington. Don't take things to the heart because the information they are telling you only means they trying to help you."
good,it allowed to build a person that i am today when it comes to interacting with people face to face but cleaning after them was alot to do.
good,"The hardest park on this job was dealing with angry guest & finding the matching shoe to a shoe. I loved working there though it was a nice environment, clean & organized"
good,helps give a introduction into the retail business and gives you more knowledge of  customer service skills and relations.
good,"Clock in, Ring customers, clean & maintain the work area."
good,This store is such a great place to work in. Great when you're working with great people who bring smiles to your faces everyday. But the management need to be a little bit more organized
good,they stick you in one spot and expect you to love it. all day long. and they wont change you for nothing in the world.!!!!!!!
good,I worked Seasonal just to get a little extra holiday money. I had a lot of 4 hour shifts which I did not like since I was coming 20 miles away
good,"Maintain an awareness of all promotions and advertisements. Accurately and efficiently ring on registers and "
good,you have to unload freight by hand and takes a long time. management is the worst there. they know nothing about the policies of the store and will not help out when things get really busy.
good,"A work day on receiving consist of opening, sorting items in big empty boxes and move every item to the sales floor. The processed cloths are moved to the sales floor."
good,"Assisting with customer service and merchandising and setting floor items.  Along with customer service, associate training and scheduling were needed."
good,it was an alright job i mean i wasn't complaining at the time i needed the money. the people are ok but you kinda have to watch your back. thats pretty much it.
good,"Good company, there isn't much of a work vs personal life balance. However the insurance with this company give you plenty of options and affordable."
good,"I actually was the markdown lead for about a year until another applicant came in with experiance from another retail store so they took my position away and gave it to her. "
good,Can't really say anything good or bad. Everyday you helped customers with questions and where to find things. Higher ups looked down upon you and you weren't paid for the work you put in but you get that with any retail job that I've come a crossed.
good,This was my first job that I had to approach customers so it took me out of my comfort zone. It made me more out going and into my own person. Taught me how to talk to people in a way that they wanted what we were selling.
good,overall its a great place to grow in the company under the right management. unfortunately while working management lacked the skills to communicate with each other and the employees.
good,I enjoyed my department because i worked in the baby department. I had fun and I got to learn about many different products.
good,"Walking into work, usually on the weekends is super busy. Most of the shift we're working on cleaning the store and getting it put together by the time we close. My co-workers are great and I truly enjoy working with each of them, they make work ten times more exciting."
good,"This company supply clothes, and baby items, house hold items name brand at an affordable price and customers are excited when shopping.  It is awesome to make a customer feel great about the items they are seeking  with this company. It is even more exciting when the  customer can afford the items."
good,"It is an overall great place, but the co-workers are not too nice. If the people were nicer, work would not be so bad. But the store is great."
good,"A typical day at Burlington Warehouse includes hard work, dedication, and self motivation. You must be able to stand for long periods of time and be very detail oriented."
good,"Staff was helpful and patient when it came to learning new departments and job duties. For being retail, it was one of the best. Negative points would be dealing with mice, dirty receiving areas and being frequently short staffed in all departments. Also, merchandise being put out wasn't always thoroughly checked and processed. It required a lot of patience and a lot of repairing others mistakes. The management was always helpful and patient with the staff though. Taught me a lot about retail and gave me experience in all departments."
good,"Move freight, stock, or other materials to and from storage or production areas, loading docks, delivery vehicles, ships, or containers, by hand or using trucks, tractors, or other equipment."
good,There were a lot of unprofessional employees. The store needed a better plan for organization and executing goals. Other then that it was a much needed experiance
good,A typical day was okay. To me it seemed very slow.  I learned to put tickets on merchandise. Management was okay too.  Co- workers was helpful and engadged in their work. The most enjoyable part was clocking out.
good,"I was in charge of the day to day operations of our location. I was responsible for hiring and training while maintaining consistant staffing levels of 75 associates. Oversaw all front end customer service in addition to working as store MOD at a 75,000 sq ft. location. Maintain accurate accounting reports and conduct audits. Proactively engaged customers to exceed their expectations."
good,Became more detailed oriented by working for this company. Very fast paced work environment. No one day is the same here.
good,"Everyday is both the same and different. I work on women's clothing, but daily I will get thrown somewhere else I'm needed. Usually this is cashiering. I learned more then I can write out, because I am constantly learning new things on a daily basis. Some of what I have learned included: customer service, cashiering, communication, team work, patience, etc. The list goes on. I LOVE the people I work with! They're the reason I enjoy going to work. They are great all around individuals to be around! The hardest part of my job is cleaning up the same exact clothes over and over again. It gets very annoying and frustrating. But it does help me become more patient."
good,Most work days are busy with various tasks that require teamwork and solo work is consistent throughout the work week. Learned to use different pricing guns and freight equipment.
good,Most co-workers and a couple managers were great. The new store managers ethics are messed up and reasons for release are false and unprofessional.
good,"Lifting boxes all day "
good,"They were very helpful with training in retail aspects. I learned the register and computer systems, stocking and inventory, customer satisfaction. The best of the job for me was setting up the holiday displays."
good,"a regular day of work consist of daily sign in and meeting to talk about yesterdays production. off to stations, pallet receiving, ticketing clothes, put to light, seeding, and shipping."
good,I started working here when I was a teenager. It has been a great experience and I have really grown and developed throughout the years. One of the best parts about working here is definitely the people.
good,My Experience at Burlingtons  was an exceptional experience for my first job but I feel my skills exceed  Burlingtons expectation & I am ready to venture into something new.
good,"Burlington is a fast growing company ad I think it is undergoing alot of growing pains.  These will be sorted out, but it is a tough environment right now."
good,a fast paced job.a learned to work with lots of people.making customers happy.early shifts.good co workers.hours vary depending on the season.Ok managers.
good,Burlington Coat factory is an employee friendly company. They treated me well. I wish I had been able to stay beyond peak holiday season.
good,"Finance team is a growing team. You can learn a lot but Burlington's compensation structure is not great."
good,Overall a great place to shop with nice quality merchandise. The customers were positive and made my job interesting. Shopping can be a stress reliever and can get hectic under pressure so I enjoyed assisting customers.
good,"I would not recommend burlington to anyone, maybe it is just my location but as far as Im concerned it isnt the genial job. They promote people who have no clue what they are doing, they do not honor doctors notes, funerals, etc, it all counts as not coming to work."
good,"Supervised the front end of the store. Loss prevention and close out at the end of the day. Trained staff for new store opening."
good,When I was hired I was told it was permanent but after a month I was told I wasn't just temporary. That discourage me I was laid off after the holidays.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to help customers with their fashion needs. My co-workers were easy to work with.
good,"Working at Burlington Shoes was usually either very busy or very slow. On the busier days, all workers were productive and useful and professional. On the slower days we took our time and got to know each other as friends. Everyone was close, even with the mall security guards. I would say the hardest part of the job was trying to take care of so many things at once and getting overwhelmed, but that was my own fault. The most enjoyable part of the job was whenever we had a regular customer who also became friends with us, the workers. It was just a nice feeling of making someone's day by simply being polite to them and selling them a cute pair of shoes."
good,"regular"
good,"-worked well with others"
good,you dont get paid enough for what you do. working there is not fun
good,just not enough hours .mininum wage co workers are good. good friendly management. pay sucks

good,My first job so it was everything. It had it's good days and bad days like any job.
good,it was a good working environment. I needed more hours scheduled.
good,It's a fast growing company. Burlington uses mostly temps and is busy year around.
good,"check out customer's, exchange merchandise, clean work area, management was a little disorganized, co-workers where very helpful and nice, dealing with angry customer's, the overall environment was nice"
good,A typical day at work consists of me assisting customer in need of help and keeping the area I'm assigned in a neat manor. I learned how to interact with customers.The management was good and held weekly meeting. The co-workers at Burlington were friendly and respectable. The hardest part of the job was during holidays when the store had plenty of sales. The most enjoyable part of the job was being around the people I got to work with.
good,there was a lot to do and no space to do it. over all it was a great company and I enjoyed my fellow employees.
good,After we clocked in me and a co-worker just threw boxes on a conyor belt. From time to time the pallet jack helped us. I mainly just thre boxes untill break or work was over.
good,Great learning experience. Great co workers and great environment.
good,A typical day at work would include dealing with impatient customers.  I learned how to deal with unruly customers and gained great customer service skills.  Management was very demanding and did not try to help those employees on the floor.  Co-workers were friendly but it consisted of a lot of gossip.  Hardest part of the job was dealing with customers who are really nasty and curse at you when they simply did not understand company policy.  The most enjoyable part was making friends at work.
good,"My typical day would consist of cleaning and straightening merchandise or departments. Helping or directing customers to departments desired. My co-workers were friendly, helpful, and helped make the day more enjoyable."
good,A typical day at work for me was to deliver excellent customer service as well maintain a degree of professionalism.. I have learned that to work in the atmosphere of burlington coat factory you must have poise and patience.The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting our daily goals and expectations.
good,employees did what they wanted. management had favorites and didnt care.the most enjoyable part was the customers!
good,This job helped me with my customer services. I just didn't really like how slow the store was.
good,Learned it fast. Was on my feet all day in very uncomfortable shoes. Manager was a little bit pushy. For example would rather tell me I'm coming in on this day I was suppose to have off rather than ask me.
good,Great place to work. My hours were set so it made planning things easier.
good,I Really enjoyed working there it was a great place to work the management was great there was a lot of fun activities we did and i had great coworkers

good,"A typical day for me at Burlington was helping out people in customer service. For example, returns, exchanges, layaways and etc."
good,A busy fast paced work environment that keeps you alert and attentive throughout the day
good,"A typical day would involve me coming into work, asking the managers the tasks they would like me to do for either the sales floor, customer service, or accounting, then go about my way performing my duties. I learned a great deal of patience, organizational skills, and how to effectively communicate with not only customers, but my coworkers as well. The managers were very easy to approach. The largest problem was the staffing issue. There were never enough cashiers, so they would call people on the sales floor, which meant these associates were not always able to complete their given assignments. Despite asking for more cashiers and help, the managers always gave the excuse that there was no money in the budget, even though there would practically be no one in the store."
good,A typical day at work was long and tiresome. Had to cover the department that I was working in that day and help others in their department as well as picking up clothes to close the store for the night.

good,"Lots of overtime, no benefits, however good people. and of employees for the demanding work,"

good,I was only there for a short time but my coworkers were great.
good,Come in for the day and figure out what to do. Learned how to be flexible and help other areas when there was spare time. Management was good at communicating what needed to be done to employees that were there at the time but not the ones that weren't. Some coworkers were good and some were bad. Hardest part was unloading freight. Most enjoyable part was completing a project and helping customers find what they wanted.
good,"Burlington Coat Factory was a good company to work for, I enjoyed the atmosphere, just wish the pay was better."
good,"Time management is important."
good,I like working with the company because of the customers and the employees but career wise this is not the job for me. The pay is not that great either for all the work employees have to put in
good,"very fast pace,  a lot of management  turnover."
good,the hardest part about the job was getting the lawyers signatures.
good,Working there wasn't too much but dealing with stealing and annoying costumers was a mess.

good,Great working atmosphere with friendly staff. A focus on customer service.
good,"I was in charge of four particular areas. I helped turn the company around and up about 7% from LY so far in the year. 20 associates directly answer to me; However, I hear from every associate daily, as I am M.O.D. (Manager on Duty) throughout the day as well."
good,"A typical day is Surveying the sales floor, light to moderate recovery, followed by go-backs and customer service. Continuous go-backs, recovery, and customer service till end of shift if no projects are requested by management."
good,Working with a great diversity of people dedicated to work.
good,i enjoyed working there it was something different and i learned alot about the company
good,"•Manage the performance of Assistant Store Managers and Associates using established Company policies and standards including but not limited to those outlined in the company’s Core Values, the Associate Handbook as well as merchandising and operational SOP’s "
good,"A typical day at work was like any old day at any old job. Working as a sales associate and dealing with the public I learned that it takes a lot of patience to deal with different type of people each and every day. The hardest part of the job was dealing with management, I mean not all were bad at their job but some were. Some of the employees were not bad but as you know at every place of employment you have employees who should not be employed. Overall I enjoyed my time and I gained a lot of experience at Burlington Coat Factory."
good,The people make it worth while. I enjoyed it. The days go by fast.
good,"Working with others to produce a good display to promote sales, and interacting with customers are good skills to have."
good,"A typical day at work was organizing the floor. In between organizing the floor we assisted customers, and sent them to dressing rooms. After organizing the floor we security tagged the clothing and even marked down some clearance items. I learned that people really enjoy good deals, like the ones offered by Burlington Coat Factory. Management was kind. The hardest part of the job was when it got slow and there was nothing to do, because you already did everything. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers and giving shopping advice."
good,"a typical day of work consists of clocking in, attending a short meeting, gathering equipment to properly complete activities then going to our assigned rows to complete our work tasks. Management is ok, a lil harsh at times because they explain something once in a fast manor and expect you to know exactly what to do after they are done. There is absolutely no talking allowed which is a lil hard and not fair, if you talk you get sent to another row and left to do the line completely by ur self, If you do not complete 150+ items you will be fired. You are not allowed to carry your cellphone on you at any time and that is a lil hard do to the fact that people have young children and need there phone incase of an emergency"
good,"Not too busy unless it's a Holliday. "
good,"This company is good place to work.  There are employee discounts as well as employee recognition.  A typical day would be one where I  would assist customers and make sure that presentation of the store coincides with company policy."
good,The days were bascially the same you do the same thng everyday the co workers are freindly and helpful when needed the hardest part of the job is the short hours alloted each week the most enjoyable part of the job is seeing all the new things entering the stoer

good,learned that customers are always right. enjoyed my co-workers and management.
good,I liked my job at Burlington. I enjoyed working in receiving and helping customers when I could.
good,A normal day at work was helping people out rather it was an employee or customer. We were always busy busy busy in our own departments or doing something. Management was GREAT!!!!!!! I loved every single manager there until they got all new people. My coworkers were all excellent as well...everyone got along. There really wasn't a hard part besides inventory once a year lol!! The most enjoyable part was working for and with great people!!!!!!!!!
good,"willing to work with with you when in school, co-workers where very knowledgeable, and have so much experience in the field of loss prevention."
good,A typical day here was normal. I worked as a cashier so you learn more about money and accounting. Management were okay. You would have some that you loved and was down to earth then you would have the opposite. Every job is like that. To me there was no hard part about this job. Everything was easy. The most enjoyable part was the customers. They made my day and 98% would say they love my personality.
good,while like most other retail jobs this store has come with many people that i actually enjoyed being around. recent changes in management now have not left a good mark on the store and there is little to no morale left in those that have worked there for many years. sadly the higher ups of the company have let complaint fall on deaf ears and i see a struggling time ahead.
good,I didnt like the work enviornment. The people were not friendly. Mostly lackadaisical about their job.
good,a typical day at this job would be picking up clothes and cleaning up the work area you in.
good,"some days are very active and some are very slow"
good,Burlington was a decent work place not one of my favorite but the people were good and nice
good,A typical day at work would be working with customers whether it's on the sales floor or at a register.  I like when a customer leaves happy.
good,"I enjoyed working at Burlington. Since it is my first job I learned a lot. I learned how to how to work with people, how to handle customers concerns and communicate them to management, count and tally my till, and etc. The hardest part of my job is when we are shorthanded and there are copious customers waiting in line. However, I enjoy the feeling of making someone happy while providing good customer service."
good,"Productive and busy place to work. great environment, the management was hands on. great team to work for."
good,"not the best place to work at, i moved from regular cashier to supervicor in 4 months"
good,"Always having sales, which helps if you are into customer service."
good,"Working at Burlington Coat Factory was hectic more than anything else. We would always have a rush of customers throughout the entire summer and never had enough employees on the registers or on the sales floor. My co-workers and I worked well as a team considering the circumstances but our number one priority should be satisfying our customers and I feel like as a store, we failed. The most enjoyable part would be seeing the smiles on customers faces when they have received exceptional customer service."
good,"things seem to be un organized, has potential to be a great place if it wasnt for the little games with peoples hours that are played"
good,MY typical day at Burlington Coat Factory was doing so many things at once by myself.What I've learned working there is sometimes things need to be done on your own then depending on you co-workers to help you out.The management wasn't all that good but some things I had to figure out on my own.The people i was working with was all about themselves just helping themselves out even though others help them out.The hardest part about my job was doing four things at once on a busy day
good,"productive days"
good,"Busy and very customer base, satisfying customers is what we do best"
good,"My duiteis were to unload trucks, sort boxes and send them to the line if required. I was in the process of learning to use RF gun. The managment was okay but at times a bit indecisive. My co-workers were very helpful getting me acclimated to the workspace. The hardest part of the job was some of the heavy lifting and the most enjoyable was the overtime."
good,"I like working here but, there could be a lot of improvement with the way its run. Being open 9:30 to 9:30 everyday is a little ridiculous because no one shops late on Sundays in Springfield."
good,"As a closer I would come in to start fixing up the store for the next day. Of course customers where still in the store so would take care of their needs while putting items back where they belonged. Learned the coding system for sale items, clearance and final clearance items. The co workers were fine, we all pretty much did the same thing, put clothes away and clean up the store. The hardest part was after a huge sale and the store was trashed. This meant it would take longer to clean up the store and often times we would not get the time needed to complete the job."
good,"A typical day at work would be unloading 100+ boxes then scanning and stacking them all. After stacking they would be opened then the contents would be tagged, placed on hangers, and sorted. The hardest part of the job was having to stand in the same place for up to 7 hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was chatting with my co-workers while tagging and sorting."
good,Enjoyed my experienced with working with this company this was my very first job in retail
good,I really liked the job it was a good experience nice co workers and staff.

good,A typical day at work consisted of standing behind a cash register for four to eight hours getting to see and meet many different people. I learned that everyone is unique.

good,"	A typical day at work was okay, pretty slow but I always got my job done plus some. i learned that even when you feel like you cant deal with the managers that its best to just do the they say and push the day away. I also learned that paying attention to your surroundings and no depending on the next to protect you is the best way to work. management was all about the right and they showed favoritism a lot but yet in still my coworkers was not well manor to each other but was easy to get along with on the other hand. The hardest part of my job was catching thieves and not be able to get security or management there fast enough and fearing the they would notice that i seen them and us getting into an altercation.

good,"A typical day at work is pushing out the new freight every morning detailing as I go. As the day goes on when the store opens my co-workers and I continue working out freight while doing customer service. If needed at the registers one of us will go for back up. When it comes to truck days if we're needed we'll go in the back and help unload the truck sometimes help on the table processing. The hardest part of my job is when there lots to do and there not enough employees on the floor. Over time I've worked at Burlingtion I learned alot of things; such as merchandising, run a register, pocess and unload trucks, customer service and looking for prices for every department.

Management cared for our safety and provided us with the tools to make the job easier. I learned that working as a team gets the job done a lot quicker. Some days the merchandise wasn't so bad to repack and count and that was what made some days less stressful than others.The most enjoyable part of the job was the store discounts and getting to view some of the merchandise before it was shipped to the stores.

good,"Come to work and count my money in the register. Then I would ring up customers items and make a friendly conversation with them. I learned how to count money in a register, how to ring up items, and how how to do layaway.

good,not consideracte if your home life. boring. people were nice.
good,"Productive and fun, good communication with management the only thing needed, in order to produce more business is to maintain and to keep up with recovery and organizing of the store. Missing pieces to suites, the inability to keep clothing off the floor, racks unorganized and lost shoe isn’t what makes money."
good,"A typical day at work for me was working the men fitting room and suit measurements. I learned that I must block out some employees that did not take being at the job serious.The management level of employees varied from one personnel to the next.

Fun times was working with peers and celebrating employee congrats rewards."
good,In my job I am always on the run pushing out new merchandise. Restocking and resetting for the new season. I am great with the customers welcoming them to our store and asking if they need any help. I work on the register a lot answering phone and multi tasking through out the day. What I learned most at this job is working well with others is a plus but mostly involved individually that I am advancing everyday.
good,It's a good place to work if you need a part time job if your a student or just need some extra cash.
good,Its retail do what you need to do and your fine.
good,in this job i found that one person can do a lot in several stores. the first burlington that i worked for was remodeled and the employees had package up the hole store. after that they dispersed us to other locations till the new store was built. once the new store was built we had to build fixtures and restock the shelves.
good,It was an okay place to work. The pay was average and was paid weekly and on time.
good,I'm was grateful to have this job as my first job when I was starting out that I was doing my work above and beyond but as years went on the work started to be too much for me.
good,"A typical day at work is slow. The hours are manageable during holiday time. But non holiday time you would be lucky to get 15 hrs. The management don't work with your hours. Besides that, the environment is comfortable everyone is cordial and respectable."
good,"Burlington is a good beginners job to start with, it helps you get the hang of customer service. Being apart of the Burlington team was an okay experience, but there is a lot of call offs and management called me in a lot of times to take shifts. I didn’t mind but it got to a point where I was at work for longer than I scheduled my availability"
good,"Very busy store, was fast paced. Management was good, very understanding. Pay compensation was decent. "
good,"Great leadership, a caring and supporting community of co-workers, and a great product. Complete flexibility about where and how you work as long as you deliver. We do walk the talk--we're a Certified Great Workplace and are getting better every year. It's all innovation, all the time."
good,This company is good if you don’t have any bills or for younger ppl. Great work environment. They will work with your schedule if you let them know before hand. More hours would be lovely.
good,"Working in Loss Prevention at Burlington was decent. There were a good number of job duties (enough to keep you busy), and the management was alright to work with at my specific store. From an LP standpoint the position was fairly easy, being either high activity or none at all. Meeting quotas is fairly easy (just 4 a month minimum), but there were dozens of audits to be done around the store. "
good,Great place to work in its fast paced meet good people and get a good discount for on items when you are in employee for this company. just keep a positive attitude and you’ll be good at this company.
good,Burlington was my very first job. The pay was great for me because I was a high school student with little responsibility. I gained customer service experience and learned how to work with other people. My manager was great. The only problem was my school and work schedule conflict.

good,"Working at such a cheap store brings in cheap and low quality customers."
good,They expect 2 people to do the work of 10. The store was always a mess and management tried to make you do other people jobs so they don't have to staff more people. They hire a bunch of people but only schedule 2 or 3 during the day.
good,There’s not much experience needed and it is a gateway to better and higher paying jobs. Requires you to be patient and have great costumer service. People of all ages and cultures come to work here.
good,Management was not always available nor willing to work with others often. Workdays were often smooth and moved quickly on the busiest days. Hours often differ and can be a bit tedious but the environment makes up for that.
good,Managers are really understanding and the employees are all nice its a really relaxed environment to work in but the only thing is that they don't give a lot of hours during the weeks unless its the holidays.
good,Great job to learn great customer service skills. Let you work as many hours as you want and are really flexible. But are willing to hire outside  management positions
good,It's okay you feel like you work a lot just without the pay you should earn. The hustle a bustle can be relenting for hours on end at least you get a paid 30 min break if your working  hours.

good,The training that was provided to all matreial handkers give the experience and know how that you could definately use in tre future. It was a fast paced job and  you stayed busy. I supervisors relied on you to finish the job that you are assigned to for that particular day.
good,"The job is all about the customer. Make them happy, and keep your area clean. Morning crew does stock, afternoon crew finishes up any stock and then cleans area. Most days was just going through each isle and picking up or re-organizing. Fun staff and good leaders."
good,It is a place to work if you are a school kids that job and some work skill the pay is very low but it is ok for school age kids are some one who need a job.
good,"nice building, friendly staff, the pay and hours are not good. job advancement is very limited and rare. it can be slow, it can be fast. not too hard of a job."
good,i liked it ok job a lot of walking and cleaning and you have 30 mins for yourself but all was good there i would not go back not the same people there no more
good,I had to be fast pace but I was working good with coworkers and I love doing customer service and working on my customer service skills for work but I enjoyed my job
good,"Mejorar la estabilidad laboral, promoveer la equidad entre los empleados."
good,"It really depends on your location. I worked on 125th street and many of the staff were rude as well as the customers. It also depends on the type of day it is. Sometimes the store would be really messy and crowded other days, it was completely together."
good,"A typical day at work would be cleaning work area, ringing customers up, and doing returns"
good,"Burlington is a busy and fast pace environment, there is always something to do. It is a customer service based job where you are interacting with people all day long."
good,Gave me my first start job wise. was a great learning experience. helped my professional aspect of customer service. taught me to be diligent in my work ethics.
good,This is a wonderful and relaxed place to work. I love the fact that the hours are very flexible and they work with other schedules of your life including school.
good,"I have a good time to work with it ,but  it is not much give me a hours and the pay rates since the last review."
good,"nice start if you are looking for a job.The Burlington I worked at, they were not as organized with their schedules. The manages was not as friendly neither."
good,Pay is very low with terrible raise opportunities. Job is relaxed and can be fun with the right people. Management is hands-off. Good amount of pto is offered.
good,"Burlington was very productive , fast pace. Everything that I did as a sales associate was very easy and simple. But I wasn’t getting paid enough and I didn’t have enough hours."
good,"They do not pay enough for the amount of work that you are expected to do."
good,"I learned a very good work ethic here. My supervisors were understanding and and help me understand my role until i was able to function on my own. Also there was always something you had to do and it  personally made me willing to work. However, there are no set shifts so it's not convenient for someone who likes set hours each week."
good,"The job in and of itself was fine but, corporate was not trying to give us more payroll and we were making the most money in our region at least that is what was told to us. That is what was frustrating I needed more money."
good,"I worked in the Edgewater, NJ inbound logistics dept. w 5 other coordinators. It was a pleasant experience as we all knew our jobs very well and would cover each others desks when needed and without much supervision."
good,"A typical day at work including me batching in for work then going to the area I'm assigned. I've learned a lot at the job like how to make tickets,a lay-away, and promote the business in a enthusiastic way. Management is pretty strict there they have store goals to meet and eager to push retail bar for Burlington. This job wasn't to difficult for me I can say the hardest thing is when you don't have back up cashiers and its a line full of customers. what i enjoyed the most was the social atmosphere, i wasn't scared to talk to my co-workers it was a warm place too be."
good,"When I had started working there, the store had just opened so all the employees were fresh. this lead to some organizational issues that made my job a bit tougher. Management was very nice however, and was helpful in balancing my school and work life."
good,"Burlington is a great company to work for.  The management team cares about you as an employee and is invested in your growth and development.  As a exempt team member, your work a variety of shift each week including weekends.  Your day starts by opening the store, opening the system, and completing accounting functions. During the week as an opener you check in with the receiving team on progress on the days freight.  You are also responsible for leading the daily team rally meeting. After the store is open, you do a variety of functions, assist with receiving, re-flow or merchandise as needed, assist customers, coach associates, recruit etc.  Evenings are more about recovering the store and getting it ready for the next business day."
good,"Burlington was one of my first jobs. For a first job it was great, Taught me about payroll, taught me how to manage my time, and how to be responsible for myself. Though the place was very very cluttered and I mostly cleaned every hour on the hour, I would say it taught me how to manage myself in a work environment."
good,"Burlington Coat Factories was very relaxed for the most part. As with any retail store, weekends could get busy, but most days had a slower pace. The workplace stressed communication."
good,"It was an ok place to work, a few managers where not that great but the others made up for those manages. It is a fast paced place to work for so if you don't mind the bad managers this is a place for you until you find something better."
good,"I was loss prevention which is a different entity to the regular store staff. I would recommend LP highly there, however regular associates are all miserable and make almost nothing while also getting janky 4 hour shift maybe 3 days a week. Typical days for me were fairly relaxed since their customers during weekdays are few and far between, and weekends were fairly good as well. People who stole were typically always homeless and very easy to spot so there was never much need to scan through every person who walked in."
good,"The associates are nice & friendly"
good,"A great place to work, I worked as a Mark Down Seasonal Clerk, very faced past, management did not play, sometimes stressful and very, rewarding. We received 30% discounts at times, I often worked past my scheduled time. Loved working at Burlington."
good,"I liked working at the Burlington Coat Factory. During the first week of work, I was overwhelmed by the work and responsibilities that were placed on me, but with the help of my coworkers, I felt more confident."
good,There was always something that needed to be done in retail. Making the store appealing to the customers. Being courteous to all and helping wherever needed.
good,"My team and I had about two or three departments to scan each week, We had to scan every piece of merchandise  in the store to check for clearance prices.  Management was great and understandably. Burlington is very diverse work  place. The hardest thing on the job is carrying the printer across your shoulders for long period time . The most enjoyably part on the job was working with my markdown team."
good,"Working with clothing, baby depot, cashier was very difficult lines where long, so I always got call out my area to help with others witch wasn’t a problem, but when you are a great worker more people depend on you"
good,"Can be extremely stressful, always something changing.  Must be extremely focused and flexible to succeed.  It is not your average retail environment and you are expected to do a lot with a little."
good,a typical work day for me would be somewhat slow somewhat fast depending on the day. I've learned that not all customers will be satisfied. the hardest part about my day is trying to find something a customer wants and we no longer sell.
good,"At Burlington, Flow Team Members or stock associates would clean out the receiving area then proceed to break down the truck. Following that, stock associates would head out to put merchandise onto the sales floor.Experience at Burlington taught me how to work with others in a fast paced environment, being proficient and efficient with my work.The Management team were very hard working always willing to help it's employees and teach them about the in's and out's of the store.The culture at Burlington Coat Factory is a fun, fast paced, energetic work environment that prides itself on a team that works together as one unit trying to accomplish different tasks at the same time. While working at Burlington the toughest part was adjusting to the different times of scheduling, trying to pace yourself to get certain tasks done, and getting things done on time.The best part of this job was working with and meeting new people, the employee discounts, and having weekends off."
good,Not a bad place to work overall. really good place if you are a college student looking for the customer service experience. Really good place to start if your are looking to go into a retail business type career. overall very good people and good environement
good,"Steady work day of sorting clothing"
good,Its a nice place to work but communication with all the managers is horrible. And the managers don't really know how to talk to their employees.. all the employees are very nice some customers you get nice but the work area is cool. Not bad place to work it's just like I said better communication better way to talk to their employees
good,"Cash collection in cash register or ATH, organize clothes, receive merchandise warehouse, set up cash register, pick up shopping carts, organize clothes hooks"
good,Worked in every department of the store and it is a very relaxed environment with a very encouraging management but just not enough opportunities to grow and move up in the company
good,It's a nice place to get a retail experience from. Managers are very helpful and provide enough support to new sale associates to ease their integration in the job
good,Easy to integrate into the job and coworkers were very friendly. Management was extremely disorganized and even have stopped me from completing my taxes due to a lack of communication on their part.
good,This store has high pace of work completion for little time frame given to work.  Easy to perform and sometimes tedious to do daily. Work hours go by fast.
good,managers need to be harder on the associates. they set in their old ways and dont want to learn nothing new. the store is not bad but it could be great!!
good,"I have been at Burlington for eleven years. I love to merchandise the home department. They give me lots of freedom in doing this., I started in the baby department, as the manager. I love to help people and enjoy the response I get when I help them find what they came in looking for. I am looking for a little bit more of a stable work schedule. I find my hours are closing shifts until 11;30 and then opening the next day."
good,"Overall good pay for a beginner, but low on working hours. Sometimes the aura of the working atmosphere is really thick, depending on the surrounding circumstance."
good,"They are very unorganized at the Old National HWY location, management needs improvement. They need a whole new team. They even will change your hours sometimes and seems like you have worked less but really you have worked more and you don't get payed for it."
good,"Awesome staff, the best part of the job was that we had the opportunity to shop there with a discount without any restrictions. Good prices as well. They work with your schedule as well."
good,I enjoy working in this fast pace environment. I am looking for a full time position and Burlington is unable to offer that. It was a great environment.
good,"My experience at Burlington was great. I worked seasonal in 2016. Breaks was short but overall work was good. Fast pace, co workers are very  helpful."
good,The staff were nice; first day I got trained I messed things up because the trainer lacked attentiveness after 'showing me ' how to do something after two minutes.
good,"Not the best not the worst job around, working in the mall it gets incredibly busy. Management can expect too much from too few employees at times. Weekends and holidays can be insane."
good,This was a good place to start a career at a young age. But after experiencing more and wanting more I left to advance my skill and career to bigger and better opportunity. I couldn't move up as quickly gathering its just retail and there's no corporate office near.
good,He is very dependable and always finishes all job activities. willing to help his employers at work. willing to stay later if necessary. always on time.
good,"A typical day at work involved being cashier and providing customer service which included layaways, returns and helping customers find items in the store. I learned the computer systems and taught other employees the same as well as their day to day duties.  The hardest part of the job were the down times as they were not fast paced."
good,"Honest pay for honest work; the folks here are goodhearted and hard working. Most are friendly and forgiving, and more than willing to help new employees find their feet. "
good,There were great and friendly employees/managers. The only complaint I have is the lack of communication that is held between the manager and supervisors.
good,It was busy during the winter and summer seasons. I learned how to manage people and prioritize tasks. The people I worked with were great and provided assistance whenever possible.
good,"I love everything about Burlington except the pay, which is extremely low. The store I work in is high volume and very large and they never have enough staff. They are great at promoting fast if you work hard. I was promoted twice in 7 months. Even with the promotions, the pay is ridiculous. This is the main reason I am looking for a new job."
good,I had a very quick pace and a very alert team to get me by. There was a manager and and about seven people at the workstation. I would go back if it wasn't for their pay rate
good,It was a learning experience to work alongside the Pittsburgh Police and the Pittsburgh Court Systems with the retail theft cases and the way the judicial system worked was incredible.
good,i enjoy work sometimes only thing is managers dont pay attention to emplyees days that they requst off.also the dont rotate the weekends between all the cashiers.Other than that i love working at burlington.
good,the environment is extremely fast paced and the Managers and Supervisors aren't too polite and welcoming. they require so much of you for very little pay.
good,Management lacks communication. There is a lack of motivation among employees. Management does not recognize employees that go beyond their job duties.
good,"The company has made great strides in improving the corporate culture. I have been employed with the company since 2014. They have an annual employee appreciation day, employee discount weeks. The corporate headquarters in Florence has a ton of fringe benefits: an amazing café, starbucks, dry cleaning services etc. There are some opportunities for growth and advancement within the organization. However, depending on the area you are in you may have to play the office politics game. Additionally, there are some jobs that don't have a clear career path(ie. POE Representatives or Merchandising Assistants) I wouldn't suggest anyone to take a job in that area and expect to advance within the organization. The pay could be better and the medical insurance that the company offers does have coinsurance layered in it(80%/20%)."
good,It is an okay place to work and I would recommend it for someone who has never had a job before or is attending college since they work with your schedule. My position as a floor associate was pretty easy.
good,"I have no complains for them. I had a good ride. But I love the staff and the manager. It was a relaxing, clam job. I didn't mind standing on my feet all day."
good,"It's your typical part time job. Unfortunately, there is little to no opportunity for any sort of job advancement. Even with the hard work, there is no job security."
good,"the job is pretty easy, for people with or without experience"
good,"In a typical work day, the mornings start with a short meeting on what our goals are for the day. I gained experience in retail and learned a lot about sales and customer service. My coworkers all seemed 50/50 on the job, it was a bit hard to ask for help. The hardest part was if things got too busy and people weren't where they should be. I enjoyed the small breaks in between and talking to customers on the sales floor to initiate a friendly environment."
good,its a good job and co workers are friendly i would not mind work in place like this you do alot multi staking also work long hours but is lay back so u dont notice it
good,"Work is, well um, work. I actually enjoy my job and the flow of business. Every time I clock in I have to find my rhythm to make sure i'm working efficient enough for the day."
good,"Good work place "
good,Made merchandising decisions on the sales floor.  Assigned associates work to do to make the sales floor a better shopping experience for the customer.  Great people to work with and enjoyed working as a team to achieve desired goals.
good,"A typical day at work can easily flow right through or become a mess."
good,This is other basic entry level job in retail that you can get went you're fresh out of high school or need a second job or whatnot. would not recommend a career there useless you just want to be a manger in retail.
good,Helping an customer with an concern bout an item they wanted that had stains on it I gave a discount on the item that made the customer happy.
good,Burlington is a good company to work for. I started off as a cashier and now CSS. There are a lot of glitches in the store that I work in but everyday that I am on shift I try my hardest to make a difference.
good,"A typical day at work would start at about 5 or 6 am depending on your shift. The day is pretty routine, show up to work, unload the pallets delivered the day before and continue to your station."
good,"A typical day at work is very fast paced and requires hard work, focus and diligence.  Burlington has taught me to balance personal and work alike.  Management is hard working and focus on company goals and standards.  The hardest part of the job is the turnover rates and the most enjoyable part is working with the team in the entire story"
good,"I loved getting disccounts for working there, even on clearance and they have awsome home items and decor. I loved being a cashier you would just ring stuff up . You work long hours and dont get to rest much. The pay is like a joke"
good,it was really hard because the store was really big mess cloths all over coworker were really nice and manager was really cool.
good,"Decent Customer Service, Great Benefits Working with Good Co-Workers, The most challenging part of the job was the Truck Process"
good,"Overall it was a good establishment, there was this one time however I was under the weather and, the manager told me that I had been taken off of the schedule permanently. When asked what for their response was "" You haven't been to work in 3 days "". I explained to them that I had called and spoken with a manger to let them know I wasn't going to be able to come in at the time and that I did indeed have a doctors' excuse. I wasn't allowed to come back to work even after explaining my situation, so I would not recommend this job for anyone with health issues."
good,"Fast pace environment that allows me the flexibility to make decisions that will increase sales in my store."
good,This is one of  places where the day goes by so fast. I am always learning more about retail management and the good and bad from a company. This is a very stressful working place and will talk about at interview.
good,Nice place to work with fair associates. Flexible hours with great management that is very involved. It's very fast paced and the work keeps you busy.
good,"I worked many hours. Didn't have family time at all. very difficult to balance you personal time with working so many hours a week."
good,they work with you for instance if you have another job or attend school but the do not have enough people on the floor to help which can get hectic around these times (holiday seasons) i love to work but when people don't comply and help out it makes the job a little harder
good,"Workdays are ok. Management is 50/50, some are excelent and knowledgable, others are not. Co-workers are good. Not much is difficult about this job. Enjoyed learning new things."
good,walk in greet the costumers . Ask if they need help . i learned to work in a fast pace . my co workers were cool at times some took advantage . it wasn't the hardest but having to restock the mechanize   and have it the way the manager wanted was annoying .
good,"i Size and organized clothes racks, i also  secured security tags on items, preform markdowns, and organized displays. My manager was very helpful after my internship i was offered a job but couldnt accept because of my age."
good,"A typical day at work would be recovering my area as ladies sportswear associate or man the fitting room. There are 4 different managers and all work differently, sometimes it can conflict when one manager is one way an the other is not. Hardest part of the job would be keeping up with the pace of the store. If its very busy there are different priorities you need to get to. Overall I enjoy my job and the co-workers i have."
good,"I worked in the morning most of the time, attended the costumers needs.  I learned to promote and sale the items, put them in the right place to get the costumers attention. The hardest part for me was closing the store, we needed to organize and take items out of the basement, put everything in their place.  The most enjoyable part of the job was to talk with the people, help them."
good,"my day consisted of checking out customers, doing lay-a-ways, keeping my area clean and organized. Assisting customers and knowledge of merchendising products."
good,"loved working here was a positive environment , everyone did the part so things were easy and ran smooth. I left because I moved to a different city"
good,"Workdays are ok. Management is 50/50, some are excelent and knowledgable, others are not. Co-workers are good. Not much is difficult about this job. Enjoyed learning new things."
good,"Depending on the shift I am assign, regulates how my day goes. Working early morning shifts are the best because there is more work to be done which makes the day go by fast. "
good,Good place to work. The pay rate should be more for the amount of work certain positions. Management is very good with giving hours when needed or giving time off when needed.
good,A typical day for me was to come in every morning and make sure all the go backs go back on the floor for the customers.  Make sure fitting rooms were empty and ready to.  I have learned to have patience with management and with customers.  The hardest part of my job is when my co-workers don't pull there weight with work.  The best part of my job is meeting new customers.
good,I enjoyed working with the managers and some of the co-workers and I enjoy working in customer service
good,Need more employee incentives minimum wage. need to pay according to skill. employees are not treated as fairly as management
good,"Unload Shipment, trash duties then began processing shipment"
good,"layaway"
good,"Provide Customer Service, Receive and disburse money, Operate a cash register, Answer customers' questions, Compute and record totals of transactions, Greet customers, Maintain clean and orderly checkout area, Process merchandise returns and exchanges, Resolve customer complaints, Balance cash register and Sell products or services."
good,Minimum wage job. Work with customers and requires all associates to provide assistance in various areas of the store. Heavy reliability on managers and coworkers. Limited hours and not enough opportunities to grow with the company. Managers try to make work environment pleasant with small events during holidays.
good,"The job it self is easy, There isn't any hard parts of it,  my co-workers are respectable, cool and fun to work with, i'v never had a bad day besides having to leave because they went over the payroll which happens at least once every week or two it gets on my nerves because i only get 20 hours a week and pay is $8.25 an hour..."
good,"-5 hour work days, however, it feels like 10 hours."
good,not really much job security. But the compensation is good.
good,"helping out costumers was my favorite thing to do."
good,I was a Stoking clothes and sizing shoes for jobs expeiriences
good,"I worked as a cashier and sales associate. The people here are very nice, but the management wasn't always supportive."
good,"I learned so much working at Burlington Coat Factory as a person that started as a full-time associate who later over the years received 2 promotions and worked my way to Assistant Manager. I have some of the best staffs who keeps me going day to day. One of the great thing about the atmosphere at BCF is that, many people are from different countries and cultures all over the world. Customer Service is a focal part of retail and it is interesting daily to meet people from all over the world who both put a smile on your face or you help them accomplishing their basic needs by helping them make purchases that brighten their days."
good,"Load/Unload trucks, clock invetory, help co workers out at the end of shift."
good,"Started as an administrative assistant to the Store Manager and developed my skills by working in different areas of the store. Got promoted three times in 12 years. Got hands on in Receiving Department, Customer Service and all Operational functions. worked as Operations Manager for about eight years."
good,"I would clock in and check to see which department i'm in, then i would speak to everyone i passed by and start cleaning my department. I've learned that every customer may not have the brightest day or attitude but i try to brighten eveyone day up. The managers are sometimes fun and sometimes serious but they're all sweet and humble. They also love when you ask for help so you would know in the futre how to do it. I loved my coworkers they always seemed as if their mood would stay the same. The hardest part of my job would be that i may be scheduled to a plethra of departments on a very busy day. The most enjoyable part of my job would be when i accomplish everything and get done quickly."
good,Dealt with a lot of customers in different situations which help build better knowledge of what customers are in demand.
good,retail is very interesting place to work and meet new and exciting people every day.
good,"Being only employed only part-time had made me motivated to seek employment that is full-time and has a more steady schedule.  I have realized since starting at the company that I am highly motivated and accomplish tasks very effectively and timely.  I often finish before several of my coworkers.  I am seeking something full-time that will test my abilities and motivate me to feel I have  exceeded and accomplished goals set forth for me.  Being in a self employed position previously, it has made me realize how much I enjoy interacting and working with different people on a daily basis.  I just wish it was a better income to support my family and full-time."
good,Really enjoyed working for my direct supervisor. Good balance of work and life.
good,"Learned to work with a team more, mastering leaderships skills on a professional level, and becoming a more fast paced individual worker."
good,It was a good place to work because I was able to work there while going to school and they worked well with my hours
good,the time i spent at burlington i was treated like family by most of the staff. but was bullied and harrassed by others when i consulted manangment they did nothing because they were friends. hardetest part of the job was over looking the problems the store had regaurd how it was mananged.
good,nice and fun place to work. But can be better with the organize things are all over the place.
good,"Assist Supervisor with overseeing the cycle counters, forklift operators, and cycle count staff. Provide assist to supervisor in overseeing the inventory integrity and status of goods.

good,"Its a job, nothing spectacular. Didn't demand too much work."
good,"I was able to move up three times in 6yrs, with great working skills"
good,this job was one of my worse jobs ever didnt like it at all.They just wasnt what they said they were in the begining so i had to quite but it did help me alot with my customer service skills.
good,Upon entering the buildig waiting for the alarm to be confirm as off with the operations manager or manager on duty at the time. I would proceed to do my interior and exterior checks marking the date and signing for the day.report to the camera room and review the previous shifts notes.Report to the head cashier to safely supply the cash draws.
good,overall burlington coat factory is a great place to work at regardless of the hours and the pay rate
good,look and working environment Average. i wounld want to work there again.
good,Burlingtong Coat Factory is a place where new ideas/thoughts are always being tried. Not one store through out the company will look the same. I wouldn't say its hard but it is very challenging to work for Burlington due to the new ideas always being thought up.
good,i went in a 2 and didnt leave until 10. sometimes we would have overtime and they would tell us to 2 hours before work was over. i sweated and i was good worker i just dont want to be in a warehouse atmosphere.
good,Good enviroment to work at.Management very professional.Friendly co-workers.Loss Prevention field very limited.
good,"On the day to day operation of the company, I really enjoy my job and the company. I do feel there is limited opportunity for advancement"
good,"Working at Burlington coat factory was fun in some cases but overall retail is a demanding line of work, people are constantly buying clothes and whats in style and whats new is extremely important to people. The time of the year where the greatest amount of people shop is national holidays and back to school time. During times like those, management is tough on the employees, but we all stick together as fellow staff members and we help each other out when things get rough in the store. The hardest part of the job was the customers that have a bad day and come in with an attitude, its hard to please them but the key is to remember that they are probably stressed and aggravated and it has nothing to do with you personally, with those types of customers you have to stay calm and be patient."
good,"A typical day at work was punching in and getting on the floor to make sure customers were getting greeted, work in the coat department and helping customers. What i learned is how to deal with customers on a regular basis. My co workers were very friendly."
good,Burlington coat factory is a nice company to work for. Very team oriented and flexiable place. Management is very fair. Hardest part of the job is pleasing all the customers that which at times can be very damanding. In order to work in retail you have to have a lot of patience.
good,"good place to work if you need a job, salary isn't that good and raises aren't very good but made friends there"
good,"As long as you keep your business to yourself this will be a place for you. Otherwise, with all of the young people working there, there will be too much drama."
good,"great employees, pay days every week, 10% discount. easy going workplace"
good,It was a good job. I learned a lot being there. I learned how to do returns and layaway. I learned how to do merchandising and pricing on the clothes.
good,"Need to pay better/have more benefits,to be honest I like my boss and supervisor they were very nice to me,overall I would rate my experience working there a 6/10"
good,"Burlington coat factory was honestly a very unexpected experience. The task I was hired for felt very tiring, and at times is very strainful. But the people you get to work alongside with can make the the long days feel not so bad."
good,If you are looking for a job to get experiences then this is a good job to start off. Hours sucks. You don't get a lot so don't expect a lot. Only time you'll ever get hours is during the holiday (month of December) and after that your hours are cut back down. Poorly management.
good,"Great first job experience. People you work with are friendly and nice. A typical day at work us working the register,helping customers out and cleaning the work space."
good,"The environment working at Burlington for the most part is great. I love my coworkers and mostly enjoy my job, but there are flaws that provide a serious issue in the long run."
good,"Burlington is an incredible company.  Financially doing well.  Applicants should be aware that an above average work ethic is needed, not just in general, though in the retail field as well.  Retailers ask a lot of their associates, and Burlington is faster paced than most, especially in the off-price sector.  For anyone wanting to develop skills quickly, that has a can-do attitude, and is willing to ask, ""what else can I do today, how else can I help"", Burlington is a great way to get the additional skills to advance there, or into other roles with other companies."
good,"Everything is kinda jumbled and cluttered but everyone is nice. The work flow is easy going but has it has hang-ups. The only thing you really need to watch for is the general manager, pretty mean."
good,Working at Burlington is all right but working and receiving there's no air in receiving and the supervisor and manager think they can disrespect you by talking to you any kind of way. I learn to do my job at end of the day i go home to my family.
good,If I was getting paid at least the average for a Loss prevention Agent jobs I probably still be working there..Great people and managment but being paid near minimum wage. Its impossible to make a living.
good,When i got hired my manager had me set as flex meaning i wouldnt be guaranteed hours every week since you have to be available at least 10 hours each day of the weekend to be considered parttime. then i got up to part time.and i was putting in about 25-33 hours weekly til a new store manager came in and has me now working 5 hr shifts and then sometimes calls me if i can go to work earlier. It upsets me because for mothers who rely on babysitters know that they give there babysitters an advance notice of there schedules. This is really messing me up.
good,works well for students.  Allows flexible scheduling.  Work culture was great no issues with management.  Wear good shoes hard being on feet all shift
good,When I first started working for Burlington the store was well organized.When the Christmas Hoildays came arouend it was so disorganized. They didn'y hire enough staff to cover the store. We recevied several customer complaints because we were so understaffed.
good,"The only thing is you have to manage your time and be quick to get everything on the floor before the store opens, for little amount of money. The Employees are very nice and welcoming."
good,fun people to work with; not enough hours.  scheduled hours changed without notice. Limited air conditioning in workplace. Easy job to learn; on the job training
good,"It is a normal place to work but the pay is really low and is better if you have a schedule for the week."
good,Work is fast paced. Have to separate and stock merchandise before store opens every day. So you are always busy in receiving. Currently at a new Burlington that opened in Frisco.
good,Burlington is a fast paced. Store that doesn't give many hours to the store therefore they work there employees very hard expecting the work of three people's from one. They don't offer fun Time hours and no benefits
good,Working is fun with the right management and if you like to merchandise and are positive about the company programs. Sometimes upper management needed to recognize what the store managers go thru daily and appreciate them. Seem to always pick on things instead of praise.
good,I liked that job. I would help restock and cashier. It was fun to help people find great deals and what they wanted. The people you work with are friendly and caring.
good,"A typical day at work usually start with setting up work station to get everything ready, then proceed to sort clothes and other items in the store, then put everything out, lastly prep clothes to feed into the main sales floor from the back room."
good,Every employer is nice but the customer are a pain the booty. They are very disrespectful. they think we are there slaves. i didn't get payed a whole week when i clearly went to work.
good,"I am a cashier at Burlington so I check customer's items up and take their payment for the items. I take the hangers and security tags off."
good,"Working at Burlington was a great expereince, the coworkers were amazing and being active with customers were a plus. I learned alot of skills working there. The culture of Burlington wasn't much but there was a lot of love. The hardest part of working with Burlington wasn't hard at all."
good,As soon as you come into work you helping a customer. I learned that if you took the sensor off the clothes before ringing them up that it quicker and fast
good,Pretty laid back environment. Very busy around holidays of course I had a good experiment. The old manager was very shady but they have a new manager now so hopefully. It has gotten better.
good,Very clean and neat store but management could use some help. Scheduling is not as great as I thought it would be since they make associates work nights rather than mornings.
good,"The job actually is very straightforward you're told to do a task and complete in a certain amount of time. Usually you Ethier would be on the sale floor recovering your specific assigned area or you be up at the front being a cashier.  The issues mostly are an organization, their times their no supervisor and over tie many full timers and assistant manager would leave or transfer. The closing also has issues due to the sometimes lack of worker scheduled to close and the expectation of work done in a short amount of time. This leads to workers leaving later than they expected too. The hardest part sometimes is meeting expectations of the store manager"
good,It's over so all is well. I got what  needed at the time. It's a job and I did it to the best of my abilities. I met a lot of good people. Burlington is definitely a job for young people looking to make extra cash.
good,"Fun place to work work well with others "
good,"Management was pretty easy to work with and we're very flexible when it came to scheduling. Most of the cons were dealing with rude customers, which is a given when working in retail, and things that were controlled by corporate such as low pay, no A/C in the summer and lack of heat in the winter to a point where all of the cashiers were ringing up customers in their coats."
good,"The Job Is fast pace environment with large crowds on holidays. You learn how to multitask, Greet and help customers, and restock items on the floor. Workplace is full of different cultures the management team help you on the floor if needed. The hardest part of the job is been pulled to do more than one thing, the most enjoyable part if you done with your job and helping someone else you can clock out, plus you get more than one break if needed to stay longer."
good,"A typical day at work required us to open packages, put the pricing on the items and censoring things that needed senors. Once they were snored they was brought downstairs and put on the sales floor to be brought. "
good,"I was required to work 45hrs/wk. Poor Management, no follow through on upper management. The morale in the store is not great. Micromanage by upper management. One good thing about BCF is that they pay fairly well if not above average."
good,"When we are busy, everything you do feels futile. When we are slow, the day drags on on on. Also, the managers don’t really like to give breaks. If you ask for one and haven’t taken to many, or we’re not busy, they will give you one. However, they will not schedule breaks on the break schedule according to how many you’re supposed to have. Rather they will schedule according to what they think you should have."
good,I came into burlington with a manager who was transferred to a new location 4 to 5 months into my time there. Things were good. Until the manager came in. The store looked better but management was not doing well. Customers can sometimes be a bit snobby and will downright want to see you mess up. They know new workers when they see them and will try their best to pay less or take advantage of them. My time there was good while it lasted...but I wasn't planning on staying there for a year. I quit after 9 months. I couldn't handle it...
good,"loved my supervisors and co workers, they created a great work environment that made the job enjoyable.  The pay was hardly better than minimum wage and raises were small and infrequent, no matter how many extra responsibilities you took on. They would hire more part time employees and give supervisors associate responsibilities and tasks instead of hiring full time when employees were asking for hours."
good,Burlington was probably the most hardest job I've had since we had to have certain about of clothing ticketed by a certain hour. Other else than that everyone there is fun to work with and everyone is very supportive.
good,its a decent job if you are looking for something part time . good exeperience. the co workers make time and the job fun. but sometimes management could be better.
good,"Minimum wage work place with flexible hours, however managers will work around any schedule you may have (i.e. school). Work is not hard, though tedious. Employees are, for the most part, friendly and helpful."
good,Retail is tough business. Those you work with (your team) is sometimes all that gets you through your day. As well as. Good Management team. Unfortunately the store I was or am a part of is lacking in some of these areas. But doesnt mean we don’t strive everyday to change or fix these problems.  Its not only a great place to shop. Its a fun place to work.
good,"A typical day at work will start by checking out the workday schedule to make sure which employees I am working with, and who will come/leave at the shift. Make sure I am coordinating the work flow. Make sure that the costumer line is quickly and effectively moving. If there is not enough cashiers i would usually help out with the transactions by ringing. If asked, i would make change to the register and if needed, i would balance out the cash registers by operating cash pick up, in which i take the overloads of cash to the accounting office. When there is no costumer traffic I would usually make sure the front line is filled out and organized with merchandise such as candy, small accessories, and electronics. Another of part the job is to make sure the at the end of the night the costumer serve are is clean and ready to be used the next day. The hardest part of the job is not having enough staff to work with when its busy. The most enjoyable part is helping costumer out and having small talk with people from different backgrounds."
good,"Tenía muy buen sistema sobre ausencias y días libres, pero el personal no era muy agradable."
good,"its cool, if i had hours il would stay but i just got a check for 94 dollars. thats a slap in the face to me... work 4 days a week and only 4 hours a day. they say they can give you hours . then when you see schedule. its 6 to 10 everyday you work..... they might ask you stay a little longer. i notice when i did work 8 hour shift, i got one break. have not complain but i notice that. nothing hard about job besides getting hours"
good,Overall good place to work and advance. Growing company. Offers benefits and flexible hours for associates. Fast paced work environment. Team work is a must.
good,"Overall it was a good experience.  I worked there for 12 years and advanced my career from help desk associate to Customer Support Manager.  However, I ultimately left due to poor management.  I was informed my manager was demoted after my departure, however, while I was there he made work very difficult and stressful for not only myself but the entire department for about 5 years.  The worst manager I have ever had including the 2 I had prior to him whom I very much enjoyed working for."
good,Burlington is a good job but it needs to be more willing to give out hours cause an four hour shift isnt getting anyone anywhere. The management is awsome.
good,"Very nice team workers and managers ,good place,comunication with other people,.............the job is not too bad but sometimes there have alot of heavy stuff"
good,My manager we great and easy to get along with. Very flexible with scheduling. Glad I moved but wish I could of stayed at the company if it was closer.
good,I am a very hard worker.Punctual.Sometimes it was stressful due to rude customers.I enjoyed the fast paced atmosphere.I was disappointed that I only worked 3 days a week.And only 4 hrs.I would of preferred more work hours.
good,It's had good times an bad time working there but they will take advantage of you an take mostly every right as a person a push u to your limits an get right ups for taking a Lil break
good,I loved working tgere but i didnt like tge management they werent respectful that i had a kid and wasnt to good to keep up with employee other wise i love tge environment  my coworkers were great
good,"The pay is low which wouldn't be so bad if they gave employees enough hours. The actual work of a markdown associate is super chill and easy and it's fun to just chat with your team if you're working with cool people. Didn't have any problems with management. If you have to work in retail it's a pretty decent environment, just really hard to make any money."
good,"The people I worked with where like family, and the costumers where wonderful to serve. I often was at the cash register and dealt with costumer problems and quickly solved them in a positive manner."
good,"i enjoyed working in a different environment and people around me, i had a great experience with the employees and the managers that worked there and that has helped me improve in many ways. The place was super busy but i still managed to work things out and helped get everything done and ready for the end of the day. Seeing all the customers leave with a smile on their face was a great feeling for me and my employees."
good,Burlington is a good place to work but that is pretty much it. The management is there and they are supportive but its just a standard job. I didnt seem like there was much room for growth into upward management.
good,The job was great overall but management sucked really bad. Very high turnover rate. I was never a set schedule. A lot of call outs. They work with your schedule sometimes.
good,"It was an ok space, I didnt enjoy working there. I would constantly look at tht time for lunch or break so I could get out of there. I had a 15mins break."
good,"Everyday is different even the crazy days but long as you deliver excellent customer service a positive, professional attitude you can't go wrong. The hardest part of the job would be keeping a positive professional attitude when you feel a manager could benefit greatly with the knowledge from a few lessons on not what they say but how they say things and that employees are humans that deserve a level of respect and professionalism as well and just because a employee stands up for himself in a professional way their job wouldn't be at risk. "
good,I have developed a lot of skills and tools that I can take with me and use through out life. I have met a lot of people and get to know different cultures and backgrounds.
good,Burlington is a very nice place to work the managers is the nicest people the co workers they are very peaceful I like how they give u breaks and lunch the time is not bad the pay can be better
good,"A typical day at work involves me running around i three different shoe departments and placing out the shoes, making sure the shoes are the right way."
good,Everyday is different if your part time employee. There move you around a lot so you know everything about the store. It doesn't matter the position you were hired in you will and must learn everything.
good,"It was a good company to work for they there ups and downs but I enjoyed working with the  customers who came in to play bing on a daily, it was a fun place and good people"
good,"On a regular day, it was very busy but of course I was seasonal employee. It was enjoyable for the most part and I made many friends with the everyone"
good,Great customers and environment to work.  weekly pay with your choice of direct deposit. flexible schedule. amazing discounts and welcoming staff members.
good,"Well, They pay is okay and so are the hours! "
good,"Some managers are great, while others are not the best. Easy work day with minimal hours, but decent compensation for work required."
good,Going into work was enjoyable from clocking in managers let you know where you needed to be for the day. I was pregnant and they accommodated my needs. it was multicultural place but it felt like a big family. The hardest part of the job was trying to get hours because of my pregnancy. I honestly can say I enjoyed working there because it was like a huge family.
good,Burlington was horrific.Manager was very lazy and lack of responsibility.Workers didn't apply them self's to jobs that was assigned to them.
good,Very unorganized . Hours were vert limited. It was hard to get hours . Also bad communication between the mangers with the employees. Needs improvement on all.
good,"great work environment. OK staff, great benefits ,discounts on already low prices. fair pay to full-time employees.also theirs always room for growth or advancements within the company ."
good,A lot of work has to be done in little time. Job hours are inconsistent every week. Management is ok. They are pretty flexible with what days you can or cannot work. Attendance is important.
good,"The store at the time was going through maintenance, so it was a lot on construction while working.  Management were arguing a lot on what employees work on and where.  Hard time finding certain equipment and very crowded."
good,"Burlington was a fun experience , first time running a register at a clothing store and the people were very helpful when I first started working"
good,"Is good job , but the Pay is low"
good,"While I was at Burlington a lot of things were going on. It seemed like we had new people hired every week. When they would hire new people, they would cut into my hours, and I was not too fond of that practice. I was only there for a few months and we had 3 new managers in my time there. They were pretty fair though. If I needed them to do anything they would be there to help guide me through the situation."
good,"Retail was probably the most difficult job"
good,"I have learned with my time at Burlington that effort does not go unnoticed and that achieving a goal the seems impossible can be accomplished through planning, effort, and consistency."
good,A typical day at work is orgainzing items and placing them in the right order. I learned about some art products the were new to me and also how to help customers in a professional way. The management is sometimes good but often needs work on it. My co-workers are the best part of the job. They all nice and helpful. The hardest part of the job is dealing with rude and rough customers.
good,Burlington is a great place to work. They give a lot of incentive to the associates. Birthday parties. Petty cash to have holiday parties including 4th of July and Memorial Day. Not just Christmas etc
good,"Coworkers were amazing"
good,"The first few days of working the cash register was challenging but after a brief tutorial I got the hang of it. Good co-workers, good management , friendly staff."
good,"Burlingotn is a great work place, the employees to the awesome custumers brings a smile on my face when we all can work together by helping one another."
good,fast paced environment with little room for error everyone worked together to help get through the day and make everyone's shift a little easier. Very friendly place and people.
good,"Making schedule edit the schedule opening the store , cash registers . Doing paper work in the cash office. Balance the safe. Taking and working the truck .Merchardising the floor. Assisting with ringing and talking to the customers. I have learned to manage customer and employees . The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing how well the store looks and how happy we make the customer and employees. Teaching and coaching employes"
good,"There is no typical day when it comes to Burlington. Consistently completing corporate audits, schedules, internal and external investigations"
good,"High volume store, long hours, much work required, great compensation and benefits, overall great staff, great company overall"
good,"I would start off getting my draw from the manager on duty. Next I would go to the register I was assigned to and make sure the area was clean and organized. I spent most of my day ringing up customers. I was a closer because I was in high school so the hardest part was waking up in the morning after a long shift but the best part was the people I worked with were cool and fun to work with."
good,Burlington is an ok company to work at but they work you to hard. There are 6 full timers and they expect us to do everything and anything. Part timers chip in but really we run the store. Any major moves we do them. Each full timer merchandizes their own dept. and sometimes the other depts. too...
good,"One a normal day, the employee will clock in and depending on the time of day it is, they will start working either on recovery on the sales floor, opening cashier drawers, or just jump right into working at the cash register, ringing up customers. in the morning there is usually a meeting for all of the employees and managers. we wear walky-talkies to ensure that the managers can get a hold of coworkers easily if they need to move them from one area to another. When it's really busy it can be pretty tough, and especially when a customer constantly asks for discounts on the items they selected. Consistently needing the manager's help to give an employee a discount can be annoying especially to the manager... My favorite part of the job was when they had holiday parties and potlucks, because that usually meant food in the break room. There are a lot of details that need close attention when working because when a mistake is made, it can weigh on the management, and I learned that when I accidentally gave a customer the incorrect amount of change, and there was money that came up short on my register."
good,"Everyday is the same, dealing with customers, organizing through out your shift. Management seemed to schedule less help, so in result you had to cover multiple sections such as mens & women or kids and layaway. it was nothing hard about the job at all. the most enjoyable part of the job was seeing customers leaving satisfied."
good,"A typical day at work is usually contained at the front end of the store. Usually I'm in customer service and assisting co-workers. I learned sizing skills, layaways, returns, NJO lookup system, and better teamwork skills. Hardest part of the job would be assisting angry or upset customers but you just have to stay calm, cool, and collected and understand why their feeling the way they do. My co-workers all usually have a good attitude but of course everyone has their down days. Some are more team-oriented than others and care more about helping everyone and getting the job done other than meeting the minimum requirements and going home. Management is professional but sometimes interferes with personal situations and has favorites. Unfortunately, if you stick to yourself and do your job you will slide by."
good,"Putting away stock, running the cash register, helping customers, setting up the department.  I learned how to help customers better."
good,"management is everything. they make everyday worth it"
good,"The company trains and cross trains across a wide variety of different positions based on their need. A typical day of work is for a part time worker a 9 hour shift on a Saturday and Sunday. The hours are fairly long but they do include breaks for meals."
good,"I do daily audits rounds and surveillance. I have advanced on my Internal and External investigative skills. Management is very hands on and helpful whenever and wherever need be. Very energetic hard working employees with amazing team work always ready to help out me or co-workers, very team player organized. Hardest part of my job is closing a case on a Internal employee. The most enjoyable part of my job is catching External thief's and cutting our loses which makes room for Budget, raises, and company success."
good,Your work is already cut out for you. No time for goofing around. Constant work but a great and friendly work environment.
good,The most enjoyable part of the day is helping customers and meeting their needs.
good,I didn't like the manager.. he was extremely rude but I did enjoy working there. the employees all had good Vibes. When I was working there it felt like a family Cause we were so Close.
good,Busy always on the go. so time goes by fast. Great employees and flexible job
good,"Enjoyable job as a retail store manager.  Manageable workload, flexible policies which allowed for autonomy and decision making at store level.  Great ability to be creative in merchandising."
good,"A typical day at work was making sure customers were satified.."
good,I love the people I work with but I hate the company. The last thing they are worried about is their  workers and the pay is horrible!
good,"a very busy workplace, very fast-paced. expected to arrive about 20 minutes early, if in the morning shift you have to wait for someone to come open the door for you which can take a while as only managers have the key. I didn't see too much of management other than during pep rallies before the opening of the store. My coworkers were very dutiful, however everyone seemed to mind their own business. The hardest part of the job would be disagreeing with a team member who you were partnered with. The most enjoyable part is knowing i truly aided a customer to the best o my abilities."
good,"burlington coat factory is a great job for someone that is just starting their job search, college, or just looking for extra cash."
good,"Although I was a waver most of the time, I found it interesting to be working in the tax world. So much I've learned about balancing out you ""check book"" and staying on task with your spending habits, PAY YOUR DUES, and how to do taxes"
good,"I loved this store, its too bad that i was only seasonal help because it is an awesome place to work. The employees were very helpful."
good,Didn't like the manual labor. they have good benefits and after three months i believe you go for $7.25 to $11.00.
good,"Loved working with all the employees learned all area of each department and working with all area mangers.  enjoyed helping customers and seeing that they are  happy when leaving the store I worked a lot with taking markdowns in the store. setting up departments for ad's ,  unloading trucks getting merchandises ready for the sales floor"
good,"the typical day at work is busy, but fun to work in. the co workers made the job more fun. the management was sometimes helpful but always there when you needed them. the most enjoyable part is making that money."
good,"Received shipments into inventory, ensuring quality, color, count, and order numbers were correct . Completed and filed invoices. Contacted forklift drivers to have materials place in proper area. i was given the opportunity to train in label printing.Management was supportive. Coworkers efficient. Taking on the task of printing tickets were the hardest if machine would jam causing production to slow down. The location was close to home."
good,They could offer more compensation for what they ask of their associates.
good,If you have no experience and want to learn skills that can look good on your resume then this is a good start. Get in an learn all you can and take it somewhere else.
good,"Real teamwork attitude; no unnecessary hierarchy. Also,I was caught off guard when I started working here and would ask for help and my coworkers would actually stop what they were doing and come over and help me at the registers. Or they’d WALK Customers to where they needed to go. Being from overseas, we are suspicious of the simplest of niceties, this threw me off guard. Plus I was used to coworkers who guarded their work and didn’t want to have anything to do with anyone who couldn't help them. It’s been over a year and my coworkers are still acting this way. I think they just really want to help. And this attitude creates SUCH a great work environment."
good,"Cashier duties, customer service, racking and stocking new, old clothes."
good,i work hard and i learned new things things fast at any place ive ever worked
good,A day a Burlington Coat Factory is like a day at the multi-culture fair
good,"Burlington coat factory was good, the management there were strict but they work with you if you had a request. Its a big store which require aolot of cleaning, I work in linens dept which require me to know alot of stuff about house hold items. They start you off at minium raise, that kind of suck."
good,I enjoyed my years at Burlington Coat Factory. I learned how to organize and delegate responsibilites to my staff in an effective manner.
good,Burlington Coat Factory is a great company to work for but they have issues with training their entry level employees. If you don't figure out the job for yourself with not guidelines they will let you go fast.
good,"Good company, BCF is a economic retail store that could use more structure."
good,"A typical day in working at BCF was very simple, go into work make the break schedule made sure expired layaways were out. make sure cashiers were meeting their goals."
good,"Very serious place, great coworkers and steady work flow. Basic routine gets very tiring. On your feet for hours. High expectations and low tolerance."
good,"BCF is great place to start out of college. They hire young, friendly people who are eager to help each other out. Burlington has implemented many top Oracle systems and continues to improve their viability as a growing, maturing company."
good,"The managers here are very engaged at what they do. My co-workers are very kind, listen and do what they are suppose to without being told. On a daily basis i come in and make sure the front end is clean and that our customers leave happy and satisfied. I also work in the cash office and make sure all registers balance. Count the safe and verify deposits."
good,Typical Day Started At 8am. Ended At 3. I Learned The Ins And Outs Of Retail
good,"The Burlington Coat Factory experience isn't all peaches and cream. It is a wonderful place to work if you enjoy unity among the employees. The employees there work for each other and the customers around them. It makes for shorter recovery times and more time to have fun with the customers like one should. The problem with working here is the communication among management. They do their jobs and that is all one can expect of them; however, when someone does something wrong, they don't tell you right away. You don't hear from it until you are about ready to get written up. That's bad considering asking questions do not get you to the answer to wish to attain. All in all, while they need some work, I feel it is a decent working experience to behold."
good,Fast advancement if that's something you're looking for. The pay honestly is not fair for the work load. Most of the people are friendly and helpful. The job in itself is very stress once you are a Dept head.
good,I would not recommend this department store to anyone who has a family and is seeking adequate compensation for a long days work. They do not give you a set schedule and most employees may struggle to receive forty hours a week.
good,"This job is great for someone looking for a part time income or a full time position. They have opportunities for everyone. Pay is stable, and only full time employees receive benefits."
good,"Buena compañía, pero no hay horas aunque se hagan las ventas. Buen ambiente, excepto que se trabaja demás ya que no hay casi empleados. Me gustaba el rol destacado pero no había continuidad pq pasaba casi una semana afuera en lo q me volvían a poner en horario."
good,"It's  okay  for people that wants a hobby, its  retired, or make a few bucks. Although, you can't live off Burlington to pay Bills. Unless u become a manager."
good,I just didn't like the hours given. The manager had a bad attitude. But overall Burlington is a good company and the prices for the clothes are very affordable.
good,Morning shifts are slow but as the day continues the more productive and fast paced the environment is. Benefits are great but only for full time employees.
good,"I for the most part worked on my owe and only saw my superviser every three weeks .Communication needed work."
good,"Very welcoming place to work, the employees are pleased to work with you and teach you how things work. The managers welcome you into the team eager to teach."
good,"I enjoyed controlling the till's for daily work. I audited the previous days work on paper, balanced. I ordered all monies for safe. I did the banking. I assisted in front end as cashier's needed a break or got backed up with customer's checking out. I opened-closed. Balanced all till's at night and prepared them for next morning business. Took care of pulling tape from register and figuring out what problem was at hand when customer needed something corrected."
good,Disturbed customers would always come across but when you do your job right its always great accomplishment to see them leave the stored satisfied that's the goal and what the front end is for to make sure your shopping is great .
good,If was a great experience working retail but the travel was a hassle and was to much to continue doing everyday. But overall it was a nice place to work
good,"-Customer service"
good,I worked there for 3 years and believe its great company to work for. great benefits and opportunity fro advancement. that's it! there's nothing else for me to say.
good,Not a place I would recommend if you are looking for a secure income. Normally hours are odd and customers are very rude. You have to deal with savage customers as well as incompetent head managers.
good,this place was more for a seasonal worker and or a part time worker. i enjoyed working here except you really have to get up early and be on your own scheduele.
good,the store is awesome also gives you a chance to be social to the world i loved this job but had to leave due to family crisis. if there wasnot a family crisis i would still be working there.
good,"When I started working here I loved it, yes pay was not so great but job was easy. Couple months into it though you begin to realize it is like high school all over again. There is an older lady,supervisor, that works in the home department that is completly rude and disrepectful towards her coworkers. She will speak poorly about employees, has caused several other employees to quite because of her behavior. She is great at her job but lacks professionalism. I would highly recommend this job if it were not for the environment."
good,This is a position where I worked as a Salesfloor Associate at Burlington Coat Factory where I was stocking and helping selling different clothing and accessory products to consumers.
good,"Opportunity to learn all aspects of the job; equipment, ticketing, cash management, "
good,"Great place to work socially but financially, unless you are full time, this may not be the job for you. Weekly pay is great. Thats about as far as that goes. Great place to shop though!"
good,"Color black and whites to wear the store was ok to work people was nice they have good clothes the pay wasn't good you Lean a lot , it is a big store I like to layaway."
good,"Very nice environment  , friendly people ! Always helping one another . What I learned about with this job is how to talk to customers and have lots of patients with them , I would put things back where they would go and at times you'll clean the same eile like 2-3 times . It's just about patience"
good,Highly enjoyed working for Burlington Coat Factory. Definitely an upbeat work environment that can keep you moving and busy. Needs to work on a better organization system for layaway merchandise and getting schedules done in a timely manner.
good,"A typical day at work, unloading the trucks that came in. I learned that hard does pay off in the end no matter how long it takes. The hardest part of the job was having to leave work."
good,"A typical day at work was a lot of cash handling, and dealing with a lot of frustrated customers. Overall a full day was a lot of work, but at times enjoyable."
good,"The staff and management are kind. The salary is horrible. I received a lot of hours to work. I had to do work that was not in my job description, which was not fulfilling."
good,"Wonderful company just not enough pay. Firm fast pace. "
good,"A typical work day is fast paced and can get really busy. "
good,"Working there was alright, except the managers aren't very good and they don't give good hours to part-time workers. "
good,"Working at Burlington Coat Factory was a great learning experience. It was stressful at times not only because of the lack of employees but the reluctance of senior floor members to cooperate with the younger ones, this turned out to be the hardest part of the job. I had good mangement that instructed me on how to carry out strenuous tasks when there would be no one around to help. This was very gratifying and made me feel like an important member of the team (I was the only one able to do so many tasks alone)."
good,it was a good experience and getting out my comfort zone. i was always busy and on task the team member where very helpful and nice
good,There is a lot of room for growth working for Burlington Coat Factory. It is a great place to learn all the different areas in retail. I enjoyed working for this company and have a lot of great memories. The management team was excellent and worked very hard.
good,"At Burlington as a cashier my usual routine is scan my work card and go straight into work, my supervisor assigns me into a cashier and there i am responsible Scan items and ensure pricing is correct."
good,CSS- A daily day at work would be identified as  making sure the cashiers had what they needed making sure the daily tasks were assigned t each cashier and any additional tasks assigned by store manager
good,"Every day, I ensure that Burlington's deliveries are processed correctly and that my employees stay on task. I've learned how to work hard under pressure and to be a leader. As a part of the management team, I am confident that my employees respect me and look up to my leadership. The hardest part of my job is when my superiors don't listen to my amazing ideas to improve the productivity flow. The most enjoyable part of my job is making customers happy."
good,"Overall I liked working here mainly because my coworkers. Hours were terrible (not enough and constantly cutting) which is why I left. Not for people with real responsibilities. The job by itself was pretty easy. Ring up customers and provide good customer service. No individual sales goals or credit card apps like some other department stores. Would have stayed of hours were better. Some managers were okay, others were terrible. Just do your job and you won't have a problem here."
good,"you work hard ..lots of customer service and lots of cleaning , just a headache on the weekends"
good,"A typical day at work is clocking in and immediately working at a register. Every retail job has the occasional customer who gives a hard time, so this job teaches you how to handle that when it comes to customer service."
good,Was an okay place to work to bad it was only temporary. i loved being a cashier here.
good,A typical work day would be me cleaning up the fitting rooms every hour and maintaining a clean looking store while providing good customer service to anyone that needs it. I learned how to cashier and do customer service work while i was there. My co-worker were nice and helpful everyday. The hardest part of the job was working as a warehouse worker unpacking boxes all day. The most enjoyable part of the job was being a cashier helping customers.
good,"Very large, busy workplace. The most enjoyable part of the job was reaching the goal for sales. I've learned that engaging and being kind to customers if possible they will buy more items. The hardest part of the job was carrying hardware from downstairs to upstairs. "
good,*managent worked pretty good with your schedule
good,A typical day at work involved me providing customer service making sure my customers were always satisfied my job title was a cashier so I also handled money. I am a great multi-tasker. The hardest part of the job had to be dealing with some of the customers attitudes but I always go about business in a professional manner. I enjoyed keeping other satisfied. My co-workers were friendly. Management was ok!
good,I learned how hard it is to maintain organization in a high volume retail setting around the holiday season. With good management and team it makes it easier to deal with.
good,"I worked in the mens department.I worked directly with Customer service and directed phone calls.Merchandise management (Markdowns, make price tags, and Receiving)Seasonal store floor plans designs.Operated the telezon machine.Customized manikins. Price points.Store signs, and floor plans.Alterations, for new and old sales clothing items.Inventory and recovery store property. I enjoyed meeting new people."
good,a good job to get retail experience and customer interaction
good,"The Managers were very nice and professional. But they do need to work on their interviewing skills...But the overall store experience, was actually at ease and fun for the most part working as an intern; I just suggest them to work on interviewing their new applicants."
good,"I have never worked for a off price retailer. The processes for this company are very different then a discount store or department store. The payroll for the week depended on how many boxes of freight you received. The freight comes in the day before it is worked. You calculate the number of skids, number of boxes and the rate per hour to determine how many hours you could schedule the team. The employees were then texted their schedules for the next day. The hours and their schedules varied day to day and maybe they didn't receive hours for that day. If we over scheduled maybe due to the amount of freight we received then at the end of the week the sales floor employees hours would be cut. That is how the company determines how many hours a store would get. The typical work day for managers are 7-5 and 1-11p. Most of the time you were required to stay later. There was a lot to learn about a off price store and I learned a lot. The salary for managers is very good, but for the employees it is very low. The most enjoyable part of working at Burlington was to see the day to day variety of merchandise that came in. I call it a treasure hunt. Once the merchandise is gone it will never come back in. So, if a customer wants that item they need to purchase it at that time. Burlington is a very interesting company to work for."
good,The job was ok went to make extra money the store is not really family oriented to me when working I like to feel the store is family my coworker were nice and I had some lovely customers
good,"The job culture is great. I only wish we were payed more than $9/hr, but it’s understandable and it’s not a high end job. Managers are generally understanding and usually, if you are a great employee, they give you the time off you need. I really don’t have any complaints about this job, besides the schedule being the worst. It’s easy and the people are fun to work with. But it’s frustrating to deal with the schedule and excuses management gives us for it."
good,This job was insufferable. The other managers are intolerable. I hated this job so much that I wanted to get by a bus before I arrived. The people who I supervised were alright. Most of the people there lack the common sense which made working there difficult. The lack of communication and disregard for me as employee is where I draw the line.
good,"The typical day at work is very easy once you get the hang of it. After clocking in, you usually would find the supervisior and ask what they want you to do, which is unload the boxes and place them on a rack so they are better to be placed in the right area. Then after that, you would place the items on the right shelve. "
good,"If you are looking for a great way to gain retail experience Burlington is the best fit. It’s quick pace. A great way to experience customer service hands on, and learning how to maintain a organized facility."
good,Overall not too bad of a job. Would be better with way better pay and not getting hours cut. I will say the work can be a lot of fun with the right crew and manger.
good,A typical day at work was moving goods to the floor and ensuring that the sales floor was well maintained for shoppers.  Making sure that pricing was accurate.
good,I don't have nothing to say I worked there for a while  it was not for me  managers were ok some were straight mean The main boss was older as he'll and didnt kno what was going on in his store. They don't give you paid time off or vacation days. No benefits
good,"To be completely honest, this store gets some very strange customers.  If it weren't for the customers, I'd give this job 5 stars.  My coworkers and managers are amazing, which is why I've stayed at this job for so long.  Definitely would not work here full time, but I have enjoyed my time at Burlington and wouldn't trade it for another job."
good,Managers make good money but hourly Associates do not. Competition in the area pays higher and the company does not see as their competition. Regional Management to Corporate Management live in their own dream world and do not listen to middle management that is on the front lines. Customer Service grading systems are used incorrectly.
good,I feel that they can be a better place to work if they don't over the employees and up grade there pay. They have too many favors there and it make it hard for the people who really want to move up
good,"This was my very first official job so I was very excited to start work and have my own money. My manager was great I don't think I've have had a better manager since, he really took a chance on me giving me that job with no real work experience, and taking me under his wing personally showing me how to do different tasks at our job. The culture was good for the most part, of course there is always a few people you don't vibe with but it didn't ruin the experience for me. My typical day would start out putting my things in the break room and clocking in for my shift, logging in to my register and making sure my station was clean and neat throughout the day, as well as answering customer questions and concerns. On nights I would close, it was my responsibility to help clean and prep all registers for the morning shift pick up miscellaneous items and put them in they're respective areas."
good,I wanted to grow and learn about different ways to dress and grow in my creativity working at Burlington gave me that opportunity to be able to do that and become successful at it
good,good place to work for kids coming out of high school or college students looking to make easy money. good discounts at Burlington stores. hours are cut when its little work. fun celebration on holidays.
good,i enjoyed working in the back unloading the trucks and putting it out on the sales floor. Had a lot of good customers that i got to know when they heard i had to move the were going to miss me and i them that was the hardest part of my job. Management was ok there was some that thought they were better then others but other then that it was a good job.
good,"I would recomend Burlington Coat Factory to those that look for part time jobs for in unloading & merchandising for as long as you can work, but I left because of rude people that work for that company."
good,"I have worked for Burlington for over a year, the pay sucks and the demand that they put on employees is hard, It can be a good place to work if you are willing to do 3 peoples jobs with little money and little training"
good,The one i worked in was pleasant some managers more professional than others but that's normal as for business clean and fast paced employees are very knowledgeable and hard working
good,I worked at Burlington for two and half years and I had the best time the pay was good after a while and employee was even better. its a easy job. Some of the managers was the worst!!
good,it was the best work place  i ever started I learned a lot even though I wasn't there  that long the experience was more than rememberable  i loved the people and the orders
good,"A typical day of work was fun,a steady pace. management is understanding and will work with you but firm and allow no room for slack. Co workers at the workplace were fun loving and positive. The hardest part of the job in my opinion was finding what to do during lunch. i would work there again."
good,Working for burlington has its pros and cons it's a great place to work although it can be very frustrating at times. I've learned so much in the 6 years I've been employed with this company from customer service to everyday life decisions. By me working as a manager on duty I've learned that decision making is a process and that no matter what we are there to satisfy the customer and making the customer have the best shopping experience ever. I've learned how to do so many things that I can excel at in any company I choose. I honestly don't have a hard part about my job. It's very self explanatory on what to do it's very tedious but the job can be done.
good,This job is an okay job i really didnt enjoy it only because hours are terrible in some cases you will only get 10 hours a week and they wont give you anymore
good,I learned that all customers are usually right. I also liked that i met different people from all around the world. My co workers were very frindly when i first started working there. The hardest part of the job was making sure all my projects i was assigned to was finished by the end of the day.
good,Working hard and fast at the work I do and finish the job you do. and working with the employeses  is fun because we help each other out when need
good,"I did not enjoy my time at burlington. IT was Terrible, management, all just awful. didnot enjoy my time the people were very rude."
good,"Working here the work was easy, I learned everything fast but the management was very bad and the employs were lazy."
good,i really enjoy working for burlington. i was seasonal staff and i was really upset when they let me go
good,"A typical day a work I am on the floor recovering and merchandising. I also cashier when need it which is checkout, la-away, exchanges, and returns. I work will with my management and co-workers. The hardest part of the job is leaving a customer unsatisfied."
good,"A typical day for me would to answer the phone work on spreadsheets, answer phones. My team is great to work for most of them. The most enjoyable part of my job is the hours and i am by myself everyday."
good,Atypical day at work involves customer service all day. great interaction with different people. meet the needs of the store. I've learned that it is not a hard Job if you don't make it hard on yourself. Management plays the biggest role in all of the store. The hardest part of my Job is not being able to not meet a customers needs. Things I enjoy the most at my Job is the Co-Workers. They make it easy and fun to work. time fly's.
good,"First time working for a company of this magnitude. This particular employer taught me how to be structural and organized in a proper edict. Management influenced their employees to reach their full potential and rewarded those of exceptional work performance. A friendly work enviornment, which made your job enjoyable."
good,Burlington Coat Factory has taught me a lot in the retail/merchandise world. Being able to work with planners and buyers and working in the market was a great help.
good,Its ok for part time the very high turn over with employees management can be rude. There is favoritism at times from management with certain employees.
good,Working at Burlington they are family-friendly people. If you are not sure about something ask questions from a reliable resource like a manager or supervisor.
good,"It is an ovewrall good place to work, the place is a veery good environment, that's why it is a good place to work at, it is a good place to work at and good environment"
good,Fun fast paced environment. very busy location. Duties were unpacking and packing products/merchandise and maintaining the inventory.keeping the floors clear.
good,When working at Burlington you have to smile n make sure all customers are satisfied when they leave the store . When working in retail make sure you are always on time.
good,I think Burlington Factory is a good place to start working for. They cross train as they see fit. They also acknowledge their employees for all of their hard work.
good,Treated fairly the works was nice and like to help you rarely get customers who are just plain rude but it was a great place to work and get the experience from
good,"The job is very stressful because customers are willing to make messes right in front of your face. They do not care that you have to clean up after them. There would be customers they are capable of messing up a whole aisle. Now imagine them having kids running around! We have a candy stand. You need to be watchful of the kids because they will eat the candy and the parents will try to hide the eaten candy. I dont think the job is worth the pay.  The coworkers are great and the manager is fantastic. He is very understanding and cares about your concerns. The coworkers are not the problem. The scheduling is also very flexible. If you dont work hard constantly, you will have to stay late in the store cleaning up. The store closes at 9:30 but you would have to stay until 11pm if you are not cleaning hard."
good,"Good place to work.  Very Supportive, willing to work with me when I was ill, allowing myself to have the opportunity for giving myself breathing treatments while at work."
good,A typical day is you come in for Moring meeting if you work mornings then clock in and start your assignment. You may have a project depending on your department. You see the manager every so often walking around or helping out. You cover for people a lot when they go on breaks and cashiers may switch to sales floor some days. The culture is very diverse and I would say the hardest part is having to deal with rude and disrespectful customers. The most enjoyable part is making friends at work and being able to help you co-workers and customers out.
good,I loved working here great clothes great people the pay could've been better but overall I loved to shop so I was happy to be in the store everyday nd see the new clothes and shoes
good,"Whether working morning shifts or closing at night, the best part of working at Burlington is seeing the different styles everyone enjoyed. Burlington was full of styles for everyone. Burlington is filled with smiles, fun, and good deals! Management was okay, could be a lot better though, as far the ""he said, she said"" a lot of that goes on. The hardest part of working at Burlington honestly is trying to keep everyone on task when we are slow. A lot of loud side conversations go on when there is a small line instead of working on other things such as hangers, sorting nubs, and putting returns back on the floor. The most enjoyable is keeping smiles on the customers faces and making sure they leave satisfied."
good,"Overall it was a very calm and collective envioment. Everyone was very open and seemed to be interested in meeting the new employees. The work was very mellow and easy. The co- workers were very friendly. There wasn't really a hard part in the facility, pretty much enjoyable. I really enjoyed working as a cashier."
good,"A typical day would be helping customers, being a backup cashier, recovery, putting out merchandise, letting customers into the fitting room, sku checks for the cashiers, finding sizes for customers, sizing, colorizing, helping with training new associates"
good,There's not much to say about this job because I didn't work here that long.
good,I was usually running around taking care of other departments on top of my already messed up department. It was never a dull momment.
good,"Is a relaxed and nice place to work, management is very nice and understanding people. But short hours and low pay. Good for a part-time but you need to have a second job."
good,This job was very intense but i love my job and the people i worked with but the management could have ran better operations.I also learned how to be a great supervisor
good,"Burlington Coat Factory is a fair and balanced workplace. I enjoyed working at this place. However, I believe that the wage should be higher. Aside from that, the workplace culture is fair."
good,Very upbeat environment with insensitive management.co workers were rather kind. Not enough pay for what I was responsible for. And the management was insensitive
good,"* I come in early some days to help put out merchandise "
good,Work was steady/fast. Customer service was difficult do to low employee to customer ratio with inventory and merchandise on the floor with kept the floor organized and made it difficult to help with customer service and organize. Work was not difficult only time management required attention. Enjoyed work very much. Loved meeting costumers!
good,Cool Work PLace
good,"It was like a shortest seasonal job I had, and it was okay and sorta like working there. But one thing I didn't like, is working in the ladies depts on the lingerings, which made me feel uncomfortable and awkward. But I did like doing other recovery work though, mostly in the men and kids dept. IT only lasted like 2 or 3 months, it was like a shortest seasonal job I had"
good,It was a good job because it showed me something compare to my other two this job me more focused on helping others at a quick pace also when i was working there i was working with females that helped me help other females on there size on any kind of clothing
good,It was okay. Only complaint was when the air conditioner broke and it got to 98 degrees inside the store.  Also when parents would let their children run all around the store.
good,"Overall, I really enjoy the people that I work with.  This is a major plus to feel comfortable in the workplace.  Never have worked harder in my life though.  Expect to work 1 person the same as 3.  Mostly short staffed, hard to get your job actually done since you are also doing so many other associates jobs also."
good,Its a simple job. The worst part about the job to me is the fact that we stand up for 8hrs or more. My co-workers and managers are very humble hardworking people. Never had a confrontation or any problems at any of my jobs. Most enjoyable part to me is seeing the customers smile just because im smiling and giving them a welcoming greeting.
good,"There was just a few bad moments, with the people there . The Temp agency’s let in a lot of unsavory characters. Causing damage and theft. But there was a lot of cool people there as well."
good,"Burlington coat factory in my opinion has a very productive workspace , sales associates make sure to assist customers as best as they can  and while doing so make sure the aisles are clean"
good,"This was an excellent place to work for.  Pay, hours, productivity, team work, friendly atmosphere. Just don't get hurt.  Things will quickly spiral.  If you lose the ability to do the main job to the fullest do to job injury, corporate has management still giving you the same amount of hours doing something you don't normally do when working for Burlington.  Their workman's comp comes from the worst company ever.  They don't like to pay the way they are supposed to.  I recently won a lawsuit with them.  Management doesn't always do what they are supposed to when it comes to enforcing rules with everybody especially when it comes to safety."
good,"It was an average job, keeping all the coats neat after the customers try on the coats then throw them somewhere else."
good,I don’t work there no more buy it was a good company paid every weekend give you good hour when they wanted too you work with other people and you learn different things every different day
good,Burlington is not a good or bad job. my time there I learned to grow patience and expand horizon . being that its located on 14th  its very busy. funn
good,A typical day at work consisted of waking up from bed. And preparing yourself for a long day at work..
good,"Working at Burlington Coat Factory was great, only for the occasional raised discounts. Other than that, management is scarce, continuously have new supervisors and managers, pay is horrible but that is what is expected in retail. Atmosphere is dog eat dog, everyone is solely at work to tattle on each other in hopes of getting a raise or higher position."
good,"i enjoyed my work at hodge pest control. but two new technicians were added which cost me eight thousand a year due to not enogh work, putting alot of pressure on me to to find part time work to live. i do vapor barriers on the side to offset my income. I enjoyed working with owner building his business one customer at a time. i worked 120 hour every two weeks during the busy tie of the year. I learned to trouble shoot where i needed worked well with the customers and explained how i was going to treat their property. I worked 10 years by myself"
good,"nice place to work, if you are a teenager. you cannot afford to live on the hrs and pay that they provide due to the inconsistantcy of hrs.there is a lack of communication as far as requesting a day off."
good,A typical day at work at the store was about putting merchandise out for display and organizing.  I have learned a lot of people skill at this job and how to make to hard things about dealing with people fun.  I had great management at the store and they really trusted their employees are making merchandise calls on the floor.  The hardness part of the job was that it was every ending on the go backs for the dressing room.  The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to see all the new merchandise come in.
good,loved my job and coworkers but unfortunately management played favorites when it came to promotions hours breaks time off you name it if you werent a favorite you didnt do anything right no matter what
good,Loved working with customers. I had great co workers. We all helped each other. General manager was never available. Not a place to grow and very low pay.
good,Way too much work to only be paid 7.25 and hour pay should definitely be 9.00 to 10.00 dollars. Not enough hours I worked here and onlt worked 4 hours a day with 3 days on the schedule. I will never apply here again.
good,A good place to work at but it is also boring place to be around. I wasn't enjoy working there
good,"Nothing  to  bad to say, but nothing really good to say either..it is what it is, a job..nothing to build Hope's and dreams on..  just do what you are instructed to do ."
good,A typical day at work was nothing hard to do at all just repetitive.  Upper management was great at the small store I worked in.  Had only one supervisor that wasn't that great but she didn't work there very long. The hardest part of the job was working in receiving trying to get all the product out on the floor fast enough.  When associates wouldn't show up for work it made it harder to run the store with those we had. That happened a lot when I was there.  The most enjoyable part of the job were my coworkers themselves.  Keeping the store organized would be a close second to that because I like to keep things neat and tidy.  You will be putting a lot of things back that the customers get out of place.  I was there part time so I didn't get any benefits.
good,"keep sales floor nice pick up and hang clothes back on hangers, run register, help the customers with their shopping needs. answer phones, start layaways and put them up"
good,Burlington works well with part time employees. If your looking for full time employment I'd suggest searching for another company. Also pay starts at minimum wage. I have worked at this company for 4 years and I'm only making 11.20 an hour. for 12 hrs a week.
good,"management was not all it was said to be.  I was promised things and they were not followed through on.  Scheduling was a major issue, they never seemed to schedule staff or enough staff to accomplish the goals for the day."
good,"A typical day at work included:  Check day before sales and report to manager.  Touch base with manager on priorities for the day.  Delegate assigned task to team workers throughout the day.  Get new stock out to floor.  Merchandise duties/display new stock presentations. Service customers.  Supervise overall store operations throughout the day.  Balance end-of-day finances.  Open and close store.  "
good,"fun coworkers, no mangement personale when needed, discounts are awful"
good,"fun easy jobs that isnt as stressful as other retail jobs, coworkers and management were great, hardest part of this job is inventory which only happens once or twice a year"
good,"Not a flexible schedule. And poor hours if your a part time. They need to work on help their employees, if they have a 2nd job, work with the time days and hours they can work.  And on does days give at least 7 hours, not 4 hours. Some employees drive from far away to go work. Not cool to give 4 hours only."
good,Burlington is a great place to work this Burlington location just needs some organizing but I love it here its very diverse and that's what I really like about it and the people here are amazing and hard working.
good,"It's a great company. The upper management is horrible though, and advancement is almost impossible even with new stores opening. Their HR department needs improvement."
good,I enjoyed this job.  It was busy every day/night.  I enjoyed all the interaction with customers.  They could train their employees better.. They kinda just put them on the cash registers with little training.
good,This is a great place to learn and grow. A typical work day is working with and customers one on one. Good learning environment.
good,"fun, busy place to work, loved interacting with people all day. Liked how it was family friendly and convenient being in the mall everything you need in one place."
good,Great place to work but the management were not fair to the staff. The hours were not even at a part time level. Associates worked hard but was treated very wrong. They set a bad example as managers and had to way to keep employees under control.
good,"All positions are part-time unless you have your own department which is hard to come across because there is a lot of favoritism. You get a minimum of 12 hours, up to 20 (sometimes). The good thing is that you get paid on Fridays."
good,the managers would pick favorites a lot I was really lucky to me a supervisor I learned from co-workers from there an people would quite so they put me up on my position
good,I enjoyed interacting with the customers and assisting staff in different departments of the store
good,"A typical work day was com, I learn things on computer, management was ok, my co-workers was great, what I enjoy was dealing with the customers"
good,"The relationships created between the Co-workers was a strong positive and professional one, it made it fun and exciting to come to work everyday."
good,My managers were not flexible with my current status in High School and unavailability for certain days. One manager in particular told me I couldn't get off the day of my prom. I was very disappointed but took the day anyways.
good,My time at Burlington was a learning experience. I learned how to use the p.o.s system that I would later use at another job. I had fun with my coworkers when it wasn't busy and it kept me pretty busy!
good,Some of the staff was friendly and eager to help not all. The time and production management is not so good ! There is a lot of miscommunication between the higher ups in charge.
good,It was ok for the most part I was just disappointed on how they choose to tell me they no longer were employing me for reasons that were out of my control Even ThO I had a Doctors note
good,"Don't get me wrong, some of the best people you can meet come from a retail background, and Burlington is no different. That being said, there is a decided lack of communication between Upper [Corporate] Management, our Management Team, and the Floor Associates. it causes a lot of double work being done, and high stress situations when push comes to shove."
good,"the coworkers and managers are amazing and try to understand if there are any situations or anything personal that's going on. The managers usually get snacks and food to treat the team. There are donations that go on during holidays and some throughout the years for a different organization, such as back to school donations for supplies, and light the night."
good,Working for Burlington store was good experience. I always enjoy working with customers and helping others. I used great professionalism and great customer service skills.
good,"Very fast paced job, easy if your into retail. Great job just had worked in a location with not the best management but besides that it is a very good job would def recommend."
good,"Burlington was a fun place to work, it was easy not so much heavy lifting and not to many difficulties, the manager was also good and understanding. The one in (University Mall Btw)"
good,"The company needs to pay more and provide more hours. The budget cut is what causes the lack of employees and is the reason why the tore is the way it is. Also there is no growth in Burlington, no matter how much you learn and perfect something there is still no growth."
good,"If you're a student it's great hours, however unless you're management it's not a career for someone with a family. They say they don't have hours for part timers and will call at last minute to see if you want to work that day."
good,come in at 7am check emails and various other internet sources for the company assist receiving with fright push schedule all breaks and lunched for the day open all tills and have a brief morning rally with the team and go over all numbers and incustomer service information from the prior days business get with full time team and make all necessary merchandising moves per merch guidelines take conference calls as well as assist with any customer issues through out the day continue to assist receiving with freight push until all freight for the day is on the floor give the closing manager any updates for the day before leaving at 5or6
good,Maintenance department manager is completely unfair and likes to bring on his old friends from his previous job that have no experience what so ever and pay them more than the regular maintenance techs that have been there for years
good,"Working at Burlington was simple. The hardest part was dealing with your bosses. They are constantly breathing down you neck, and basically telling you to force customers to give their phone numbers and donations."
good,"Again, Retail at a different level, department store with very little help and everybody doing everything, no continuity at management level and plans changed with the weather.I would not want to go back there,"
good,When i first start first work at Burlington it was a calm workplace that was fun to work at till new store management come and became rude and unfair.
good,Typical retail environment. Store could be more organized. Not much opportunity for growth. Scheduling could be more flexible. Lacking in the work/life balance that comes with retail.
good,A good job if your still a high school student.Not for a grown person. Good for a college student that is just looking for work for the summer time until he/she go back to school.
good,It was a great first job at first. The workers are social and sometimes rude. They help you when you ask questions and the store has a great customer service staff.
good,It was a very steady job you never had the same postions everyday I had to switch postions. So you have to be very flexiably an time management be able to drop what you doing to help your staff members.
good,"I liked the job, met a lot of very cool and nice people. They just didn't pay me enough. It's a good part time job, but I would not work there full time."
good,"I ran the Customer Service desk. I did exchanges, returns, layaways. Also customer complaints. I packaged Layaways, counted my drawer down at the end of the night."
good,They expect a lot of work done by a small crew and do not provide enough time for it to be done. There's a lack of communication from higher management to the small workers. I love the people I work with which is what keeps me there for all these years. I would not recommend the job to anyone unless they are just looking for a simple part time which will stress you out for the wrong reasons.
good,Straight forward instructions and a good training program. The schedules are very flexible and perfect for a student such as myself.
good,"Chaotic. Customers would come into the store and tear it apart looking for what they want. It's understandable, us employees get paid to keep up with the store not the customers. I loved the job as a cashier. There were so many nice people that would come through. The only thing was that the co-workers were into a lot of drama. There was gossip and posies just like High School. I didn't mind because I wasn't involved. I would stick to myself and focus on the job. Management was okay. There were a few really awesome ones and others were a bit rude. It's hard to understand how people with attitudes, illiteracy, and laziness could advance."
good,"Liked my coworkers , loved the atmosphere , didnt like the hours I worked , my manager was super nice and understanding, there uniforms were alright didnt like some of the supervisors , wish it was in the mall instead of a separate store"
good,Burlington was a blast to work for. The co-workers were great as was the management team. Job was easy but very fast paced. Merchandise was a hit or miss.
good,"I would spend my day ringing out customers and giving customer service."
good,"I enjoy working with this company, but i feel they give unrealistic goals for one person thats the hardest part of working there. Some dont feel appreciated there. You show up and you have a large portion to clean and organize. Also would have to cashier as you go. There is usually 1 to 2 cashiers and 3 people on the floor. the easiest part is cashiering, Co-workers are friendly I get along with  them all."
good,I learned a lot about working retail. I was also able to work with different cultures. I gained a new respect for customer service. Although the company is very flawed.
good,"Work is not a place to make friends but you can make it fun, and that is what Burlington does. As for my day of work it is eight hours everyday, forty hours a week, sometimes more. In the morning as a full time department lead, I get what projects done that need to be done. By that I mean anything that needs shifting, reworked, touched up, etc, is basically my mornings. If I am closing the store that night then I make sure my recovery is very well neat, clean, and organize for the customers in the morning for opening. In between doing all of that I do encounter with customers, do other things if needed such as markdowns, customer service, training new employees, you name it I most likely do it."
good,"A great place to work, but management a little unorganized. minor schedule mess ups and clock in mess ups, but all fixed in timely fashion. pay is reasonable but never given enough hours. bad turn over rate."
good,"Everyday I go around to check for proper signing. Thankfully my department is the store managers baby. So when the merchandising team can't put out new clothing in the morning, she is there to size & display the product beautifully. Giving me time to work on any problem areas or projects I can do. And since Women's Clothing (Sportwear) is one of the hardest areas to maintain... I never run out of things to do. "
good,"Over all each Department Supervisor seem to be in my opinion kind,respectful,and professional more so then the manager of the store."
good,"It's a great place to work, never a dull moment theres always something to do."
good,My overall experience at Burlington was good. I had a chance to work with a lot of people from me being able to adapt to any department within the company from shipping and receiving to customer service/cashiering duties.
good,Most of the work was overwhelming. They set you wherever they want/need you. In my case i was in charge of 4 departments and was often to work them alone for 8 hours. So it can be exhausting especially during busy hours. Good thing was i got paid weekly. Often went home sore after getting layaways. You basically have to be quick and okay to carry boxes and bags while trying to figure out their organization skills.
good,The store I worked for ..I was uncomfortable all the girls just talk no attention to customers .. management was ok pay was a little over minimum wage ..you receive a small discount I mean it's cool job..nice things in the store though.
good,"I’m a dedicated, hard working individual. I take pride in whatever job I am employed at, and I love doing whatever task is given to me at my best ability. This includes Burlington. For a college graduate this is no place to be, unless within upper management. Great side job, but for the hours you get, it will not be enough to sustain you. Will need both this job and another"
good,"it was very busy, needed more leaders in the team so if you enjoy that go for it. People really help you , the only bad thing is no one really teaches you what to do you kinda have to figure it out yourself to not get in trouble."
good,"When I first started working at Burlington, it was pretty nice at first. I was really happy because it was my first job and they were the first people to give me a chance. But an incident happened about 2 months into me working there. They had told me something and just kind of said well you did this but it was a training error. I was confused so I called a family member and talked to them about it. They came up to my job and talked to the manager and the manager basically said that this didn't happen and was just saying he can't say this but still told them anyway. And after that he started treating me kind of rudely. He would greet all my other coworkers but would ignore me. He would tell them what he wanted them to do, but then get them to tell me what he wants me to do. It was just very childish and unprofessional. So after a little bit I put in my 2 weeks notice. I believe Burlington has potential to be great, but they need better people."
good,Big box retailer. It was a good place to work for the time that I was there. A lot of changes were being made which in turn made a lot of employees leave.
good,"I have gone above and beyond for this company and have seen other people who have been there less than I have, advance in different departments/positions with no experience."
good,"Love my fellow team members.  The manager is willing to work with your schedule.  The hours available are very inconsistent.  Great team players, everyone works well together.  Most all shifts are available."
good,"It was a good part time job, great for students. it was a routine job. Management was bad but my coworkers made the job a little easier. We also got paid weekly."
good,My first job and It was alright you just need to be under the right manager and we dont get paid fairly for the amount of work corporate wants to put us through. It's always about making money.
good,"Interacting with my customers and getting to know them."
good,Always changing leading the way in sales and meeting the needs of customers from all over.  From clothing to furniture this place has all you need and more.  Workers are always moving providing the services you need and more.  This place keeps everyone on their toes.
good,As a receiving associate we would put away inventory. I really enjoyed organizing the sales floor. To be able to see all of the new items as they came in was a very fun experience. I would definitely recommend this position to anyone wanting to work in retail.
good,Burlington overall was a great work environment but the pay is not up to part. If you are looking for a job with very few hours and min wage pay then this is the place for you!
good,They work with your schedule and they pay is good with good hours and nice coworkers slow work days sometimes times people call of so your asked to stay later or come in early or come in when your not scheduled to work
good,"I wasn't there long, I was maybe working three days a week at four hours a day. Definitely not livable. It was a super easy job, but you definitely need another job if you're gonna work here."
good,I worked at Burlington while I was finishing school. It was great because it had flexible hours and days. Management was easy and accommodating for me.
good,Working here there is no work/life balance. It's all work if you are full time. There is rarely coverage. Split days off. Only recommend as a part time job.
good,This was a great place to start in retail if you are a student or just need a part time job this is great for you only thing you will only get 30 hours a week and no benefits
good,It was okay as long as you had something to do. if not the day would seem like it was very long. also at my location my boss didnt give me alotof hours at all so that was the biggest downside.
good,"Its ok if you wanna get experience, not a permanent job, doesn't give raises, supervisors don't care about unless you guys are buddy buddy or you're kissing their butt."
good,"Good job to start off with building a budget or savings. Very friendly,  well balanced, and Friendly environment. 15-20 % discount on all merchandise in store depending on store. Only thing is not much really a long term job to keep just a start off."
good,Well I really kind of like this job more than my recent one even though it was low pay. I really did not have to deal with a lot of customers but overall it was kind of a fitting environment. The managers were okay. there were not as bad as the ones at my recent job. It was days were I was upset and I worked slow. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to my associates while working hard. The hardest part was standing at one spot the whole shift. I learned a lot from that job. Never give up.
good,"they always accomidated me with my needs when it came to scheduling. My supervisors was great to work with, but store management barely acknowledged us and complimented our good work. Most days they were rude and nasty to the employees they didn't like and gave hours to who was their favorites. Also got low pay for what was expected of me."
good,Great job to learn how to multitask and work with others. Generaly you take care of customers with clothing ideas or checking them out. Help with go backs
good,great experience and learned a lot that i didn't know before. Had fun working for burlington coat factory. Short breaks and short luches but other than that fun place to work and learn and grow.
good,"Typical day at work was arriving at 6 am and working until whenever we get the heads up to stop. In this job you learn about retail and customer interaction."
good,"This is a great place to work of you are looking for part time hours. It is clean and the managers are very nice. The hardest part of the job was the lack of resources on the floor, but that wasnt often."
good,"Didnt work there long, lots of room for growth. they hire from within. give there employees more than they can handle and work life balance is very low"
good,"Burlington is always busy. we always have big lines. as a supervisor, I have to expedite the lines and supervise all the cashiers; which is Fun and stressful at the same time. we have a friendly work environment. we have fun working together. The hardest part of the job is to keep the place clean while we have almost a mile long lines but everyone does a pretty good job on that."
good,Well I arrive around 6 in the morning. Start the day with setting out what has to be done. Work as a team on braking down the truck orders for the store. Put all merchandise out for the day.
good,"I like the position I am in at Burlington. More hours a week would be great. The people are great to work with. The work is self explanatory, however, they do train well. Usually receive a truck once a week so we only work 4 hours, 3 days a week."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job you where able to work when store was closed to the public and able to work at a faster pace and able to buy with your discount and get extra discount on mark-downs.
good,This job allows you to stay up to date on the latest fashions and current sales. This job is cool for people in school or just need a little gig for the time being.THIS IS NOT A CAREER.
good,"They cut hours a lot during off season, there is no real training and you will be responsible for training new employments. The pay is minimum wage but up to 8.00. Raises are only like .05-.10 basically nothing."
good,I would say Burlington is a great place to work if you are still in high school
good,My typical work day was at opening to very rarely closing. I learned how to do quality customer service in a fast pace and good timely manner. Upper management was fair and good. Co-workers were not always happy. The hardest thing about the job was it's location and being so far away. I enjoyed seeing new faces everyday and being able to provide good service.
good,"A typical day at work for me is maintaining a clean sales floor and constant monitoring fitting rooms. I help out in other departments as needed. Each day I learn a different strategy on how to help customers and keep a presentable display for our merchandise. "
good,"While there's plenty of space to roam and build team work, the motivation from other co-workers wasn't there."
good,Everyday at work I put out merchandise with a group of five.I delegate daily responsibilites.I worked in five different departments every day.The hardest part of my job was doing other duties that I wasn't responsible for.The most enjoyable part of it was working with coworkers and helping customers with their purchases.
good,"not Much Hours For Most Employees Including My Self, Its A Friendly Place , All The Associates Get Along , Management Is Good"
good,"Hands on experience in accepting payments from customers and give change and receipts , Highly skilled in using scanners , cash registers , and calculators to calculate the price of items that customers buy , Proven record of using the right process for cash , credit cards , or other types of payment in depth knowledge of handling returns and exchange of goods , Through understanding of counting the money thats in the register at the beginning and at the  end of the shift. All so worked in Lay-Way Department , Picking up and putting customers clothes in lay-way . One of the mangers put my Card as a Level 1 ( Key Scan ) ."
good,I have a good relationship with my managers. They direct certain goals for my day but allow me to work independently. I have alot of responsibilities and also have to shift gears if they need me in other areas for backup.
good,"It's a job...if you need a temporary job until you find a better or looking for a part-time job. It's very rare to receive full time, there are a few tenured employees who are full time. Managers aren't too bad except for one in particular. As a cashier you are ALWAYS being watched and hardly get to take a break because many times it gets very busy. The weekends are a nightmare because EVERYONE comes to shop and the lines are ridiculous. Overall, the job is low pay, part-time, customer service, and 30 minute lunches."
good,"A typical day in the cash office, have a short amount of time to have everything ready for the day while answering the phone. I learned not to get frustrated and stay on task. The management was stressed also, but helpful. The greatest co-workers. The hardest part of job if a cashier was short was it a paper mistake or a true shortage. The end of day enjoy a job well done."
good,"Never bored. Unloading trucks, processing freight, merchandising, customer service, cashier, price changes, changing departments to fit the next season, setting for sales. Each day will be different. The management will work with you on what you do best."
good,Burlington Coat Factory was a very good place to work. I was able to gain my customer service experience and I also was able to advance in the company. A typical day at work consisted of dealing hands on with customers non stop. management was very easy to communicate with. The co-workers were nice and friendly and maintained a good environment. The hardest part of the job was having to deal with the unhappy customers who would tend to act irate in the store. The enjoyable part of the job was always striving to satisfy my customers.
good,"It is a place where you need to work hard and give 110% all the time with very little resources."
good,A typical day at work was greeting the customers and making cash/ credit transactions. The managers were a little annoying and were always on your back. I had cool coworkers who I became friends with in the end. The hardest part of the job was cleaning up after the store was closed. We would be in there for hours cleaning. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers and just having fun with my coworkers.
good,"I Don't like Min Wages. It's Pretty easy to do, the system is pretty easy as a cashier."
good,I really enjoyed working here and interacting with all the customers and my daily duties. I just wish i hadn't of gotten sick and lost my job.
good,Good workplace to start off with an job but not really a long term job
good,"Very little management help with questions, concerns. Hard to advance within the warehouse. Management has a the habbit of repeating personal information ot other management & employees."
good,nothing bad to say but I didn't like when they made us make people get a creditcard.i would tell anyone to work there but you have to have patience cause if you don't you will not make it
good,"if you like to work any hours and dont mind days or nite .this job is for you."
good,I had a great time at this job I was pregnant at the time but I never felt overworked and I was always treated with respect I was always busy but I had fun doing my job and making costumers happy
good,Your trained on a comp and then thrown out on your own. People feel bothered when your needing help. Must cashier fast in certain way may not best way every time.  Co workers good people.
good,Burlington is a good place to work.  The coworkers are very friendly. There is opportunity for job advancement if you work hard and have good attendance.
good,Its an ok place to work but it seems as though the more qualified employees regularly get passed over for other employees that seem to cater to management
good,"a typical work day was filled with fun and laughter, often fatigue. the only real issues we had was from some of the management, and the head of LP. other than that, nice place to work"
good,Working at Burlington Coat Factory what is a good experience. It is a relaxed place to work with good people and slow pace work. I would recommend this type of job to an elderly person or a person with a disability because you can take this job at your own pace.
good,Enjoy working at Burlington just not enough pay for the amount of fast paced work. I love the hours just not enough. Would love to grow and just want to learn more than one position
good,Great job with good management and good coworkers. The only con to this jobs was the turnover with the store managers; 3 in less than a year and the low pay. The good part is that the managers that stayed were good enough to run the store without a store manager. You are celebrated for doing good work.
good,It's not a job you can live on! Great job for high school students even college students also. The pay isn't really nothing in the state of Florida! Get a lot of discounts.
good,My Co workers are very nice and the mgmt is very understanding when it comes to personal issues. Other employees are friendly and helpful to new employees
good,"Job is very different when I left from when I began. When I began it was a relaxed, fun, place to work. When I left, 2 years after company was sold, the atmosphere had made a 180 degree turn. Then getting job done as quickly as possible with as little help as possible was what ruled. The old standards no longer really mattered. Personal customer service and making it easier for the shopper were no longer as important."
good,The hours are given mostly to the older workers. But you can make the atmosphere better each time. Still no matter what happen in there; Thank God! Still I Rise!!!
good,The hours at Burlington arnt so good because of the way they distribute the hours. They make sure everyone works but not everyone wants little hours alot of people want full time or at least 10 hours a day and some people get like 5 or less.
good,It was a an excellent experience but unfortunately I had to leave the job because they were not paying me enough for what I was doing so I decided to move else where.
good,It was a good workplace. Lots of nice customers and employees. Durning the holidays there is a constent amount of customers coming in and out the store
good,"The store is a nice place to work depending on the day, it is easy to learn about whatever there is you need to know. The management is cool. Period.."
good,it was alright even it was sometimes streesful with grumpy customers I enjoyed my job. enjoy helping customers the best I could. they needed to make things better for the employees example: giving brakes and how they treat employees
good,"Working for Burlington was an overall good experience. Only negative quality is that they do not give 20-30hours for part time employees. When only getting a 12 hours work week, it makes you feel unappreciated as a hardworking employee."
good,"Everyday was the same process, open shipment boxes and made the merchandise floor ready. censoring clothing shoes and accessories in a well lit stock room."
good,"A typical day would be in the warehouse receiving large numbers of shipments on a regular basis.  They are responsible for the receipt, verification and recording of raw materials and that the contents are correct products that come into the company. They often are involved with storing inventory for shipment. The hardest part of the job might be receiving heavy merchandise. The most enjoyable part of the job would be lunch break, they respect your time of break."
good,i was young and that was my first job. i enjoyed it and i worked with and awesome staff. there was nothing we could not talk about it was always fun at the office
good,I enjoyed working with Burlington due to the lovely customers and amazing sale prices they have. The store was always organized and I got to learn  alot of new things such as management.
good,"Things I have learned working in Burlington:"
good,"All of the employees were warm and very helpful. He location was convenient and all  of the employees were very amiable. The store  layout was very pleasing.  All sale items are conveniently located., and the sales associates were always available to assist with questions. The cashier lines were somewhat long at times.  I learned alot about markdowns and how to use floor product equipment.  The loss prevention staff was always available for loss prevention and there was a quaint lunchroom."
good,Great Experience all around. I learned a lot about cashing and customer service and being on the sales floor but the pay wasn't so great and hours wasn't bad.
good,The manager that made the schedule while i was working was horrible she never had the right amount of people to cover the areas. We had to cover multiple department when she worked on the schedule.
good,Work started with separating the truck into areas to make it easier to put on the floor. unloaded truck when it came from the warehouse. Also had to help out at the warehouse.
good,"A typical day at work would be constant movement there's not one moments when someone is just standing around. There is plenty of work to do believe me I have had to do a lot more than my share. with the amount of work we got most employee's couldn't Handel it my department was always under staffed hence me doing more than my share. The hardest this about working in Burlington Coat factory was being over worked for little pay I felt if I'm going to break my back for a job I could at least do so for one that pays well, but I couldn't complain it was a jobs and it was paying the bills for time being until I find something else. All my hard work wasn't for nothing it showed I can be depended on when there was a time in need. Which opened up opportunities for me to learn thing out side my field just in case someone was out sick. I learned out working in Burlington I learned how to work with a crew and how most of the operating systems work throughout the building. Management was pretty good keeping you on your toes making sure things were done right and giving help when it was needed. I loved all the people I got to meet a lot of friendships were made."
good,"Daily responsibilities included keeping an organized work space, and transaction file, all the while assisting new hires with operating company systems."
good,It's a great part time job for someone without many bills to pay. limited hours but good people and simple work. The management is pretty good. I only work a couple days a week and I wish I worked more but that's about my only con.
good,"Burlington is an ok store to work at, but there are a lot of things I did not like about this job. I loved the diversity of the workplace from the customers down to my fellow employees. I am a fashionista so working there was great in purchasing items for me, my family,, and my house. I have learned a lot of things that I have carried with me. I was a cashier but I wanted to learn other things as well. I love how corporate appreciate their employees by giving them gifts for being a great worker. The thing I disliked about Burlington was the hours and management. The hours were very little and your paycheck wasn't that much and the management sucks, I feel like they could have better people in managing a store. There was a lot of favoritism going  on. Once I asked for more hours I actually gotten less hours than I had before. Management was more worried about personal relations instead of work relations. Too much gossiping for no apparent reason."
good,Responsibilities included having the ability to utilize strong interpersonal skills.  Reported to Loss Prevention Manager in human resources daily regarding security audits & the stores recent activities. Used Sherlock program to investigate fraudulent returns. Enforced company standards to all staff. Investigated & resolved employee thefts. Maintained surveillance of individuals involved in dishonest or illegal activity within the store.  Had to both interrogate and detain shoplifters until police arrived on site. Patrolled the store and stood at high valued locations.
good,"Typical work day for someone in Receiving is starting at 6am to unload the truck and then merchandising for several hours before going to the back and processing clothing for more hours. Depending on the size of the truck it can take anywhere from four hours to a full day or more of tiring work."
good,Can't wait to Become a Team Member with you Guys I Really Do like The Way You All working progress Goes . The Only Hard Part about it is Whenever It Gets Packed and The Clothing are just everywhere
good,"Burlington Coat Factory was a very fun place to work. In the receiving department there is so much to do. However, this specific location was not very professional. They need to improve training, and enforcement on rules.  Management also needs to be more accountable for their actions."
good,It was a good company to work for. The company did not have a good work life balance in place. I worked on all weekends and holidays.
good,how to supervise the back receiving room..how to become a good loss prevention associate.the co workers were great..hrdest part of the job..catching thiefs
good,"Working on freight every single day, i learned helping my co workers out on their freight as well, from each department, the managers aren't really on the same page. One manager says to do something then the other manager says i shouldn't be doing it i had about 5 managers they all had different things on how to do work. It was just crazy and hectic. One of the hardest thing was that at first while i was working there most of my first co workers quit and i stayed alone doing the whole freight by myself and  working at a fast pace couldn't finished as much as i would had hope too. Until i had to clarify my self that i needed new co workers in my department so we can all execute the job as productive as possible  *& when they did hire more i was more than happy that i had the best team helping one another with the merchandise. loved it."
good,"A typical day at work included: clocking in, reporting to me supervisor to find out my daily duties, signing in on a register, offering great customer service, and a speedy and delightful check-out. I learned how to handle difficult situation in a business setting. My management staff did the best they could, with what they were allotted. The co-workers were hard workers, yet very opinionated."
good,I'm looking for an advancement in my temporary career. Making more money then a minimum wage job. Full time with benefits whether that's a labor constructive type of work or office work. I'm great at math and organization. Athletic and love hard work. As well as people. A well rounded individual for a job worth more then minimum wage.
good,"long hours"
good,Working through this company was sort of a tough process. Everyday we would come to work 7:30 am wait for our pallet to come. Some pallets may come with 30 boxes maybe more or maybe less it was an interesting experience
good,Loved my co-workers and most customers. Corporate had no heart for its employees.
good,"A typical day at work ..I would make sure that my drawer was counted and correct in the morning. I would make sure my area was clean and that I had all supplies I needed to start my day."
good,"•	Make the daily, weekly, and monthly reports, deposits, and all the other paperwork the auditor needed."
good,"fun place to work, opportunity to help people and make customers happy, fun co-workers but not enough hours and not enough opportunities of grown"
good,"I really enjoyed working for Burlington! This was my first retail job working as a cashier and it was better then I thought it would be. It was an easy job, but I still worked hard.I was hired as a Cashier but I also worked in different departments here and there, some I enjoy more then others. Most of the mangers were very cool, They allowed me to use my skills and learn and they were always available when I needed help with something. The hardest part of the job was probably standing on my feet. But eventually my feet got use to it and I gain a tolerance. The most enjoyable was meeting people. There where a lot of funny, cool, interesting people.Even though the job got repetitive at some points the people always changed which i enjoyed ;)"
good,"the most enjoyable part of the job ,was that there was always something to do interaction with employees and customers"
good,Co workers are friendly and easy to work with.  Management has challenges regarding workflow and job assignments.  Enjoy working with customers and helping them achieve what they are looking for.  Would like to work more hours
good,lots of running around and was a great experience great employees
good,I gave great customer sevice to customer by helping them around the store by finding merchandise and serving them at the cash register. Management was always changing. Co- workers was fun. There was no hard parts of the jobs. I really enjoyed helping the customers.
good,"Cool place to work, far diffrent from admin postions. They work ya and theres always work to be done. The people you work with are cool just they get lazy & leave work up to you. Put it simple....management dont care. They take all the Hours and leave you with 10-20hrs a week, THATS IF YOUR LUCKY! good for a young kid."
good,"Learned different aspects of retail at this job and I loved my co-workers! Minimum wage works as long as you can get the hours, but its highly dependent on high and low retail seasons."
good,"Typically, I liked my job at Burlington. Usually this depended on if there was enough employees there to be able to handle the work load for the day and what management was there."
good,"good customer service, sale floor is alway messy, not a clean lunch room. co-worker alway complain about the work, and the pay.I did not like this job, because it's only pay 7.25 per hour, that can not help paying for my rent and food,"
good,"Clock in, check department for recovery, broken and/or damaged merchandise. Check with receiving for box count for department, A to do list for associates to do. Check stock levels, recovery in stock room. Managers meeting discuss plan of action for today. Recover front end, restock as necessary. Dust, recovery of crib pad. Hang clothes in infant apparrel to teens. check sizing. check my to do list from corporate. Look in receiving for Special order, make sure layaways are current, return to stock outdated layaway. Call in special orders, file and get receipts from front end. File paperwork, pull out old files (keep in bottom drawer). Do the schedule for two week time frame. Hand in to office schedules. Make correction on schedule if necesssary. process freight to floor or back stock or top stock. get ready to go home."
good,"Had to go in and maintain my department at top shape, help customers in everything they need. Have a good communication with customers to figure out what they were looking for. Management was kind of picky, they were on top of the employees alot, but they were very helpful. the environment was great the co-workers were great also, they would help and teach everything they knew. Hardest part of the job was that we had to be doing something even though there wasnt much to do."
good,"Burlington is a very customer service oriented company with high standards for customer satisfaction. Employees are overworked and underpaid, yet still expected to have high energy and drive sales."
good,"I have had better jobs but also have had worse. Coworkers are friendly and as long as you do your job you should enjoy it. Pay is alright, not as many hours as I would have wanted."
good,Working here is okay. The new manager is nice but doesn’t really let people know what’s going on. The assistant manager on the other hand is amazing! She connects with us almost every day. The other employees can be stuck up and rude except a few. The customer’s language barrier can be a little difficult but not too bad. It’s okay place to work when you never worked retail before.
good,"Lee's than stellar Management"
good,"Working at Burlington can vary from slow-paced and relaxed, to frantic and stressful depending on the hours and days you work. On particularly busy days, it feels as though you never have enough time to get everything you want to done due to the constant flow of customers. While slower hours tend to make you feel extremely productive in contrast."
good,"It’s cool at first but the workers there are horrible. They either all think they’re managers but are either working in the register or are working in the back from 7-12. Almost got into an altercation due to a coworker thinking he could just push me around. All in all, horrible store but great company"
good,"Not to much organization between managers, and they keep you with 15 hrs a week sometimes for long periods, its a lot opportunity to grow in the company"
good,I was excited to work here until i realized they want a lot for very little i wouldn’t work here again if i was able to. I enjoyed being a cashier here.
good,"Store were over stocked   Deliveries were inconsistent "
good,I love my coworkers but the management is horrible. I only work about 8 hours a week because they try to schedule you the least amount of time they can. It also makes it difficult because it's always packed and there's usually only one or two cashier's scheduled and they usually have to end up calling people in.
good,The job was great when you had stuff to do and if people were stealing. A lot of investigation work and gets your mind going. Management was not very good. They never communicated with us and there was a huge lack of care with their Loss Prevention team.
good,"Even though you are hired as a floor associate, you may have to learn register to become a backup cashier. Typical day at work is coming in picking clothes off the floor, returning merchandise that customers do not want back to the floor and organizing. If you are trained on the register, you'll also get called up to ring if it gets too busy."
good,The store has entirely too many managers which can make it confusing but a few of those managers are pretty good. The pay is pretty decent and there is room for advancement and raises. It's not a bad environment to work in either.
good,"Burlington Coat Factory was a fast pace company that with the right coworker can be fun to work at. After starting your day before you know it the has ended and its time to clock out. They teach you on all bases of the warehouse, and moving up the ladder is pretty much a breeze."
good,I loved working here! Everybody was like a family there! I did however only preferred to deal with one particular key holder manager the other ones acted stuck up like they were better than everyone else.
good,"Not a bad place to work and everyone is welcoming ,but there could be better management. And more consistent hours and better benefits for Burligton staff members."
good,"It is a good place to work but at times can be extremely challenging and not in a productive way. As with any place, it starts with your direct leadership and if they are not good, you will always suffer."
good,"I overall like my job, but sadly it doesn't pay enough for part time  to purchase a place in my area, but for a start right out of high school balancing college and work it is a great choice."
good,Discounts on everything in the store. Helps out around the holidays when there is a bigger discount. It's mostly clothes so if you have children it would be beneficial to receive such discounts. Or if you like to wear clothes in general.
good,"The people at Burlington are a fantastic group of people. They are very helpful with anything that happens to come up in your work day. The work environment is very positive and fun. They have different reward programs. I work in the fitting room and I get to meet a wide variety of people and culture, I find this to be an exciting part of my job."
good,I really thought i would have advance in this work place but that not possible. Burlington is a not a good place to work at. Manager dont kno how to treat there employees
good,"helping customers, keeping store clean,you have to have patience,very demanding,satisfaction,trying to please customers, kept busy an other associates were very nice"
good,"What I enjoyed most working for Burlington Coat Factory was helping people. I really enjoyed seeing the smiles on the customers faces when I was able to help them find exactly what they were looking for. "
good,"We had to unload the truck and rotate the stock, as well as sort it all out in two hours before the store opened. Once opened we constantly had to restock as well as prepare other products to be sent out onto the floor. Even as back room associates we still were to help and assist customers we saw that needed it."
good,retail store co workers were nice customers can be rude then working on holidays usually has some busy moments during Christmas and other holidays have to stay after and come in early get store cleaned ready for the next business day
good,Easy job overall but pay and management were terrible it was super stressful all the time never had enough workers the store was always really busy. Management wasn’t very friendly or willing to help out employees
good,Burlington is great if your looking for a second job hour aren't guaranteed and they not as organized at they should be. It's fast paced and your always being watched.
good,Working here was great for the time all you had to do is do you’re job have good customer serive and this was a great place to work not a future advancement here though
good,"I was responsible for following and enforcing all company policies."
good,Great workplace besides being underpaid. A little tip I think the management staff should be 100 on the same page in order to succeed greatness in the store
good,"Management could be a little more solid. You start on with minimum wage, once you're there for 6 months you will get your raise which I guess u can understand to make sure that you would stick around with the company. The co workers are helping and friendly.The only pro would be the discounts but u really don't get a lot of benefits."
good,"It's just like any other retail job; I was a cashier and so I just operated the cash registers. Employees and managers were nice to work with. Hours could have been better but again, it is retail."
good,They are not organize. They always have problem with the schedules. They don't give you enough time to rest between shift and sometimes you work 6 and 7 days straigh.
good,I enjoyed working only problem was the lack of hours. It could of gotten very busy at the store at time due to the location at Sawgrass Mills mall and because there where so much tourist visiting on an daily basis.
good,My typical day at work a contains me doing my props from doing shoes and going out back and properly restocking them into the show I like the fact that I like shoes and I would like to show more versatility versatile e to maintain a wonderful work day
good,"burlington is a nice place to work, overall though its not enough room to move up in the company. if youre inside of the actual store it can be easy to get over looked."
good,Backroom associate help unload the morning trucks and separate the freight by pallets an stocking the items of clothing by size season and gender also rehanging clothing
good,Its an ok place to work. I can't complain really. The one thing I can say is that we dont get enough hours. Everyone I work with is ok on towards the end of the morning. Lowkey grumpy in the early morning though.
good,Enjoyed going to work most days big holidays such as back to school and Christmas are quite rough but manageable. most enjoyable part of the day was when the doors are closed. I enjoyed my coworkers great culture of supporting one another complete task and working as a team. The hardest parts  of the job for me was the standing and trying to give customers great service and a great personable experience while still being timely.
good,"Good start up job. There are few advancement opportunities, but it is a fun work environment. The manager is awesome, and makes the store feel like a family. However, it is a fast pace work environment, and most people don't act like a team."
good,I actually learned a whole lot of spanish from working at here. hardest part was the work schedule( not working with school) the most enjoyable is the support you have from other workers and the comadreship.
good,"This job was fun and I enjoyed the people that I work with, however I started college and I let the management know of my schedule. They seemed to always schedule me during my classes and when I let them know, management seemed to get irritated with me. I had to let them know I was putting in my 2 weeks to be at school full time."
good,"The co workers are wonderful to work with. The environment is great and everyone gets along with everybody. However, the pay does not equal out to the amount of work they make you do."
good,"Responsibilities included:  Customer Service, merchandise replenishment, department recovery, housekeeping recovery, warehouse inventory organization."
good,"Working at burlington has been quite the roller coaster.  The attitude of the customers do overwhelm some people on certain days.  But overall, managers do care for their employees unlike other places.  The work is sometimes a bit too much for just one person to handle and the hours usually are too little.  But if given a decent amount, its a fun and productive place to work."
good,It was always messy and nothing has a place to put the items in. The store is never clean and people are always rude. The worst part is working in the shoe department.
good,"Burlington is has a good employees with great team players. Since working at Burlington i have seen the improvements with the store. it is a very friendly environment, but I wish the benefits were better for the employees."
good,This job was great at first but with poor management and favoritism and sexism going around made this job very undesirable very fast. It's probably only good for maybe temporary work not for a prolonged time.
good,"Working in the back, loading and unloading trucks, processing clothes. Going out onto the sales floor, helping customers with their needs. Building and  fixing displays."
good,"Burlington is great place to work and learn. the management is enough to create good atmosphere for all the employer."
good,"promotion is likely when you work well."
good,"This store has great products I mean I even shop their and still do the prices are great but bad management, and some of the people were crazy in upper darby co-workers were nice meeting new people and shopping on my time of was the best"
good,It was a job like another. However management was not the easiest to get along with. favoritism was defiantly used and it was almost like high school the way the managers used their power over employees.
good,Working for this company is exactly what I needed to get my foot in the door for working for the future. Management was great I learned some new skills. And is recharged from the experiance
good,"I was hired as a cashier, and six months after working there I was given the opportunity to work in the accounting department. There I would assist other cashiers with balancing their tills, answer incoming calls, help with payroll, and jump on a register when needed. Management was a pleasure to work with."
good,"Burlington Coat Factories Stores gives a wonderful work environment, working in Burlington is like working in a toy store as a child. you learn so much while your there and the people you meet vary in so many ways. the management team are interactive and friendly with the workers, they're understanding and  are always willing to work with their employees."
good,"Hard working and smart people run the company and overall the staff are very pleasant. Advancement can be slow, but this is a company on the move"
good,"working at the front of the store allowed for much employee -to- customer interaction, which could be pretty challenging and at times fun. dealing with difficult customers on a busy day was about the hardest part of the job but through this I've learned how to quickly resolve most problems."
good,"A typical day at BCF going to work knowing you do not want to be there, no one is on the same page, management does not back up the cashiers, I go to work clock in go to my register, and hope I have back up cashiers when I need them. I dont feel as though i can talk to management about issues that occur with out fear of losing my job. management spends most of the time in the office, and when we request them to come up front for customer assistance they ask ""what do they want"" they are not hiring from our store but other stores so we cannot advance in our own store, Most of my co-workers are the best and are there when they are needed, others just dont care. The hardest part of the job is not being backed up by management when I am following policy.  The most enjoyable part of the job is my co-workers and the customers."
good,My first job and I loved it. Pretty busy since it was on TV but that's what made it fun. Great food and a homey feel. Wish the pay was better or some kind of benefits.
good,Burlington is a place where you came to work and adjusted to the environment. The ethics in the company was standard but not enforced all the time. I learned to conduct myself in a professional way. I always maintained good communication within my co workers that I was exposed to. I mostly worked in the shipping and receiving department where I excelled in many ways. A normal day would be two to three trucks a day and everyone would help with receiving and sorting the trucks contents so that it met with company standards. My hardest part of a normal day would be being punctual with the requirements that is needed to have the freight completed and to shut down the operation at the end of the day. In my opinion the most enjoyable part of the day would be the wind down where you can let loose for a while and enjoy the company of your fellow employees.
good,"Great management and friendly co-workers. Ive had a great day at work everyday, and customers. Ive gotten to know many things about myself working here. The most enjoyable part of working here was the many faces that you will see, and co-workers."
good,"A typical day for me is moving fast and steady, having a lot of energy. I've learned how to ticket boxes and have watched how to be a scanner. My co-workers are all enjoyable people. I have to say there is no hard part of my job, once you set your mind to something that you want, then that's that shouldn't anything be harder than that. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing the clothes and when here my percentage is good."
good,The workers and supervisors are very friendly which is a plus to all young workers. The most enjoyable part of this job was that everybody worked as a team.
good,"I pick up merchandise from receiving or the registers and take it back out to the floor for other customers. I was also a backup cashier & sometimes called into work at anytime. I kept an open availability in case they called me in. "
good,I have been in retail for most of my life. You take the good with the bad. Most of the time it is good. I enjoy placing merchandise on the floor for customers to buy. I enjoy the fact every day is different. Meaning you meet different people every day. I especially like when I am able to find for the customer what they are looking for.The only part I dislike is the long hours during the holiday season. I don't get to enjoy it with my family.
good,"A typical day would involve 20% management and 80% cashier/customer service."
good,Former store manager was awesome and caring.Took the time out to help others and making sure the store ran smoothly and the work enviroment was fun!
good,"A typical day at work is making sure all the merchandise items were on the sales floor,with the correct price and size!"
good,"The normal day of work is scanning the cameras through the store. I would look for suspicious customers. once you locate a customer stealing a product and they walk out of the store, I then approached the customer and make citizen arrest. I had great employes and the managers were professional"
good,I worked in maintenance for Burlington Coat Factory.  This was a starting-job as I was looking for something with more hours and benefits.  My co-workers were very nice and fun to work with.
good,For the most part it was enjoyable. Like helping people.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers.
good,"My day starts off by setting up my station to ensure I don't run out of supplies throughout my shift. I then assist customers with purchases, returns, and general questions. I learned how to effectively communicate with the patrons especially the disgruntle ones. My co-workers were very pleasant and I enjoyed working with them. The hardest part of the job was actually setting up the store from scratch. The most enjoyable part about my job was meeting all these different people and helping them enjoy their shopping experience."
good,"High production, fast paced. good training on different departments."
good,All and all I liked my time with this company. the staff was good but the same problems always would occur and would never get fixed.
good,"A typical work day would consist of during layaway payments, taking out a layaway, or doing returns. I have learned to stay positive and professional in situations. My co-workers were team players and always willing to give a helping hand. Management was fun to work with and always did their jobs. Enjoyable part of the day was helping customers and putting a smile on their face. "
good,I stated out in the shoe department (part-time) & Linens Department (Full-Time). I was liked for doing a good job so more hours were given to me; which is a plus. But lonely started out at $8 hourly & recieved a raise of $0.18. I would frequently get pulled form my department to be a back-up cashier during busy times or to work with the mark-down team. i wore many hats during my time working at this location; Grapevine Mills Mall.
good,Supervised shipping and Receiving departments. I had great co-workers and had great management support.
good,Seasonal position to where I was able to greet customers and help them with thing they would need or if something was miss matched I would help find the correct piece that belonged to the the other piece. Check the fitting room and clean it out. Restock the floor with new merchandise and smile. 
good,"I typically do most of the floor cleaning, and assist customers. On occasion I will work as a cashier."
good,"Friendly atmosphere, kept busy by various sales floor duties, customers walking in with questions and obtaining merchandise from the warehouse for customer purchase. Knowledge of products a must for working there."
good,"Over all good store to work for. If you are using as a second job ,or student. Fellow workers are helpful and generly pleasent. No benifits for part-time workers."
good,You learn something new everyday. The mangers are nice and fairly when it comes to your scheduling.
good,"A typical day it is very busy. I've learned that arguing with the customer gets nothing accomplished. Management was a little unorganized sometimes, my co-workers were great their attitudes were always positive. The hardest part of my job was when an employee did not work the night before and left a mess for me to finish the next day. The most enjoyable part of the job was how everybody at my job had different personalities."
good,Was a part time job good hours and ok pay for someone looking for extra money with out a whole lot or responsibilities.. but because the best part time job the placement of hours are not good at all.
good,BCF has taught me to be responsible and dependiable and the management staff was nice and fun to work with as well. BCF had a great staff team and we all got along well i learned from them and they learned from me. the hardest part of my job was the shipment but i stayed focused and did my job. the most enjoyable part to working at BCF was working with shoes and able to helps different people to find what they we looking for it made me feel like my job was done
good,"-management is approachable"
good,good day strong work team friendly and helpful kept busy with cleaning and organizing normal schedules and time off  no benefits or insurance jand no overtime
good,"I love the store in general, it has a large variety of goods, which is very beneficial, but at my specific location, the management and some of the staff are not easy to trust and very drama-filled. I like the job but some days they can really make it stressful. On top of that, I personally don’t believe that the receiving manager here is mature enough to manage anything at all. She handles things very rudely and in extremely childish mannerisms."
good,"Great job, great people. More hours need to be provided to the employees. Needs better security for shop lifters. More flexible hours for employees that have more than one job."
good,It's a good job not too much hard work you meet lots of people I was only there seasonal so there isn't too much I can say. The management staff are good people
good,This was my first job fresh out of high school and it was really enjoyable I learned alot of work skill and how to be a successful person in the work force
good,"it is great to work here. It will be much better if they gave associates full time hours to work and make some living for themselves. Most of the associates barely survived on the hourly rate and less than normal part-time hours. "
good,"Enjoyed restocking items such as clothes, shoes , makeup products and more and also helping my team  organize items on the shelves if needed and friendly environment."
good,Working for Burlington coat factory was very fast paced because I am behind the scenes loading on loading two trucks per day I was in charge of 25 employees who work there tail off. Burlington coat factory is very cheap when it comes to get a raise. You have to earn it.
good,Fast paced work environment with a lot of multitasking and problem solving lots of physical labor. Overall I enjoyed working for Burlington in the Distribution  warehouse.
good,This place is good if you looking for a job that  if you go to school or you have another job. Have good discount i love it but I have to leave for better opportunity.
good,Cashier stock sales associate handle computer register rung up guest check them out put up layaways cancelled n restock layaways clean stock the supple
good,"A typical day in the Receiving Dept starts with unloading the pallets; having the stamina to process between 10-20 pallets a day is necessary as well as understanding you will be assisting in multiple departments, not just one. Knowing where every item is within the store or general knowledge of an item and retrieve it quickly for a customer is also helpful."
good,I cannot speak for cashiers but as a loss prevention associate their are conflicts with my supervisor and store management and who i should refer too when something happens
good,Didnt have that many complaints i was a css and as long as u get the job done no problems. You just have to stay on top of your work. Sometimes you have to do extra jobs
good,"My time at Burlington was pretty good overall. Managers helpful as possible ,work is not that stressful it's pretty easy once u get the hang of it .I'll work there again"
good,The Dolphin mall store has a very positive work atmosphere. Employees are friendly. The store is always busy and employees are constantly busy as well.
good,Really good staff that I functioned with  as well as my coworkers who always assisted when I required assistance. Very understanding supervisors and managers who cared.
good,"Was excited about working here but to much drama, staff was unorganized and unprofessional for the most part. Toughed it out but i ended up putting my two weeks notice in. Sorry."
good,"Co-workers were very helpful "
good,"As any job in retail, the most stressful part of the job is customers. The cashier job is simple and since transactions are repetitive (ex. returns, layaways or regular purchase) the computer actions necessary for each transaction becomes second nature."
good,"The company is a good start if your looking for something temporary, its can help those who have a business major. Management can be a little but confusing but they are a good team"
good,I enjoyed working at Burlington. It was very busy on weekends but it wasn't too bad. My manager was understanding. I also had great co-workers. Working at Burlington taught me a lot about money handling and customer services.
good,"Very laid back and relaxed working environment. Very easy job responsibilities such as greeting customers, completing transactions, fixing fitting rooms and etc."
good,The work assigned needed to completed on time. The merchandise needed to be set up in right order. The staff and management was very helpful and friendly.
good,"Come in the morning and put away ""go backs"" or organize racks."
good,Everyday can be a productive day. From working on the sales floor to helping the customers. I learned learn time management is a key. Management is a key and are willing to work with you. Work place culture is good.
good,being at burlington wasnt really a job that i would go back to unless i was a cashier being in stock merchandising wasnt really an interesting job to do the mornings were always fast paced and then there was staff that wasnt really friendly and being around them was uncomfortable
good,"Fast paced environment, team work is a big role, 15 minute breaks. My work schedule I loved 5-6am - 10-11am. You got the rest of the day for yourself."
good,"It was an overall good place to work everyday. I learned quite a lot about how a department store functions and operates considering it was my first job in a retail setting.Management was not always the best depending on the manager on duty, but most of the managers were helpful and respectful. The co workers I had to help me were really nice and great people to work with. The hardest part was keeping up with such a fast paced work environment. The best part was getting a long with most of my co workers, helping customers, and getting to use my organizational skills."
good,A typical day would include running racks to the floor before store opening and setting up merchandise. Upon completion the team would retreat to the stock room to process new merchandise for the floor.
good,The work was there but there was extreme favoritism while there. Work was selective and the easier parts were often given to the people who were favorites.
good,Burlington is a very productive and thriving business but while visiting other stores and my home store I noticed the attitude and energy revolves around the management
good,"I enjoyed the time I worked at this store it was a really great environment , the staff is friendly . I would have rated it 5 stars but they don't pay supervisors enough here for all the stuff we have to do in the store and that includes accounting . they defiantly need to give supervisors a raise and not a dollar more than cashiers ."
good,"I was a seasonal part-time cashier at the Glen Allen, VA location. I enjoyed talking to the customers and working with the team. It was a fast-paced, interesting and fun environment."
good,It’s a fast paced company and the hours worked can be stressful but with the right team it’s easy. You have to have patience and be able to self manage yourself
good,Everything was pretty easy and relaxes. Most of the tasks they had you do weren't rocket science and you were able to learn everything fast. The Staff was friendly and so was management.
good,"My experience working at Burlington has been very enlightening. I have work in retail the better part of my employed life. I have learned retail from the a erage customer perspective, now i can say there is more to retail than just standing at the register and shelling out your money. Thanks to Burlington and and the insights of knowledgeable managers between both stores has help me tremendously."
good,"I loved my job at Burlington because my department allowed me to give my opion on how it should be displayed in materninity, juniors, misses and plus size."
good,When i worked here itvwas super fun. The suoervisor was great and was non judgmental . There really were no advancement oppurtunities within the company.
good,"If you happen to be work at Burlington, which is located at Sawmill then you will find best co-worker. All the co-worker are super nice and friendly and always willing to support, but most customers are tend to be very rude to workers."
good,"I like work in Burlington, is a very nice place to work , however things sometimes are very mechanic, meaning, no time or space to change or improve at the spot."
good,"I would walk in at 9am head to the back of Burlington’s employee locker room. Then sign in on a sheet with our names on them. I’ll look for my manager ask “what position he needs me in today?” I’ll work on restocking shelves with items or unboxing and price tagging items all the way till 5pm, which is when my shift ends. I’d say its a pretty easy job for me to get done for and doesn’t take a toll on me."
good,"I liked to work in receiving because the hours were 6 or 7 am to 2 or 3 in the afternoon. However, they would time is to sensor piles of clothes in a certain amount of time and it was stressful. The pay should've at least been $12 an hour."
good,The management really helps work around your needs. I am going to school and they have worked around my schedule. the only bad thing is that with part time you are only garneted 8 hours a week.
good,Good place to work when you are just starting out. The job gives you many opportunities to problem solve while you deal with customers. Friendly environment to work in.
good,Voice committee. Sharing each other’s thoughts on how to give better customer service and having a voice. Feeling valued and being a major part of the team.
good,"It is nice to work there. It has a nice, fun and relaxed environment. It's not too busy but we have enough people there to help out if there is help needed."
good,The work is very simple if you're taught. Depending on which manager you're dealing with its a fun work environment. I would reccomend this job for someone else.
good,"Great learning experience. Great place to grow, develop and hone interpersonal, teamwork, merchandising, customer service, cashiering, and retail skills."
good,Its an average job. Managers deal with so much that they hardly focus their employees. Employees are left alone to do their duties with somewhat or no supervision but employees help out one another when in need. Its a mediocre working environment.
good,"I worked her for a long time as a sales associate and it was fast-paced at times because the location I was in was on 23rd street so it was often busy. Besides that everything was relaxed, could be messy at times."
good,"The job is relatively easy to perform and is an excellent place to get a feel of the work environment for entry level employees. Consistent moving, lifting, stooping and bending along with standing long periods of time between breaks and lunches but as to be expected of a retail position. Great open and clean place to work with fun and friendly employees who are happy to assist customers whenever needed. Management is understanding to personal situations and can assist when needed."
good,"Its a noce place to work, people are nice, jist a fact paced working environment when it gets busy. Other than that there is a laid back aspect To it."
good,"Great people to work with.  Very much into work/life balance, teamwork and training.  There isn't a hardest part of the job.  Just the normal not enough payroll as is the case with many other retailers."
good,"My job was Shipping and recieving, shrink wrapping, palletizing, unloading and loading the big truck. Also labeling the boxes. I also cleaned, sweeped, and mopped."
good,A friendly place to work. Supervisors and co workers were easy to get along with and helpful. We stuck together as a team. It was a nice side job for a while.
good,"Working as a recieving associate at Burlington isn't very tedious as long as you take the time to work on your skillset. For example, you're unloading boxes during the first hour, and then you're pulling carts full of accessories, sensors and tags out on the floor the next. This job requires you to multi-task, and become as quick and efficient as possible with whatever task you're completing."
good,"This job was simple for the most part. As long as you are able to direct your staff clearly, then everything runs smoothly. Sometimes it's hard to get all managers on the same page but when you do its awesome."
good,"Trabajo habitual en Atencion al Cliente, Cajera, Asociado de tienda"
good,"Hours range from 4 to 8 hours, during holidays overtime is offered"
good,"Full time employees and management are great.   So many part-time employees who are unreliable, and incompetent, but not held accountable.   Very disappointed but not surprised."
good,"it was a good learning experience - they take you in and teach you from the ground up and give you a chance to learn and succeed."
good,"it was okay, a little much sometimes, hours were hard during holiday seasons, communications a little lacking most of the time, and team work could use a little more effort."
good,"Well i was terminated because of my work perfomance.i didn't get to know the job very well! liked the hours 4;15 p.m. to 1;00 a.m. but as a ticketer my eyesight wasn't good enough for speed! i was 58 yrs.old then! there were people there that had a hard time understanding english!"
good,Working for Burlington is a customer service driven industry. I work well with the public even though at times it is challenging. I have met some valuable friends while working at Burlington.
good,Store in Chealsea was one of the best ive seen. A lot of good mentoring from management. All black uniform was required but communication was iffy sometimes
good,"I was responsible for stocking the floors, assisting the supervisors, handled Lay Away products and Team Leading. I was also responsible for the shipments that came in and inventory."
good,"I did not feel accepted nor welcomed "
good,"The typical day at work included: organizing new arrives to their proper location according to style/brand/season. Having to price tag and put alarms on the most expensive items. Interact with customers on helping them find the best deal, while guiding them toward satisfaction about their item or purchase."
good,"Burlington is a great job, with a great opportunity. For the most part its fast pace. Burlington has a very good, management team who are definitely team players."
good,"Its pretty easy but boring depending on the position you have.The floor is the most annoying. Its easy, but unless theres actually work to do, you just walk around picking up after the customers. Cashier is the best as its fast paced, at least when theres customers."
good,"Burlington is a good place to work. It’s just fast paced, no enough hours, and the people don’t handle their stress well."
good,"What I learned from Burlington is that you're always going to be on your feet, there is always going to be something for you to do. It gets hectic at first but once you get the hang of it there should be no problem."
good,You have a scheduled break and lunch. Typical day your just upfront ringing up customers. Nothing special about being a cashier at Burlington. All you do is ring ring ring.
good,"During the short time I have been working for Burlington I have drastically grown. Burlington made my passion for business spark. We are currently in the process of getting a new management team, so things are shifting a bit."
good,A typical at day at work was easy. Not much work was provided because it was divided between everyone. It took about 1 to unload the trucks if everyone worked at a high pace. The hardest part of the job was when I had to unload the truck when there was a lot and the pallets were extremely heavy. The management wasn't horrible but it wasn't great either. Sometimes things were said and happened that were unnecessary and immature on their part. The most enjoyable thing about the job was your co-workers and how fun they could make it. They always kept you laughing but pushing you to work at all times. It was cool.
good,Burlington is a great place to work and has a great work atmosphere. working on the flow team gave me a chance to work at a fast pace and understand alot about the retail business.
good,"It was fast paced with generally friendly management, psychically demanding with long hours standing."
good,Burlington is a very friendly and fast paced job that requires a lot of patience. The can be very rewarding if you like to meet new people and if you’re the type of person that likes to move around a lot.
good,Burlington is a fast paced friendly enviorment  with many people of very different cultures. Every day is about customer satisfaction friendly service as well and a clean establishment. Being physical is a big part of the job but most of all seeing the customers with smiles on their faces with a look of satisfaction.
good,I would recommend burlingtons to any one. It is a fun place to work and you also work at your own pace. They really care about their customers and employees.
good,I love working at Burlington it was fun working with clothes. I love different styles of clothes. Being in Burlingtons was like being in my own personal closet.
good,It had it moments but was fun. It requires it's manager to be more of a working manager. Company is still a growing company and there is information that you do not get as a more established company you would see such as an P&L statement.
good,They expect too much for the pay. Great job to start off with for college students and retired folk but does not provide a living salary. Quick advancement because of the high turn over rates.
good,Great place to work. Management is a power struggle between managers and supervisors. Managers don’t want you to help other Co-workers and when you try to multi task they get upset.
good,"Tending to customers, restocking, merchandise control"
good,When I first stated at Burlington I intended on learning every department and possible management. Within 8 months I learned all the departments. I transferred stores closer to home and wish that I hadn't. The benefit however were wonderful.
good,I would love it and really do just not enough hrs to live on. But good place to work overall.Good people .Good management.love fast pace u stay very busy.Just no hrs
good,"you get 15 min break on the clock"
good,"Atypical day at work, was fun, exciting and exhausting, but beneficial to what the needs were to help Burlington remain professional and fun to work at. I learned to mult-task. I started as a shoe associate and soon after, I moved to working as a cashier and working in receiving, which helped me to gain new skills. Management, was good and very helpful, never had a problem with management, very engaging to the staffs needs and encouraging to move forward. The workplace culture was divers, I don't believe management seen any of us by our race or culture, their goals was to help the customers and empower the staff to do better and to be better. The hardest part of this job, was accepting that you could not work overtime or you could not get but a certain amount of hours. The hours/pay made it difficult to maintain my home and the responsibility to provide for my family, or than that I loved working there. The most enjoyable part of working there, were the customers, I got to meet all different types of people and help put smiles on their faces and to assist them was enjoybable to me and still is."
good,Burlington is a very good company to work for. The environment in the store was very friendly and everyone worked has a team. The store manager had good communication skills.
good,"It was a good experience for a first job friendly co-worker and nice customer, hard worker good company helped me a lot for a first job"
good,"- Assisting Customers on the sales floor"
good,"- Greeting customers, responding to questions, improving engagement with merchandise and providing outstanding customer service."
good,"Depending on when you were working or who you were working with it was a nice place to work, meet people and get a first look at all of the incoming new merchandise,"
good,"was a great experience, i learn how work with others as completing task for the day. i learn how to handle a telxon gun, the process of tagging clothes. i also learn the importance of customer service."
good,"must be able to have a sense of urgency and move quickly, mangers had unrealistic expectations for you to complete tasks that required multiple people to do but never gave additional help."
good,I like working for Burlington however the location I'm in we don't get paid enough to cover the cost of living in my area. It is a fast paced environment and you have to be a quick learner while keeping up the pace
good,"I was cashier, front-end supervisor, auditor, before being a receiving associate. Managers were friendly. This was second time I was hired. Liked being kept busy."
good,"Burlington Coat Factory was a job just to get pass by, I knew It was going to be a career job or life time place for me. I went into work ready to work."
good,a very fast environment to work. variety of hours to choose and different active  to do. team work is necessary on some of the areas that are the most busy
good,Burlington was very fast paced. I was able to learn each position in the warehouse. My job Title was PTL (Put To Light). Picking and packing from the line itself.
good,"I think i worked waaaaay harder than I should have been salary wise. I didn't necessarily feel like I was getting paid enough for the amount of work I was doing and then after thanksgiving and christmas, the hours slowed down tremendously."
good,"A typical day at work always resulted in a good day. Did things such as unloading the trucks, learning how to stock merchandise within the Burlington store, and greeting customers with great customer service."
good,I personally started there as my first job and worked there for 10 years. I have worked in several positions there. Some better than others. It's been a long time since I have worked there and I do know a lot has changed so I don't know how good of a review I can give for their current working conditions.
good,Fast paced friendly setting.  Management was fair.  The most enjoyable part was working with the customers.  Company supportive with the flexibility of scheudules.
good,Is an equal oportunity employer committed to workplace diversity.
good,"Working third shift /night shift was quiet, long and sometimes uneventful overall working for the Burlington Coat Factory distribution center was a good experience."
good,"Quality staff which Store manager was clueless, employees would go above and beyond to make sure flow team was successful . Store Manager would not STEP IN to prep for Inventory or anything requiring work. He sat in the office and did not do much but complain on things were not accomplished but never spoke to the positives."
good,Burlington is a big company with small company appreciation for its team members.
good,It was a good experience for building your work experience. They have a very strict work policy.  You can learn a lot from this company to work your way up.
good,I only work part time so as soon as I get to work I start to work and most times I don't stop until I am finished.  I only work four hours per evening so there is not much time for anything else.
good,Employees need to learn the simple skills of a fast-paced environment and learn from every department to gain the knowledge of every part of the store
good,"I enjoyed my time at my store. I grew to love some of the staff as family. The environment can get a little hectic as typical in any retail environment, but with a good team, the work is almost non-existent. It's a face-paced, friendly environment. The managers work with your school availability, something I always appreciated."
good,Great it was a nice place growing into the nice customer service. its not hard work just how you work nice management keeps you moving day go by fairly fast
good,Great interactions with customers. Fun environment. Great management and discount benefits. Great to have added on to your resume. Fair learning experience inside retail.
good,"This was a decent part time job but there was no opportunity for my position to become a full time job. "
good,"Very very low pay. Unprofessional management. Very dirty, messy store. Although they were flexible with hours, they often cut your hours and they are not fair with everyone."
good,I had fun. had a typical work day. I learned a lot. management was great. the hardest part was to leave. the most enjoyable part was just being there.
good,"If you are just starting out and have a very relax Schedule, Then Burlington is your place. No Hours, Even working (3) different positions. Markdown, Cashier, Recv..."
good,its an okay job to start but not really worth the pay. hours were not guaranteed and everyday coming in was always something different. the management was either their or not available
good,The most enjoyable part of a job is getting things done faster then you usually would. Also it would be learning new skills and strategies from the real world and applying them to the business world.
good,I enjoy working with all of my co workers and I love having the opportunity to interact with the customers. It is a fast paced and positive environment.
good,"Full time sales associate, I open , close or work a mid shift. I must maintain a certain average hours to keep my benefits. I have been with the company for 1 year and 5 months."
good,Burlington is a strategic work experience. You get your zone and must run your area and maintain your area. The hardest part of the job is the go-backs. Finding where every miscellaneous item goes back to.
good,Management needs to care more about employees and be fair when it comes down to appointing positions and pay. Just because you are friends with or know a fellow employee doesn't give them higher ranking for a position especially if there are better qualifying candidates that have been there for yours who deserve the position. All future supervisors or managers should be trained properly before starting solo on the floor or in their sections. It's not fair to those who have to stop what they are doing or get behind in their actual work load to train the individual.
good,"If you like working in retail, you would probably like working here. The manager i had was awesome he listened to you and if there was an issue he would fix it. When he told you something that's what it was. Very good atmosphere!"
good,"Its a fine place to work, but no benefits. Sometimes the store is so managers forget that you're human and you need a break. As a team everybody works well together its a good environment to work in, it has it's flaws but what company doesn't."
good,good coworkers and great management. I made really good friends and they were great with my disability of depression and anxiety. I made so many friends here.
good,"I enjoyed the time I did work there. The only reason I left, was offered a full time M-F job. Which is something you can not pass up. Especially when you compare to retail."
good,Unload trucks and stock store with merchandise.  Management was good and fair. Hardest part was getting all merchandise out in the stores fast enough.
good,"helping and assisting customers, being a cashier, maintaining floors, monitoring dressing rooms ... it is a relaxing place to work especially for someone seeking part time"

good,Great employees and good management. Everyone is apart of a team and works well together which makes everyone's job easier. Burlington is a great fit for retail workers.
good,"I typically open most days around 9:30am, and the day can be busy in the beginning of the week. It can be busy at times but that's what makes the time fly. Meeting new people is always great, I get to smile at them and talk with them and if possible make their day better. My co-workers are amazing, they trained me well and I continue to learn something new almost every day from them. Without the support of my co-workers backing me up when it gets really busy at the registers, I wouldn't be able to do a great job. Their help allows me to provide not just quick and efficient service, but a friendly experience. The hardest part is when there is not enough customers or things to do, and time just drags on. When that happens you have to find anything and everything to help make the time pass, but luckily these moments don't last long. I love the skills I get to put to use, I love meeting new people every day and I love my fellow co-workers."
good,"Good place to learn at a fast paced, well managed and clean store. Physically demanding, and mentally challenging, working as a team for the whole day to reach common goals."
good,"Working for Burlington was one of the most exciting jobs that I've held thus far. Getting to interact with the customers was always interesting; for everyone was different.

good,"It was cool working here, always stayed busy. My coworkers and i always made it fun though. It was a very busy fast paced environment, with all different kinds of people."
good,Burlington is fast paced and you have to be able to handle multiple tasks at the same time. Your job extends more than what you think it would. The pay is not good for the amount of work
good,typical cashier position not hard what so ever! Help customers out with anything they need help with and maintain a clean work space. return clothes to proper place.
good,"Burlington's atmosphere could have been more positive, this is my own opinion of the store I worked in. Management is where it all starts, attitude could have been better."
good,"I learned quite a bit. As a stock flow merchandiser I learned how to place price tags in the right place on items being sold on the floor. I learned how to strip plastic bags and boxes from items and place in the appropriate binds, scan items that were missing tags and print them off, utilize a needle/tagging gun to put pricing tags on garments, and sensor garments according to pricing guidelines ( men, young men, youths, juniors, and women). I ran items to floor via garment racks/runner and placed garments in the correct area on the floor Monday through Friday from 7 a.m. to 2 p.m.- 3 p.m."
good,"Fun easy workplace "
good,"A typical day a Burlington isn't so bad. Find out what needs to be done for the day, walk your department so you can recover and make the necessary adjustments. Help out customers that need assistance and any employees that may need your help."
good,"A typical work day starts with arriving at either 6 or 7 am. 6am group will take the shipment pallets we received the previous day and begin to break them down and categorize them by department, clothes, shoes, men, women. The stacks for each department is them pushed onto the floor to that section of the store where the 7am crew will begin to open, ticket the merchandise and put the items on the shelves. Everyones comes together once the shipment is completely separated in order to get all the merchandise out into their separate departments. Once that is finished the remainder of the shift is spent organizing, ticketing, censoring and placing the sizing markers onto clothing. Then running the racks onto the floor, and helping any customers who require our assistance during that time. "
good,Burlington was a great place to work. I really liked the management team that I worked with in AK. A typical day at work was customer service and working in a fast paced environment. I really enjoyed talking to all the customers as well as my co workers. I was asked to be a supervisor and said yes but moved out of state before it could happen.
good,don't remember to much of what happened except I enjoyed doing the maintance of it and then they changed my job to coat salesmen and I don't know nothing about coats so I didn't care much for it.
good,Normal day at work is grabbing orders & getting the job done safe & accurate. Along with talking to coworkers who need assistance.
good,"The managers at Burlington are very respectful women and care about their employees.  However, this job does not pay too well."
good,"Burlington was a great stepping stone to start my career. I learned many things there.  I was able to be a cashier, work in a department, complete markdowns and they let me give my opinions on things.  It was a good company to work for."
good,"the typical day at big retail store was like cleaning after your children. There always something to clean and organize you never stay still. Learned how retail works with their sales, and leadership. Hardest was dealing with shoplifters. I really enjoyed the black Friday experience as a sales associate."

good,"My typical day involves doing sales floor moves, being the backup cashier, and ,on certain days, being the manager on duty. The store isn't in the best of shape but the employees do the best they can with what they have. The overall morale of the store tended to be pretty good. The management of the store was overall good. The hardest part for me some days is trying to balance being the backup cashier, the sales floor associate, and the key holder in the same shift."
good,a typical work day consisted of receiving stock and tagging and pricing items to be put out on the floor also to place items out on floor in favorable positions.
good,A enjoyable place to work. Easy to get a long with associates working in the store. Well managed and organized throughout. Benefits package and insurance is exceptional as well.
good,"Working for this company introduced me to my first retail job. I was so new that I didn't know what customer service was and how I was supposed to speak to a stranger. In fact, I'd always been a fairly shy person until this job. It really made me break out of my shell and learn not to be scared of communicating and to be confident with my voice. Some customers will be difficult but it's nothing we cant work around."
good,"review emails "
good,"Started off as a floor associate but quickly moved up to a cashier and have been there ever since, a typical day at work for cashiers is pretty much being at the front end of the store the entire time. There are days where it's slow but there are days when it's very busy, and believe me when I say busy. The work environment is fast pace, and for anyone that enjoys that then this is the place for you."
good,I worked only 3 days a week for some times only 4 hours a day.  I was not in a supervisor or management position but responsible for those I worked with.

good,The staff there are very helping if you are new. They have a solid work force and tend to work well as a group. Anyone that has worked in retail will tell you its not for most but I would say my experience was worth it because of the staff.
good,"The register is easy to understand, But you learn new things as you go because it isn't any ""official"" training before you're put on the register.

A single workday involved receiving, tagging, and securing merchandise; Colorizing and sizing merchandise; helping customers,cashiering; inventory and markdowns; processing go-backs; counting drawers and assisting store manager with bank deposits at the end of day. A lot of multi-tasking is involved, I know!"
good,"Performed quality checks on products and parts"
good,Talking to customers about the latest trends has to be the most enjoyable part of the job. I learned that if you are really in to fashion this is not the job for you because you'll end up spending every paycheck on many of the great buys. I work with  a lot of great people. Overall its what I expected it to be for a 1st job.
good,"As a college sophomore, I worked retail on weekends working around 14 hours a week. Six hours on Saturday and 8 on Sunday. A typical day at work was nonstop movement, which included ringing up customers, making returns on the floor, and directing customers to different floors for the item they were looking for. It was an incredibly demanding job and I developed a thick skin from it as I often times had to deal with unpleasant customers. My co-workers and managers were always helpful and supportive, constantly willing to lend a hand. The hardest part of the job was constantly being up on my feet. The most enjoyable part was forming bonds with my coworkers."

good,"A typical day consisted of clocking in at the time clock. Then going to the first bay and looking at the line-up for that specific day. On the line-up I will find what register, or which department I would be working for that day and the times I am scheduled to take my lunch break and 15 minute breaks. I learned many things while working at Burlington. Burlington was my first retail experience and I enjoyed it. Being able to work in a fast paced environment meeting many new people daily was something that I enjoyed. Being able to hold conversations with strangers and being able to not let the rude customers affect my attitude was something else that I learned. The hardest part of the job was not being bilingual. I had a lot of customers who only spoke Spanish, so not being able to understand what they were saying was difficult; because I then had to call an associate who understood them. What I enjoyed the most about my job was being able to be the reason someone left Burlington with a smile on their face. Being able to give customers in a rush a speedy checkout was also enjoyable."

The hardest part of my job was not being able to dedicate my customers as much time as I would of liked because of the high volume of costumers.
good,"A typical day at Burlington is like a roller coaster ride you come in you work and everything is mellow but then waves of people come in. Then you feel some type of relief when it closer to closing because everything becomes settle we all smile and thank each other for being a team by working together. I learned the in's and out's of working in the back room and being at customer service what a really learn is patients as well. I love my co workers we look out for each other and I feel as if that should be like that in every workplace. The hardest part about my job is when the store is understaff and all the pressure falls on me because of the fact that I know each section well and I am good at making sure I finish my task.

If I were closing, it would consist of me counting my register, grabbing all paperwork at my register, cleaning around store, picking items up. During the time of me working I'm pressing a button to notify customers that I am open and ready to help them check out. If we're not so busy, I put hangers away, clean around store, clean cuing. I sometimes answer the phone. I am great with my customer service skills, I have literally had two bad situations with customers(not my fault). Myself and my coworkers all get along. I would say that I have learned how too operate different register software.I am only on register so that would be the most enjoyable part of working there."

I have to greet and help customers as well as put away merchandise, assist at the cash registers, make price tags and make sure the sales floor is clean. It can be very challenging especially because majority of the time I am required to be alone and cover my own departments.

Most of the staff is friendly but there's a lot of lazy people that expect everyone else to do their job. Friendly managers."

good,It was good while I was there but college was enough on my plate so I had to leave but enjoyed the experience met a lot of nice people and got to see new still before it was on shelves
good,I was the customer service manager so everything had to go through me when it came down to complaints or approvals.

Burlington has managers who hides in the layaway room while everyone else works. The hours are no more than 25 hours a week. checks are n more than 150.00$ a week. Pay rate was about 7.25 an hour. Burlington has a 12 point system that is checked every month. you get 2 points for calling out of work. 1 point for something a manager doesnt like that you did. 1 point for being late. the management doesnt warn you about your points until the beginning of the next month."
good,"Burlington offers an environment that allows managers to make most decisions independently.  There are numerous opportunities to advance, however your work ethic must be top notch.  There is always lots to do and you must Follow-Up with Teams.  This a a great company with amazing benefits.  I enjoyed my time there.  But beware, it is hard work! No sit in the office managers!  They don't need you!  The pride in my work was the best part!"
good,"Burlington is overall a pleasant place to work, the managers there are pretty great at working with the employees with regards to the scheduling.  This is great because I am a college student who at times needed to switch shifts."
good,"this was my first job and this was several years ago. They frequently overlapped job duties but not with an increase in pay. As a cashier, I practically worked the front half of the store."
good,Management does not communicate very well with employees. If u have a problem it normally takes up to a week to be solved. I gave 110% and still wasnt good enough for management.
good,"I was a cashier, pretty typical stuff, returns were always trouble because of the policy. My managers were great except one he was a bit of a dweeb when he wanted to be but everyone else were cool. The pay would be good for someone in high school but someone with bills the pay there is no way you could live off of their wages alone."
good,"Great place to work at, employees are diverse, pay was ok. Manager was always too busy or never around when needed. No support to discipline subordinates."
good,"working as men's associate gives lots of hard work including take care of fitting rooms almost entire shift. Ring up customer, help customer & thank them for their purchase"
good,Easy job especially as a cashier. Colleagues were friendly and helpful as well as supportive. Figuring out the work tasks is as easy as pie as long as you pay attention & obey the supervisors when the managers aren't around.
good,The first month I set up the store that was fun and got to do a lot of different things in departments. After the store opened I cashiered witch I love to do because I like to talk to customers and help them. Sometimes the department head was hard on you. they want you to go fast when I was always taught to make   people come back so make them happy.

good,"It was a great place to work because of the happy feeling of assisting customer's with his, or her day to day needs. it was a fun place to work because of the customer's joy of appreciating you."
good,"Working at  Burlington  wasn't really a difficult job. From the time i have worked there, i have learned the cash registers, worked the men's department which basically just consisted of organizing all of the shelves and racks and assisting the customers in locating an item. Also as a cashier, sometimes you have to run downstairs for the layaway items, other times, you collect the carts and bring them back to the store. Rather simple job. The hardest  thing about working at Burlington is really just dealing with rude customers. Other than that it is easy."
good,"Working in receiving is a very fast paced, physical job. Unload shipments, empty all boxes and disperse to their different departments in 4-5 hours. Hang, tag and sensor all clothes and run the racks."
good,"Don’t think we get paid enough , time management needs focuse a little more , lockers need to be provided for personal belongings , food truck is a plus"

good,"Burlington is great if you're looking for money every week. Management was understanding, Co workers were nice. Didn't run into that many nasty customers."
good,I learned a lot about people skills at this store. we were located in downtown Pittsburgh. It was a melting pot of people from all different walks of life.
good,I've gained great experiences while working there. It's great for young people who need to get there foot in the work door. There is room for advancement however the pay could be better.
good,"A typical day at work would be repackaging items, label boxes, and palatalize. What I learned at work was how to work at a fast and productive pace. Management was decent. Everyone would get along and help one another when needed. I do not think there was a hard part about this job.The most enjoyable part of the job was palatalizing the items."
good,"I genuinely had a good time working at Burlington. My coworkers were pleasant, the customers were never irrationally upset, and management was both fun yet disciplined. The reason I left was because I had intended to move into a different career field, as well as a few experiences with a single manager who was less than amicable. From what I understand, that manager is no longer working at the location I used to work at, and so I would highly recommend a position to anyone interested."
good,The people are friendly the guest are friendly it's a clean environment it's a great place to work to get extra money or if u are in school. Great retail job

good,The management team didn't choose favorites but had the best intentions for their employees. Always helpful and willing to push them forward every chance they could.

good,"productive environment, hard work, physically demanding, great group of people to work with though, and overall fast pace. Need to pay attention to detail at all times, and safe place to work."
good,"Burlington has great prices for everyone. I have learned everything for receiving, sales floor, markdowns, cashiering and once was a key holder. Great place to work!"
good,"I liked working at Burlington because there was always variety. One day you might be on registers and other days you could be in one of the various departments cleaning, stocking, rearranging merchandise. There was always something to do."
good,"Very busy, Love the people I work with. A great first job, Not all managers are good managers. The hardest part of the job is the Christmas season.  Good place to work"
good,Getting the new merchandise out on the floor and making it look good was the main thing.  The hardest part of the job was being on your feet all day and not purchasing everything you wanted when you seen it.
good,"Working here was a great oppurtunity when it comes to security work. It was corporate so the pat was good and I've learned alot, such as security skills and responsibilities."
good,It was an okay experience just for $7.25. I did not like the fact that i had to wear something specific. My discount wasn't great. This job was just something to have while my mom was sick so there isn't much to say about it.
good,I loved working here...it was a fun work environment.... management were reasonable and attentive. I wish my  transportation had been better when I worked there.
good,"Nice people and  flexible hours ,  occasionally will reward the receiving team/sales with food and celebrations, very positive and  supervisor  is the best!"
good,"i like working here. i worked at the 1 on nw 63rd and it was a fun experience and the coworkers made it very enjoyable. love getting paid every week but always gave the opposite hours. if you wanted more hours they'd give you less, want less? you get more. sometimes managers try to over work you."
good,The coworkers make the job bearable at times. The customers are disrespectful and times and often treat you as if you are below their level of intellect. It seems to take a long time to progress into a promotion even when you exemplify great customer service and leadership skills.
good,"I enjoyed working this position ringing customers items as a chance to meet new people as well , comfortable environment sometimes a little overwhelming"
good,It was more like chilled everyone I met was out going and friendly I learn how to stock things the right way I've learn how to sensor items over 100 dollars I learned how to put price tags on items using tools
good,"A typical day at work was very fast paced.There was quotas to be met and that kept things moving very fast. Being in a warehouse was a lot different from what i'm used and i was surprised  how quick i went from picking to packing to put-to-light. It was an overall great experience. The hardest part about the job was ticketing sense it was the shortest shift there wasn't a break until lunch, and even that wasn't so bad. The most enjoyable part for me was going home with a job well done."
good,"its a wonderful place to work and get hands on work experience. management is great, they just need to work on giving employees fair hours but overall a great place to work"
good,"great place to work to gain experience in different fields, willing to work with your schedule if you have school or have another job. very nice management."
good,At Burlington it's alway busy day and night so what I do is pick up and cash customers out.  The hardest part of working there is to keep the store clean at all times and to keep the line down. But what I love about this job is that I actually meet sweet customers and the people I work with is fun and friendly.
good,Let me start off by saying it's a nice company to work for the dow.not side were just the benefits. Such as 401k and Insurance. I would definitely recommend a friend.
good,"A typical day at work woud be unloading packages, Then different employees in receiving stock the packages on the sales floor. The hardest part of the job was attempting to complete all the work, because it took team effort."
good,"Basic, the only real problems are the rude costumers, most employees do more then what there position is. Such as a floor employee would typically find themselves at the register, or customer service more so then the floor."
good,"It was a  good place to work, but I was promised a promotion and I never received it, with no good reason why. When I had to change my availability due to personal matters, my boss was not happy with it and demanded me for reasons which I didn't feel comfortable to give."
good,"I like my job just seeking advance growth, I been cross trained in multiple departments and areas love staying busy just the pay and to move up is hard"
good,"I'm originally from the state of California; a pro-employee state. I truly enjoyed working for the company. We moved to Texas to be close to family and Burlington allowed me to transfer with a very healthy raise. Once I started working here I was shocked as to how little we paid attention to our employee needs. It was not the company, it was the particular store I chose. I resigned my on after a year.It was an adjustment but I was happy to begin a new chapter."
good,"Ringing people up, I learned what I have always known the customer is always right no matter what. The hardest part is being able to make sure everything it done when there is not enough people ringing. The most enjoyable is my co-workers we always make each other laugh no matter how busy or how hard we are working and there is no drama."
good,"Burlington is a great place to work. It has fun people and the best vibe when you come into the store. The management team consists of people that believe in proper training, and leading by example."
good,"Most of the job requirments I learned picked up pretty quickly which made it more fun. Most tasks were given were simple however, some tasks were changed in the middle due to communication issues."
good,"I actually liked working at burlington, I basically knew everyone there from high school so that was kind of fun. everyone got along, the managers were cool but still lenient."
good,Great place to work and to have a family life. All the managers were great! the pay was ok but I did received raises and if needed to time off they let me
good,A typical day for me in the work place is being able to walk in being greeted by your other teammates. That sets you in a good mood when first walking into work. If I run into something I don't understand and that's where I come to someone who may know and about it the correct way instead of the wrong way. It helps you in the long run. Management is being able to learn different responsibility's of the aspect of the job itself. Being able to get along with all of your employees. Making sure things come out to where it should be at the end of the work day. Learning all aspects of the job itself.
good,A typical day at work was very interesting.How to manage my time.How to handle customer service.The management as was very helpful.My co-workers were very helpful.Having to put all the clothes set order.Customer service.
good,"A typical day of work here would be very stressful."
good,"Burlington's Coat factory is a very good comapny with great employee,customers, and managers. I had  a great experience working with different People and satisfying customers."
good,"A typical day was marketing down items that vendor have lower so customers can get materials at fair prices, establishing a team goal daily, making sure all met requirements are achieved by managements liking. Learned patience with older customers is the most a value because they are the most consistent customers and loyal when they get the right amount of support. My management were understanding when it came to scheduling since i was a full time student and part time worker, they allowed me to call in on any day and was able to provide me with a task. My co-worker's are helpful in many ways they go out their ways to help another. Hardest part working at Burlington Coat Factory was the prolong amount of standing with very little time for breaks. I enjoyed the activities the management did provide for the staffs on holidays and the environment/ community volunteer help we provided."
good,"I enjoyed working here, co-worker worked well together.. The work place was enjoyable to be at daily. The pay sucks but hey they PAY!"
good,Great experience !awesome employees awesome general manager! Acquired leadership skills. Flexible on times . Pay was okay . Hardest part was closing
good,"I have learned how to make use of space, how team work is important.  The hardest part of the day was dealing with a partner that would not work as a team player."
good,Very busy because it is in a very convenient area. Somewhat disorganized and needs more employees to have the business run smoothly.
good,"Very nice friendly co workers and overall a good place to work. I also liked the manager, she was very nice and thoguhtful."

good,"The clientele at Burlington are the bottom of the barrel and do not care at all about the merchandise other than price."
good,"A typical day i was with a team organizing items into boxes and tagging, censoring, and sizing shoes. I was fast with my hands so i was always doing shoes. I didnt lean anything new. I just understood how things worked with merchandise and how important it was to be organized, fast, and analytical. Management was strict; as it should. If you do your job with minimal mistakes, the relationship with anyone is easier. Co-workers are truly what makes working at this place so worth it. The people are fun to talk to. The hardest part of the job from the Flow Associate perspective is the waking up early and keeping up with everyone. There is a time-limit for everything and we have to meet that standard everyday. Its a battle between your quality of sleep and the working fast for the hours your there. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people. If makes you eager to come to work everyday knowing that these people are going to enjoy being there and enjoy talking with you - AS LONG AS YOU DO YOUR JOB QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY."
good,The job is invigorating. Teaches you patience and great customer service. Managers are attentive and are great problem solvers.

good,"Management need to work together as a team but other than that the place is a great place to work."
good,Working here taught me a lo as far as customer service. Learned how to communicate with the customer and other employees as well. I was the head in the Mens dept. which gave the control to stock and merchandise the items to get the customers to buy them. also i trained any new employee coming up under me. Management was awesome they knew i was good at my job so they would basically tell me what the company wants done and know that i would execute it. I was one of the ones they didn't have to really watch over.
good,good environment and nice co worker. I hope they can absorb the part time associate to full time so that we can enjoy the benefits.
good,"I enjoy working here but am looking to work in more of a field I went to school for. I enjoy working with food and safety, this job has given me the experience and knowledge to broaden my work experience and use it to better ,y self"
good,Flexible work schedule great for college students. The hours started off great but longer i worked here for a year and my hours got cut.

good,"I love working for burlington!  I always look forward to going to work there,  they are always striving to make employees lives better and they try hard to work around your schedules."
good,I was excited with the work I had to do and the people I did it with. The only part was it was a seasonal position that didn't last long enough.
good,My day is very physical and mental challenging processing freight all day and providing customer service everyday ETC
good,"Burlington was a good work place. Each morning we would do our morning rallys, an they would tell us what our sales need improvement on an where an what section we need to complete before the end of the day. My job to me was fun an important because I was the one marking down clothing from sales price to clearance. An in my free time helping customers find certain things they may want or looking for."
good,"A typical day at work is very busy. Having to maintain a good spirit at work 24/7 can be very challenging especially since customers can be very disrespectful sometimes, but it's all worth it in the end. I learned working in retail that the customer is always right no matter the case and I also learned that not everything requires a reaction. I also learned that sometimes customers can come off rude and demanding but if you treat them politely back, they tend to feel bad for how they came off to you. My co-workers are very hard-working as well. Although we all have our days when we're sick or tired, we all seem to put in the same amount of effort and we all get the job well done. The hardest part of the job is the amount of times you have to pick up clothes from the ground when customers intentionally put them there. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to interact and meet different types of people. They definitely keep your spirit up and help time pass by a little quicker."
good,"No time to slack off, always something to do. clean, organize to stay a head of big groups of costumers. a bit of separation between cashiers and floor associates"
good,"Overall, this was a great company to work for. My colleagues were professional and courteous. We always took pride in providing outstanding customer service."
good,"Burlington was a nice place to work if you enjoy sales and fashion.  Upon arrival you are greeted by fellow co-workers with a friendly attitude even when it is busy.  Management was pretty good at my store but some needed more training on policy & procedures and merchandise in the store.  The hardest part of the job was receiving. Merchandise has to be unpacked, ticketed and out on the floor usually same day."
good,Roles need to be delegated evenly throughout the company. Depending on the area you get placed you can either experience a great work life balance or a terrible work life balance.
good,"Fun for the retail world. Some days were fast pace and some days weren't. Management was a hit or miss depending on who worked, pay was ok. Holiday bonuses are avalibale and it was a diverse enivorment."
good,"Working at Burlington Coat Factory I learned about the business aspect of retail, the hardest part of the job was working a late shift and having to work the next morning.  Majority of my co-workers were nice and friendly people, management was strict about all the employees working every minute of their shift."
good,Focused on getting the new product out in front of the customer and providing a customer experience that welcomed the customers to the store.
good,This was a seasonal jog but I took my jog seriously and my mangers were impressed.
good,"It's a retail job that deals with alot of customer service"
good,If you want to work every weekend at a extremely busy store that's under staffed this is the store for you
good,Typical day at work was having a morning meeting to start of the day. I learn how to become a leader and take charge of any important matter that may come up. Co - Workers are well I enjoyed working with them they were my second family.
good,"This job is a face pace environment that is always go go go, and time management is a big thing here."
good,"- Greeting customers"
good,I was a cashier at Burlington Coat Factory. The people I worked with was very friendly. I enjoy working with them because they makes the job easier to go through everyday. The hardest part was dealing with the customers and their complaint. But overall this was a great beginner's job to start out with.
good,"- You can come in at your scheduled time ,clock in in the employee lounge and begin working on your section"
good,BCF constantly tries to make the work place a better environment for employees to work in.
good,I enjoyed helping customers choose what they would like to buy. I made sure my are was neat and organized.
good,Its a big hierarchy of people. Really just a sea of individuals who go by the book. At least until you get down to the jobs that require more physical labor. Then your just a pawn to be pushed around until you either gain higher status or is killed by a dumb mistake by someone.
good,It's a good work place because I got to learn a lot from it. Was anble to work with a good team on my shift. I was able to train those who were new in the company.
good,"Management could've been better without the micro-management. and the work/social life had a good balance, so no complaints there. if you were looking for your first job i'd recommend BFC, but if you're already been around and have extensive experience in retail, warehouse work, etc. i'd keep looking. as far as pay rates go and what they make you do (i was a merchandising team associate), its slave pay to me. co workers were a bit plain to me but then again, but then again about 2/3 of the employees were over 40 and all most of them did was complain. helping customers with the items that we dont have on the sales floor was the hardest to me. half the time  we could find what they want but the backroom can get so cluttered sometimes it makes it impossible to find anything."
good,Customer service was a priority. I gained great customer service skills here. The co-workers were all team players that helped to get the job done.
good,I loved the job plus the discount just needed better management
good,"Wide verities of clothing and baby items. Working with customers, answering phones, price checks, ordering furniture for expectant parents."
good,"Burlington Coat Factory, was a great and fun place to work at. Positive environment and energetic people to be around.  I loved the management and my co- workers.  If i was still in Michigan I would be working there still to this day, but I decided to move to Chicago and attend school.  "
good,"Management at Burlington's is wonderful, most of the time. It is a great place to work  except there's not much room for advancement."
good,"I worked as a costumer service rep. cleaning and going into all departments as needed. I learned more computer skills, gained more experience in customer service, learned about retail and seasonal changes in the store. I enjoyed working with different types of people and having the opportunity to advance."
good,A typical day her for me was fun because there is always work that needs to be done and I loved the people I worked with. Management was really great here easy to talk to and great with scheduling. The hardest part of the job was the layaways. The most enjoyable part was engaging with all of the customers.
good,"I worked at the Gallery location, and I must say that the staff and management was truly like a family. Managers were always complimenting the staff and willing to help out. The staff was very knowledgeable about the items that were being sold in his or her department. And the staff excelled in customer service. The only negative is that the pay was not that high, but the perk was being paid every week."
good,The most enjoyable part of this job I had was merchandising. I enjoyed it a lot. From putting out clothing to doing mark-downs and mark-ups. I enjoyed!
good,fun and productive workplace. Great managers. Respectable co-workers. The hardest part of this job was irate customers. Not many though.
good,Loved the mngt. Got plenty of offers for advancement and would recommend this job to anyone looking for a low turn over type job.
good,Constant customer satisfaction is the main priority on the day to day basis. I was able to advance in the company working as a floor associate up to upper management. Burlington strives to employ well rounded and dedicated employees. The hardest part was dealing with the constant changes and new procedures of the company that sometimes did not work and having to revert back to previous procedures. I enjoyed working with the staff and customers from day to day.
good,"Providing the best customer sevice so that customers walk out the door satisfied with our business. Ive learned how to conversate better with individuals , kind and unkind. Also ive learned how to stock merchandise. Accounting work in the cash office as well as work on the receiving dock. Managment was not the best, but they did what they had to do to get there job done, they didnt always stay professional. When ever you needed management it took forever for whatever you needed to get done. Co-workers was the best enjoyment of working for the company. They always had good sprits and were very uplifting and supportive. I found the angry customers the most challenging because they would most likely be disrespectful with you. The most enjoyable part was the sweet customers who just brighted your day with their good sprits and high energy!"
good,"there were morning meetings , we worked on how to improve performances from previous weeks then we worked for 7-8 hrs a day then home"
good,A typical work day is non stop movement from the time you walk in until you either leave or take a break.
good,Provided customer service by creating an in stock shopping environment that encourages maximum sales and high levels of customer satisfaction.
good,"i very much enjoyed working at Burlington coat factory all the co workers were very friendly and helpful. A typical day at work involved me at the fitting helping customers with there sizes and making sure no one was trying to steal anything while in the fitting room. The managers were very helpful and did there job very well. the hardest part would be dealing with angry customers the best part was making someones day just by helping them find a simple shirt. i learned that the customer is always right,"
good,"Run register, greet customers, bag items, returns and exchanges, and lot of other things! We had busy, busy, busy days! It was a new store I helped set it up!"
good,A typical day keeps u going until its time for u to go home for the day...staff was average.
good,This was a good place to work and gain customer experience but not enough for growth
good,"Management was wonderful,however I was only a temporary employee for the holiday season. Wonderful employees all around though."
good,"Enjoyed my stay there, Great people at the silver spring location. The company is willing to bring you back if you leave in good standards. I've returned several times."
good,"Assisted customers, checked out patrons, and completed returns and exchanges, sizing, tagging and ticketing merchandise"
good,"fun environment, great people to work with, the customers were very nice, management was friendly and flexible with hours, but the job didn't pay very well the raises were not that good."
good,"employees & managers are all friendly and good to work with, typical day keeping back counter clean, conversing with customers, Easy place to work for"
good,I loved my working experience at Burlington Coat Factory. They even allow their employees to transfer locations. I really enjoyed greeting & interacting with the customers. I would often see employees getting screamed at and later be told to smile and be happy and to smile at the customers. It almost felt like a facade that would destroy anyone in the inside.
good,The company had great management and every one took the time to get to know the employees personally. The work environment was relaxed and everyone worked together as a team
good,This is a pretty good company to work for. The only issue is your schedule. When you request days for appointments you mostly have to call off to make your appointment
good,"Shifts start around 6am or 7am depending on how much a truck will bring in. You have to be quick when the process first begins (opening boxes, distributing merchandise by category), then you still have to keep moving fast as you take out all the merchandise to the store floor. They have you work quick so you can leave as scheduled. If you move slow you have to stay longer to finish your work."
good,"Micro mgmt ruined this place.  Cross training, less hours, loss of benefits. My gm was a tyrant and a bully.  Went in the other day and hardly any workers.  For minimum wage its ok job, just expect to work your butt off."
good,Burlington it self is a great place to work but depending on the manager either they can make the location workable or not. They do emphazie customer service if u have customer service in you...you are good
good,Coworkers were the best part it was a very friendly atmosphere. Management was nonexistent at times so we were free to do whatever but the freedom was not taken advantage of
good,"Burlington in Anderson is a pretty good place especially for a first job. The people were nice enough. Clean enough of a place as well. My only problem is if you're part time, they'll sometimes cut your hours down to one to two days a week. So do count on a steady constant paycheck unless you actively ask for more hours."
good,I have been working for Burlington for 3 years now. Its been ok working there.I started in receiving on the flow team and was promoted to full time shoe department. Ups and downs but overall cool job
good,"overworked and under paided. never enough staff to cover a shift. The management was okay to work for, sometimes it felt like they didn't care if there was enough staff or not."
good,Great job for fresh out of high school kids. Fast paced and stays busy. Full time and part time positions available.  You do get an employee discount and ft benefits.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Burlington Store, I stayed for a year. The co workers were diverse and friendly and we worked well together. The most enjoyable part was working with interesting people and the pot lucks. The least enjoyable part was getting assigned tasks that was out of your job description that you suddenly had to do. There was no time for that and to get your job done so it made it stressful."
good,"A typical day at work, helping customers find what need, processing customers transaction. recovering merchandise from the fitting room. Associate a usually friendly and helpful."
good,It was a great place to work love when I wasn't there the managers really listen and take into consideration everything that is said by the receiving stat they got a pay increase for us with the dollars 50 within a month's time
good,Short term this place its a great job. Long term you will eventually burn out. Employee turnover is very high which also effects YOU. Pay is average to below average depending on your age and/or needs.
good,the job was ok simple work only problem not enough hours to really call it work but I did like working there but eventually I had to move on to something better
good,"i can not see myself staying at Burlington any more due to the issue with pay, there is aldo the issue of core values. it is preached constantly but not really followed.  the service center is treated like trash whichis very heart breaking seeing they do most of the work for other departments on top of their own."
good,"I enjoy working with some of the staff members. They are very good on helping people and other staff members. I enjoy helping customers new to the store and showing them great discounts we offer. Above all, I enjoy the simplicity of the job. The work is easy and very simple to understand. I have been there five years and counting. Looking forward to our new area of operations next year."
good,"Worked there for a short time and I met some nice people. I enjoyed it, but I wanted a change. Can be unfair at times, some people work really hard while others just let time pass, but general manager didn't seem to see this differences, and it definitely doesn't reflect on your pay. My direct manager was really nice, good at explaining, no nonsense, flexible, and she works harder than anybody else. Hours around Christmas can be tough. There's always dust and lint around, so not a job for those allergic to dust. Limited opportunities for promotion."
good,"I would love to have still been there. Although, unfortunately I had a few words with a foreman that lead to my assignment ending. I tried to get back and would of been able if there was another foreman I could of went under. Although there wasn't."
good,an alright place that pays the given bills/ help pays the given bills. the management has its ups and downs and everybody is working stress bubbles. i feel neutral about it. it's a job.
good,"My position at Burlington is fun, active, fast pace and great! I would like to have the opportunity to work more hours though. The environment is a great working place to work in."
good,Fast paced environment.  great coworkers and lots of fun.  Assisted customers with finding all merchandises. Management was always available on sales floor.  Open door policy was always followed.  Just needed more hours and more money.
good,"Productive and fun work place that allowed for flexibility."
good,Assist customer with items that they were looking for assist cashier items alway customer did not want  learn to work in other areas of the store to be more knowledgeable and efficient with customer needs
good,"Very Shallow place to work, Management was very cool. Not really the place you want to work if you into excitement on the job. for the most part the tasks given is very simple and easy to get done, just very time consuming"
good,"It’s a great place to work, has new management team in this store he’s doing a lot of great things they just need to get all the employees on board with task"
good,Burlington has a strong management team.  As a seasonal employee   I was expected to know cashiering and be able to process a large number of customers in a friendly and efficient manner.  The entire staff was friendly.  The company has a charity event through the month of December where coats can be donated to help needy people.
good,I always have to ask for more hours I never get consistent days of the week as a schedule you get paid weekly which you see less in your checks so it feels like you’re not getting paid enough management is a bit grumpy one manager has very bad communication skills .
good,"Also long as you do want you're told you'll be ok. Just don't apply for something that you can't handled or else you'll get in trouble. Great co-workers, great customers and a wonderful experience."
good,"I LOVE Burlington but even though I am a seasonal worker I have to call in almost everyday to see if there is work for me, I am never on the schedule. I hate that there is no separation for layaways, and returns from the cashiers doing purchase transactions for other customers. I can do a purchase transaction just fine with a hiccup here and there, but learning how to do a layaway transaction or a return transaction can be A NIGHTMARE to remember! If it wasn't for the wonderful staff, and I do mean EVERYBODY is wonderful including management, I wouldn't be working there. They are a great support system like a family, just the training methods need to be a bit better and the hours and schedules need to be a lot better. It's not like they don't need the help the cashier line is always backed up and no one is ever on the sales floor, so I don't know maybe it's just me."
good,"The Management team was very inconsistent. In the 3 years I worked there, I had a total of 8 differing managers. They burned employees out quickly. It was perfect for a full-time college student who needs a flexible work schedule."
good,Everyday I regret the decision I made to leave Burlington.  It was a great company and although it had its flaws overall I was content.  Ultimately I could not work for a manager that pushed all of her reporting errors on me.  I was struggling with my health at that point and decided it was time to take leave and find a new opportunity while I was out.
good,"When walking into your work place ,around every corner you see  smiling faces ,along with there smiling faces you see the mess that follows.The long shifts pay off  when your the reason a customer  leaves satisfied."
good,Burlington is a fast pase job which requires lots of energy customer service is definitely needed and work ethic seeing yourself as a customer enable you to provide accurate service
good,"Fast paced and fun engaging environment.  The most enjoyable part of the job was merchandising, training managers, setting up new stores, remodels, and traveling."
good,Being able to multi-task at Burlington was fun. The day started out in shipping but we did floor customer service and set-up. I always like to try different things so this was a new experience.
good,Managers not willing to work around school schedules . Customers & other co-workers are very helpful and a joy to work with.  Work load ultimately easy .
good,"Part time employers are always on call to pick up extra shifts. The store is always busy,sometimes employers does not receive their  breaks. Burlington is a great company they just lack employers."
good,"working in burlington wasnt always easy there were days you felt you would never things done because of how busy the store would be but luckily there were employees and managers that would teach easy strategy thinking on getting certain taks done. working in burlington i gained merchandising experiance and was constanly complimented by corporate , i was working for the merchandise team and did my job very well. i also gained being supervisor in customer service , i was a very clean well organzied strategic person i loved what i did and how well appreciated i was for it."
good,"The store has a large selection of clothing and household products. My hiring process did not include any training, although, training is normally done.  The management was helpful and other staff members were very friendly."
good,"Burlington is not a harsh company to work for, it has everything to do with managing the company without making poor decisions that affect us employees. That was my only issue at times but that's just about every business so that is why it's not such a big factor but it could be better."
good,Employees and managers are very friendly and are willing to help you whenever you need it. The work environment is very clean and inviting. Managers are always checking up on you to make sure you are doing well or needing of any service.
good,Burlington was a very fun and fast paced environment to work in. Employees were all like a huge family and management were phenomenal when it came to understanding their employees and appreciating their hard work.
good,The work flow for the most part is constant. procesures are easy to follow. The work stations are always neat and organized.The store has a wide range of items and constantly mark downs prices on which clients can find excellent deals.
good,"At Burlington's there is never a dull moment, you are on your feet walking around recovering the sales floor, cashiering when needed. I pretty much can do it all for the managers on duty, whatever is needed to complete the job. However it is tough work and requires a good pair of comfy shoes as you are on your feet for the whole shift. The great thing about this company is that there is great amount of availability as far as scheduling around your needs. The culture of the store is very dynamic and diverse. Managers are pretty cool with you if you work hard."
good,"Burlington coat factory is a moderate pace job that requires you to lift more than 50 pounds a day, and provide excellent customer service. Also, while working here I was able to build better working skills and personable skills."
good,I enjoyed working at Burlington because they would always work with my school schedule. The hours where okay for a college student and being paid every week was very nice.
good,It's a good job that is clear cut and easy with good people to work with. Though dealing with rude people and constant shoplifters sometimes makes it a stressful job. Your hours are constantly changing so its hard to have a second job.
good,"1. typical day at work cleaning aisles and putting cloths, accessories or merchandise back to there spot"
good,"Great place to work, fun environment, fast paced but not at all difficult! Not nearly enough hours and only pays minimum wage, this is a good job for someone in college or just to have a little extra money."
good,"It was cool to work at burlington along with interact with new people. I liked how it would get busy just to have the time go by faster. It was fun at first, but the days began becoming less to where I was barely there. So it was fun while it lasted"
good,"The work is fine, but its mostly the customers. The main problem with the business itself is how far behind it is on the technology curve, lots of slow machines and the common stance is something is more likely to NOT be working, than working. If you can adjust to that as the major issue, decent place."
good,"I'm working in Receiving in the backroom of the store. Every morning we open boxes and we organize the merchandise in rolling wrecks or blue bins the clothes and in pallets the footwear and all the other merchandise. We open the bags of the merchandise, we put their tickets and we censor any of them that needs to be censored. We go out on the floor and put them in the right place. Receiving is one the most difficult jobs in these kind of stores because they are responsible for all the merchandise not to be damaged and also people to be pleased with what they buy. The most enjoyable part of the job is that when you work hard the managers give you a smiley a small letter that congratulates you for your excellent job and this is a reward for every employee. Also the company gives additional employee discount on special days"
good,"It was really cr*ppy at times, but I loved all of the employees and managers; this place is really understaffed, but to be honest most of the time you'll be fine. Would definitely work here again  for the people."
good,Burlington is a great place to work. Work life balance with Burlington is awesome. If you work hard there are chances to move up. They deffeintly promote from within.
good,"Managment are ok at store, not enough store employees working at any one time. Even though I do my job and know my job it doesnt seem to be good enough for store manager and assistant mgr."
good,"A day at burlington was relaxed ,non stressful , and well balanced. I learned everything from how to keep departments clean to how to run  a register, management was always respectful and willing to work with you. Hardest part to deal with was the salary/hours they were able to give. Most enjoyable were the great people who worked and shopped there"
good,Good for a first job and part time job for students. The environment is fast passed at times but mostly slow. Managers are nice and hard working. Christmas season sucks.
good,"working at Burlington store was good "
good,"A typical day work was busy fast-paced and fun, always something interesting going on."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Bulington, my only complaint was that they did not pay very well for the amount of work and responsibility I provided. I did appreciate the company and their organizational principles, their compensation was just unfair, especially for associates."
good,"Burlington is a fast paced work place but if you focus on the customers and keep your numbers up you will do fine.  I love the co workers and the customers, but I am a people person."
good,"A typical day included counting down and opening all registers for the day, preparing the daily schedule including writing all associates break times for the day, ringing customers, doing returns and creating and pulling layaways for customers. Responsible for cash pickups on registers and assisting cashiers with customers."
good,Working there is a great place to be it give u alot of opportunities. U can grow in the company and build a career out of it. U have days off that u can use when sick or personal days. The people are great too.
good,Great management but pay sucks. Only 9 dollars an hour not good for the working class more for college students or high schoolers. Can move up in the company but not if you want to make that career.
good,"The management staff was nice and efficient.  I do not believe the pay reflects the amount of work one has to do in a given day.  The work is not hard but is like a workout, if you do it correctly.  The people are friendly and it is a nice place to work."
good,my experience was good as an employer. Everyone was a good team player and as well as a great energy. Theres always happy customers and good quality products in the store.Many organizing projects and re stocking is always good.

good,"on a typical day, you prepare your work area and make sure it is clean and merchandise is placed where it belongs."
good,A typical day at work was really busy. I learned how to count how many products were in a box. Management was nice and very helpful. The work place was very cultural. There were no hard parts in the job.
good,when I was working at Burlington I was a summer assistant so I did not work there for long and couldn't do certain things like doing the  cashier but its a descent job though.
good,the hardest part of working here was no matter how great of a worker you are you don't really get no recognized for nothing. through it all i enjoyed working here
good,Burlington management compensation was very competitive. Vacation and personal time off also competitive. Management required to work at least 10 hours a day. Work/life balance Nov.- Jan almost non existent..6day work week..10hour days. After the Holiday season Burlington did comp. 6 days off for management. Overall a Great company to work for as store management.
good,"Making the all customers are happy is very important, but also making sure your employees are happy in their work environment is also just as important."
good,"It was very busy work place, great co-workers, and fun customers. I appreciate the help from others. It was a competitive work environment. But overall I enjoyed it."
good,"I was employed at the Burlington Coat Factory located in Center City Philadelphia. I was employed in Loss Prevention, we had a great team. The size of the store as well as the store being located inside of a mall presented several challenges for security. These challenges helped me improve my communication skills, leadership, and teamwork. As security we often had to make quick and fast decisions under pressure. I loved this job, and all of the skills that I had learned from working for Burlington Coat Factory."
good,"A normal day for me is coming in at 9am , almost everyone greeting me with a good morning. I hang, tag, senor, unpack, run clothes during my hours there."
good,Worked as a cashier and guest service. Placed orders for layaway and also took payments on the account. Checked out customers and got orders from the back.
good,"Just a job, nothing very exciting about it. I worked in the back and would unload many trucks a day, tag and hang clothes and stock hard lines. Worked with fun people"
good,"My work day was very busy."
good,"cool place to work, kind of a fast place job, there was a lot of walking i didn't mind that. the pay was good they just don't like working with school schedule."
good,a typically day at BCF is great. All the associates work well together. Great team and great management. The hardest part is the closing shifts living so far away.The workplace is diverse. I have learned how to merchandise and use my time wisely
good,A typical day at work is very long but quite busy. I have learned how to work at a very fast past with little space. The hardest part of the work day maybe when the work does slow down.
good,"short hour"
good,"Good experience"
good,"It's a good job to work at. Good managers and work staff,  good environment and good workers. Clean and fast paced environment, sometimes travelling to other stores for assistance."
good,"This job is an easy hire. They want new people, it's a great learning experience and a great start out to the working environment. A problem I had was trying to move to a different position."
good,Burlington is a fun place to work with an excellent and friendly customer base. The company has gone through many changes including various stages on restructure and downsizing which is very discouraging and stressful to employees. Job security is not established.
good,"Management had communication issues, the staff could be unfriendly, too much drama for a job. Not enough hours and the pay is too low, you are expected to do everyone else's work because no one else wants to do anything but you have minimal requirements to leave for the day."
good,I loved being able to work in the baby department helping new mothers create baby registries and also shopping for their new born. The workplace was always so welcoming to come to even by me being a high school student and the workers always encourage me to make sure that I push with my dream to find a good college for me to attend to.
good,Long hours on your feet but the amount of work don't measure up to the work that goes in. One week you get a lot of hours. Next week you don't. Nice management.
good,"Hours from about 6-10AM, laid back workplace with monthly potluck lunch. The hours leave the rest of the day open and the work went by quick. Compensation was a little to low."
good,"This is a great job for a college student, or for someone that want to make up their own hours. Burlington allows you to pick up as many hours as needed. They also help work around you schedule, and are very considerate of their employee's needs. For that reason alone, I will always love Burlington."
good,overall great place to work but the management needed work. They seen like they did not care about what was going on in your life and overall did not want to work with you.
good,"I really enjoyed my time, although short, at Burlington. The fast paced environment was thrilling and ever-changing. I couldn't have done my job as well as I did without the sales team behind me, encouraging me to be better and allowing me to make advancements within the company."
good,I managed to fill up an empty spot that needed my talents and then I worked everyday with a strong pushing attitude. Part time is my position and there are times where you are asked to stay longer for full time hours ...sometimes.
good,very fast placed where you had to multi task a lot and have the ability to work in multiple departments at one time and the hardest thing was dealing with the work load
good,"A typical day at work was would consist of arriving at work clocking in and heading to the cash register. On busy days we were required to attend and check out customers quickly yet while still being friendly which might of been difficult at times with the variety of customer personalities. However we always had to maintain or calm and be polite, I learned how to maintain patience in different types of situations and always look to my manager for assistance. At the end of the night we made sure to count and close our till and help organize and tidy up the store before leaving for the work day. It was enjoyable because they always provided with different events to reward the employees for a job well done like gift cards and free lunch in which they ordered food. Above all it was a good work environment"
good,"Leadership skills need more cultivating, workplace culture was friendly and welcoming to both staff and customers.  Hardest part of job was the lack of training.  It ultimately fell on the employee to figure it out themselves.  The most enjoyable part of the job was how rewarding it was to develop employees."
good,"At Burlington the workers there are amazing. I say the store manager know how to pick good employees. The work there is fairly easy, but some of the managers do not distribute the work evenly. The managers there basically wants to overwork about 2 or 3 people each day so that they don't have to pay as much. Other than that Burlington is a great place to work at. My location is very awesome. I really like most of the team. Some of us we work together to get the job done."
good,I love working here. people who work here like my family. Sometimes is fun and sometimes it is too much work. low wages comparing to the job the employees do.
good,"I learned a lot from working at Burlington, I learned how to process all inventory and to work in a fast paced environment with the warehouse team. We always managed to finish or get close to finishing everything by the end of the day. It was a great warehouse team and a good team leader she always helped out whenever we needed it. The management was very nice and worked with you if you ever needed something."
good,"Hay buen companerismo "
good,"Upon working at Burlington Coat Factory, I learned quickly that the employees receive discounts on the merchandise. My managers were very friendly and worked well with the employees; sometimes they would even have a potluck dinner"
good,I worked as a cashier and I thought It was Great work place. The management was good. The company overall is a great company. It was a great job.
good,"Days started early and sometimes if there was not enough work , which happened often, we were sent home early.  We were also made to stay late, if there was more work than we could handle with out notice till we got there.  If  you had a job after this one, you would have to call in.  Some days you did not need to be there and you would end up shpwing up because you were never called.  Co-workers were great.  When I broke my arm, I was told that I would be let go because I just started and could not do the work.  For me to keep my job pretty much I had to take my sling off. Still have issues with my arm to this day.  I loved moving around.  I am a very active person and going from the floor to the back and to the floor again was good for me. You had to be a bit of a perfectionist in this job, which is good because I like to put all myself into my work."
good,"chill, can meet a lot of people, work with your availability, little hours though that's the downer, a lot of things to detail so be very detailed and responsible"
good,"It is a pretty fast paced job. It stays crowded so its a lot to help and serve every customer. But it is a fun environment and my co workers were friendly. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the items and making sure new stock that would come in was set up right, it would be a lot of inventory especially during the changing seasons of the holidays."
good,"The benefits are great I was sick for a long time and I eventually had to have surgery I had to stay out 6 weeks. I did not have to stress for anything I had long term disability ,short-term disability and personal leave time which paid for time out for six weeks.   Benefits called and checked up on me and asked me how I was when I arrived home from the Hospital."
good,"Solid structure that has improved tremendously the last 10 years."
good,"most day consisted of cleaning and maintaining the floor, occasionally stocking the shelves, During real busy days I assisted on the registers. Managers were very helpful and my co workers were all friendly and helpful."
good,The job was hard work but not bad. Managers and supervisors were kind and easy to talk to. The hardest part of the job were the hours and the wage wasn't too good. Overall good job to start off.
good,Good place to work. Nice employees that know how to laugh and not be so up tight about things. Supervisors and managers do well. Work isn't hard but its not a walk either. Good job.

good,"The atmosphere was very calm and easy going, managers always set up the stores break room for holidays and before each shift there was a meeting with all store workers just to go over sales and different other accomplishments the day before"
good,Descent co-workers. Good Customer Service. Descent management who seemed to really care about their employees. Hardest part of the job was dealing with irate customers.
good,I enjoyed working with the other staff as well as the customers. The best part of the job was working in the fitting room and being able to purchase items from the vending machines.
good,"•	20-22 hours per week"
good,At Burlington I gained experience in a lot of different departments throughout the store. I really enjoyed the diverse group of people that I worked with. My co-workers always supported each other and  always worked together closely as a team to accomplish daily tasks within the store.
good,Burlington was a great workplace with good people it was a great learning experience for me. Learned how to run a cash register shipping and receiving and lots of customer service.
good,"10-15 hours a day"
good,I loved working for Burlington. The management and staff were amazing! It was more like a family. Unfortunately there was little room for advancement and little hours available.
good,"Receive payment by cash, check, credit cards, vouchers, or automatic debits. Issue receipts, refunds, credits, or change due to customers. Assist customers by providing information and resolving their complaints"
good,"The store I worked at was severely understaffed, so there was always a lot that needed to be done. However that meant staying longer after close to perform closing duties.  The management is very good at delegating and understanding your situation."
good,"The managers are great.  The pay could be better, and they are very careful with the hours.  I enjoyed working here and only left for a better paying job with more hours."
good,Burlington Coat Factory was great job. It helped me to gain better customer service skills. The Employees were good people and fun to work with.
good,"Customer service is our first goal at Burlington. We are given a task each day, keeping our sites on greeting each customer, back up at cash registers and store recovery. "
good,Burlington is a great company if you wish to be a merchant. You will have plenty of opportunity to take and make merchandise a wow statement.
good,Burlington was a good place to work. Some mangers had their pets but all in all was a good place to work. I enjoyed my time there
good,"great place to work,everybody works as a team and everybody gets along they also have great managers and plus you get a discount"
good,Working here i learned a lot as well. i learned how to multitask faster with the customers while im behind the register. i also learned more about women clothes and materinity clothes
good,you came in and clocked in and went to the front and started assisting customer and ringing up there merchandise. when it was not busy we would sort the hangers.
good,"it is a fun place to work ,however most of there jobs are part time an th hours are not enough .The job itself isnt hard jus the benefits an pay is not good enough fo employees"
good,"I used to work at the Burlington coat factory, the pay is LOW but the workers are good people who like to work but there's little help from the managers."
good,"Working at burlington was a great experience. I enjoyed the environment, my co workers, even the job period most times. Burlington does have its downfall as far as hours and wages go."
good,"a typical day was long but fast and busy"
good,"Easy job, real laid back managers cool just doesn't pay enough. The pay is minimum wage. Needs to offer employees a chance to earn pay raises."
good,"i really didnt enjoy working here just didnt want to give it because it was hard to find another job, i just didnt like how the managers were extremely rude i just didnt like how they treated the employees"
good,"Being a empolyee at Burlington, i have learnd different people skills also how to multi task. The company cares a great deal about ther customers and shows concern for there empolyee. A day a Burlington keeps you very busy with only breaks at the appropriate time, managment can be very busy but they always seem to find time to help with any daily problem rather job related or personal. I find that sometimes the work load does not add up to your work day hours. Burlington allowed me to see that i have great people skills and that under any sort of pressure that i can prevail. I like working with other co-workers they keep you on your toes they also can make the job a lot easier."
good,"Recently there have been a changed of management with a very open door policy compared to the  previous team, there's a VOICE TEAM that meets with the management once a month to voice opinions,helpful suggestions along with new company guidelines to inform associates the direction company has taken. This along with associate rewards and store activities has improved the store productivity and moral."
good,"Exciting job full of challenges and rewards"
good,A typical day at Burlington was grabbing the go backs and recovering the floor.I learned that having your own department could be a bit challenging.The managers was very helpful by teaching you step by step on how to complete a task. There were coworkers who would come to work and do their job but there were some who didn't do it at all. The hardest part of my job was having my own department without a part-timer. What i like about the job is that i got rewarded for all the hard work i accomplished.
good,Worked from 4 to 12:30 and the work days was long it felt like. I learned my first warehouse experience working there. The co-workers was cool just was not that close to them. The hardest part was working all the different jobs I had to do. I enjoyed the pay every week and that was the part.
good,"Greet customers, head straight to the shoe department. Restock any shoes left on the ground from previous customers. Check for correct prices, assist with any questions and/or needs. Cashier at the front whenever needed."
good,The Company culture encourages you to speak up your mind. they promote a team building environment.
good,Focused on making sure all cashiers till balanced daily. Made sure money balanced as well
good,"It is a Nice Place to Work, Good Managers, and Fair Benefits."
good,"very fast paced, customer oriented. I enjoyed taking care of customers needs, and the associates."
good,"Burlington was a fun place to work. I really like my co workers which made the job the most fun. the management could use a little bit more work in the communication aspects of the job. they never knew what the other one said. a typical; day would include coming to work and having morning meetings and then going to size clothes or racks as a team until the store opened. and them you went to the different departments. I worked up front so, i got a lot of returns in the mornings.. my co workers were a lot of fun. the hardest part of the job i think was the management, their communication skills were just not good. nobody knew what was going on."
good,"It was nice, work was easy. Not enough hours but enjoyed the people i worked for and with"
good,A typical day at work. I start out by taking out the work needed for the floor workers and cleaning up the back of the warehouse. I then move stuff around in the warehouse to make room for when we unload the work load that was delivered the day before. That usually goes on for about 2 hours. We take our first 15 minute break at 8:40am its rare I take mine earlier only because I get a start on the work before the rest of the workers come. After our 15 minute break we start the work load which goes on for about an hour maybe more depends on the work load we may have. After that I usually wait until the truck comes with the new load that we would be workingo n the next day. After that I clean up if I need to take any more work to the floor I do and if I need to bring garbage back to the warehouse to throw out I do that too. My co-workers are great I get along with all of them. Management is great too. My boss I have alot of respect for. The hardest part of the job honestly is waking up in the morning at the time I wake up. The work is not hard. The most enjoyable part of the job is being around good people. If I'm around miserable people I'm going to be miserable because I'm motivated not only off of my energy but mostly off of other people's energy. I cant say I learned anything because my work is nothing new to me. I've been doing warehouse type work since I entered high school. Only thing I can say I've learned is re-learning how to scan.
good,"I currently supervise about fifteen cashiers. A typical work day for me would be to make sure the cashiers have everything they need to work efficiently. This is a retail environment so I am in direct contact with customers. Depending on the day, this could be the easiest and also the hardest part of the job. However, it's all worth it. Being a supervisor has taught me how to bring balance to the work environment while maintaining a positive work ethic. One great thing about this company is that there is always room for growth."
good,"a typical day at Burlington Coat Factory would be me being on the cashier helping customers with their purchases, and taking out all the  garbage from each register and then bring them to the back of the store. At Burlington coat factory I learned Burlington Coat Factory's type of cashiering, how to look up items that have no price tickets on them. the management at Burlington Coat factory are flexible with their scheduling, and understanding if a problem arises. My co-workers at Burlington Coat Factory are easy to get along at work, and on breaks. the hardest part working at Burlington coat factory is if I am helping out at a department putting away item returns to the correct place. The most enjoying part of working at Burlington Coat Factory is  when I am at my register and seeing people check out with their purchases."
good,Burlington is very busy place you are always working which is a good thing. As  part time associate there is not much benefits offered. My co-workers are very nice and are always willing to help me in every way they can. the job is pretty much basic and pretty much the same every day. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping customer find items that they might like.
good,"i learn alot within the yrs i been there from regular associated i know to been in the registers ,receiving , back room and so on after all is great job , but the management is poor ."
good,"At Burlington Coat Factory I am a cashier. A typical day for me, is a fast paced, fast talking, and quick thinking type of shift. My favorite part of my job is being able to interact and connect with so many different people within such a short time frame. I enjoy being at the customers' assistance when needed, and enjoy working in retail because I do believe I have a keen fashion sense and can give reliable and helpful tips to shoppers. My management staff at Burlington are all very down to earth and try to make the workplace feel like one giant family. Communication is a bit of an issue here, and messages relayed could be more clear, but the overall direction they give their employees is adequate. The hardest part of the job can be the distribution of power between employees and supervisor staff members. I feel that this problem can seem unprofessional and make the workplace stressful at times."
good,My position is very simple to me. I've learned a lot working in receiving and processing all merchandise for the sales floor
good,The most enjoyable part about working at Burlington Coat Factory was the customers. Working with different types of people and talking to them showed me a different way to look at life. I learned many of things working there as well how to handle different types of cust0omers and the attitudes they come with.
good,They were flexible with my hours. Management was nice. Not all the co-workers were friendly. When you are new some of them just don't want anything to do with you. I worked in the Baby Depot Dept and my supervisor was fantastic and we got along really well.
good,"the most exciting thing about this job is that you get to really talk to people on all levels, which can be helpful in life and funny and make our an more caring person as well.  All though it's hard work most of the the time dealing with cleaning and picking up  and hanging up clothes and running price checks for the customer.  It's still a great job to have."
good,"A typical day of work is not knowing what your day many bring, You learn something new everyday such as what is needed to run a large and profitable company with such high standards, Working with the Management staff is always a pleasure we each teach each other in different departments of knowledge for each areas. It's fun working with and teaching new employees of there job responsibilities and expectations of the company. The hardest part of the job is knowing there is so much to get done, but not enough time of day to do it. What i like the the most is making sure the customers are always satisfy and come back. It also make me feel good when your associates appreciate you for all you do for them and help them to succeed in there job."
good,good place to work just not enough hours on average about 25... takes awhile for advancement
good,"the company has a great pay ratio, to job related experience, work life balance was essential to the company"
good,Typical day involves helping and providing warm friendly customer service
good,"A typical work day includes providing a sense of safety/security to a retail environment. The day includes communicating with a diverse range of customers to gain postive feedback and energy and to familiarize with climates and characteristics of individuals, monitoring closed circuit television to ensure thefts or emergency situations are not taking place, patrol the store on foot being a visible line of defence, apprehending/detaining theft suspects, completing detailed/comprehensive reports, and multi-tasking."
good,I would come in and start the line where all the boxes would run thru and I had to be checking on the labels to make sure it was the same label as the other boxes. If a new label would come in I had to get the order paper and check in the system to see if the order was in the system. I would opened the box to make sure the color and sizes of the ordered were correctly. Once the ordered was correctly I would start the band so the rest of the boxes would run thru.
good,Typical day was going in helping customers and putting thing's that was not in their proper area in the correct place.
good,"Unload and unpack deliveries"
good,Typical day at work would be busy attending to customers and their needs with their items that they are purchasing. Improve what are customer service needs.
good,"A typical day, I would be in charge of cleaning Sportswear department. Making sure items are picked up off the floor and put in proper spot. I also have to make sure each individual section of sportswear in organized. I take clothes back from the fitting room. I do projects to rearrange the departments. In addition, I am a cashier when needed. I have the skills to work in all departments of the store. My managers are easy to talk to and I can go to about anything work related or just to talk to about personal stuff. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I get a customer that I can really help them by finding that right outfit for a certain occasion. The hardest part of my job is going behind people that purposely drop items on the floor right in front of me."
good,"Store environment was heavy traffic, less payroll and production demands. development of team made it possible to be successful"
good,"I am pretty content with my employment. I can say I have no major complaints. I like the environment and atmosphere. The customers can be a tad much, and a few coworkers/managers have their bad days, but all-in-all I leave my job with a sense of  accomplishment and joy."
good,"I love Burlington Coat Factory. However, it's just a job to most people. I believe that a lot of the people I work with do not have a good work ethic and it brings down the job. The management is decent. We just received a new manager and we are in the middle of a lot of changes. Some for the good. Some not that great. The hardest part of the job I think is dealing with the level of unprofessionalism that a lot of these co-workers have. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I know I have another satisfied customer due to great customer service."
good,"very large store with a long list of things to do. "
good,"At Burlington Coat factory I was a Baby Depot Associate. I would stock shelves and maintain a clean and organized department. Product knowledge was a must due to new mothers needing the most information about products for their newborns. "
good,"I enjoy working at the Burlington Coat Factory. They have productive cashier front line. My co-workers were friendly. Especially, Burlington provided us a comfortable break-room for employees."
good,This was a decent company I only left because I got injured and was going to be out for too long.
good,ther is never enough associates on the floor and they pull from the floor to help ring customers because there isn't enough cashiers so that leaves the sales floor unattended and that's poor customer service
good,"My days involve one of 3 things: Putting out merchandise, Processing  merchandise so that it can be put out, or Marking items down so that items sell faster and then there is space to put more merchandise out.  I learned that Burlington Coat Factory revolves around Customer Surveys, Donations to causes, Making ""Plan"", and Corporate.  These are the things that management cares about, not how feasible anything is to be accomplished when they cut hours down to half.  Yet what makes the work day bearable is the friends/coworkers who work with you. While not everyone likes everyone I cannot think of even one person who doesn't have a few friends at Burlington."
good,A typical day at work for me was making sure I cleaned and sanitized the bathroom and breakroom according to safty standards.  Helped kelpt store cleaned and organized.  Assisted with other taks when needed.
good,"Great atmosphere to work in."
good,This job was great for me to start out in retail.  At a certain point it becomes hard to move up because people stay for quite awhile.  My coworkers were very friendly and it was fun to work with customers.
good,It was ok had great costumers and my co-workers where fine .My days where long but my houre where short so that could have ben better .But the people that I work with where pretty cool .
good,"I enjoy working with all my co-workers, and all the different people I get to interact with on a daily basis. We are constantly busy. The hardest part of the job would most likely be interacting with the extremely rude customers, but luckily that is rare."
good,I enjoyed working fr Burlington. I met intresting people on a daily basis.
good,"To me burlington was a fun place to work. I would recommand any body to work for there company. The mangers are great, they are easy to talk to and they are fun to work with. The saff was very friendly and helpful at all times. I learned how to work better with people."
good,"• Handle Customer Inquiries, complaints"
good,"I worked on the floor and I cleaned it, brought clothes out, and also dealt with customer service from time to time."
good,"You never get bored as long as there is work. If there is an excellent management team work is worthwhile. Fairfax and Bailey's Crossroads offer integrity, disciple, and status."
good,Learned how to manage a team through daily situations. This job helped me perfect my customer service skills and gave me the experience needed to help me advance in other job career oppuretunities.
good,"It is a good starting job place where you start from the bottom chain and move up higher overtime, but do not count as a long term career sometimes get a raise every once in a while every year and not too much of a raise..."
good,"I had to stock items , Volunteer work. Unload and load items from and to the truck."
good,typical day at work was good just real slow. what I learned was being a better person to others. management was ok at times. The hardest part of the job was working late. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to walk around alot.
good,"awesome staff members, and work environment"
good,i love my job at Burlington i was able to interact with customers but the only issue had with my job that they was able to work around my school schedule
good,"I started here as a floor associate in their baby depot department which was not only a challenge, but I was left alone during ""black friday"" in that department and if you can get through black friday alone then you can get through anything lol"
good,"I had a great lerning experience in Burlington Coat Factory, I truly learned a lot from my co-workers and managers there."
good,this positon as the lead CSS was a great experience. I enjoyed meeting new people everyday and finding a way to make sure their shopping experience was memorable.
good,"A great place to work management is good to employees.Many employee discounts, ample parking."
good,Great working environment
good,Its a nice environment needs improvement in sorting areas.
good,BCF has great employees working for them. I was there for well over a decade and i made great friends and really good co-workers.
good,"basically your just fixing stuff, helping customers with their needs and when it's time to close, just sweep your department and help others too. I learned how to mechandise on the sales floor and comparing prices on the same brand. The co-workers are always on the up-beat when we are in a rush. The hardest part is that when a customer didn't see the price on the merchandise, you gotta go look for it in a certain amount of seconds because if you don't do so, the company loss money on that merchandise and basically you gotta walk ALOT. I enjoyed meeting new co-workers and when it's time to close, you can buy something, BIGGER THE PRICE, BIGGER THE DISCOUNT with the 10% they give you and also with that card, you swipe in and out, that includes breaks instead of clock-in in and out."
good,Its a good place to work... Expect a few major things.. They changed your schedule and don't bother to tell you. And certain mangers have their favorites.
good,Easy work but limited hours and minimum wage. Management is great but current supervisor in Receiving department at Waterbury CT location is unprofessional and rude. Most coworkers are friendly.
good,"It's a good job for people fairly new to work life or people getting back to work. "
good,Great work experience and made a lot of professional contacts in the field of loss prevention. My education and background gives me the ability to lead a company in the right direction and set example for good employees
good,"A typical day at work was coming in the morning unloading the truck. After unloading the truck we put the merchandise in the sections that they belong in. What I've learned from Burlington was making tags for unmarked merchandise, what clothes and shoes need to be censored, customer service skills. Management was great, if you needed certain days or need to leave early they would give you your days off. The culture was relatively younger people and everyone was on the same page to get the truck finished. Hardest part of the job would be unloading truck and sorting the merchandise. The most enjoyable part about the job was that you can get a look at what is coming into the store such as clothes, shoes, toys, etc."
good,The work is 4 hours a day that’s not enough for me to provide for my family. I’m just looking for a job that can help me do that. Getting around 20 hours a week is not helping I need at least 40.
good,My job at Burlington just wish they would’ve kept me I was a seasonal employee and I work very very hard and I don’t understand why they didn’t keep me but I can’t understand why if you’re not Mexican or Latino then you have nothing there you basically no one I work very hard  there but I still would go bad because I really love my job there
good,"I needed more hours at the time and couldn't get them but other than that a great place to work. Really busy on weekends, customers are usually friendly and excited to be there."
good,"enjoyed working with everyone there, it was like a second home. everyone was super nice. they were really flexible with my schedule. i was cashier and helped on the floor when needed"
good,Burlington Stores was a great place to work and be able to conduct yourself individually with limited supervision.  Management within my department was exceptional.
good,"It's a decent place to work at. I won't lie and say I love it, but my day spent is nice for the most part. I'm not sure about other Burlington stores, but it does seem like working as a cashier there is a good first job."
good,I liked working for this company. I was offered a higher position very fast. It is a fast and friendly environment.  You must know that great customer service is the most important thing.
good,Burlington is my first ever job and they did a good job training me to do the specific tasks they required. The management at this particular location is quite friendly and easy to work with. Retail is not for everybody but this job is definitely a nice place to start for those like myself.
good,"Never had enough sales personnel on the floor, not enough cashiers. One manager the majority of the time. They want most employees working part-time hours."
good,This job is great for someone who enjoys personal shopping and is good with customer service. There isn't room for advancement but the worm was not difficult.
good,"it was a good workplace. employees were respectful. customers are messy, but the recovery is doable. just work slow and steady and consistent so you don't burn out too early. the work is doable, but not for the pay you're getting. you start of at 8/hr."
good,"I enjoy working at Burlington's. Its a very fun, energetic and family like environment to work in. My managers and coworkers are very genuine and easy to work with. While working at Burlington's, I continued to develop my skills of time management, work in fast paced environments, and solve problems."
good,"Luckily, I became the store's go-to opening cashier after several months on the job, which worked out nicely thanks to the ""in early-out early"" scheduling, and what I thought was an easier workload than later shifts. Management was easy-going but still focused on maintaining a professional atmosphere, and very understanding when it came to requests for time off, as long as they were presented in accordance with the company's typical policy. Overall a great place to work, as long as you're willing to put in the work to show them you're worth keeping."
good,"Good benefits, good work/family balance, treat employees with respect. Good employee discount program, Good opportunities for advancement, pay holidays."
good,This was a great place to work and I met a lot of new people and purchase a lot of cool stuff  from there after work I wish they would have stayed longer
good,"I worked in receiving, so most of us were in and out before customers were ever in the store. We basically unpacked and put out all the shipment for the day to ensure people could see all our current stock. My coworkers were really nice and because we were in the back and away from customers, we were able to goof off more than the average team."
good,"The day would start out fast paced unloading pallets of merchandise and once on the floor it was sort of fast paced as well since there was a certain time limit you had to have shelves stocked and at least be off the floor before the store opened at 9 am, after I was off the floor id size shoes and clothes and run racks once finished. I didn't really learn much as it was a fairly simple job. The workplace was great, very cool and friendly employees as well as the managers, they were very understanding. The hardest part of the job was the morning since you had to move very quickly to get merchandise organized and out on the floor and I would say the most enjoyable part of the job in my opinion was sometimes trash duty and stocking merchandise after organizing and running racks."
good,Productive Busy day at work. What i learned different skills and new company rules. Workplace culture busy and working with other coworkers. The most enjoyable part of the job to assist and help customers.
good,"I felt like the job was good paying, very relaxed, everbody worked well as a team, comfortable environment, If i didn't have to relocate I wouldn't of even wanted to leave."
good,"Great benefits, good culture.  Location is key to work life balance.  High volume stores receive more payroll to complete task.  Low volume stores still have the same task, but with less personnel.  This forces management to have superior communication."
good,Burlington is a win now culture that is a great place to work! Like all retailers it has ups and downs.  Always a new experience when working for a discounted retailer.
good,"typical work day consisted of , stocking and merchandising . I learned how to properly merchandise and recover display areas. the hardest part of the job was getting off the floor before a certain time. the most enjoyable part was getting paid weekly and having 15% - 30% discounts. management just needed to learn how to communicate with co workers more ."
good,"Working at Burlington Stores I learned how to keep up in a fast passed environment, receiving and giving assistance to coworkers during high stress situations, as well as essential customer service skills."
good,"Good workplace, nice coworkers. The pay was decent and i worked about the same amount of hours per week. Some managers were good but others weren't the best"
good,I was a seasonal employee at Burlington. I found it enjoyable to work there. The employees were all friendly and willing to help on another. the management was great also.
good,A typical work day at Burlington was ensuring that the store was presented well and maintained for the customers.  Organizing associates to recover the store daily.
good,A typical work day at Burlington is fast pace and lots of interacting with the customers. Management is understanding when you need a day off. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the customers.
good,"This was a very fun job to work in during the holidays, it can be a bit overwhelming and stressful if you don't do well with fast-paced environments. I loved working here but the hours were never a set schedule or guaranteed."
good,"I enjoy a lot working there , the store has a very organized staff. The managers are very good and very friendly, people there are also very friendly."
good,team oriented environment. great place to work. management is always ready to help the employees to make independent decisions and shows confidence in their employees
good,The place Is Wonderful YounWant Be Standing still Getting Bored. there’s Always something To Do. The People That Work There Is Fun And Very Nice. If you Getbthe company You Aren’t Going To Want To Leave.
good,"This was a great summer job. Asa college student, I wasn't looking for anything full-time. This job is about 3 days a week if you're a fast-paced worker. In receiving, you have time limits for your activities, so your managers want people who are fast and organized. The schedule isn't pre-set. The routine kind of fell to a Tuesday, Thursday, Friday schedule, but it isn't permanent. Also, if you do markdowns, you could be working Sundays and Mondays. Training is kind of a learn as you go, but a new backroom manager was just hired and the training seems to have improved. All in all, I'd say that this was a pretty good place to work. While I did not enjoy waking up at 4:45 am, it was nice to be off by noonish and have the rent of the day to myself,"
good,I enjoyed my experience at Burlington Coat Factory it was a very hands on job that helped me gain some experience in other fields also it was a very comfortable setting even though things tend to get out of hand some times.
good,The staff are rude and they don't care to much about their employees there more about just satifiying customers and their bosses first timer retail experience and it was awful
good,A day at Burlington was quick and stressful. I learned how to do returns and exchanges. The new management at Burlington was very bad. The hardest part of the job was working the management and most supervisors.
good,Productive place to work an can be fun at times. They have heath care benefits an dental. It can be an fun place to work it’s slighty fast pace but all so relaxing.
good,"Since the first day at Burlington I felt a connection with everyone and there was absolutely no hesitation whenever I would ask for help. This is why I love Burlington. We not only treat each other like family, but every single customer who shops at our store. I appreciate the fact that this company took time to train me and teach me everything I need to know"
good,"This is a great job for any person starting out with work, recent high school graduate, or someone attending college. Disliked that the hours were inconsistent: I would work up to 30 hours during the holidays and during regular time of year it was as little as 12 hours per week. The amount of supervisors present during one shift was unnecessary because it caused confusion when one supervisor would ask you to do something and another supervisor would come and ask you to do a different task. Shifts were sometimes too long with only 30 minute break.  Standing up for pretty much whole shift is necessary."
good,Enjoyable work environment. Steady and consistent work schedule. The ability to have a home and work balance.

At Burlington Coat Factory Warehouse I learned how to time manage and become more organized, as well as gaining new skills. The staff at Burlington were very nice, humble and caring. One of the hardest parts at Burlington was learning how to time manage and be well organized. I enjoyed learning new skills and meeting new people."
good,"I had a lot of fun working at Burlington. As a cashier I was in charge of keeping the cash area clean for costumers. When we had slow days I could help people on the sales floor with their tasks. And whenever it was getting overwhelming help was always provided. When shifts were arranged the managers always kept in mind our availability, and based shifts off of that, which is greatly appreciated. Almost everyone I worked with was extremely friendly and ha a positive attitude. Breaks were also very reasonable. We usually worked 6 to 8 hours and had a break every 2 hours. The only reason I left was because the location where I was working at was 2 hours away from my home by public transport. And after a while I was getting 1 to 2 shifts a week. But I still find the overall experience very fun."

I was a customer service/sales representative/cashier. I assisted customers on the store floor, on the phone and up front. I learned more customer service experience, learned inventory, and helped customers enjoy their time they spent in the store.. I learned a few things about myself as well. I learned that I'm definitely a people person and that I will go above and beyond to satisfy them. Management was good, always helpful and there if you needed them. The workplace was enjoyable for the most part as far as my co workers and the overall environment. I'd say the hardest part of the job was when I was called to the Shoe department to help restore it. The customers made a complete mess of that poor department. Thank Lord we all worked as a team to get the job done!"

good,"Worked in Recieving and Markdowns. I had a great boss that I could talk to if I had an issue. The Management wasn't the best team, but it was a fun working environment. Everyone felt like family instead of coworkers."
good,At work as a QVQC i would regularly receive the pallets coming from the packer tables. Then I would log onto WMS to look for units to be able to print out the carton labels. I would then use the RF scanner and receive the boxes to see their destination. Lastly I would palletize the boxes so the material handlers would take it away for the forklift drivers. Here at Burlington i learned to be an independent and focused worker.

good,"Burlington is a good place to work for a college student. A place for someone who do not have children and live at home with parents. The pay is ok for someone in that bracket. Will deal the public a lot, Will not get many hours if you are part-time, some people do their part as a team player some will not, they are just there. Most hardest part of the job is not getting paid enough to do as much as the company wants you to."
good,Burlington could provide more hours and a better salary. The work environment was good and the job kept you busy. Working here you are busy from the time you clock in until the time you clock out. Overall i enjoyed working here.
good,"My day starts and typically ends in the stockroom. Depending on whether I am assigned to the stockroom or floor, my duties if in the stockroom will involve processing merchandise or running merchandise to the sales floor. In processing clothes, I have to make sure I hard tag merchandise that meets that pricing, place the correct size marker on the hanger, tag two-piece items and hang it on the correct rack. The size of the merchandise we have in a particular day determines where you are assigned. Some workers only process merchandise and only leave the stockroom to go home or take breaks. Others run home merchandise but do not run clothes merchandise on the salesfloor. Very few workers can work both in the stockroom and sales floor carrying out all duties of which I am one of them. Normally, My Supervisor starts me off with running merchandise to the sales floor which takes a special kind of intellect and then I might end up processing in the stockroom. "
good,"Good retail experience, fun place to work, best part working there was that as a Markdown Associate we had an early start, before store open and get more done.  "

good,"Burlington Coat Factory was a great to work. The most hardest part of the job was dealing with unhappy customers, but being able to fix the situations and putting a smile on the customer's face was the most enjoyable. I learned a lot when it came to customer service and cash handling. It is a great way to learn about customer service and how to talk to people."
good,I was only working here for a few months because I had a baby in June 2015. I enjoyed it while I was there. I loved when we were busy.

good,"I enjoy working at the new Burlington in Manchester Nh.The co-workers are kind and friendly. The store is clean, bright and beautiful.  I like interacting with the customers. Lay Away is a plus in this area."
good,Burlington Coat Factory was very interesting because it was a fast pace environment. I liked the fact that there was always something to do. I got a chance to operate the cash register and deal with all type of customers. Some where difficult while others made my day. Hardest Part of the job was cleaning up the mess at the end of the day. We called this recovery.
good,"A typical day at work consists of maintaining the cleanliness of the store and ensuring customer satisfaction. I learned how to properly ensure the quality of the customer's shopping experience and reinforced the importance of working as a team. The coworkers are all very friendly and helpful and so is the management. The only bad part about the job is management says there is room and opportunity for promotion, but when that time comes they are very reluctant to actually promote personnel and the pay increase can take months to actually be applied to your hourly wages."
good,"A typical day at work would involve clocking in, unloading incoming freight, processing clothes for floor readiness, and pulling pallets on and off the floor. I learned a lot about retail, considering the fact that this was my first retail job. The co-workers are funny, loving, and easy to talk to, but at the end of the day, everyone wants to get the job done."
good,everyone there is friendly and understanding. Great customer service in every department. Clean and neat . I think what i liked the most was my co-workers they were genuinely nice people
good,"Burlington Coat Factory is on the rise of being something amazing. I worked at the Taylor location, and can only speak on this location alone. I enjoyed my time working there, and was satisfied with management."
good,"Store Manager  is the best boss anyone could have he is funny, sweet and understanding but he can always get the job at hand done. You get treated as if you are family with some of the co-workers. As an associate at Burlington I learned that in order to promote yourself at Burlington you must work there for many years."
good,"My time at Burlington was very eye opening because of the different types of cultures that that were apart of a normal work day, always interesting because of this I learned something new about the Latino, Haitian, and Jamaican cultures. my co-workers were very humble and forward at work they were never afraid to be direct we never really had any problems when it came to team work or things of the sort. the hardest part of work was the lunch transition times because everyone wanted to take a brake right away even if it meant the floor would be empty. the most enjoyable part would be working in receiving because fellow co workers made the time go by fast with their sense of humor."
good,This position was my very first one and was mostly standard to a cashier job. The main difference in this job and other cashier jobs is that we had to deal with layaways and returns along with other front end responsibilities. The employees and employers did not change much from when I was promoted to the cash office position except for a little more respect. The customers were very rude much of the time which was the hardest thing I had to deal with in this position.
good,"A typical day at work , it'll be very busy , energetic .. steady pace.. greeting and helping customers. My co-workers were very respectable and well mannered towards others. The schedule was flexible. The hardest part of the job was trying not to actually want to shop for yourself. The most enjoyable part of the job was coming in every day with intentions of pleasing the customers."
good,"This company make it hard for you to advance but wants you to work several jobs with one base pay. No manger likes to take charge and gossip way to much with co workers. A regular day at work for me starts with getting the boxes open and sorting all the products and clothes. Once that's done we begin to hit the sales floor and put things away, head back to the receiving area and start the process for the clothes to be tagged and censored. Its the same job everyday and you have to work twice as hard because we are short staffed. The hardest thing to do is complete all the tasks with so little people who don't always work hard ,I enjoy my co workers and shopping there for my clothes."
good,"Typical day at work would include me meeting and assisting many different people in a short amount of time. As far as work duties, I mainly helped with store presentation and anything one of the co-workers or managers would ask me to do. I learned how to interact with different people and got my first experiences with customer service. For the most part all of my co-workers were nice and respectful but my job didn't require me to be involved with more than two of them regularly. The hardest part of the job was standing up on my feet for long hours and constantly being on the move. This was nothing I did not adjust to quickly though. The most enjoyable part of the job had be the constant interaction."
good,"a typical day at work would take clothing from fitting room, sort them and hang them in the proper order, occasionally i am back-up for cashiering. i learned how to do cashiering. management was awesome and so were co-workers. i did not feel the job was hard at all. the most enjoyable part was being able to meet many new people."
good,Stock merchandise and assisting customers with what they are looking for in each department
good,"A typical day at work would be going with a state of mind that no matter how difficult it was to get out freight with no payroll which meant no personnel, we were going to succeed, and finish our goal for the day.  I learned how to speak to personnel to get them motivated and work harder to accomplish our goal.  Tried to get management involved so they would know where we would be at the end of day.  My co-workers worked hard and tried their best all the time.  The hardest part of the job was staying focused and managed the entire group to keep focus as well to finish our goal.  The most enjoyable part of the day was the end of the day when I saw everything that was accomplished."
good,Allows you to leave your work at work and have a good work home balance
good,"We check the fitting room to make sure it is clean, We then sort out clothes and put them where they belong. Also we recover every hour. What I have learned was to read price tickets and help customers. Management is good they try their hardest to make sure everything runs fast and efficient. My co-workers were very friendly and helpful. The hardest part of my job would have to be maintaining my area and the fitting room and making sure the customers were happy. The most enjoyable part of the job was coming into work everyday and greeting customers."
good,"Work day could be slow if your don't stay busy "
good,"a day at work, come in set up schedule for my team of 8 girls, have our meeting and off to work. I learned alot and they have gave me the chance to show my leading skills by becoming the QA Lead. Management is good, they were helpful, nice, and kept us updated with any new information. My co-workers are great, 8 ladies that work well together, helped eachother out, repectful, and great workers always on task busy doing their work. Hardest part about my job was giving out Error forms when someone did something wrong that was causing a problem. The most enjoyable part of my job was my team and always staying busy."
good,We process freight. Then make sure it is put in its proper place. After that is done we go out to the floor to put out the merchandise and ticket anything that needs to be ticketed. When we are done we make sure our area is cleaned and take all trash to the back along with the pallet. But I have learned a lot while working there and also gaining the experience in warehousing. The management is good they try there hardest to make everything run as quickly and efficient as possible. Co-workers are great to work with once you get to know them. And the hardest part of the job I would have to say is a mix of everything depending on how much stuff needs to be processed. And the most enjoyable part is that we all get along and work together as a team.
good,My coworkers are generous and caring people who always take the extra time to make sure things are done correct. Burlington has an open door policy which is to be kept confidential and the managers strictly abide by that rule. This is very important to me that management follows the rules and proves themselves to be trustworthy just as the rest of my coworkers are. I have learned a lot on the job here. I have learned how to look up the inventory and evaluate which items need to be marked down. I am currently being cross trained as a cashier after only a month of working there.
good,Each day I put out all new merchandise on to the sales floor. I learned how to become more organized and how to stage the sales floor to sale items faster. I loved the management there. They were all so understanding and laid back. My co workers were the same. The hardest part of the job was always being needed in more then one place at a time. What I enjoyed most was getting to see all the new stuff coming out before anyone else.
good,"It was a good entry level job. Learned alot, had a good time. No complaints."
good,"Hardest part of the job is keeping everything clean, neat, and organized after a very busy day."
good,"The customers are messy, and the employers expect too much. Example, they will place one employee for an entire department, expect customer service to be performed while stocking new merchandise, and cleaning up after customer, and reorganizing racks. All with a smile while they constantly call you up for a price check or assistance in the cashier section. "
good,"Burlington Coat Factory is a great company to start out with if you're looking on making a career with some kind of retail company. "
good,"A typical day would start off at the registers, helping customers during their checkout process. Toward the end of the shift I would move to the audit room to process daily cash transactions, and prepare nightly audit activities. The main learning aspect of this job is how to properly use time management in order to finish all required projects for the day. Management and co-workers all have a close knit relationship, and are quick to help out a fellow co-worker in a time of need. The hardest part about the job was having to quickly switch between audit work and cashiering on a regular basis, as well as the necessity of working late nights. The most enjoyable parts of the job are the closeness that all of the co-workers show to each other, and also the fast paced environment kept you alert through out the shift."
good,"a day at work included unloading and scanning cartons of merchandise.then processing the merchandise,pricing and entering the information in the computer.5 employees were part of my receiving team that helped with truck and pricing"
good,"On a typical day when you come to your shift you greet your co workers, management team then your manager will tell you what register you assigned, count your draw, & maintaining the cash wrap. throughout our entire shift you make sure customers are treated with number one priority as all times. When closing you finish counting your draw at the cash office then when coming back to the floor making the store is neat for the following day. Management & coworkers are great they treated with respect & dignity making sure customers are the number one priority. The hardest part at times when there only three cashiers available & the long lines are increasing but maintaing your composure & making sure they are being rung as quickly as possible."
good,"Always different"
good,"A typical day was getting everything out the fitting rooms. I would then looking at the tags to organize on one big rack with the juniors clothing, another for ladies, night ware, and active clothes. Once the racks were full we would return the items back to its original place. We would also get the clothes that were left throughout the day in the front basket and organize as well; It would be a repeat process. At the end of the night we would recover meaning pick up all the clothes from the floor and fix the racks. So it would be ready for the next day. There were days i was schedule to operate the cash register or when ever it got busy. I learned how to do return and exchanges."
good,Nice company to work for especially if your a people person.

I learned how to put other people before my needs in the time of their needs. The management was very strict but understanding at the same time. They will help you but won't hold your hand the whole way. The want you to achieve your own goals. The hardest part about working at Burlington was dealing with the rude customers. They have there moments. But, the  most enjoyable part about working there was knowing the staff had your back in any situation."
good,"Unload trucks, a lot of heavy lifting, management makes sure to keep a safe and productive work environment. Co-Workers are very job friendly. Hardest part of the job is trying to speed up the pace of productivity with half a crew of workers."
good,"I hardest part of the job would be the hours, but coworkers were great."
good,"A typical day at work for me is to come in and straighten the area that I work in (accessories). I then go and see what merchandise needs to be put out on the floor from the truck. I unload boxes onto proper equipment and then take the merchandise out to the floor and arrange it so that it is appropriate and do so in a timely manner. I help in other areas where needed when needed, such as cashiering or in another department when asked. I have learned that I have many abilities in the sales industry. The management team is pretty easy going and easy to talk to if you have a situation at work or at home that needs attention. They also work well with me on my Fibromyalgia. My co-workers are up beat, with a sense of pride about who they are. The hardest part of my job is understanding the different cultures and there ways of doing things. My most enjoyable part of the job is helping a customer one on one."

good,i liked working for the company but it needed more help for the people that we handled we did not have enough workers to assist the customers.
good,"At Burlington Coat Factory I am categorized as a Merchandise Team Associate. I work at 6:00 am putting new merchandise onto the floor before the store opens at 9:30am. Once the store is open, I greet every customer with a smile, and make sure that they are finding everything ok. I also have register knowledge, checking customers out and making sure they leave the doors satisfied and will come back to shop again."
good,the co-workers treated each other like family. Willing to help you in your department if needed and give you new tools to help improve your job skills everyday. You would start your day off greeting customers. You may have markdowns in your area or new merchandise to put on sales floor. The hardest part is when you run out of space in the back warehouse. It can be difficult at times. The management staff was great and always ask for our ideas to improve the store. I like to do markdowns and see the customers come shop the racks a little more.
good,"Work consisted of a regular routine. It'd be rare to have done something different. I was usually on the floor making sure things were organized, clean, and where they were suppose to be. I also help put new merchandise out. At times I was told to go to the basement and just help throw out boxes if no one was available."
good,A typical day at Burlington is intresting there is always alot to get to get done. An being a full time you have to maake sure everything in the department is corectly done. Making sure your keeping up with with merchandise and helping out cutomers. Stocking up the store with the new product we get in.

A service with a smile, and the customer is right about whatever need or concern they bring. The management team try to help the team focus on customer need, challenging to get better way to services.

good,I would so work back at Burlington the pay should be raised but other than that I never had a problem with this job I love getting to see all the new merchandise and the managers were also nice and let you work overtime if you wanted this is probably one of the only jobs id ever consider returning to
good,I really enjoy working at the Burlington store. very energetic environment. the team and management are always in good moods and make working their an enjoyable experience.
good,"They will respect as a person and will do the best they can to work around your schedule, but they don’t guarantee your hours. Unless you work as a cashier or in the front but receiving they let you go early almost everyday"
good,Good Good place to work great associates nice customers nice environment fun to work there co workers make it fun to work there also co workers are willing to help
good,"Some people look at jobs like ""I hate this job"" but once you realize it's not the company, it's the people, you'll progress beautifully. Enjoy. ............"
good,I miss working with the night shift in the Bergan Towne Center .  Pay was weekly and customers appreciated great customer service . My managers always were nice and fair .
good,"A good company to work for; the office was renovated a few years ago, and it's modern and convenient.  I very much love all charity work that Burlington participates at.  That means a lot."
good,It was a rocky start but as I got better at the job my work load became a lot to handle. I'm glad I had great team members who'd look out for me. They don't watch every thing you do. I was part time so I didn't get the many benefit they offer. The pay was decent and my hours were good.
good,I love it here. only get $9.50 for seasonal work... but it is enough to call it “fair pay” they are very fast paced but its good. it keeps you busy all day so time doesnt go slower when you are bored
good,"Being a cashier, there are many more responsibilities.  We do returns, layaways, cashier, account payment credit card apps. You need to clean a clear your station during your shift for the best customer service possible."
good,Working the graveyard shift with Burlington was a fast-paced environment. Sometimes jokes was made but most of the time work was being done for the next shift in the morning.The most enjoyable part of the job was tagging the clothing.i learned how to pace my time on the job.
good,"It’s hard work and overtime always given. Start as temporary than u can get hired on. Pay is average wage . They treat workers good though, check on u, give u meals or snacks, water."
good,"It is a good starting job, however the opportunities to advance are limited. Most of the time, they hire outside the company for higher positions. Usually the highest you can get in one store is a key holder. Otherwise, it is a good job to learn customer service and I have enjoyed working here while in college."
good,It’s good for a first job if you are looking for a first job. It’s chill and laid back. If you want more hours they’ll give you more hours. The pay is standard.
good,"Great place to work and shop. Its just too hot in there, corporate always say that they are working on it but its still hot. Great place to work. Great place to work.yess yesss yess"
good,The job was very difficult at first but once I got the hang of it it was very easy... most of the employees were very nice and always tried to help when needed.
good,The air conditioner didn't work so it very hot but it wasn't really a fast pace job. Everything was very unorganized and it was too much. the store also had an odor.
good,"Most , if not all the managers I have worked with are all gone.  In regards to shoplifters, we had incidents almost on a daily basis.  Staff judged us by how many shoplifters each LP Agent caught.  The more you caught, the more respect.  Management was very supportive and showed their appreciation  by offering advancement. Again, this was during my time.  The hardest part of the job was the turnover in LP Agents.  Some had some type of security experience but had no apprehension skills.  At times it got physical and this is what seperated the ""men from the boys."" (we did have female Agents that did outstanding jobs.)"
good,I loved working at Burlington. I was really sad I had to leave for a personal reason. its a great starter job. the staff are very friendly. the manager is so nice I loved her.
good,Typical day at work keeping The store clean .. I learned how to do layaways returns and be very patient with the customers.. Most of the managers were lazy and not putting effort into the Job..The workplace culture was mixed ...The hardest part if the Job was keeping the store clean... The easiest part was showing up for work and doing your Job
good,Burlington was a cool place but wasn’t a very good environment many because of the people it was impossible to keep to ur self and get the job done because people always played around but other than that the pay was amazing and the job was easy
good,Overall was an productive environment to work .  Opportunity to work on ones communication skills as you are to greet customers as they enter the building.
good,"Every morning as a team we would break down the pallets of inventory and sort it into the main departments. We would then process, ticket, and flow the merchandise to the floor to ensure that the store shelves were fully stocked and the backroom remained cleaned."
good,"The hours here are VERY flexible and the management works well. I would recommend this position for those seeking out part-time employment. Although there are full-time positions available, they are very hard to come by and at my location, it could take two years to work your way up to them. The work pace changes based on the time and/or day you work. It can be very busy or very dead. The employees are friendly and the customer is typically nice."
good,Pretty fast paced and gets crowded from time to time but the job is very easy and simple and the coworkers and management were awesome. The pay was okay
good,Burlington was an enjoyable place to work. Management team was pleasant worked with you if you needed time off. I learned that I do have a take charge personality and Management helped me see this.
good,Hiring was immediate. Flexible work schedule. Employee discounts. Bad security issues. Theft was daily problem. The security teams caught the thieves but let them go.
good,This is a job for people please rs.  Being helpful is second nature for these workers.  Informing customers of what's in the big store and where to find the products in the department.  Multitasks would be the second most important skill working for Burlington.
good,Management can be better. They work with you in everything tho the hours aren’t enough. Store manager can sometimes take things out on you trying to have you feel guilty. Loved it in the beginning but now it’s just favoritism all around. They expect you know the new things they’ve changed while you been gone even though they only schedule you twice a week. You basically have to ask what’s changed instead of them informing you.
good,Burlington is always super messy which is hard to keep up with. You really couldn’t go home until your entire department was clean so if u finished at midnight you leave at midnight and if you finished later then so on. Super fast paced and always busy but the amount of work didn’t add up for the pay.
good,"It was a well rained organization, the pay in particular was not as nearly as much as the work that was given to all employees. Although the pay was not as appealable, they did have a very great business approach in bringing in more sales."
good,"Burlington Coat Factory was one of the best places I have worked for, allowing me to prove myself to become an effective leader. IT had a family type atmosphere and I truly enjoyed the people I worked with and for."
good,When I first started that was the best job ever It was so fun and everyone was so nice and always willing to help. I have been there 3 years now and it has totally changed. Our new store manager makes us feel like we have to compete for hours. I still love working there but I want more hours and I would like a different environment.
good,"The management was great, but the other employees seemed to make you feel as if your not wanted in the environment. Great pay and hours. I would work there again."
good,"Working at Burlington Coat factory was very much a fun, fast paced, job, that I did really enjoy and like working for, but was only a seasonal position for me. A day a Burlington was always very busy being that I was employed around the Holiday's so we were extremely busy. I also really liked working with the co workers there because everyone was so nice, friendly and very helpful. I enjoyed most was learning new things and getting to know more of the employees better there. The least and hardest past for me was when I closed night shifts and had to stay so late that night to clean up the store. I was just soo tired by the end of the night. I did close every weekend though and got the job done, but its was defintly the hardest for me. Overall working here was extremely fun and I would defintly consider being rehired sometime and defintly recommend Burlington to a friend or family member whose looking for a Customer service position."
good,"My experience at Burlington has been a very good one, I was openly welcomed and quickly made connections with my fellow coworkers who seemed happy enough to have me along. My supervisor is also a big reason why I enjoy the environment because as you know a supervisor/manager can make or break the job for others"
good,"Great place to work. Lots of teamwork and great morale. Opportunity for advancing. Money is decent depending on the cost of living. Rec manager is the greatest,  love the nob."
good,great place to work to start off with. hours will be gained if you work for it and the team is easy going. staff is cooperative and will help when you ask for it.
good,"I do like to work at Burlington, It is a very good place for someone to start their first job to get a feel on how real live customers are in the retail industry. There are a lot of ups and downs, but overall a good place to work ."
good,"not to much to say about Burlington, it has its flaws that I was not completely ok with. overall the work place and employees are wonderful. management great."
good,Very high stress job but that is what also made it enjoyable. We had fixed times and a fixed amount of production we had to get done everyday so it really instilled time management in me
good,It was a comfortable work environment but very fast-paced. It was very collaborative which I enjoyed. And the management was highly respectful and appreciative of my services. I have no regrets working here.
good,"the job was ok, very different than any thing I have ever done.  I love working with customers and got none of that, and never knew when we were going work far in advance only a few days away from the day you would work"
good,"It's the same repeating tasks every day, you get there at 5:45 in the morning, and don't leave sometimes until 3. You do get breaks, and there is good food around."
good,It was a challenge sometimes because I had to manage more than the ladies department but it was an experience I wouldn't trade at all. I enjoyed my coworkers and I loved setting my floorplans and having my department look fabulous. Its great if you seek the department store thrill.
good,"-Burlington is a quick faced paced enviroment. There are constant changes both on a store level and strategy. Within each season, there could be as much as 5 floor moves. The floor inventory changes from week to week, so the ability to adapt is key."
good,Overall it wasn't a terrible place to work but the inconsistency of hours was a real problem. Also the turnover rate sometimes made it difficult to get the job done quickly because you constantly had to be training new employees. The managers were amazing except one who seemed to never be on the same page as the rest of them.
good,A typical work day at Burlington is going in  to scan delivered truck from the day before. Then we begin to process freight for each department to be taken to sales floor. Then it is stocked to be sold. Sometimes I may help with markdowns. But for most days that is it.
good,Working at Burlington Coat Factory gives me different experience of handling cash register. We go to help other departments to move and handle merchandise when not busy which provide a good environment to work. Team work and help each other would improve efficiency.
good,"I had a wonderful team working for me in my department. All other department managers we very easy to work with. Linens department  at that location was the districts location with the big boss. I had to be on top of the game to run that location. great place, I would recommend to anyone."
good,At Burlington its a nice place to work when your're young and active.... the managers work around your school schedules and if you have another job your not penalized they will always work with you.
good,I enjoyed working here and the pay was okay. The work was not too hard. This is a great part time job for those looking for extra money. This job pays every week instead of biweekly.
good,"Working as a Markdown Associate is pretty simple and easy. I enjoy the ability to go in early and leave early. However, know beforehand the hours are lousy, even with helping other departments occasionally you will hardly get more than 20-25 hours a week. I personally enjoy this aspect as someone who is going to college and works a second online job."
good,There is a positive work environment.  My ideas and opinion matter and is sought after by my management team.  Collaboration and team work are encouraged.
good,"The job was fun, Lot of Work to do but got it done super fast!"
good,like any other retail store tj maxx ross its good for college students who need work hours that are flexible. my experiences with management there are always willing to alternate shifts
good,"This place is a good place to work at, always busy, if you enjoy being at fast pace this is the job for you. breaks were the best, coworkers are like family."
good,Burlington is very flexible with student schedules and are considerate about exam dates as well as provide enough hours in the day to work part-time shifts.
good,"It was busy every now and then, but overall very casual and relaxed since your coworkers become some of your best friends. Management was a little rough, but they understood if you had something urgent to do or if you were sick."
good,"My daily task was different every day I learned how to do inventory, customer service skills, stocking, management was good there and very fair, the workplace was busy and slow at times however, the workload was the same, I liked working in a diverse group of people, the hardest part I don't have one the most enjoyable was I was able to be trained in doing everything."
good,"management team can work with your availability. Not a very hard job. A lot of employee shops at their own store, and a lot of savings. overall pretty good."
good,"Nice place to work. Depending on the rate of sales. Sales drives all. Do not depend on hours being there if you need a certain income. These are dictated by corporate office and cannot be changed.  If you are hourly, you are subject to extreme cuts in off season. Salaried employees make up the difference in hours by working extreme shifts. Do not expect home time during seasonal sales periods. "
good,"A typical day is normally at a steady pace, it has its highs and lows. When the store becomes extremely busy, the teamwork is impeccable. Developing a relationship with the managers and your coworkers comes naturally. I believe they try to schedule you accordingly, however, nothing is promised. Being employed at Burlington is a joy, but if you're going to be part-time, I would not consider it as a long-term job."
good,"I enjoyed working in this company. Managers were great and fun to be around, and always helping customers would bring joy into my day of working at burlington."
good,"A,nice company to work for flexible hours and good management team to work for overall good company I like my time there flexible with time frame, they work with you with any problems you  have and a commented with you"
good,Good place to work a little stressful fast paced place friendly and hard working employees I would  recommend anyone to work there wouldn’t mind working there again.
good,A day at work includes walking the floor acting like a shopper to detect and apprehend shoplifters when necessary. Conduct audits and detect any employee theft.
good,"Its a good parttime and fulltime for some people, they do under pay for minimum wage I think they need to go up a few more dollars there an better benfits for the employees"
good,"Just your ""average joe"" retail place, nothing special of note. It is a good place to build retail experience because you can be asked to do many things that might take you out of your job description but an overall okay place to work."
good,Fast Paced work environment. Cool coworkers and great management. Good job while going to school. Theft prevention requires the ability to read people and create innovative ways to keep merchandise from being stolen.
good,Its better then my last job at the 99 cents store but as always retail is retail.. When one person doesn't do their job it falls on the rest...But hey it could be worse...
good,I loved working at Burlington. If I didnt have to move I would probably still be working there. Everyone from district to store manager to dept managers were great to work for.
good,"I was not at this position for long, I was 7 month pregnant when they hired me and ended up being put on bedrest after less than a month with the company so I had to resign from the position.  I think that it says a lot for the management of the company that they did not discriminate against me and decide not to call me back after seeing that I was very pregnant at the interview."
good,Good team work team members help others manners are always on top of the team make sure the tasks are getting done. Great job greeting customers security is always on point.
good,"While employed here I was a High school student averaging on 20-30 hours a week to support my family. The hours were strenuous especially during holidays, as expected, and difficult to manage. For me I was at an impasse and could not request less hours due to the financial situation at home, but my managers at my store location were thoughtful and expressed care for their employees. Management was flexible and adjusted schedules if need be. Holidays can be insane especially around Christmas time when the line would stretch from queuing all the way past the fitting room which entailed extra hours in the am to make sure the sales floor was clean and the returns had been cycled through."
good,i love the people we work with and all the new people i got  to see. justl need a better paying job for my husband to finish school. im sorry i needd to leave.
good,A typical day at work on the weekends is busy but on the weekdays its calm and have a nice flow. I leaned that Burlington really has nice stuff. Management is cool. Workplace culture is cool. The hardest part is trying to keep an area clean because customers are there all day messing stuff up. The most enjoyable part of working there is seeing how happy the customers are about the low prices.
good,"I learned a lot of valuable training and work with great and fun people."
good,Working at Burlington coat factory was fun fast pace productive in nice sweet people but sometimes busy I live everything about Burlington working in groups helping people find what they need most of all the great mangers
good,The work life balance is very manageable but you must put the work.  The biggest hurdle was getting the right people in the right place.  Good company.
good,"A typical work day was fast paced, it had its slow moments. The hardest part of the job was working the telephone. I always enjoyed pleasing the customers. But the pay wasn't quite my satisfaction."
good,"I worked there for a year.  I loves how busy it was, and they understood if I had a doctors appointment. Or if I had teachers conferences. I'm actually trying to get my job back. Great weekly pay"
good,"i loved working here. Everyone is so nice, its so easy making friends with the staff. The store i worked in would get very busy sometimes, it could be a hassle but everyone helped each other get through the day."
good,"A typical day at work includes organizing the stock that we receive and placing them in order. The management is excellent, very friendly and enjoyable."
good,"* I spent my time receiving and organizing stock, and putting it out on the sales floor. If a customer asked for help, I would do so."
good,"A typical day at work, was keeping sales floor organized. Kept the coats in the right place. Help manager with special orders and counts. I learned to do indept searches for merchandise. Learned how to work alongside loss prevention officers. Management was helpfull. Sales driven environment. Hardest part of the job was winter time, recovering at the end of the day. Most enjoyable part fo the job was working with great people and helping customers."
good,"The management is very strong, but it can be easy to get stuck in on spot and not advance which can make it challenging to progress.It is a great place to jump start your career and everyone is willing to help you get to the next level but it depends on your management team."
good,"It's retail.  Do your job, take advantage of the discount to build your wardrobe for maybe a future job.  People come from all walks of life.  You have determine what YOU want in life and WHY you are there for the job. Stay focused!!"
good,"Many days consist of helping customers with their purchases and putting up baby depot models."
good,"I rather enjoyed my time at Burlington stores, however my employee problems werent an obligation to management. That is why i resigned. I would work here again ."
good,"It wasnt a bad job, all i did was run a cashier, i learned how to ring things up, i learned how to deal with rude customers. The hardest part of my job was standing on my feet all day. the most enjoyable part was my coworkers"
good,I been working here for 8months its a good start off job i woukd say if your gonna work here its a good opportunity of growth really frienly staff always helpful.
good,Nice managers and understanding. The boss will work with you and let you off if you are not feeling good.  The customers are very easy going and nice.
good,"I really enjoyed working with the management team and staff. Promotion is available within the store. The downside of working there is a lot of work for minimum  wage, which at the time $7.25 an hour."
good,"7.5 Hrs working,cleaning,merchandising."
good,It's a nice experience working at Burlington coat factory and not just working but productive with more working hours and loving environment.
good,"Unless you're hired permanently, expect your hours to be greatly decreased after the holidays which is the same as any other retail store."
good,A day at Burlington with the job that I have can be a day or never going to know what going to happen which can be shocking or excited. The hardest part of the job is that you might have to deal with a very irate customer or associate sometimes. The management team work very well with their associates. I really enjoy helping the customers in the store and learning more about my job everyday.
good,They are flexible and do work with your existing schedule as far as hours. The staff is very friendly n professional. They do cross-train in other areas as needed. I enjoyed being a part of the team overall.
good,"A wonderful and lovely place to work. Convenient and nice. Co-workers pretty cool, teamwork always. My managers are awesome. "
good,"There are many different aspects to my job, in that sense there is good, bad, and a lot of in between. In my position i have to handle many situations from when to give a discount, to making sure the registers all have the right amount of money. I get the chance to work with people of many different backgrounds. Some positive points of my job are getting to know my cashiers, and helping and encouraging them to be the best they can be. Some less enjoyable parts of my job are when we are understaffed and customers become angry. However, those instances are great learning opportunities for me to grow as a supervisor."
good,"the full timers that work here are not worth keeping "
good,"As a Receiving Associate, there is a common thread of respect and understanding to work as a team in the receiving department of a clothing retail employer."
good,"A typical at work is always fun and entertaining. I'v learned so many things from how to make tickets to something so simple as to debt things out; Management here is very friendly but very frem, my co-workers are always there to lend a hand for customers and each other. The hardest part of the job would be the constant change of departments its one week something but next week it's something else but it's always manageable.The most joy I have at my job would be the part where when I am unable to help a customer there's always a chance i can help another."
good,"This Burlington is new to the university area in Charlotte, So I basically helped putting everything in it, it was a great experience and everybody that works there from managers and associates are very nice to work with."
good,I have had the opportunity to be promoted in each department I have been in. My managers have been very supportive of me moving departments to advance. My most recent position has allowed me to learn a lot about Supply Chain and apply my past experiences. I love being a supervisor in my department and helping the people on my team advance in their positions.
good,"After I clock in, I find a supervisor that'll put me on a register or switch out with someone going on break. During free time we cleaned and organized our registers, restocking the front end, and sorting through returned merchandise. As a supervisor I'd open and close the store, counted the registers and made the deposits at the end of the night."
good,I enjoy working at Burlington because of my co-workers. We all help each other in hard situations. I clean my department as well as provide great customer service and recommendations.
good,I loved it at Burlington. I learned a lot there and management was great. The work place was fun. The hours were good and the breaks were good. The only reason I stopped working there was an issue with my transportation after a flood had damaged it.
good,"Contributed to the success of the organization, while learning new abilities. Used my skills in an environment and benefit to the organization from employee services to networking relations"
good,"I enjoyed the staff & my employees. I also Loved seeing the different items coming in the store for people to enjoy, but I was layed off during the recession, which put me in a financial situation that had me struggling for a while, but I was able to find a job later & continue my success!!"
good,typical day as usually . walk in and clock in and start to work. and Ive learned as obtaining good customer service being a cashier under pressure. management is alright sometimes when we need help supervisor has to help alot of employees for price tag and stuff which others has to wait. co-workers are awesome because good communication skills and team work. hardest part of the job is closing the place and returning all item back to its place but the enjoyable part is communicating with customers making fun jokes .
good,Very nice employees who work together in order to have a productive workplace. Start time was 4am but everyone was very upbeat by then. Unloaded trailer which was hard work but environment was great.
good,"Burlington Coat Factory is the perfect place to enhance your working experience profile. Being a cashier taught me how to comfortably engage with customers and associates. Then after when I was moved to the selling floor, I learned how to be a team player with my amazing co-workers that strive to keep our work place flowing smoothly. Having to be responsible for expensive merchandise and making sells is possibly the most enjoyable part of my job. Along with making merchandise moves within the department whether its with a team and/or independently."
good,sometimes fast paced but enjoyable. Management varies from day to day some of the managers are impossible. Great organization. Friendly co workers and some customers come in and really make your day.
good,"Sometimes it was very slow but of course during holidays can become very fast paced which i like personally, management was fair, i met alot of regulars and coworkers were nice, really nothing hard about this job at all."
good,"I love working for this company, but I don't like not having steady hours. The people who work there a very friendly and work as a unit to get any task done."
good,"usually start off with management and see what needs to be done . then move to my area and do my duties , the store is always busy and we always came together as a team to help pick up where need be , co workers are nice , management haves there days like everyone else , most people think they don't appreciate us . best part is working as a team ."
good,Good fun to work with some nice people. However most were not. Too much gossip and arguments. Had to witness arguments and witness many major incidents.
good,The days at work were very calm everyone made every co worker feel welcomed. The hiring process was a bit of a process compared to other jobs i have got hired on. You definitely have to be flexible even if you set a schedule. The hardest thing was making sure i get a lot of hours after the first week
good,I liked working there in customer service and I do love the retail industry. I just had personal issues at that time and could not hold a job.
good,"Burlington was very easy going, fast pace and has lots of varities of things you can while working. Burlington give room for growth and also team work play a big part in the company."
good,"good place to work.  A good balance.  If you get a good merchandising team and manager, this is a great place to be.  Sometimes its just luck of the draw though."
good,You're never finding something to do. It's always busy. You learn everything from cash handling to lay-away checkouts. The management is awesome. Never a dull moment. Co-workers are co-workers. They can be fun or they can be annoying. The hardest part of the job is knowing the full functions of checking a customer out. Satisfying customers is always the best part of the job.
good,"Wonderful place to work, staff and management are friendly and supportive. Customer service is of the greatest priority and always comes first. The best part of the job was working with and learning from my coworkers daily."
good,"I would always walk into the store with a smile on my face, I had the best managers, and amazing co workers. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work on group projects, it made the job easier and fun."
good,Its a great place to work to balance school and work life. Hours are flexible and management is fun to work with. Everyone is a team player.
good,"Opening the store, monitoring the merchandise from dock to floor."
good,"Fast paced environment with excellent employees. Management needs work, we never have enough coverage and the receiving area is a mess. The workers themselves always work hard and are really friendly people. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you are able to work alongside."
good,Fun and diverse workplace that allows those with a passion for fashion to bloom. this company showed true training in working together to complete tasks. the most important part of working here was working in conjuction with Co-workers and Superiors.
good,"load and unload trucks, go through shipments to assure every item the store orders is correct. Use computer to look up inventory and make labels for packaging"
good,"Daily there were multiple tasks to complete. In addition to assisting customers with point of sales transactions, employees are responsible for personal projects or tasks. Although my position was seasonal, the most enjoyable part of working for Burlington Coat Factory was helping customers in any way that I could."
good,"This is a nice job for students. A typical day would vary, you never know what is going to happen walking through the doors. I learned even a customer who's very angry at the product, can change the overall thought of the store when dealing with the right associate. The managers are very engaging, Most are on the floor doing the same job as their associates. Most of my co-workers were fun and easy to get a long with, never a dull moment. The hardest part of this job is dealing with the fact that I would remain part-time, working full-time hours. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing what comes out before anyone else."
good,Clock in then examine work are clean if needed. Greet customers when they enter. Ring up customers and bag items. Work layaway dept. where you organize all layaway items.
good,"Typical day at work is just helping customers with any questions or concerns they may have. Making sure that my department is clean and recovered with nothing on the floors. Sometimes my manager will have me build cribs, dressers, shelves or even take some of the discontinued ones apart. I have learned a lot about retail and merchandising from my immediate manager, this is also my first retail job. The management is alright, with so many employees I imagine it is hard to take care of everyone when it comes to hours. The coworkers I work with are very nice, most of them were the ones who were teaching me how to do stuff when I first started. The hardest part of the job for me is when it gets really slow, customers are not flowing as much, I personally like to keep busy and be running around. Being able to put a smile on a customers face is what I find to be most enjoyable at Burlington."
good,"Mens Dept Associate job was stock the racks with new inventory, price and organize the store. Keep the mens area nice and clean for shoppers."
good,"I will always be grateful to the managers at Burlington Coat Factory for hiring the under 18 year old me with no prior job experience. As a customer service cashier my duties revolved around making sure the customers were happy and kept coming back. That meant making transactions, bagging, cleaning up the store, answering customer questions, and most importantly do all the above with a smile on my face and cheer in my voice. The best part of that job would have to be interacting with and helping customers and getting to know and love the employees. The worst part of the job was dealing with customers who tried to steal (which was rare but did happen)."
good,"During a typical day, I would check the employee roster and make sure that employees had reported for work.  If not, I would begin to call other employees to see whether they could take an extra shift."
good,"Personally, i enjoyed about everything while i worked at Burlington. I always had something to do, my former co-workers were fun an helpful to be around. Management was fairly understanding and patient which i very much appreciate. At first, i admit that there were things i had to learn to use and do quickly, but thankfully i was able to do so with the help and patience of co-workers and management. I would say that the most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that i was in a healthy and fun yet responsible work place. Unfortunately, the reason for why i left was because of interference of my academic schedule which created situations where i had to make ""call-outs"". But, i would definitely recommend Burlington Coat Factory as a great work environment to anyone who is willing to learn what the company is all about."
good,"This job is a great way to enter the work force community. The people that work there are great, and they work hard to work with you. It teaches you a lot on how to be in the work force."
good,I have worked there for 5 years and have made great friends(coworkers and customers). This place teaches you a lot about customer service and how to relate to customers. The hardest part of the job is relying on self control when it comes to purchasing merchandise because it is very affordable. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with my coworkers!!! I've made a few lifelong friends :)
good,"My typical day as a cashier is carries an upbeat personality to assist customers. I handle money as a trustworthy employee. I contributed as a team member to keep the store outstanding."
good,Working here had its fun moments but the managers at times can treat you as if you are so much below them.
good,"Typically I would start out at a register, answering calls and directing people to their desired destination. I learned valuable communication and group working skills. My co-workers were engaging, the hardest part of my job was dealing with the mass amount customers during rush hours without backup."
good,"A typical day at work was unloading the truck and breaking about 26 pallets of boxes filled with different merchandise. Clothes, shoes, toys, kitchenware, etc. I learned to always push through the aches and pains. My management team was okay. Most of them were fair and responsible. My co-workers were the best. I'm a friendly person so I gain friends pretty well. The hardest part about the job was dealing with an unfair manager who continually made things difficult. The most enjoyable part of the job was opening the doors and having all type of customers come in and shop."
good,"With the retail site being so close to my home and in the center of my town, it was very easy to serve people that you know around the community. This helped the job be a lot easier, knowing the people in the community and how to help them. The management and co-workers were excellent, great people to be around and very professional. I've learned a lot at Walmart within the company and from the customers, and that was to always know your stuff, the merchandise, and how to satisfy a competitive customer with non-walmart prices and products."
good,"Very Great place to work."
good,If I had to I would definitely work there again! I met a lot of people and was able to gain a lot of experience.
good,"Great management, great associates and customers. Fast pace environment, so it is never boring. Items sold are of high quality and at a great price. This is specifically for the Burlington in Arcadia, Ca."
good,I worked as a cashier but even if i had my area clean I still couldn't go home unless every department had everything clean so they would make me go to a different department every night and I would be there until as late as 12am and I was still in High School. I felt that they could not do that if they made me clock out at 9pm so had to find another job.
good,"Burlington Coat Factory"
good,haven't worked at BCF in 16 years but it was a fun work environment that allowed employees to move up the ladder.
good,job where everyday something was new. not the same stuff happen everyday. fast pace
good,"Maintain a safe work environment for employees"
good,"My duties were to assist the supervisor and workers with anything they needed help with including the mail room, organizing files, leaving messages for the clients, and sending off reminders for future appointments."
good,"I love my job at Burlington Coat Factory. The staff and managers are friendly,fun and compassionate. They've taught me the importance of hard work and the role it can play when trying to advance in life. They've also taught me both customer service and leadership skills that I feel open me up to many new opportunities. I have continued to work for Burlington despite the fact that they offer their associates small salaries because I'm still happy working there after 4 years and I know that not many people can say that. If there were more opportunities to advance within the company or to make more money, I would not search elsewhere for employment."
good,A normal day consisted of numerous tasks that included organizing and maintaining of merchandise. My co-workers and I got along well and collectively completed our tasks in a teamwork and timely fashion. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to move around and about within the job area and not being stuck in one small place all day long.
good,great company with flexible working hours around college class schedule.
good,"Burlington was very family oriented, when I needed off at a certain time or a certain day I had the opportunity to request it as long as it was before the schedule was made. I loved my job to a certain point. It is not very organized and they don't communicate very well between each other. I was very well trained when it came to my duties and many other duties throughout the store. My input mattered when it came to new cashiers since I was a customer service supervisor."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is that customers get to know you and they appreciate what you do for them.
good,"Stocking became easy after the first 2 weeks, customers were fun and easy going"
good,Good company to work for and pretty good benefits with employee discount days where you could purchase items 50% off.
good,"A typical day work consist of meeting a high volume of demands. I have learned the value of customer care and employee appreciation. Management could be better. My co-workers are awesome. The hardest part of my job is staying in my department, there is always a call out for back up cashiers. The most enjoyable part of my job is the interaction with customers when helping them with their needs."
good,I got along well with all my employers as well as employees. We were all like one big family. I gave 100% to my job everyday I came into work. The hardest part was not being able to find exactly what the customer was looking for but would find enjoyment in helping them find something they did like and knowing I made their day. I learned to take pride in my job and my daily work and knowing I was making a difference in the customers shopping experience.
good,I liked my time working at Burlington Coat Factory.  I learned quite a bit about how the retail side of hospitality/customer service operated.
good,The people at Burlington are easy to get along with and make it a point to make you feel like you are part of a team. They have instilled at strong sense of value and culture
good,"I learned to work as a team to achieve my goals every day as a loss prevention employee."
good,"My experiences in Burlington was I can work with different people, in different areas.."
good,The hours were great. It was part time work during school. My co workers were okay. I enjoyed wroking the register and providing good customer service while working at this job.
good,"It was a great experience for me.  I had enjoy my time there."
good,"Good company to work for.. Benifits are good, corporate office is good. "
good,This job was challenging because corporate wanted merchandising done so different compared to what I was used to. The co-workers worked well together and would let you know when there was a problem. The job was enjoyable but unfortunately I moved and the traveling was too much for me.
good,really spacious for u to work very nice people good costumer service
good,Worked 8hrs/day. Good lunch breaks. Met great people there. Management was ok. The most enjoyable part was being a cashier and talking to the costumers. Co-workers were great.
good,Come into work around 8:00 am and process boxes of clothing and shoes. There really wasnt a hard task at my job.it was very convenient and flexible.
good,A great company to work for. Many areas of advancement if want the opportunity.
good,"I would arrive at work 30 minutes before the first truck would arrive with our load for the day. Start cleaning the dock for the days load and finish whatever work was left over from the day before. Once the truck arrived with the days load, I would break down the truck and seperate the items into different categories. Then start tagging them, sizing them, assembling them, and then taking the items out and putting them on display."
good,"A typical day at Burlington Coat Factory would be very busy usually during the weekends, helping customers, calling other stores for item check ups, multitasking. I learned how to be great at being an associate in this company, it was my first full time job, and i had alot of responsibilites. My responsibilities were to make sure other employees, were doing there job, and to all work together as a team, and make sure we would finish our duties on time. Management was very good, always awarding us with promotions. My coworkers were very good to work with, always doing team work. and helping one anjother when in need of help. I reallly enjoyed working in this job because, I really like working in retail, knowing im there to help customers just makes my day."
good,My review for Burlington is everything is finished what is needed
good,"I was a High School student so things were different. The typical day at work was busy. Constantly Cleaning Clothing . Providing Excellent Customer sales . My co-workers were lazy. The hardest part of this Job was When The customers came out the sressing rooms and leave clothing all behind. I really enjoyed my job , even tho it had its Up's and down's."
good,i liked bein in my own section and communicating with staff and customers.
good,"When Im at work I am always dealing with many people with many different backgrounds. Solving complaints and answering questions takes up most of my work day. I see to it that the cashiers are providing excellent customer service. I learn how to be patient and understanding every day. The managers see to it that the store is running smoothly and customers are leaving satisfied. I love my co-workers, we work great together. The hardest part of my job is having an unhappy customer because I believe all customers should leave happy and accomplished. THe most enjoyable part of my job is helping people. I love the feeling that I get when I know that I made a customer happy and make their visit personal."
good,"I been working here for almost two years and i still enjoy it. In the beginning its very fun and exciting because you are meeting new people and learning new things. After a few months it becomes more of a routine, but it is still fun ( depending the people you work with)"
good,Communication is very unorganized and needs major improving.  Employees often quit.  Management is very friendly and energetic.  This place is very stressful.
good,Working at burlington gives you a chance to move out of your comfort zone and interact with people. It teaches you to be confident in all work areas and teaches you to have outstanding customer service.
good,I loved being a part time cashier and interacting with the customers and making sure that they found what they were looking for.  I also liked my co-workers I worked with.

good,Management and work environment were great. Flexible hours and great treatment towards its staff. They treated employees to lunch and also reward you by letting you wear jeans on certain days.
good,"Great learning experience working the public everyday, fast pace and unpredictable, work hours were okay, pay could be a little bit more, management was fair and sincere."
good,"Great company to get into and grow with.  I worked in the corporate environment not the warehouse. This was one of the most enjoyable jobs I have ever had. The management staff was VERY receptive and encouraging. The people I worked with were great and other departments were equally as friendly. You get a sense of family at Burlington.  The flexible summer hours and remodeled building, lunchroom, etc. also made it a great place to work. HR staff seemed to really care about your development.  Often ask myself..why did I leave"
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the co-workers and members in the company. They are fun people and I liked the work environment. I really love the job because they always gave me a flexible schedule and I never had any problems with it.
good,Burlington is a great place to work. It offers great hours and flexibility. Great work environment. Always opportunities to move up in different positions.
good,The pay is good but you only work part time. Like with all jobs there are employees and managers you might not get along with. They are flexible with scheduling if you need certain days off and need to work certain hours or need to change you availability and will keep you no matter how many times you mess up.
good,"Burlington is a fun place to work, helping customers and enjoying all merchandising coming in receiving. It's centrally located in a great area, close to the only mall in the antelope valley."
good,Things was cool here as well. I work better with a team but I also do great alone. I love working the cash register it was pretty awesome. I enjoy putting up new things in the store.
good,"Good place to work , good and friendly staff and family oriented.Managers are easy to work with and always on the floor with you most especially when in need of help."
good,"Good place to work management have a clear vision  for what they want employees to do and where they want to go......................................"
good,"Burlington was a chill place to work, I was the part time CSS (Customer Service Supervisor). I Got paid $1 more than cashiers which was ""okay"" I guess."
good,They haven't been giving me enough hours so that's my only complaint but overall it's a nice place to work at. The management is nice and helpful and they value collaboration over competition.
good,"Great work but if you work the floor be prepared to walk a lot. I did 23,000 steps on average when I worked the floor. If you work cashier don't be scared to ask for back up the line can get really long very fast."
good,The job is fast paced get the truck unloaded put everything where it needs to go put it out on the floor hang the clothes tag them put them where it goes
good,Very helpful easy to navigate  I really enjoyed the people . All associates was very friendly and made my process less stressful. The environment made it comfortable to be apart of during tha time
good,"I have enjoyed my years with the company and it is a great place to work, management is pretty flexible with schedules, and the pay is pretty decent it just depends on your experience"
good,Aside from being on your feet until your break it's a cool job you get to meet a lot of people it's fun but some of the workers don't like to do their job

good,"I've worked for Burlington Stores, Inc., corporate for nearly 10 years and we have grown a lot. I still enjoy my job and my colleagues. We will continue to grow and hopefully opportunities for advancement will be forthcoming."
good,"Management was good and understanding, but the pay isn't a livable wage. It is excellent as a temporary job. The discount is also very good. Although, sometimes professionalism was not enforced enough."
good,"Its my favorite job I've ever had. I work in the fitting room and it can be an overwhelming mess some times.  But im very fast so I have lots plenty of time to relax and help customers.  Is crazy during the holiday season but what do you expect in retail. Everyone is very nice and coolest managers ever. I work at the wvc, ut location. I love getting paid weekly."
good,"Great hours, good teamwork, understanding management, good 10% discount with an occasional 30% off, fast paced working environment which I enjoyed not for someone who is lazy that’s forsure."
good,"This was a part time job well I went to school. They worked around my schedule. The management is awesome. They really cared about their employees. If some one is in need of a part time job this is the place to work, but they only have a few full time positions."
good,It’s not a bad place to work at. Depending on the store manager you may love your job or you may hate your job. Best advice do your work and go home. The discounts is good
good,Burlington is always busy it’s always something to do. Which makes your day go by faster and you enjoy it more and the people their are nice and you get to interact with customers.
good,I worked Burlington for 6 years and most of it was fun. the pay was terrible but at the time i didnt have bill to pay. overall it was a good job......
good,Its was a fun place to work staff was helpful to each other and management was ok. Our work was done on time and very accurately. All and all it was a good place to work
good,"Store needs fixing as there is a lot of bad areas that smell, have leaks and the building is so old the air quality is bad for not only the customers but the workers as well"
good,"Great work life balance"
good,"typical day would be coming  to work and plan my day by spending a hour or 2 on the computer to do my daily task."
good,"This job is good, as long as you’re likeable, hard-working, and consistent. Don’t call off randomly or not show up and be on time as much as you can. We have too many new hires that don’t take the job seriously, resulting in a harder time for the rest of us. Hours are scheduled here and there, leaving a lot of good workers in the dust. We’ve had people quit over that as well. This leaves the dependable people getting bombarded with calls on their days off to see if they can fill in for yet another rush hour with few scheduled people."
good,"There is room for advancement opportunities, diligence is always acknowledged, welcoming associates, professional training. There is an open door policy which means if you have an issue or concern about an associate or situation, you can go speak with someone without receiving any form of retaliation. Managers show concern for their associates and will accommodate schedule based on associates needs."
good,The warehouse was really consistent there was a lot of work and also it was a good work environment and plus it was really packed with a lot of merchandise so you did not run out of work.
good,It was OK it was just the time I had to to go work at that was my only problem with other than manager keep says that he would fire us and that he can do this stuff faster.
good,"It was only a seasonal job for me , even know after the time was done they offered me a position full or part time the store managers were happy with my performance unfortunately i couldn't take it."
good,"It was relaxed and everyone was enjoyable to work with, it was a collaborative enjoyable environment. People were always friendly and nice to me and customers were our priority"
good,"I learned a lot working for Burlington and really enjoyed the time that I worked there. It is a very fast paced environment, but they help you to adapt to it, and train you to the best of their ability."
good,"great company to work for. Spent day managing others, truck unload managing payroll, serving customers daily conference calls. Use sales numbers to drive sales daily"
good,This was my first 'real' job and my co workers and the customers allowed me to learn a lot.  More people need to work in customer service.  The pace is busy and it can be stressful when there's understaffing.  I imagine it's hard for management to be able to calculate exactly when the rushes will be to be able to coordinate coverage.
good,"I enjoyed working in the mornings it was kinda slow but the staff was always able to cheer each other up to get ready for the work day. mid day was always kinda hectic so we had to come up with efficient ways to quickly help the customer while also trying to keep the store clean and presentable. The main staff was always fun to be around and they seemed really fond of each other. it was nice change of pace for me because i was so use to doing housekeeping and not working so closely with people in a while. all in all its a decent place to work, learn, and grow."
good,Fast paced customer oriented. Company growing fast.  Believes in Core values. High turn over rate is an opportunity. Needs to invest in better ways of training and training material.
good,"When I went in to work the store was closed to take stock off of truck. The job was easy and was not stressful, I enjoyed working there. It was a seasonal job."
good,"On a typical day, you unload, organized than put the items in correct areas. You than go back to the receiving room to finish up the apparel or shoes. After everything is done you than will put out the organized apparel and shoes on to the sales floor. In the receiving room you have to have leadership skills, communication skills and move at a fast level."
good,We learned accounting at the retail level of operations. Sales Auditors were allotted 15 stores and needed to complete 430 cash reports a month to tieout the stores for monthly accounting and validation. We also assisted the warehouse in packing and storing the information for archival purposes.
good,"This discount is great and they're excellent when it comes to being flexible if anything unexpected comes up, especially if it deals with family, but the work is hard (receiving) and the pay is relatively low. So this is not the greatest job for a breadwinner or someone trying to save money (great shopping) but if you're a stay at home parent or someone just looking for extra cash it can be a great place to work."
good,"An ordinary day at work would be, come in check my mailbox, check my staff to see who is on schedule, make sure everyone went to lunch on time and had breaks on time, count down tills (drawers), make sure area was always clean, make sure all areas were covered. Count money at night after store was closed & log money in and drop in safe."
good,"Burlington is a very relaxed job, but can also be quick paced, Burlington is equally diverse and everyone works together as a team; managers are very understanding about life outside of the workplace and really want to work with your schedule."
good,Working here was a great experience especially for a first job straight out of high school. You gain your basic retail knowledge as well as customer service.
good,"I wouldnt tell anyone to work here full time. It can make you crazy, other than that it is a nice place if you need a second job to pay the bills. Good luck"
good,"On a daily coming across different situations allowing me to gain experience in a variety of areas. I have gained experience cashiering, stock flow, markdowns, as well as merchandising. Quite easy to maintain while attending school, store manager very friendly and understanding."
good,Worked mainly in receiving.  Not enough work hours.  Management is very nice.  Provided many meals for us when working odd or long hours.  Could get more hours during holidays if willing to cashier.
good,"locking the clothes up, able to have a little fun, but still be focused on your job. good outgoing people who make the job fun and makes you feel wanted."
good,"it's a retail store, it's busy. customer service is great. diverse. how to be able to handle the irate customers. your on your feet all day. it is fast-pace"
good,While working for Burlington-Stores I learned the most about retail. I had a up close experience on how to deal with all kinds of customers. I also learned about stocking items while having to manage my time to get certain task finished.
good,"major retail corporation. . fast-paced. .  staff were easy to work with. good communication. . scheduling is set however, easily adjusted... great place to get started working"
good,it was a neat learning experience as it was my first loss prevention job. I had never experienced it before so it was fun while it lasted. I also enjoyed the people I worked with but the store manager wasn't too great.
good,Working at Burlington was a nice experience. Everyone got along nicely and worked together as a team. This is something I plan to continue with every other job that I work.
good,A typical work day at Burlington is very fast paced and constantly greeting and assisting customers with all their needs. I learned great customer service skills as well as cash handling skills.
good,"Management is very caring and understanding, they lack communication sometimes, but at the end they get everything together. Every day is very fun and new, ever since i started working there I have learned how to deal with customers questions and handling money."
good,I loved working as a cashier at hurling but i applied for sales associates and got hired as a markdowns associate the first couple of weeks were fine but after a while you get tired of going through the same stuff week by week would not suggest this job or receving
good,The store I was in had an amazing team of workers and a great management staff. I felt like I was taken advantage of a lot though with the time and experience I had with the company and I was asked to work on tasks that weren't part of my position at the store
good,"Burlington was a quick paced work environment. It was a good starter job, however, I have been there for three years now and am still making minimum wage. That was my only issue."
good,"Coming into this position with no retail experience, I was able to grasp the concept after only an hour and half of verbal training on my first day. Thankfully, everyone was helpful and around; when I need a reminder of anything for the remaining seven and a half hours shift. The most satisfying aspects was being told about the great feedback from customers on my first day! It was my pleasure to make sure my customers had a great experience."
good,"A typical day for me in the receiving department is help receive in the products, separate by department and ready product for the sales floor. Superiors are very nice and I enjoy working with my coworkers. Since this is essentially a warehouse area there is no hardest/enjoyable part of the job its all physical."
good,"I enjoyed working at Burlington, if I could go back I definitely would. I would have to say the employees are very nice & very active, we all made a great team work."
good,I enjoyed working for Burlington and would recommend it to anyone looking to gain skills in a retail environment. Great discounts and a great team to work with.
good,"Brand new store, Have not been able to experience how the store operates when open. Getting store stocked and ready for Grand Opening. I have been learning how to process each department."
good,good company to work for competitive pay worked with temp agency the bad part was the job was seasonal did learn certain skills with computers and scan guns on how to ship and recieve merchandise.
good,"Fun work place... Good environment, Good atmosphere.. Very nice people. Love working with the customers and providing excellent customer service. Very clean and well kept store"
good,"a typical day is checking out customers and hanging up clothes. "

good,"helpful employees, understanding management, flexible hours, easy work"
good,It is a great first job experience. I really loved working there as my coworkers really gave you a family experience. Management always tried being supportive. I learned money handling.
good,A typical day at work is very optimistic. The workplace culture is very laid back customer come here to find new things. The hardest part of the job is a unhappy customer.
good,"Very friendly environment well welcomed by associates not too much work to do very busy at time but manageable, also an understanding crew members too"
good,"I honestly learned lot from Burlington. I didn’t think it was always fair, but it did keep me active, and working. I would recommend it to others who are looking for work."
good,I really enjoy working at Burlington being a cashier. It is a easy job and keeps you occupied. Workers are very nice and same with customers. Store is amazing as well.
good,"coworkers are very friendly, managers are very helpful with situations, friendly and fun place to work, at times a very fast pace but time does go by quickly"
good,"Cashing was fun. But having my own dept was great! Bringing merchandise out to the floor. Reset areas for sizing like when something doesn't belong there. Unloading boxes, tagging and hanging. Did pretty much every dept when needing extra help. I'd call on my days off to see if anyone called in or if they just needed extra help."
good,"Cashiered and marked down merchandise.  I learned how to adapt to a laid back environment,  Management was okay and the place was diverse.  The hardest part of the job was the constant straightening and the enjoyable part was helping the customers."

good,"Good team spirit, excellent customer service, encouraging and inspiring management, good location and proximity. Career advancement opportunities, friendly and diversified work environment. Hardest part: Working weekend."
good,"There is always work to be done in Burlington, whether its processing merchandise, flowing the merchandise, and or helping out the cashiers. It' always busy and filled with lots of customers. The hardest part about work is when the store is short staffed and you're stuck trying to complete your task for the day while also helping the managers keep up with the high volume of demands from customers. The fun part about work is the environment itself, in my section/department we all work together as a team to get the job done the fastest, productive way as possible. The one thing I learned about management in my store is that communication is key in order to keep the store running correctly. A typical day at work would be long lines reaching the elevators, a bunch of merchandise to process and flow."
good,if thing checking email making sure any planogram can out from corp then walk the floor and looking for recovery and what product is low and then talking to my department manager whats going on for the day
good,Burlington is a great company to work for.  The only negative I ever had with Burlington was not a lot of advancement opportunities for non-merchants.  I regret leaving this company.  You don't realize what you have until you leave.
good,"Its a fun place to work. All the employess are like a family. Its a fast paced up beat place, with alot of loyal customers. I would highly recommend this position to any one who wants wonderful work family."
good,I liked my job and enjoyed some of the staff I worked with. It was also convenient for me to travel to as well due to me not having my own reliable car at the time yet. I liked getting paid weekly to keep money in my pockets/ bank account. The hours was decent and flexible for me as well since my daughter's weren't into daycare yet at the time. They were very understanding to my personal life as a mother first incase I really had to call off.
good,The work place was nice and relaxed.  I  enjoyed working for this company. You could move to different areas to be trained in each. The management team was all right.
good,Do not expect to pay your bills with this job unless you practically live at work. Overall it is fun to work there as long as you do not let customers get in your head.
good,"I enjoy working at the store and will continue at this store .Iike meeting new people. and enjoy the smiling faces.  The store is a good atmosphere there,."
good,"Every day was different you never knew what to expect from customers, some of them,  were so excited and running to get a job interview outfit."
good,Productive and organized work environment. The management and coworkers were very friendly and ready to help. I enjoyed going to work. The customers always left happy

good,"Burlington is a place where u need to be fast and on point, because if your doing recieving and the truck needs to be unloaded, u have to be fast so that everything can be put on the sales floor by the end of the day."
good,"The job was a good experience learning about retailing for the first time, it was a little stressful but it open up a lot more opportunity for me to explore."
good,"this job helped me while was in school, i worked as a part time, learned how to treat customers and how to be patient and be more social, was able to be more open interacting with others."

I've learned to count money under pressure and make some returns for some of the merchandise.

What I enjoyed the most about this job would be discounts and friendly co workers."
good,"Everyday went pretty ordinary and calm. I learned new things about working in a clothes department. Nice and helpful managers. Multitasking alone was hardest thing, making sure to finish everything I needed to and also manage the fitting rooms the entire time.

I'd say that would have to be the most enjoyable part of the job, from my experience."

By the end of my career there I could do markdowns, unload freight, merchandise, cashier, cover an area, do layaway, make missing price tags, cover dressing rooms. And you know what I started out doing? Unboxing shoes.Management started out a little rocky but over time got better. One complaint I have for management was the constant changing of schedules mid-week. Schedules went up Sunday, but by Tuesday it was completely different and your days were messed up. I think the hardest part of that job was freight, they have constant changes in how it is executed. I made a lot of great friends there and had some pretty great times in that store too. It also makes me happy knowing that I helped open that store."

good,"I helped customers with merchandise and measured their sizes in suits and dress shirts. I swept and cleaned the fitting rooms; making them comfortable for shoppers. I learned the measurements in suits. Communication skills I learned by speaking to customers and succeeded by persuasion.

good,This company is a good company with great prices for even the most expensive brands.Has a clean fitting room which is organized and tidy every time.The workers are friendly and help out with whatever means necessary to be sure customers are happy with their visit.
good,"come to working start off cleaning and making sure the floor was nice and neat at all times, answer some of the shoppers question, find items for them, the most enjoyable was talking with the people, the hardest being on your feet allday just walking around, management was nice did not see them much, co-workers did not see them much either I was seasonal and pretty much worked alone"
good,i worked here all through out my pregnancy and it was great but my breaks were always forgot about and sometimes i would be working non stop for 3-4 hours straight. the people were nice and the service was excellent and the management was great untill it changed. it used to be fun and then things got incredibly strict....not saying its a bad thing but ther should be some fun in a working environment
good,"I enjoyed being a cashier, I dealt with various sitiuations as far as customer service which helped me develop better people skills. I learned alot about clothes & designs. "
good,"exellent co workers with different cultures"
good,I enjoyed the customers and my co-workers. I also enjoyed my work place. 
good,"everyday was different, coworkers were great, had the opportunity to go on business trips"
good,"The managers are outgoing and easy to talk to. They make sure you are comfortable in any decision you are maming, and if you have a problem, the managers actually take time out and listen."
good,"Assure your postion at the register and start assiting the customers. Consult with managers on what projects need to be completed.  Learning experience is that one has to adjust to every customers needs. My co-workers are like a family, ready and willing to help one another.  I enjoy the fact the I get to meet different people all day long, with each customer brings a new experience. Hardest part is that the postion is part time."
good,enjoyable atmosphere and good ppl. Management was pretty cool.  Very easy to work for as long as you did your job.
good,"Good environment to work in. Employees are friendly and are really easy to work with. Work was easy on a day to day basis. Only concern I had were the hours. Other than that, it was a great place of business."
good,"The management was really good, the hardest part about the job is when you have an irritated customer and you can not get them to calm down. The co-workers were really nice and they helped out a lot if you had any questions or if you looked like you were struggling. "
good,"The most enjoyable part was the fact that I was able to help people. Working in retail and as a tax preparer, I met all kind of people who all had different needs. Some needed advice while others just needed a friendly ""hello"". The fact that I could always make a person smile by just simply saying hello was enjoyable for me."
good,Loved working there. Just it was kind of far from home and wasn't easy transportation.
good,Most of my co-workers I worked with were great but the hardest part of the job was not enough workers. We all worked very hard in doing what we can to keep the customers happy and keep the store clean but it was tough. The management was great and very appreciative of the work we did and that keeps up the motivation of getting through a rough day. I am honored to have worked there and gained the leadership skills and learned to work in the fast paced environment especially Saturdays and Sundays. A typical day at work is making sure all cashiers are putting in all their effort to maintain a clean workspace and keep up with special offers/promotions of Burlington. Customer Service Supervisors need to make sure to keep the front clean by taking trash/sensors to the back and put sensors/tags on all clothing that need to go back to the sales floor. We also need to notify all departments to empty their customer returns/go back bins. All returns without a reciept or tag as well as discounts on merchandise needed to be approved by us or management before the cashier can proceed with transaction .
good,room for advancements and great customer services great discounts
good,"There is always something that needs to be done which keeps employees busy throughout the day. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to send my clients away happy. The hardest part of the job would have to be keeping the entire store tidy, especially on the weekends."
good,"Really irritating job but co-workers are really friendly everybody gets along with everybody there is no work drama. The managers are really understanding and able to adjust with your school schedule, etc. The hardest part of the job is trying to get the store cleaned before end of the shift. The most enjoyable is being able to work at your own pace and nobody breathing down your back"
good,"A typical workday would start with opening the store for the employees as I was a keyholding manager. I would then do payroll and make my schedule for the day. From there I would hold a store morning meeting. Then I would open the doors for the customers. After my shift was complete I would review the day with the next manager coming in. I learned all aspects of manageing the company from hiring, merchandising, scheduling, payroll, open an closing new stores. My co-workers were more like close friends. We got along well. My hardest part of the job was learning to help the many different personalities of people so that everyone could come together an get the job done. The most enjoyable part of my job was training and coaching."
good,prepared college students for college level reading and writing.
good,A typical work day is anywhere from 4 to 8 hours
good,I enjoyed working this place and if I could have stayed there I would have because there probably would've been room for advancement. I had to quit because I was starting school full time and the store had no available night positions for me and they weren't willing to work with me after all the hard work I had put in.
good,working there was a very good work experience good coworkers and management.
good,"A typical day at work starts with suppling the sales floor with new seasonal items,including daily markdowns, and reduced sales items. This would also include new signs, red hot ticket items. I learned to keep myself knowledgeable about daily inventory. The management team, especially the merchandising department kept the employee pumped with daily team meeting . I had a opportunity to work with several stores in the metro area which brought alot of diversity to the table in the workplace. The hardest part of the job was having to down size some of the departments and still keep quality customer service on the sales floor. The most enjoyable part of the job was having insight on what the customers were really looking for in clothing and fashion."
good,"It's a good business. When the store would get packed, the work went by quicker."
good,"great place to work long hours hevy lifting req,over all it a great plce to work."
good,Typical work day includes unloading the merchandise from truck and process it the same day. Great strong management. Really easy to get along co-workers. Hardest part of the job a lot of heavy lifting.
good,"I worked day and night,i learned how to work with people,follow the rules and deal with co-worker,the hardest part of the job is working at night and the enjoyable part is I like my job and my co-workers we are work together ask a team."
good,it was a busy environment with great coworkers...great customer service skills
good,A day at work here was very well paced and great due to co-workers and managment having things prepd and ready for the next shift. We worked together as a great team and got the job done on time.Over all coming into work was enjoyable. Hardest part was actualy leaving i was hired seasonal.
good,Not your typical department store... everything is done with keeping the customer in mind so as to not have sky high prices.
good,"Productive workplace learning how to assist customers with a nice greeting and a smile,great management to make sure everything was on task,it was a good job overall"
good,"unloaded trucks all day,i also process the product in the store.Everything about the job was eazy.The best thing about the job was the discounts you get."
good,"People arrive from 8:30 to 9:00 and can leave if they have other responsibilities, the company is very flexible in that respect. A lot of opportunity to move around and learn from different departments. Very personable management."
good,Burlington was fun to work at and a gud place to meet new and different people.
good,I worked in customer service interacting with people. I delt with layaway paperwork. I inserted information into the computer. I was a cashier as well.
good,"Working at Burlington has taught me many more skills than before. A typical day at work was like starting work at 6 am, unloading the truck, opening boxes, sorting the freight, and stocking the merchandise. I learned how to communicate with customers and employees. I also learned how receiving is done and how to stock the merchandise in the store. The management was pretty good, but they let the employees work on their own most of the time without supervision. They would check on the employees and help out every so often when needed. The workplace culture is an equal opportunity employer. Burlington would hire pretty much anybody. The hardest part of the job was starting so early the morning. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with a team to fulfill the store needs."
good,"•	Received payment by cash, check, credit cards, vouchers, or automatic debits and operated cash register"
good,Learn how to work in a team and how to become to a leader at times it would get hard with customers but I would still get through the day good.i enjoy my time working there
good,I was stocking here and i didn’t think i would like it fr. But it turned out it’s not as hard as u thought it would be. If u messed up your crew members would help you and get i back on track
good,I love the job and people I work with.  My only complaint is seldom do they allow OT. You cannot work a second job and be full time here because schedule is flexible schedule that changes weekly.
good,Training needed to be a bit more elaborative but besides that the work environment was great and I worked with good people management should take complaints more seriously. Loved working through the holiday times
good,"It's a nice job for kids graduating. The pay isn't so good and they're strict about call ins and being tardy but, it's decent easy work. Not enough pay for the mandatory 10-11 hr shifts."
good,"Burlington is always looking to better a person's skills by offering leadership programs, lunch and learns, job sharing and specialty programs to further enhance your business skills."
good,Great work environment. A job well done is always recognized. Great management team. They want to see you win. Great about coaching in the moment. Always motivating
good,"It's more physical than I'm use to and sometimes customers can be rude. However, the shifts go by quickly and coworkers are always celebrating something with treats."
good,"My Overall Of Burlington is great , they have great staff , really flexible hours and will work with you Incase you have things to do. Very friendly and polite."
good,"As long as you can be fairly quick with your transactions, you'll easily excel here. The supervisors are very easygoing, but don't tolerate slackers. Coworkers seem to get along very well."
good,"Good experience "
good,Burlington is a wonderful company to work for. I really enjoy my team that I work with we all get along well. But like any company we can improve in small things.
good,"This job was very fast paced. One has to unload the trucks, unload each individual box, organize each item out of every box, and place each item in the designated section of the sales floor. It can be a very stressful day, or no stress at all.  Management was excellent."
good,I had an excellent experience working at Burlington. Your able to pick which shift best fits for you especially if your still attending school. I loved the work culture as well.
good,I would clock in talk to the previous css to see what need to be done to close shift correctly and then look at my survey scores and document sales for the hour every hour by the hour. I also would check if donations were being met for end of day evaluation. Then I would re introduce myself to the cashiers on shift to see how they were doing check levels of irritability. and if some one seemed over whelmed I would send them to complete another task while I multi tasked speed of check out and cleanliness.
good,"At this store, I've learned so much and met a lot of great people even the managers at the time were awesome! Very flexible with your schedule especially if you go to school or have a 2nd job. The only time that would ever be hard at this job would be during the holiday.. maintaining the store clean every 30 minutes to an hour was the hardest thing to keep up on. Other than that, I'm glad I was given the chance to work here!"
good,I enjoy working at Burlington the hours and schedule that the managers have for me really fit my needs and wants in shipping and receiving you get the weekend off and that is HUGE to us the management is GREAT  at least at my store nothing really needs to change here except there can be a little bit of drama at times other then that I am happy with my roll at Burlington.
good,"Management team is very supportive of team. Flexible hours, snacks and beverages provided for best productivity of the team. We have a good team at Burlington. Everyone does there best to work together and make it a fun working environment."

good,Made sure everything was organized and clean before starting any project. I learned that the most important thing is the customers and gI've great service to the customers.
good,"A very fast-paced, multi-tasking enviroment. Trust me, you will never get bored here. Plus side , time does go by fast here. Occasionally you have to push donations and customer surveys which is easy, not too bad, don't be intimidated. They offer 15% off employee discount and for family members as well. They give out a good amount of hours. Management really values their employees and their other commitments. They were really understanding with my college schedule! They worked with me on that. Part-time employees get most benefits such as dental, vision, life insurance for cheap. just not paid time off or vacation. You get paid every Friday!Did i mention around the holidays , 30% off for employees and family members. Plus we don't pay layaway fees,ever."
good,"It was a great environment to advanced in life skills such as commutation, taking on challenges, and critical thinking. All of the employees were amazing to work with."
good,i loved working at burlington. i worked for 2 different locations. they work with your schedule and it is very easy to learn. the employees and managers are very nice and make the workplace fun.
good,"The only reason I would ever leave Burlington (aside from after graduation) would be the pay. I really like the company and most of the managers. They treat their employees better than any company I’ve worked for in the past. My location is pretty relaxed and I enjoy that, for the most part. The dress code is simple and lax (black and black or black and khaki). A big concern for me before I started at Burlington was pressure to commit to more hours. As a student, I can only devote so much time to a part-time position and at other jobs in the past, I would receive constant pressure and frustration from managers when I could only work 20 hour weeks. However, at Burlington they have never pressured me into working more than I can and rarely call me on my off days to ask me if I can come in to work. If you’re looking for a simple part-time job with flexible hours and lots of employee recognition, I highly recommend Burlington!"
good,"A typical day at work would be that of any other retail experience. Typically packed on weekends, and light traffic on weekdays. Could be a poor experience if you don't along with coworkers."
good,"Fun place to work..especially around the holiday time,  "
good,This place has great managment as far as I know of about 2 years ago.  Face paced but not overbearing. It allows  you to work  independently instead of always being hovered over.
good,the job its self is awesome. paid time off insurance they give away stuff and feed you all the time. it is very fast paced. you have to learn very quick or they will fire you
good,I enjoyed working there but it could of been better.i liked my co workers but I needed more hours and days on the schedule. My manager was nice but they tried to give me more hours.
good,Burlington coat factory was an enjoyable work experience my only complaint was the fact that there really wasn't any room for promotions or pay grades unless you got a new position which rarely occurred other then that I cant complain
good,"Great company, wonderful co-workers, generous discount an room for advancement."
good,I was a a.m. stocker and it was a pretty easy job. The pay was ok but you won’t get many hours unless it’s a peak season and you may not reach 20 hrs then. Overall it’s good as a second job.
good,I enjoyed working at Burlington. The managers were fair and accommodating. There are many locations which are easily accessible by public transportation. My coworkers were friendly too.
good,My first job was Burlington it was such a great experience. The only down side was my 2 hour commute to the city. the management both in New York and Sterling were great.
good,The management and upper leadership encourage education and growth. They care about the well being of associates. Its a family atmosphere and team driven solutions are often required. When finding solution to issues is when the team atmosphere makes the job less taxing to do. Having close working relationships with many different individuals and solving problems over the years builds partnerships and friends. It also drives results. The hardest part of the job is the unknown. The company is still growing still making improvements on processes.
good,"As a cashier, a typical day at work is ringing up customers with their items. The pace is not too fast, but not too slow. I sometimes have to deal with difficult customers and other times I have to deal with very large purchases with only so much room. "
good,"this job is perfect for someone in high school or that doesn't have much responsibilities, they have a very flexible schedule options and relaxed work atmosphere"
good,loved my job and co workers. Management was excellent except for one hectic manager that made it so stressful and her communication skills were very poor I no longer desired to work there and left my supervisor position.
good,"Typical day at work was okay, it was rush hour being that I worked in the city. Hardest part was when a customer had about 60 items and I would ring all of them up and they wouldn't want some items so I would have to cancel and redo it. Most enjoyable part was interacting with the customers."
good,At Burlington you always meet new people . Your always the first to see the new merchandise . And you get discounts . It can get a little frustrating at times but you always manage to get through it .
good,"it is very stressful during the holidays."
good,"It was a stressful, yet fun work experience. I enjoyed each day I did work at Burlington, and being ""behind the scenes"" was something different as well. It gave me a different outlook on the industry. Now I can walk into a store and know exactly how to locate something, along with the ins and outs of the business as well, of course if it's based off planogram that is. The hardest part was the deadlines that I had to have my team meet, since I did manage a large body of staff, but the most enjoyable was the connections and the confidence I had in my team and them with me."
good,Fun place to work. But quick paced but not bad at all. The location I was in had an awesome work atmosphere. Managers were nice. Coworkers were pretty cool.
good,"My experience working at Burlington Coat Factory was very interesting . It was a very cool atmosphere, I know what retail employees really go through and the hard work that is done for the store and customers daily."
good,You can give your all and be exceptional but as far as benefits you will be held to the same extent as someone who has just started the job. I feel there should be more promotions and pay raises for those who are qualified for the benefits
good,Family like atmosphere between employees with well defined expectations. Decent hours with flexibility. Job is busy and fast paced. good management team that listens to it's employees while maintaining boundaries.
good,"I worked at Burlington for 6 months and I absolutely loved it. It was a great work atmosphere, the only reason I left is because I was an seasonal/on call employee and no longer received hours after the back to school sale due to low customer traffic. Management was great and very helpful. I entered as an cashier with absolutely no experience and they took me under there wings and taught me everything I know. The only con in my opinion is the fact that you couldn't leave at close until every employee was done and since it was alot of us that took a while. So instead of leaving at 10pm like the schedule said, you wouldn't leave until 10:45pm."
good,Working here has been very enjoyable for me. I am a busy body so being constantly busy at work was very enjoyable for me and helped time go by faster.
good,good job nice staff love it. i would reccomend it to others. I enjoyed my 3 years there. I had to relocate that is why I am no longer employed with the company
good,"I was here to help with setting up the clearance area. I had to check the inventory, organize the product, and keep the fitting rooms cleared out. It was a great job."
good,I loved the hours there. it worked very well with my schedule. the people there are lots of fun to be around and all are team player. Even the group leaders tired their best to help you.
good,huge warehouse with lots of products but that made the work day go faster.  easy going managers and fun coworkers that didn't mind helping each other.
good,Loved working for this company there are a lot of outgoing people in this office who were willing to help me find a job and make sure that that job was the right fit for me
good,"Working here was fun. Everyone got super close, and had no problem with helping each other out when it came to closing time. Discounts were great also."
good,Great temp job they are greedy with hrs but if ur looking for part time it's perfect the pay could be better but the job is  easy so it's not so bad they are flexible and good with working with another job
good,I like the company's core values.  There's a lot of processes that have been put into place to make the store successful.  It is sometimes difficult to get everything done with the payroll provided.
good,"I openned my store here, I started as a baby/youth sales associate. In sept. I worked hard in the back, getting merchandie out to the floor, so they switched me to flow team. I did that for a few months and then got offered full time sales associate and key holder! Within 3 months of the store openning I got a raise and almost management position. If you work hard and show initiative you can definately move up in the company. My regional managers are great. LP is also great. Managers can butt heads a little bit, but they are caring, fun loving people. We have great customers. The store stays very busy and we are over merchandised so there's a lot of picking things off the floor!"
good,"I really enjoy working as a cashier at Burlington coat factory the hours are flexible and works well with college students who are in  school, weekends are mandatory and having a second job is exceptional it is a great place to start before settling into your career choice and goals."

good,"Overall, the stores have great benefits. You must have open availability for them. Hiring is easy and no judgement. I enjoy it because no job is easy, if I can change one thing is would be pay rate for associates and allowing overtime. I do loss prevention and I am apart of management. Any concerns believe we have open door policy. It's worth the time if your young and flexible. Most definitely need dependable people. You get a raise after 6 months working."
good,"I've been at Burlington for a few years now. And honestly, the reason I haven't left is that I've made such great friends. The policies I don't always agree with and the customers can be rude and trashy. But to be honest, all of that is worth it because of the friends I've created at that job. They've essentially become family."
good,Was a great place to work for the holiday season! Especially if you like to shop. The coworker were all very friendly and welcomes new employees with open arms

good,"the day begins at 6am, unloading and sorting the new shipment. this lasted until 12or 1pm. During this time i was allowed 1 break; which was enough. My managers had an open door policy that encourage communication on any subject and that made it easier to build a relationship. My co-workers and I established close relationships built on trust, accountability and dependability. The hardest part of the job was making sure we still met our deadline when multiple people called off or didn't show. This happened more times than a few but we managed efficiently. I enjoyed the fact that I was working for a company who presented itself as a family oriented business and treated its workers as family."

A typical day at work is usually fast-paced which makes the time go by quicker. Management and co-workers are respectful and nice to word with!

I love to help people find what they need!

The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing my customers smile, helping my co-workers and my managers out when they needed me to and whenever we had our coat drive for kids they were in need of winter coats. it always put a smile on my face to see the kids in need get taken care of."
good,I loved it here the only reason I left was because I moved. I enjoyed talking with customers and helping them pick out clothes.

good,"Busy day of work, good working conditions, teamwork oriented."
good,The managers are very friendly and help you advance and become better at the job. The hardest part of the job is when there's not enough cashiers and the customers would be very disgruntled.

good,"A typical day at work is starting my shift at 6 a.m. unloading freight off pallets, verifies quantity and quality of order, tags and issues supplies, and stocks shelves. The hardest part of the job is waking up early to go to work. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to get off work early no later than 2 pm and having weekends off.

good,"Ok so I started working here on August 2018. I was initially hired on June 24th but for some reason didn’t start until August. It is VERY FAST PACED, and I started out as a cashier at $9. Where I work, seasonal get paid $8 and part timer get paid $9 an hour. I like that we get paid weekly on fridays. Customers leave a mess EVERY DAY. You get your typical nice customers and sometimes you get rude customers that make a big deal over something small like ask for a discount on clearance items when we don’t offer it on already reduced items. Typical tasks I did as cashier were: charging people and doing layaways/returns/manifiesto and just recently credit card and loyalty program, cleaning up the queue line and re-organize, doing returns by making sure sensors are on clothes and are hanged, refill the refrigerator with drinks and sometimes help out other departments. I would help other departments when they offered hours so I’ve been in accessories, baby depot and youth. I personally like being cashier better. By April 2019, I got promoted to being a supervisor and got $1 raise. Not bad, but supervisors do a lot. Management is very lenient, hours are good. I now typically get like ~30 hours a week. Breaks and lunches are ALWAYS GUARANTEED at my work, if you work at least 4 hours you get a 15 min paid break and if you work at least 6 hours or more you get a non paid 30 minute lunch break. I think it’s a good starting job for the summer because the holidays are a NIGHTMARE. Associate discount 15% and on “holidays” it goes to 30% from a Saturday to the next Sunday. “Holidays” included"

good,"working here is very simple. not very difficult to understand what needs to be done. sometimes can get hectic because there is not enough staff working at times. working here is kind of like having a second family, but the employees can get very dramatic and sometimes the management gets involved in the drama too."
good,"Great first job experience, get paid weekly. Can be stressful some days but all the hard work pays off. You do get recognized by the managers for your hard work and dedication."
good,"On a typical work day it's busy. The truck is always heavy, lots of merchandise to put out. Sometimes not enough people to get the job done. Working at there yov find that it can be very stressfull, that's encludes the management team. That can be overboard with something. The work cultrue is great, also everyone there gets along. The hardest part of the job is no everhaving enough people there to finish the job. As far as it goes about enjoying the work place there it's good. The hours are great. You get a great discount. 15% to 30%. It's not a bad place to work. If I had to refer this company to someone for a job, I would."

During my time there I learned a lot  about how to run a retail store as far as merchandising, how to handle customer, learning the registers, and going into the system to look up specific items a customer is searching for. From the time I got hired til my time was up because the position was seasonal the team was very friendly and helpful. The hardest part of my job is when the customer would get upset because of a store rule or policy. I never want to tell my customer no or I can't help them with whatever it is they want because I'm not allowed to go against store policies. But the most enjoyable part of my job is being able to bring my smile and make everyone's day a little bit brighter."
good,"i enjoy working here but the pay was too low for the work i did"
good,The overall work isn't to hard. It's very fun at times. The only problem for me was that the minimal wage payment of $7.25 was not enough at the time for me.
good,"The most best part of getting an new co-work alert to hot stops, in store, and working with they on cash handling."
good,"A typical day for me at work; I clean my department, assist customers with purchases, I sometimes work with freight (shipping and receiving). I also work cashier if it becomes extremely busy. Management is very helpful when it comes to my school schedule, they usually will give me the schedule that I need so that I can stay on top of things."
good,I clock in and go to the mens department to clean fitting rooms. I then sweep and throw away all trash. I put away go backs and respond to cashier calls for price checks and stock checks. I learned how to be more detail oriented and how to find answers faster. The management and co-workers are great and always willing to help. The hardest part of the job is keeping it clean and neat when it is busy. The mos enjoyable part of the job is helping people and working as a team.
good,I was a sales associate when I first started to work then. About a week later I was a cashier because my manager love that I was a very happy and friendly associate.
good,"Managers need to be more nice and patient with every employee. Treat people the same not lower than anyone else. For example; managers should not feel more powerful than new employees. Managers have earned their roles, but should not make employees feel less. They should make employees feel appreciated for there great work. A successful business runs with happy employees and happy customers. A win win for both."
good,"A typical day at work consist of taking customers, Checking the Q-line, taking hangers and security tags to the back. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to meet different people."
good,loading trailers unloading packing boxes checking the system if qty is correct if not correct would give errors hot lots of hard labor  paid time off over time
good,It gave me the right experience for the real working place. At first I struggled a bit but then once I adjusted to the schedule I learned it was the kind of job I need.
good,"Burlington is an excellent establishment to work for. It is easy to move up within the company, and they offer plenty of benefits for their full time employees. The managers are great communicators and corporate workers are very involved with making sure the establishment is up to standards. It's a workplace that cares."
good,"A typical day at Burlington is fast-paced and the employees are really nice. The managers are very understanding, and easy to work with and so are the other employees."
good,Working at Burlington Coat Factory is definitely a learning experience. I learn something new each day that I work. It's very steady-paced unless it's holiday season or we're having a sale. Management is very productive.

good,"I enjoyed working at burlington , its a great company where everyone worked like professionals. They have good Communtication skills and i never had a problem with my fellow workers"
good,"A typical day at work is fast paced. I assist customers with any questions they may have. I market merchandise to appeal to the needs of the customers. I answer phones calls from customers wanting assistance for example I answer any questions they have about a product. I perform tasks such as putting away returns, clean up any items dropped on the floor and arrange products to keep the appearance of my department organized and neatly placed. We are short staffed at the moment therefore I have to help with price checks in other departments also run cash register to keep the lines flowing quickly. Our management team consists of four different mangers that run their own sections of the store. their personalities differ."
good,I enjoy the fact its family values and the company is very flexible and caring! I like the work atmosphere as well as the great long time employees which most are 10+ which says all about a company.
good,"You learn a lot about customer service, working in retail, and working with others. They work hard to teach you the meaning of team work."
good,"I've been in some part of customer service for over 26 years. I was unemployed from 2011 to 2014, so when Burlington called me I was generally excited. Their compensation isn't anywhere near what I'm use to, but it's enough for the time being to meet my current needs. I also like the employee discount with helps a lot as I have young kid's. Management is friendly, but the associates take time to knows as some seem very immature. I was told there is room for growth and upon achieving my Masters In Human Resources will pursue a higher position within the company next year."
good,College campus based bookstore with a lot of energy and fun u get to meet people of various ethnic backgrounds.
good,"•	Responsible for cashier, money transactions, and cash drawer balance at the end of  the shift"
good,"The job tasks are simple but require stamina and awareness. The processing of material is constant with a high traffic volume, with great co-workers however each story may and should vary. If you pay attention the job is not hard and enjoyable with your comrades."
good,"Organize all the clothing (per department,per area)"
good,I had to run a set of looms we weaved men wear cloth at this plant ..I had to inspected cloth 3 times during the shift... I had to check filling first part of shift to see if it the right kind was running had to put up filling when it ran out....had to fix broking warp end and fix filling breaks ...when the looms would break down i had to flag for fixers...when looms would doff i had to put up a flag for a doffer...had to blow looms off and clean my area before shift change..management was alright..this place closed so it could have been management...had a lot of friends there ...then some coworkers you could not get along with....the hardest part of that job was when you had bad warps lot of end breaking...that job was enjoyable because i love to weave

good,my review on this job is that it was very fun to work there .it was very fun to work with positive people and fun people .the most that ive learned there was to stay positive stay happy and smile through it all and what I have learned is that hard work pays off .mangment was wonderful.the hardiest part of the job was when we all ways have rush when theres a lot of people in line and we had to get that line short in a matter of time.the most enjoyable part is making people happy
good,"Burlington Coat Factory was my 1st temporary seasonal job, which only lasted for 2 months though. I used to recovery work mostly, organized clothes and items on racks and displays. The hardest part was working in the women lingerines dept. I'm not used of working with women undergarments (bras, underwear, etc), which made it bit frustrating for me sometime. The only part I like was doing recovery work in other dept though."
good,Great first job for anyone to have. Really gives you a good insight into what customer service/ retail jobs are like. Would recommend it to anyone for a career there.
good,"sometimes hard work sometimes"
good,"A typical work day at Burlington Coat Factory is enjoyable and fast paced. I walk into work ready to work with a smile on my face, both because of my coworkers and also because of the customers."
good,"Great Company, and always room for advancement good people love to work there again if called."
good,"This job being my first experience in retail, I learned how to manage my time better and pick up my speed in handling purchases especially around holidays. It is great when a customer is satisfied with the items they bought."
good,"A typical day at work was just picking up wood & metal and throwing it in the dumpster and if the dumpster didn't show up then we just organized and cleaned up. I learned that you have to keep your eyes and ears open at all times cause if you have something heavy fall on you it can do some serious damage. my co-workers were really good to me as I were to them, they were funny and very talkative. The hardest part of the job was lifting heavy wood twice my size. The most enjoyable part of the job was while I was lifting the wood and metal I was kind of getting a workout at the same time."
good,The staff work as a team. I learned to multi-task better and communicate more effectively. Scheduling was not the best but they worked closely. Hours could be cut or extended at the last minute.
good,It's a good place to work for those looking for part time and or a second job. Base on locations your experience with the company can be great or bad.
good,"Very petty co workers, I done very well with my job picked it up fast but some the employees and management had very poor attitudes to the point I would cry daily."
good,"It was a good job, but i never got any hours and i was constantly having to pick up shifts because they would just never schedule me. The people were good, but the schedules sucked."
good,They fired me wouldn't show my points and said they would rehire me every other end I got along with while my boss was firing me he said he would give  an excellent reference and told me to apply for unemployment
good,I like this job because i got to see all the new clothes.i learn a little bit about retail and my co-workers was cool everybody was helping each other with their assign job . The hardest part was restock but i enjoyed every part of it .
good,"I work receiving and MTA and it seems like I do more work then the managers. Unloading the truck, opening each box putting the merchandise in the appropriate area then putting tickets on clothes, hanging the clothes on racks  , putting sensors and sizes in the clothes then rolling them out to the floor."
good,I have experienced in management and just took a seasonal job and I believe they are in  need of customer service skills. Didn't even bother to hire me back even though I was only part time with management skills. Oh well your lost. I really loved working there
good,Despido sin motivo alguno  preferencias laborales con algunos empleados pocas horas
good,Good for working a part time job.  Learned a lot about receiving merchandise  for a company.  Good co-workers to work with.  Would recommend if looking for part time
good,"It started off great, but the management is absolutely terrible. Management was very disorganized and they never aided their employees needs. Managers got rude towards my ending period so it drove me to not return"
good,"I Had a great time working there at the beginning, but was then given less hours. 12 hours a week is not a livable wage for anyone in this day and age."
good,"While the store manager at my location was doing stuff against company policy, the work itself wasn’t very difficult. My coworkers who were there before the new manager arrived are great workers and it was a really friendly environment. They knew what they were doing. There were holiday potlucks and the employee discounts wasn’t too bad."
good,So far it's a good company could use a little work can't complain the management team seems like they need assistance so growing in the company is very likely
good,"from 9 am till 4 pm I usually know where I'm suppose to be which is the cash register, sometimes the manager send me to work on the floor which I don't mind cause I liked learning about all the positions"
good,Very fast paced. Your full attention is required. you must come to work everyday prepared to work hard and safely. There is a lot of action going on in the building so for your safety you must give your undivided attention
good,"your typical day consists of getting yelled at by certain customers, not pleasing your superiors & being told you're not moving fast enough."
good,I love it here just not the hours u wish they gave me more hours great people very respectful always willing to work with your schedule It's a great job
good,"Burlington would be a great company to work for if the opportunity to grow would be offered to everyone. Other than that, the workers that I had the honor to work with are amazing."
good,"I Learned a lot of stuff from Burlington coat factory. I learned how to become a patience and relaxed, joyful person"
good,A typical day at work involves me protecting the customers as well as company assets. I learn something new everyday and I really love job.
good,A typical day at work was fast pace. I learned how to deal with customers with many different attitudes in very specific ways. Management wasn't very structured at all. co-workers was very willing to do what it took to get you through the day. nothing to hard about the job. the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people co-workers and making new friends
good,"I really like the people that I worked with, We were a fast pace team, getting the job done team.(Except one lady, She didn’t like to work just talk) unfortunately it was only seasonal and my manager didn’t rehired anybody 😞"
good,"Get to work at 7am.  Work in a particular department, opening boxes and then stocking shelves.  Once that department stock is finished, go onto the next department."
good,"Management needs to be more professional and stop power tripping! Also, the rumor mill of lies can hurt the individual who is being victimize! Rules should be followed by everyone!"
good,"Love my supervisors. Great opportunities to grow. Fast pace, easy to learn, you do need to work the weekends. This is a very easy job, i think it doesn't suit anyone that wants to work at a slow pace"
good,nice but management changes were bad and also the store i was began working with were really mentoring me in what to do and most of all friendly. lately new management has taken
good,The enviroment is great but the hours are not so great and the work is fun.
good,"Punch in , go to my assigned work area. Make sure my area is fully stocked and well maintained. Help customers locate merchandise."
good,"It’s a fun place to work and it’s easy if you need a job, but it’s honesfly very hard to maintain a life outside of work here. They change your schedule too often and don’t tell you, and it took me nearly a week to figure out how to access the schedule outside of work. Wouldn’t recommend working there if you want to juggle two jobs or are just looking for something temporary."
good,Burlington helps you develop the right to work with others it helps you have a strong mind move at a fast pace and is very organized I have learned a lot of good experience working at Burlington far as leadership qualities a set group of skills and a lot of motivational and positive influence
good,"I enjoyed working with customers and learning about new styles and trends. Its a great place for part-time work, the hardest part of the job was difficult customers."

good,It's a wonderful place to work...the employees are great to get along with...I'm a Supervisor and I love being a people person...I love the smiles on the customers face. I plan on staying for a long time....
good,"My first day I was already getting attitude from everyone here I figured out after three weeks that they just didn't know how to speak to people in the back. The work is way more stressful then it needed to be and the manager tended to get EXTREMELY angry at everyone for no reason. The majority of people in the back were foreign or deaf so they couldn't u deratand the directions being given. I enjoyed the people I worked with, just not my immediate managers. There was a girl.there younger then me that was sure to cut you short or make u feel inferior to her. The store manager was AMAZING!! He kept the energy up "
good,"I would go into work, make boxes, fill them and repeat until the day was over. I really enjoyed the work but the company that hired me on was a temp agency"
good,If you apply for here don’t do shipping and receiving I’m a mother and since I started I received 2 checks one just for the hours of my onboarding and then the next I worked one day for four hours if you are new you will not get hours in the back of store
good,"I had the privilege to work at a burlington since before the store open. My store currently is a baby to the area and working here in general is great. As a recieving associate a lot of miss-communication between BOH and FOH. My supervisor is amazing. For the most part management is fair. "
good,"Regional manager is unprofessional, not too sure how he got into that role. I'd simply avoid because of the manager. Other than that, the store has your back, everyone is friendly and is easy to get along with. I would simply apply just for the store level people. Regional manager offered a higher wage to someone with no experience."
good,"I liked working as a Cashier for Burlington."
good,just overall a good place to work. I would actually go back if I had time to do so. the managment team was awesome also. I learned how to interact with new people a whole lot. the most enjoyable part about the job was working as a cashier
good,Good job for teenager.                        It was a great job while it lasted the pay wasn't so good but it was paid I did like the fact that I got paid every week the people I work with were great people they just wouldn't pay you more money and the benefits work wasn't worth the time and the money that they were offering
good,Burlington is for a students with no kids or bills. The pay and hours or not livable for a family. The hardest part about the job is the standing and bending.
good,great place to work if you just need extra money its not a place to start a career with. some of mangament is easy to get along with others not some much.
good,On a typical day the store is busy and slow back and fourth throughout the day. I shuffle between registering and being on the sales floor. Most the day is spent doing recovery.
good,Learned a lot from this position. Was able to communicate on a corporate level.  My ideas were taken into consideration on how to improve customer service.
good,"Working at Burlington is a productive work environment. If you are a college student this would be a great first time job or a job for extra income. This job was an easy job as long as you knew how to work in a fast pace environment and did as you were told, everything operated smoothly."
good,Working for Burlington was a great experience that I actually worked for the company twice. Management was challenging but I really enjoyed my work overall.
good,"In the position that i held, I was given a very important role. Why i say important is because i manage all the money for the store. The only downside was basically  managing all the money, supervising the cashiers, open/closing the store, doing payroll, making schedules, controlling all shipment, keeping track on infentory, basically being a GENERAL MANAGER, i got paid the amount of a part-time cashier which was completely unfair."
good,I had fun working as a cashier the work was easy and the co-workers was helpful
good,"Normal cashier duties, have learned how to complete tranactions, most of the management are nice and easy to get along with, most co-workers are good at working as a team, the hardest part is being on my feet all day, the most enjoyable part of my job is getting paid every friday."
good,"It was a great place to start out at. All we really focused on was exemplary customer service, maintenance of the merchandise, shelves, racks and aisles. Maintenance means making sure your department is clean, swept, and the stock straight. Always talk to customers there no matter what they are doing. Kept a good record with management. Downfall, you are expendable to them. Also, like in any retail store, do not share any personal information with other employees. Spreads like a wildfire around the store. Keep work business at work and home business at home. Never mix the 2, Burlington will ruin you."
good,My day started with filling out daily reports & then marking any inventory that was received & helping customers with their selection of shoes
good,"Created new processes and systems for increasing customer service satisfaction."
good,Wonderful place to work if your a people person and love retail! I enjoyed helping others and greeting them each day!
good,I developed new skills working there. Being time cautious was very important as-well as securing the store and its merchandise. I also got along very well with my co workers. workers
good,A typical day at the workplace I would have to say was very busy and unorganized. I learned how to treat other clothing stores with more respect because I learned that some people just will throw clothes wherever they feel. The hardest part of the job I would say was the end putting everything back in its place in a specific amount of time when everything is out of its proper place. Overall I enjoyed getting to be able to participate in helping customers find what fits and looks the best.
good,"I loved working for Burlington I just had relocated "
good,I enjoyed working here. Employes are nice and some management. Work load is light most times and easy. Never short handed on staffing. Garunteed lunch and breaks. Decent hours.

good,"great for a high school student"
good,"Management was not good at all, and co workers were very disrespectful to each other. the job was to risky and wasn't worth the pay"

good,Great disocunt. Fun atmosphere. great oppertuntity for growth. I would recamend people to work there. Hardest part of job was not spending my whoel check there.

good,"I was hired as a seasonal employee during the holidays. I felt that I did not receive sufficient training for my position, and I felt clueless most of the time as nobody would help or explain how anything worked to me! The store manager was extremely rude to me--however, the other managers/supervisors/employees were very friendly and easy to work with."
good,Not enough training in security or loss prevention.  Management didn't have access to cameras and it made dealing with shop lifters difficult.  Mostly it was greeting customers.
good,"We prepare the merchandises in the store before opening. I learned how to do the fitting room, layaway, layaway runner, shoe department, Sale's Assoc."
good,This company is a good and fun work place they are willing to work with u on your hours and points before trying to fiering you I love working for them during there seasonal hours

good,being that i loved retail so much anything about it made me happy to a new level! i loved going to work and dealing with customers and then some. i loved the job what more can i say
good,I worked for Burlington Coat Factory for 12 years and made a lot of good friends...I would still be there if it was not for the Lay off of 2009.  They worked w/ you on family life.
good,"It was an good experience for life they really know how to make people feel welcomed into a new environment, I would recommend this job to a good friend"
good,The job is okay the tasks given to you are very easy. They just expect to much of us in a short amount of time and not enough staff or payroll. The management cant seem to get along.

good,"Always something to do at Burlington, so many customers wanting to find the right gift for a loved one. Easy when everything is color coordinated and you know exactly what you're looking for."
good,"I worked here for maybe 3 months, it wasn't too bad. Usually busy and when not busy your cleaning and organizing bins. Management was very nice and didn't give you a hard time if needed time off or if your running late. Probably the hardest part of the job is dealing with all the rude customers. You'll get asked for coupons all the time when in fact they never really come out only during holiday season.... Plus its a discount store so why would then give coupons???? lol. But anyway, pretty cool place to work, you may need to work two jobs because just this job will not pay the bills because minimum wage is so low."
good,The company blended off-price business with a presentation that offers style and merchandise alternatives.  Broad scope of products with a big focus on children's apparel.
good,Train all employees step-by-step before throwing them out on the floor but overall I enjoyed working at Burlington Coat Factory it was a great experience I learned new things grown from the experience.

good,"Everyday is pretty much set. You clock in, do whatever assignment your manager ask of you, take your breaks and lunches as required, and clock out. You learn customer service, how to multi task if you dont already, and more depending on your job title. Management is friendly but strict at the same time. Make sure you get your work done but enjoy yourself as you're doing it. Most of the time your co-workers will become everyday friends. That shows how friendly the environmentand coworkers are at Burlington Coat Factory. The hardest part of the job is when it comes down to the holidays & there's a big rush and you're constantly moving throughout your entire shift. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the customers & co-workers. The all make this experience a wonderful one!"
good,"I liked working there, but I do need more per hour income, or more annually whichever. The more mature co-workers work to be supportive, yet I have felt personally judged and overheard remarks about my performance where it should not have been versed. That person was in no position to make same judgement call. My experience of 20 years reveals this often, and it usually comes from someone of an immature persona. Please also realize that I am not beyond just tolerating as most peoples lives have been traditional mine has not been. And so, I am not unaccustomed to this behavior at work.  I unfortunately have learned to tolerate same if must."
good,Burlington was a great experience for me we had fun time everyone got alone with one another worked together.i loved shopping after on my days off discounts came in handy
good,"I Left Burlington a decade ago, and I still miss working there.  The pay was not great, but everyone got along, helped each other with tasks. Management often brought in snacks and sometimes we had potluck, etc.  Great place for me!"
good,It was cool meet some cool down to earth people but if you have a car you will be fine management was not fair steal haven’t receive my pay and they would transfer me closer.
good,The pay was minimum wage but you know how options go. The management was wonderful. I lost my car and refused to take the bus ride the distance from my house.
good,"It was a great job I loved helping the customers and how laid back the work day was."
good,Usually its a pretty easy day at work! I'm about to speak with the manager upon my arrival in reference to task I'll be completing at work for the day and usually after that I'm pretty much working on that task until its finished!
good,It was fine. I really don't know why this site is making me do this. I just wanna apply for jobs to get some money cause I quiit Burlignton cause it sucks.
good,Management makes decision butdoesnt own their bad decisions. There is lot of favoritism and they don't follow their policies on promotion: if you apply you are granted an interview or at least a response. Instead they choose to just ignore applications even from current employees which doesnt do well for morale.
good,I'm was able to increase my productivity in a fast paced environment with I'm able to use in all aspects of every day life today. Also I was able to improve as a team player and learned to be a leader.
good,I like working there it’s a job to start with the manger and workers were very nice if I had to I would totally work there again as a part time job good job for students
good,I would definitely recommend any one to work here it had decent pay and great ppl fun environment bosses are nice and very understanding with your problems
good,Most enjoyable part is giving the customer a great expirience so much so that they come back again and remember you. Also a job that is never dull or boring.
good,All management and staff were easy to work with.  Day went by quickly with fast pasted work load.  Met new friends each and every day.  Enjoyed the work but didn't enjoy working with all the hangers.
good,I was a customer service representative at Burlington Coat factory. It was a nice experience for someone just getting off of high school and transitioning into college.
good,"Visit store and walk floor acnolege good work and make suggestions for better use of floor space and locations.  Culture very laid back."
good,"Burlington is a great work environment. Diverse employees that I worked with where very informative and helpful. The hours could have been better. There should have been a position for Full time Cashier were I worked, but yet it still made due."
good,"work was fast paced, help all over the store when needed, good employees, met many interesting people. Some managers went above and beyond the call of duty to help when needed."
good,"Work day usually goes by fast because there's a lot of things to do to keep you busy. Customers make a mess and it gets frustrating at times, but it keeps you busy."
good,"I got the job while I was in school, and the hours did work for me for a while, but I had to quit because of school getting harder. Management was good, but a bit unorganized which isn't a problem because they are very nice people. Everyone was nice. Only downsides were we would be short staffed a few times, which meant having to work a bit harder. Also, the shifts are only in the early mornings at 6 or 7am on  maybe 3 weekdays. Sometimes weekends had to be worked. If you're looking for a part time job for a little extra money then I would consider applying. a 15% discount is what you're able to get and goes up to 30% for a week every other month( I believe)."
good,"hang up clothes, clean dressing rooms, and help customers is a big part of the job. Co workers were always nice and managers made me feel comfortable enough to talk to them about any questions or concerns."
good,Pays 7.50 to start for 6 monnths then goes to 9.00 hourly but I'd have preferred to be able to get small raises and work my way up the pay scale so I wouldnt need a second job to support myself until i got to the 9$ hourly
good,Load/Unload trailers make tight walls for maximum space in the trailers kept my workplace clean. worked as the shipping clerk also when needed had a gym onsite to workout if you wanted
good,Working for Burlington is great. However they are very limited on hours. Usually p/t is all that is offered and during slow seasons they will only offer 12 hours per week.
good,"Very great place to work at and the staff and team get along very well with each other, cultured, diverse, and very healthy environment to work in comfortable and secure."
good,"alright company to work for, no complaints they could pay the employees a little bit more especially during the holiday time and provide a greater discount but its a good company"
good,it was a good atmosphere to work in.i love working with the coworkers i had. manager were very friendly and helpful.the work was real easy .the customer are great. the prices are cheap.
good,Very good company. They acknowledge employees of they time served. Very family originated and get parties  and a lot of team work. The managers always motivated you to do better and make a change in the company.
good,your co- workers are not your friends strictly go to work and make your money so you can take care of responsibility at home.it is a fast workplace have to be able to provide excellent customer service to customers clean up and go home
good,i love the fact you get paid weekly. a typical day at work is like any retail store. i learned that you can move up easily.management wasn't so bad just lack of communication
good,"1Amazing people, great place. Good clothes with great prices. Clean and everyone who works there is so kind and generous. Its a lot of peoples favorite place to shop."
good,Nice place to work at .Employers in upper management was friendly station was clean easy place to work at the hours not long follow instructions easy.
good,"You have to always keep your customers happy and satisfied of course I did everything cashier,fitting rooms which was the hardest but I stick with it ,merchandise,counting money I work in the back unloading the truck putting the stuff where it goes n the back getting it ready to be put out in the store ."
good,I like working at Burlington. I had great friends there that cared about one another. My manager was just the greatest at all time. he was all about work but he was caring and understanding.
good,It's a lot of physical work and be prepared to stand all day. The managers were tough on you and sometimes made a hostile work environment. About twice a month they provided us with free lunch
good,I am a Sales Floor Associate I also am a backup cashier. I make tags for the merchandise. Also I help rearrange fixtures. Our job as sales floor associates is to make sure everything has a Burlington tag on it and making sure everything is placed in the correct place on the floor.
good,"A typical day for me at Burlington would be very simple. I would have to "
good,"Co workers were amazing to work with. Had some trouble with management,besides a selected few. maintained well.Good place to work for High school students"
good,"Una empresa con muchos beneficios, y el personal es muy amable"
good,pretty fun to work in the back you get to be active and it is early in the mourning so when you finish you have a lot of time left in your day to do whatever you want with. Depends on who your supervisor is though.
good,"I enjoyed working with the employees at Burlington, I learned a lot working with them. I learned a lot from the different employees that I worked with,"
good,"ocused on administrative work, such multiline phone answering • Computer data entry • Overseeing audits, scheduling, accounting payable, invoices company information • Administering breaks, lunches, and supervised front end department of a team of 15-30 employees • Solve any customer service related issues over the entire store by phone or in person"
good,"This is a fun company to work for a part time job, Its always something different with the customers .Management is great and "
good,at Burlington Coat Factory I've learned how to manage time to time and how to communicate with Co-Workers. At first it was hard on sport department because it was my first job but after a while i started to get used to it.
good,Walked around making sure the customer was satisfied and did not steal! Helped every customer that needed assistance and make sure they had a pleasant  shopping experience and protected all employees!
good,"Loved my position there."
good,"Assisting with clients, making sure the customers are happy and satisfied. i love working with my co-workers they are so fun and accepting. i don't think there is a hard part in my job i love it. Most enjoyable part is interacting with my customers and keeping them happy."
good,It is a great place to work for if you need extra money but not as good if its your only income. Hours are bad and certain staff is rude.
good,Burlington is both a great place to work and grow. I really enjoyed my time here but I am not excited about selling clothing. I would have been happy here forever but I was to be excited about coming to work and I wasn't and it showed.
good,the work place is usually good. my co-workers are great people and never really give a hard time. my managers are great and really understanding when it come to personal situations. an typical day at work is usually pretty good customers rarely give a problem so most days go smoothly. the hardest part of the job is just counting out the cashiers at the end of shifts. the most enjoyable part of the job is talking with customer you meet really interesting people.
good,Always intesting to see what new merchandise comming thru the store each and every day. Greeting and meeting new customers was a plus. Never bored due to the misc we did in between customers like keeping our area clean and returning merchandise that needs to be trturned.
good,"customer service skills work with coworkers as a team"
good,The products are affordable to all types of consumer so it is not that hard to sell. You just have to use your convincing power to them on how come its cheap but you can use at a long time. So basically the things you need to know is the product qualities before you sell it. To be able for the consumer to patronize the product.
good,"I had a great experience in Burlington Coat Factory. I learned a lot from my peers and colleagues. From manager work to cashier work , I know what to do in the retail business."
good,"Being with Burlington has made me become more of a mutli-tasker, patience, and a goal oriented team leader. I work as a customer service supervisor where i supervise, and lead others to promote great customer service for the shoppers as well as instructed employers with rules to clean and organized the store. As a supervisor i work with the management team to drive the store to be successful and encourage the employees to make a good shopping experience for our customers."
good,"Working in time in holidays was kinf of fun because i had to work in fast paste and i love it , and  i interact with alot of people that come to the store and love doing that ... and my co-workers i get along with all them.. there nothing hard about my job."
good,It's a okay place to go. I would say it is a temporary place to work until you find some that pays more and a little better benefits.
good,Soon as I get to work I receive a happy greeting form my co-workers. I walk he mens department to find out what needs to be done. I find my manager find out if they need me to do some a.s.a.p. work. All the while meeting and greeting customers. Assisting them in anyway. Sometimes go to the front to run the cash registers. I like the end of the night putting everything back in its place because I get to see what we have.
good,"Absolutely loved working here from the time I did. There weren't too many downsides to this job, however there were a few. I felt like for the work that I did in my assigned department, I did not get paid enough or recognized for the hard work I put in. Overall, the management was AMAZING, and the co-workers here are completely friendly. This would be perfect for anyone looking for summer employment, or for a typical job to enjoy."
good,Burlington Coat Factory has taught me how to merchandise in the retail business and its very family oriented.
good,"Daily shipments received, unlaoded all merchanside onto convery belt. Then sorted and seperated all clothing depending on deparments, then thier after hung, stripped, and tagged merchnadise according to style to prepare for neat day sales"
good,"My responsibility is to make sure that my area, which was the junior section and the shoe department was tidy clean. But what I've learned from this job was to always stay busy but also learn to enjoy it while doing it. My co-workers that I work with were awesome because they were there when you needed them but they were all very helpful. The hardest thing about this job was focusing on both department and trying to keep up on my cleaning. The most enjoyable thing I like was listen to music while working because it got me through the day."
good,great place to work but not enough pay i learned new things and the co workers were wonderful
good,Overall I loved my co workers and our great team of leaders who promoted teamwork
good,working together as a team in a quick environment and providing excellent  customer service.
good,burlington is a great place to work. the team work among associates is amazing.
good,I always was there when a customer need any help. Most important thing is good customer service.
good,I enjoyed working with this company. The store was always busy and It was a pleasure working with the customers. I learned how to handle my own register and control transactions. My co-workers were nice and extremely helpful. The hardest part of the job was dealing with unpleasant customers and the most enjoyable part of the job was working people and being social.
good,It gets pretty busy on the weekends but I learned that if you just stay at peace and keep doing your job you're fine.My coworkers are great to work around and the customers are why I love my job there.
good,I enjoyed working at Burlington it sucks I couldn't keep working there for personal reason though. The only problem was the pay there pay is very low. I mean we stand there for very long period of times we bend over a lot. But overall I liked Burlington.
good,Enjoy working in a good atmosphere and Customer satisfaction. With a smile and appreciation ineah sale. Like to succeed and try to get a hire position Learning more skills and being updated with technology.
good,I liked my job its just the hours that i dont like and its to much i want something not to stressful and i need more pay what i get now is just not enough
good,Since I was seasonal hours were scarce however the team is welcoming and inviting everyday! They have different days where you either make something or dress a certain way and that adds on fun to the job you know!
good,"Burlington is a great job they are flexible but, they didn't pay well for the work I did in the back. Didn't mind the work but, would have liked a full 8 hour day with a better pay at the time I worked there they start u out at $9.00 You get paid every week which is a plus but that still wasn't enough. Left because of pay and hours."
good,Again I love working with and for Burlington it's a great environment to work and meet people employees and customers as well. My only negative about working here was the hours working 20 hours and less.
good,Hired right before peak holiday season. Worked early morning stock. Came in at 6 or 7am and was done before 3pm. Sometimes done way before then just depends on how big the truck is. And only worked 3 to 4 days a wk which was perfect for me bc I'm a mom. Nice staff. A plus is you know spanish bc most of the stock crew is of Spanish decent.
good,"A typical day at work is taking care of customers, cash them out and organize everything. I learned better way to serve the customers. Is a very diverse workplace where everybody is respected. The hardest part of the job is making sure that the prices are the right ones. The most enjoyable part is knowing the customer leaves happy."
good,"Typical day; Was shockingly okay depending on the patience of customers"
good,Faced paced at all times. Work in a very big store. MOD are very nice and there's a good team. Hours work great for me. I've also seen a lot of growth for those that seek it.
good,"I enjoyed my time but the pay was very low and I had a long commute.  "
good,"I work at Burlington as a supervisor, its a challenging job because of the different personality you have to deal with but if you have empathy for your fellow man its a great job"
good,I enjoy working at Burlington because of the positive feedback you get. Most businesses spend too much time pointing out the negative and not enough of on the positive. I appreciate that Burlington doesn't do that.
good,they give you health insurance as a full time employee. they also have a good management team that will help you with the customer service. the loss prevention team was also humble and will help you through your shopping with Burlington Stores.
good,My manager at Burlington was great. All the co-workers were nice. I was trained by a CSS and did not get proper training but i figured everything out by myself. The only thing i seen messed up was the fact that the night shift had to do a lot more work than the first shift workers. It would be great for someone who is trying to find there first job. There is a lot of young people that work at Burlington. I would have to say night shift was the hardest because we closed at 10pm and only had 1 hour t clean the whole store put hangers up from every register. The most enjoyable part was being a Cashier because you get to interact with all the customers and their children.
good,Working at Burlington you willl be given short shifts and sometimes you would close late an open early back to back. They don’t schedule enough cashiers and working on the floor under management is terrible . Holiday season is so bad
good,A retail store in the city with a wide variety of merchandise for every person. The company provided advancement but within management. Loss prevention associates must maintain a safe environment for the employees and customers. Management and employees should work together as a team. There were no paid leave and vacation time.
good,"I love Burlington. I don’t like the pay. My supervisor is great, my store manager is great but I can’t say that about the other salaried managers. I consistently work about 4 hours a day. We rarely work above 20 hours a week"
good,"I'll work again 50 hours and call more  often a0. Thank you."
good,Great place to work if you love retail and have flexible availability. Good management and friendly co-workers. Good job to gain work experience in retail.
good,"Always something to do. Kept you busy and made sure you earned your money. Friendly staff, always willing to help out. Very organized with how they went about assigning duties to employees"
good,I loved working here lots of fun putting outfits on mannequins and seeing all the sales and clearance racks. Loved seeing customers come back and become regulars in my cashier line.
good,"My position was seasonal. However, co-worker work together as a team. The pay wasn't Real great but it kept me by. I encourage high school student...."
good,Burlington coat factory is a great plave to work at. Working at Burlington the customers will put a smile on your face. Even though its a fast place you will like it. The worst part is picking up clothes and hanging them up continuously.
good,"If an employee work long enough at Burlington there are advancement offers. The work is simplified by the all supervisors, the tasks are not complicated,"
good,thers really no room to grow. Most employers that are there has been there for decades so you have to wait til they come up in postion. Your schedule is never the same.
good,"I had to stock shelves and clean up, put clothes on hangers, also do price check on items to make sure it was the right price. Customers Ask where the bathroom at a lot and i show them. Communication was great and there wasn't rude people at all."
good,El empleo actual que tengo es muy bueno pero no se adapta a lo que estoy buscando. Busco un trabajo a tiempo completo o uno a medio tiempo
good,Working at Burlington was a really good  experience for me because it was my first job . Working a Burlington was tuff at first but I adjusted and the work started becoming very easy .
good,the store was average in terms of working conditions. it wasnt always enjoyable because of things like air conditioning not always working and the elevator always breaking down
good,"Always busy, consistant job responsibilities, loved helping customers, loved making merchandise look appealing to the eyes of the customer. loved everything"
good,Enjoyed helping cuatomers and really good managment salary and not enough hours given too many employees for so little hours
good,Overall great work environment I enjoy the staff the management and the whole atmosphere...I dislike the short hours given. OF COURSE THERE IS CHANCE AT ADVANCEMENT LIKE OTHER COMPANIES WHICH IS A PLUS. The warehouse leader is amazing and really belives in chances and working with his crew. Burlington offers an open door police that is completely confidential
good,I rly enjoyed working here. Most of the people were nice and helpful. The work schedule even for a part timer was nice and was straight forward so you always knew what day and time you had to work and rarely ever changed
good,Working at Burlington is fun because it is constantly changing. You are always replacing old stock with new stock. The customers love it when you know where everything is. The co-workers are fun to work with as well.
good,"Empty trash cans, sweep floors, ticket merchandise, work on add merchandise to ensure proper display. Give tips on lose prevention and keep as many cameras working as possible. Keep register stocked with bags, put up layaways.  And get layaways for customers."
good,"No hours yet they are always hiring and cannot accomodate the staff they already have. whats 12hrs a week? one day lunch. its ridiculous, its a great place to work however thats when you are on the schedule."
good,"cashier , seasonal, interacted with different people enjoyed seeing all the different items that were sold for the Christmas season"
good,Some of are days are very busy and can get crazy at times but we manage to keep going and make it a better day. Some of the things i learn since I've been there was good communication skills and better customer service skills. I love management they have taught me so much and helped me as a person.
good,"I had never worked in retail before and I loved my job there.  I love to shop so it was great.  It became one of my favorite stores. I would definitely recommend the company, but some of the stores I have been to need some new staffing."
good,At typical work day was full of crazy characters which taught me just how much patience I have. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing the customers leaving with a smile after coming to my register.
good,"Working for Burlington has provided me with an opportunity to improve my operational, recruiting, and leadership development skills."
good,"Counting down register,Greeting Customers with a smile, assisting customers with layaways, enjoy working with my coworkers."
good,"I work in the receiving department, a fast paced environment. I have learned to balance between speed and efficiency at work. I enjoy my team mates and the managers. They create a friendly work environment."
good,"I started working at Burlington Coat Factory my senior year of high school. It is a fun place to work, and the environment is nice."
good,Burlington is company that you can enjoy work but be yourself. Coworkes are amazing and easy to work with when you have such an amazing team. I regret leaving.
good,"the work was mostly labor "
good,making sure shelves were stocked and helping customers. doing mark downs. the most enjoyable parts were the hours
good,"The management was good , co-workers were nice the hardest part was trying to keep the customers happy but I knew I could do it . But overall the job was nice and fun."
good,"when i would get to work i put all the products out "
good,I've been with Burlington Coat Factory for over three years learning customers wants and needs while building long term relationships with customers. Also I've gained trust from managers and supervisors to run the front end registers while managers and supervisors weren't present.
good,"Had been let go for medical reasons and felt it was not fair nor right, managers husband worked there and felt it was not right to sisters whom worked there made one quit."
good,"You where expected to know your area well as well as be flexible to go to different areas to help when needed. Typically my days where the same, I would clear out the fighting rooms, straighten my floor area and help customers. On occasion I was scheduled to do other things, like cashiering, mark down, back room and other sale floor areas. My co-workers where very helpful when I needed it and they could provide it, we all worked together as a team no matter what area we where working in. The managers where good, sometimes they could seem very distant and overwhelmed. But for the most part they made sure everyone was doing there part. Even though being on the floor by myself in the mornings was challenging, because I had to cover the whole floor. It was the most enjoyable because I got to utilize my multitasking skills more and got to help more customers out as well. "
good,Working for Burlington Coat Factory was great especially the first week there. My manager show me around the first day introduced everyone of my co workers to one another.A few of the older woman show me around nd taught me ways to go about my work and so on.The time spent with BCF was definitely was a learning experience i will never forget .
good,I learn a lot at Burlington Coat Factory Because that was my first job Ever and it was only a summer job so I only worked a few months but I worked in retail I loved it and I will like to find another Job in retail. but one thing I most Liked about it was Sizing Clothing and Greeting the customers as they walk tthrough the door It was very Exciting for me and i wish I could kept that job all year around but it was through the school and only for the summer.
good,"Helping customers with their needs. Managers are great, they work with you on anything you ask of them. Co workers are awesome, we are all a team player and love what we do. At first the hardest part of the job was setting up the store to actually open it. I really love working/dealing with customers, and making the work environment a happy and fun place for all."
good,"• Receive payment by cash, check, credit cards, vouchers, or automatic debits.."
good,I love working at Burlington. The management is understanding and helpful. Coworkers are friendly and welcoming. Customers come in and appreciate being greeted. I've learned a lot of skills from my fellow teammates most of whom I consider family now. I really enjoy the holiday potlucks.
good,"i liked working here because i loved my coworkers and the managers were amazing. but the store is usually a mad house and customers will destroy the store, disrespect you and steal."
good,"I started as a regular sales associate in mens and i learned how to interact with costumers .I learned how to perform as a team helping my fellow workers.it help me to learn how to deal with different troubled situations .The management has been improved over the course i worked. I am part of the management as a Part time C.S.S . i try to make it a better environment for employee and customers.The pay per hour is low ,the only thing hard about the job."
good,Working at Burlington has taught me alot about working in retail. It's a fun environment and everyone is easy to get along with. The managers are great and they're very flexible
good,"meet alot of people with different backgrounds. Fun and exciting work place, Room to learn and grow with the company. easy going managers and flexible work hours."
good,Great place to work at.management is great pay could be a little better we work well as a team  the growth is wonderful they always looking for leaders
good,I really enjoy working there I need it more pay but for the work the pay rate is fair. Great staff there's always something to do great incentives for employees you feel included
good,"Im a hard worker but unfortunately they dont provide enogh hours, i enjoy being around people and also helping them. Im self motivated and dont need to be told twice."
good,"The job at Burlington was great. However, the pay is low and the hours are way too low. I have nothing to say. I only worked their for a month. I unsuccessfully tried to trasnfer to another location."
good,"Great work environment. Ability to be retained after seasonal period end. Work well with supervisors and peers. Sort merchandise from rook rack by male, female, young men, junior, children infants, home, shoes, accessories.y Hang merchandise by brand, size, department. Place on sales floor with strong emphasis on eye appeal"
good,The com apanha was not well organized. The Workplace culture was great. Everyone tried to help everyone and worked as a team.Although sometimes there were some difficulties.
good,coworkers are amazing to work with. hardest part of job is getting yelled at by customers for enforcing the policy and then having a manager over rule the policy so it makes you look like you were lying.
good,"I started out as a seasonal cashier of last year (2018 ) and I worked EVERYDAY!  ALL THE TIME.  EVERY CHANCE I GOT!  with that being said I got promoted about 6 months in to a full time sales floor associate!  I have my own department,  and I enjoy all my coworkers!  It's never a dull moment with my Burlington family.  Really in truely you'd be blessed to be apart of our team!  It can be stressful  but at the end of the day it's all worth it if your happy!!!  Management is a bit on the down side,  but deep down it's a great place to work & I highly recommend coming to be apart of our team!!!"
good,I love working with the Burlington coat factory. I have learned a lot with the company. How to handle different customer service issues . There is always room for growth in the company.
good,"I worked under different management... I do not know Burlington's current management."
good,It was a great job but it is hard to move up in the company. You first have to apply and speak with management and wait for them to make an assessment about your abilities. Pay could be better especially for someone with experience or who is a fast learner. They had me at part time but kept calling me in to cover people’s shifts. I was part time but working full time hours. Not cool.
good,Customer services is #1. There store are clean. Merchandising all the time. Recovery all the time. Time management when working your department. Friendliness
good,Co workers turn into family. Always organized if you have the right team. Would of stood but policies changed too much and I was the only one with a kid. Hours changed every week for under wage
good,cool it was okay job could have been better with all the robberies that were constently going on all day every other day at this store in particular cultural
good,"Enjoying working with the public at a fast-paced workplace. I have learned that a positive attitude when interacting with customers and employees will make a person's day go a whole lot smoother. Management understands the professional and personal day- to- day operates of the stores. The hardest part of the job is how to pace yourself as a cashier, handle exchanges and refunds in a quick, efficient manner for more than a few customers. Most enjoyable part of the job would be working with a great team of employees where everyone does there part."
good,"My supervisor and Leads were really friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful. I enjoyed the team spirit and being a part of the squad. I liked working there"
good,I increased my job skills and advanced my career with in 3 years. This job has given me the opportunity and growth I was looking for. Excellent job for high energy fast pace workers:)
good,My time working for Burligton was great. I never had any complaints. I had to leave due to my pregnancy but if i had the chance to work for them again i would
good,I honestly love Burlington. I wouldn't have wanted to leave if it wasn't so hot in there.. i feel like my day doesn't match my hard work for what i do..
good,friendly team and flexible schedule. But low wages and unpromising career growth. there are no benefits. There is only a discount on the goods. A good place to work with part-time.
good,"not enough hours. great people, no chance for promotion unless you apply for higher position. you stand on your feet all day expect the 10 mins break you get and your lunch"

good,I enjoyed working at Burlington. I learned a lot and had direct access to hiring managers.  They valued my input and that was important. Decent benefits.
good,"At first arrival, I was always greeted by security and then go to the break-room to put my stuff in a locker and wait for my shift to begin. I would then go to the front of the store to find out what cash register number I was assigned to. Depending on my shift hours, I would get two short breaks and a lunch break.This job location was the only place that hired me with little to no experience as a cashier at a retail store. I learned how to attach and remove clothing censors, make new price tags, create  layaway plans for customers, find products in stock and in other Burlington stores, etc. The managers and supervisors were always helpful and understanding. The work environment was pretty good. I had amazing coworkers and customers and usually things went smoothly. The hardest part of my job was dealing with upset customers. The most enjoyable part of my job was when I attended nice and patient customers."
good,"Burlington was a very fun and nice environment to work in really nice people and hard workers. That was my very first retail job and I really enjoyed it. Managers were super nice and the job wasn't really too hard unless the boxes were way too heavy. What I enjoyed most was when we would get the work done the bosses would reword us with breakfast or lunch, which was pretty nice of them. Enjoyed all my co-workers also they taught me everything I needed to know."

good,Love working there. Good hours and the people are great  would work there again. It's great place to shop save money and look good doing it all the same time
good,It was a fast past job that requires you to be able to deal with different personalities and still remain calm and humble yourself management then was all over the place supervisors didn't really know what they we're doing and management would put everything off on the supervisors the hardest part of the job was not being able to take your break in peace without being called back to work and the enjoyable part was getting paid every week
good,"The management here is the best I have and probably will ever experience. The people are so family like and open. I loved this job and wish it could have been forever but with the pay and the hours I had I had to leave to get a full time job. But as a side job, I would without a doubt recommend."
good,"I wouldn't have chosen to leave if after christmas i was still ""employed"" by them and not on the schedule. I got hired before ""seasonal"" positions were being asked for. I need to feed my family and theres no way i can do that while i have no scheduled hours in this store. Everything else is positive and nice. No complaints."
good,"Job was pretty laid back, so was the staff. I could say the only negative was the location due to the rude customers and frequent shoplifters, but you get that with any job."
good,I would help unload trucks and process merch. and take to sales floor.I learned to work fast and accurately. Management was very fair.Pleasant co workers. Hardest part of jobe was heavy lifting Best part of job was opening new merchandise.
good,Loved the job but it was a more slower pace than I was used to working.  I was confined to an office and wanted to work more with customers face to face.
good,In working at burlington I learned how to work in a retail environment and deal with customers in a way that's wholly different from food service. They also provide ample opportunity to move up.
good,"Overall, a great job to have. You're on your feet alot, but the customers make it worth it. Management is pretty great as well, some travel required.."
good,I just love coming in to work with coworkers who are team motivated and are all about serving the customers needs to leave the Burlington store with satisfied smile.

good,"Fun place to work at meet a lot of great people. Unfortunately they where not able to hold up their end of the deal with trying to promote me, but non the less it was a great learning experience"
good,"Working at Burlington Coat Factory has been pretty good so far. I haven't been working there for long, but during onboarding schedules were discussed thoroughly so they could make sure your work wouldn't interfere with outside activities. They're open-minded about attending college, and the co-workers are great, friendly people who ease the nerves of your first day."
good,I do like working for Burlington the people are great but the is a few problems. I do not get paid enough for the work and hours that I put in. They don't appreciate some of the work you put in.
good,I Loved it it was a very unique experience loved my bosses and the activities that they would have for us. They also showed gratitude with lunches and many more greatly felt appreciated
good,"A typical day at work was busy and fast moving all the time but kept the shift moving and customers happy. I learned while being employed at Burlington was that everything matters such as speed, attitude, courteousness, your opinion about what customers have found, compliments and especially communication. I enjoyed working with the management they were always nice and friendly and open armed felt as if you could talk about anything and they would understand. The hardest part of the job i would say was the end of a busy day and having to clean the whole store up before the next day. The most enjoyable part of the job is feeling like everyone their is like family and welcoming new associates with open arms."
good,Very busy environment. The hardest part of the job is that when people called you have to do your job and the person job. They dont pay enough for what people do there.

good,"A typical day at Burlington consisted of assisting customers with merchandise and processing their transaction.  I learned hear how to deal with different personalities in the workplace.  The management team was helpful at times, but at times they were under stress.  My co-workers and I got along very well.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with irate customers (which was my first encounter).  I learned how to deal with them better.  The most enjoyable part of this job was assisting customers with decisions."
good,"coming into work to see my work area a disaster from the previous employee gave me the push to work harder on my shift in order to get alll tasks done before quitting time. being able to work at my own pace and to move around made my job a little more enjoyable. helping customers is always a plus, even the difficult ones especially when they leave the store smiling. the managment and co workers made the job fill like second nature more like a family like environment. overall it was a good job for me at the time, the hardest part of  the job was the pay"

For example, Within the month of January of this following year; I received employee of the month. In addition, I learned that my compassion for other people; rather they love me or despise in any kind of way, helping is always the right thing to do. I'll never know when someone is going to share their time and efforts with me. "

good,"Ive always loved burlington. When I first started working there I was a cashier, then I left and came back. The departments aren't really that hard to maintain you just have to focus and not get frustrated when a customer does something that bothers you. The hours then give could be alot better. But its not the most horrible job out there. Atleast your getting paid good."
good,I enjoyed going to work. I worked well with others and management was fare.
good,"supervise up to 15 people, customer service, treat people like you want to be treated when going to a retail store, people were great-customers and co workers, management was fantastic to work with, having to leave due to gas prices being to high which made it impossible to drive back and forth to work."

good,"A really great place to work. Could use some stablity in management. The pay was the worst thing about this job. I think as big as this company is and as much work that is put into the company the pay could be a lot better. Minimum wage for a job that one person does is really the job of three people. Store 739 has some great workers and are willing to work, but they don't feel appreciated."
good,"My personal review is that they had a lot of things lacking for them, but  they made me feel welcomed. Very cultured people that were nice to everyone."

good,I liked the way the trainers and managers as well as the leads kept working together and always tried to keep everyone working and trying to make our quota
good,it was fasted paced adventure . but it was also a great experience. the pay was pretty good for me being young. but it wasn't career status good. overall I would recommend it

good,everyday i go to work i feel relieved from whatever problems i had at home and the management team is just as amazing as well the other burlington associates. really the only downfall is i dont get many hours or days scheduled for it to be such a big company and still looking to hire new people.
good,Working at Burlington was a fun and great experience the only reason why I left was because they pay wasn’t good enough to help my monthly bills. If they would raise the pay I would definitely go back again.

Thanks to him, I got over my fear of handling money. The place was very organized from the start. We tried improving it right after we got a new store manager but he quickly changed our routine at keeping the store organized and we went from working in two pairs in each dept to working as a whole team in all depts. That was one of the jobs that helped me grow a lot. Loss Prevention/ security is great. They are always on the look out for trouble and or anyone that might harm the safety of the customers and store.

I learned hard work and a great attitude will get you far. The management was very friendly but the supervisor was very prejudice because I did not speak Spanish. She would shorten my hours because of that. I got along great with my co-workers and even made a few friends. The hardest part of the job was making sure everything went in the right place.

good,"Working at Burlington feels like being with family, everyone genuinely cares about each other and helps each other out. From the first day, I felt immediately welcomed. I work as a customer service cashier, so on a daily basis I do regular transactions, returns, exchanges, layaways. Also, I use a multi-line telephone to direct customers to correct departments to answer any questions, and I also look up items in other stores for customers. At this company, I learned many things such as saying the closing announcement in spanish, creating tags for merchandise, and how to do layaways. The management there are very knowlegeable about the store, and do their best to create a great store for customers as well as employees. My co-workeres are amazing. They all work really hard and are very friendly. I genuinely care about these people and have made friends for life. The hardest part of the job is sometimes customers forget you're a person too, but we have a great team that can calm any situation down. The most enjoyable part of the job.........the discount! I love shopping here, and I can honestly tell customers that I do shop there and that the prices are extremely cheap compard to other stores. Also, I love meeting new people, new personalities, and helping people out. Customers mention my name in surveys alot, and they write great things about me on our website."
good,Burlington Coat Factory was a great atmosphere and environmental work place. I had a great experience working with others and meeting new people every day.
good,"I would clock in super early because of my position, but I also got off pretty early in the day. We would get straight to it, I scanned all the items in the store to see what went clearance. It was soo easy. We also got first pick at new clearance stuff haha. Which was neat. Coworkers were chill. Hardest part was having to go through every single item (but they might do it different now idk) Good work environment, no complaints rlly."
good,"I loved greeting the customers as they walked in, it made them feel welcome. I love seeing how fast I can check out the customers with a smile. I also loved working the floor because it helped me get aquatinted with the store, that way I could better assist customers. Freight was awesome because it provided a challenge in making sure none of the merchandise was not damaged and helping with loss prevention. The job overall was pretty fun and a great learning experience."
good,"I love it here , friends with all co workers , and management isnt as bad as usual. It gets very very busy but everyone works together to get everything done , i highly recommend"

good,Receive and unload truck with new merchandise sort out merchandise per sales floor department stock sales floor with new merchandise. The hardest part of the job was Christmas season with over loads of merchandise and minimal space to put it into.
good,"Great experience great support team "
good,"A typical day at Burlington in receiving requires me to break down a truck, separate what comes in off the truck, in to four groups on the floor, two groups with the clothes that come in, I work with the clothes in processioning what comes in, as in censoring and ticketing clothes, Also putting things to the floor. I've learned so much when it comes to receiving to processing merchandise. completing my work in a timely matter, whatever meets the time requirements. working on the floor, has showed me how to maintain a position i can see myself doing more of, like to help where i'm needed, Great at directing customers to merchandise on the floor, Id have say the hardesst part of my job is breaking down the truck in the morning which can require up to 300-350 boxes cut opened and separated that has to be done in a fast pace timely matter, Best part of my job is working with great people with the same energy you put out."

good,It was a great first retail job for no experience. After the first few days i was right on pass with the other works. They also had a very unified work community
good,got promoted quickly and learned a lot. Hardest part is getting through busy days with not much coverage in the store. Managers willing to work with you.
good,Great holiday job seasonal maybe for teenagers. And the pay could be better and they could give more hours. But other then that its a good job you get to meet new people be a team player amd help customers.
good,"My overall review of Burlington would be that the management treated every employee the same, with respect and honesty. I think that I also learned a lot from working there as far as my cashier skills. Burlington made my cashier skills better and stronger. I am very thankful and grateful that I had the opportunity to be apart of their work environment."

good,"I used to work 3 days/week. Shifts were from 6am-10am. I spent most of the time in the receiving department working on freight. We used to get between 500-1,000 boxes/day, but we were a fast team so, it used to take 3 hours to get the job done. I used the cash register a few times. It wasn't an everyday role, but just for learning a little bit of everything."
good,"It was very sad to see the Topeka, KS location close, everyone at that store got along, the managers were great and very helpful and caring."

The environment was relaxed and everyone was helpful to each other."

good,"A typical day at Burlington would be to clock in, grab walkie talkie, place merchandise on the sales floor, assist customers and possibly ring up customers on the register if needed. I learned how to be a lead over Sales Associates and to take care of multiple departments at once. The job is easy and hands on learning. The most challenging part would be to ring on the register because I never had experience doing that before working here. The most enjoyable part is placing new merchandise on the sales floor and setting up displays according to holidays and seasons."
good,The job was great but management can be better. The position was terminated with no prior notice and that decision left many of us unemployed at the time
good,"Had the privilege to be apart of a fantastic team. Everyone worked well together to get the job done, especially around the holidays, with those layaways. It was a little rocky, during school, but they were  flexible with my school hours and were willing to let me change positions throughout the store. I really enjoyed working for the company !"

good,Management is great at this location. I haven't had any real issues with this company in the year that I was with them. I have a Burlington family because of this job. It's hard not to make friends at this company because a lot of the work takes team work and that's something Burlington requires.
good,Its a fun olave to work and everyone there is so nice! The managers care about their employees and there health and are family oriented. They akways ask how you are doing and make sure everything is good.
good,Managers are very nice and friendly. They work hard for everything to be well done and organized.  I really love working here but as a single mother I need something better.
good,For the position I had filled you must be able to work at a very quick pace as well as able to walk around a lot and move heavy boxes. You must also be careful because you use expensive equipment as well as dangerous ones like box cutters.
good,": Receiving merchandise from the warehouse, sorting the items and making sure the merchandise went to the rite area of the store, tagging each item clothes, shoes, baby items etc."

good,It's a great place to work at if you like short days or a simple secondary job. I like it though. The pay and hours could be more. I prefer long hours and more days.
good,The management at Burlington was the greatest they were team players when the associates need assistance they didn't hesitate to jump right in to help out.
good,"Worked for seasonal, and I understand times got busy, but while this was my first time working retail I didn't get any real training. I got shown stuff a couple times but didn't get to continue learning in the department I was hired for. I was called constantly to all other areas."
good,Typically we unload boxes on a belt and we begin to process everything from clothes to home goods. We then go to the floor of the store and sort each item by departments and put everything in the right place before our store opens.
good,pay low  great managers great hours  but the pay is low  managers are great  i loved working for burlington but they need to pay more  no benefits  sad

good,"I worked for them for almost 12 years.  My location had many associates that had been there for 7 years or more.  It was a family atmosphere.  The discount was good, 10% and sometimes 25%.  It can get stressful in the 4th quarter but any retail establishment usually is that time if year."
good,It was a very helpful experience.  It help me gain experience as well as teach me how to work with customers and work a computer system. It provided me with the knowledge of customer service and what it takes to be a great employee.
good,I love working here. Sometime there are days when you get frustrated. But the team at Burlington is the best. I learned how to talk to customers. The hardest part is taking insults and anger from the customers. The enjoyable is knowing that the employees will be behind you for any help you need.
good,"this was the best place I have ever worked, developed personal relationships with daily patrons, staff was great, cross trained if you wanted. overall nice employer"

good,Working at Burlington Coat Factory has taught me a lot about good management. The management at Burlington is rated to me at five stars. The reason why I say this is because they acknowledge their workers and always always courage them to do better. The work environment was very positive. I loved walking in to work and leaving out of work. Being a cashier at Burlington has also helped me improve on my Spanish speaking skills since it was diversed. It helped me to speed up my checkout area but also making sure I communicate with my customers so they can always come back with satisfaction.
good,"Associates that have worked for the company 15 to 30 years, that says something for the company itself. Working hard, but having a good time while doing it is a big part of the reason associates stay."
good,good job too work at discounts come in handy but the salary and py rate isn't at it's best could offer for more for the job and responsibilities that are required for the job position whether it's part timers or full timers
good,ITS A FUN PLACE TO WORK AND EVERYONE IS FRIENDLY JUST DONT GET ENOUGH HOURS AND WE ONLY WORK THREE DAYS OUT THE WEEK I don't get paid enough I only get paid 8.25 an hour and we only work three days and that's not always guaranteed cause we only work when we get trucks so if we don't get trucks then we don't have to work which means we don't get paid and that's less money for me out of my paycheck every week
good,Great Company to work for and there is room for advancement in the stores. Flexible hours for hourly associates. Management is very flexible.
good,Good management and family to work with.  But for future preferences to enhance more in terms of benefits for the employees.

good,"Burlington was a good, high energy place, yet so draining.

good,"I always wanted to work for Burlington ever since high school, when my family started shopping there. I felt I could have turned the atmosphere around a bit. Girls were always angry and not building Good repport with the customers. I do love customer service, but the pay was way to low for working mother's, father's and grandmother's to survive. Everyone had a second job which is tiring. Overall love the company and wished they offered more hours per week. I still would shop there and recommend people to shop there. Maybe another city would be a better place to work for a Burlington store. A place where my positive attitude and eager to help will be more welcomed. Thank you happy thanksgiving."

good,"It's a nice place to work at, The management is ok and my co-workers are fun to work with .Dealing wit the customers is a great learning experience far as trying to understand some one who don't speak English at all that well in order for you to communicate with them.

good,"Burlington was a great job to have, they just don't offer enough hours. You can only make up to 20 hours a week. If you have serious bills to pay you would need a second job. That would also be hard because you don't get a set schedule. You could close tonight and open tomorrow."
good,A lot of involvement with supervisors and co workers and made my customer service improve. Merchandising and handling with cash was improved also.
good,They did not pay enough and I needed more money. The trucks was late a lots and we had to go home or wait. Sometimes the merchandise came in broken.
good,I love my work environment always busy and it gets hectic ... ups and downs as with any job but nothing too serious my manager was lovely very nice and flexible with my schedule

A typical work day evolves bringing out new merchandise to the floor for tagging, visual merchandising newspaper items on sales floor by planograms, marking down items on sale, giving responsibilities to sales associates, customer service duties, counting tills at the end of the night, and sometimes assisting store manger with bank deposits. All of the Burlington co-workers are very polite. The hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers in a nice manner.

good,"Learned new customer services techniques(they trained me)"
good,"Consistent hours, lovely managers and supervisors and always kept busy. I've learned a new receiving process and adapted very well to it. I have amazing co-workers with great personalities.

good,"I enjoyed working at Burlington Coat Factory. I was one of the lead cashiers in the main Customer Service area, which meant that I rang up regular purchases as well as lay-aways, exchanges, and returns.

Head in to the shipping receiving department, unload incoming invoice and inventory, disperse amongst sales floor. After the inventory process the day would be hopping from depot to depot helping with break down and set up of displays, shelves, clothing racks etc."
good,"The place is great when it comes down to the co-workers. It doesn't matter how busy, how stressful the management is everyone teams up and work work work and there is always a laugh in it. Hardest part of the job I could say is dealing with customers but the job takes time and patience. The most enjoyable part is to see everyone getting along and doing what they got to do and still have a little fun on the side. Management is good, you have some managers that is really good and then you got one that one that thinks he's better then everyone because he's on top."

I worked for 5 years in the men's fitting, once she took over, I was moved to the ""coat gallery"". I could not get anyone to watch my department for a restroom break unless it was a manager. This was a problem because I have a weak bladder and management was impossible to get to relieve you. Many of my co-workers had already left before I had finally had enough."

On any given day when closing at 930 p.m. We didn't get out of work until midnight. The most enjoyable part of my job was the repeat customers and my team mates. The hardest part of my job was having the make pay role and cut hours and my crew earlier than scheduled. Management taught very well and always kept a positive outlook and attitude about the entire work day, whether it be a day with expected above average sales or below expected sales."

good,Great place to work. I love my job here team building comes first. anyone that can get in would be grateful to have the opportunity to be in such a work environment.
good,"Burlington is a discount store that provides brand new, name-brand items that are extremely affordable. Like all stores, they have slow times, but not very often. This store maintains a busy work-day and there is always something to do. My experience with Management has been welcoming and understanding. This was a place that I could grow and move-up and I did so pretty quickly. The hardest part of the job was dealing with extremely hard customers. Because this is a discount store, there is a percentage of customers that think they can haggle prices down. It is hard to make that judgement call because our prices are already so low that we lose money if we go any lower. That is why we try to keep damaged goods off the floor. But for the most part we have a good customer base and they love the store and we love our customers!"
good,"awesome! "

good,"One of the greatest things of working with people is to be able to deliver above satisfactory services to many customers. I believe this enhances the professionalism of many employees as well as the efficiency of the quality of corporate policies and procedures. At times we must face controversies at many jobs. But with great team players and finding solutions that can be implemented is whats very rewarding. When a company has employees that are producing quality work, it's a win, win for all employees that makes the workforce environment a happy place to work instead of a stressful workplace."

good,"I would typically come in and work on a plan for the day, then give everyone their assignments for the day.  Learned many new things on merchandising.  The hardest part of the job for me was having to let people go."
good,The overall work day was great. MAnagement would out you in the position you were going to be for the day and everyone was a backup cashier. The hardet part of the job was trying to finish one job before they placed you in an emergency cashier position. THe most enjoyable part of the job was being around new people (customers) each day.
good,the thing i enjoy the most and respect about the burlington store is the diversity. Not just within the employees but the management as well. I also love the chemistry between everyone who does work in the store. When relationships are built within the company it makes the workplace a better environment.
good,Burlington Stores is a great company to work for.  I would recommend this company to anyone looking for a career in Retail.  This company provides effective communication with their quarterly Town Hall Meetings and is also very involved in community events as well as internally.  Each Department interacts to effectively create a store that serves many different demographics.  Burlington Stores is a great place to work.
good,Burlington was a safe and fun productive work environment it helped me over come my many fears and it also helped me learn new things and meet new people. It was very challenging at first but my coworkers and my managers all were there to help me and to motivate me.
good,I have learned a lot about policies and procedures for the company.  How to properly detect and deter both internals and externals at the stores.  Overall a very good experience
good,"I enjoyed working for Burlington because it help me achieved my personal goal to work as an  Operation manager for a major  company. I was in charge of running the front-end customer service, warehouse receiving and processing merchandise. I was responsible for maintenance and cleanness of the store,. I have to make sure that payroll was done every week and cash office was running right."
good,Since working I have learned a lot about retail and everything that goes on to keep the store running smoothly and efficiently.  The retail busuiness can be very grueling and difficult. Having to deal with customers that aren't satisfied can be a challenge.  I feel I always had support from management and fellow coworkers.  I have learned that being patient and listening can definitely calm the situation. They have taught me different skills and ways to handle certain situations. I enjoy working with my fellow team members and management.
good,Store manager is great understand  and have all employees best interests at heart. Wish it was more room for improvement as to opening more positions for those who are able and willing to learn. Overall it's a great company to work in.
good,Burlington is energetic and fast pace environment. Management staff is always willing to help each associated. It is a balance for work life and allows room for growth. A great place to work.

good,"I love my job and my associates,it makes up for the fact that I have to work two jobs in order to meet every day loving standards. My managers and co workers are wonderful people. We are a close knit family and really work well together, as well as welcoming any new comers into the job and making them feel comfortable."

good,"-Fast paced environment, always something to do"
good,"Burlington was a wonderful place to work. My coworkers were friendly. Some years later, I still keep in touch with them. They are very polite. Be ready and willing to work though."
good,I have loved working at Burlington. The other employees are fun to work with and most take their job seriously. The store has gone through a change in management over the last year and the store is starting to really come together. With better employees who actually want to be there we are slowly but surely turning the store into somewhere you actually want to shop. As long as you bring a lighthearted attitude and a good work ethic you will fit right in. I do wish I made more than 8.50 an hour but you can negotiate based on experience (this was my first job in retail). They allowed me to take 2 months off due to me having a baby even though I didn’t qualify for maternity leave. If I wasn’t moving away I would stay and climb the ranks and join management one day. The customers can be difficult to deal with but that’s to be expected and it makes for some funny stories! Definitely reccomend working at this location.

good,"I believe Burlington to be a good sound company to work for. My typical day of work begins with emptying my return bin, tidying up my department, and assisting cashiers and other sales associates when needed. Depending on the flow of the day, and possible department plan-o-gram changes, I may or may not be in my department; another area may need help. "
good,"My experience with Edinburg, TX Burlington was great. The employees as well as the store manager were great and easy going. A typical day was work 3 days of the week when the receiving truck arrived, I forgot which exact days. I think it was Mon, Tue, and Thur. All you had to do was put stickers or tags on items and shelf them. Easy. You typically worked 4 hours from 7am to 11am. Sometimes less sometimes one to two hours more, depending on how much work there is to do. So you only work 12 hrs a week. Start pay is 7.50 after 90 days it's $9."

good,Probably the best place I have ever worked at. The only down side is really just the amount of work hours you get. Besides that the job is pretty easy and fast. I never had a really hard day at work.
good,It was a fast production line with all merchandise for Burlington Coat Factory. We would receive merchandise and we would grown through it all and place all items in their right boxes to be shipped out to the proper stores.
good,The hardest part of the job is dealing with inconsiderate customers. The best part is being able to talk to and learn from some customers who are kind and full of great information. Team work is emphasized and advancement for those who strive for it is available. Scheduling is flexible so great for those who are going to school or working two jobs.

good,co-workers was great to work with so was the bosses..store  was always clean and organizes ..my displays was my most enjoyable part of the day
good,"Great experience, typical day at work consisted of doing layaway's, returns, as well as exchanges."
good,"Working at Burlington was definitely a positive experience, the co-workers were the best, everyone was always in a positive mood, so if you are having a bad day that will change once you step into that store because everyone greets you with a smile. The hardest part of the job was probably dealing with customers who weren't having a good day and they just come and take it out on the employees, I would try my best to satisfy them and if they continued do be dissatisfied I would call a manager to help them out instead. I learned how to multitask school and work, it wasn't easy but I got it down, which makes me feel in a way accomplished. The management from Burlington was amazing, they would help me out in the best way possible if I needed a day off they would help me switch my day with another employee, always helpful and for that I am grateful."
good,"Burlington is a fun yet professional workplace. Coworkers are always nice and easy to get along with, while the managers and supervisors  are very kind and will help in any way they can."
good,"what i learned working for Burlington is the value of teamwork, and punctuality. Synergy is a great thing a team where the sum is greater than the parts will always succeed. Punctuality is key because the respect you show when you are ready to work on time and not letting someone else stay longer because you were late is not acceptable."
good,For my first job it's been great! love my coworkers! supervisors are the best! and my managers are understanding and fun to work with! best team hands down!
good,"It was a college job in which I feel in love with, from the managers to the employees everyone was always so positive. I never went in  there with the intentions of being upset. even when things got a little hectic, we would rally as a team to get things back to pace. We kept our district expectation # fairly high and was always appreciated for the hard work. within my time at Burlington I learned how to really juggle a heavy workload as I was going into the hardest semester and picking up shifts. The management always made accommodations to fit my schedule. I can't really say there was a hard part, when dealing with irate customers it could get a bit challenging but we as a team made strides to make the customer feel at ease. Overall I liked and gained a lot of experience in the short time I worked there."
good,I loved this job and absolutely loved going to work amazing company. Marlene was absolutely amazing. Great manager! If you feel like your position doesn't fit you speak up and you'll get put where you are better fit at! A little drama with Co workers but not enough to make you hate work!

good,I enjoyed working here I learned a lot. There was a lot that was going on with this employer but I don't regret working here.
good,"Being a Customer Service Supervisor, a typical day at work can vary between having very few customers, being able to fully complete the tasks at hand and having a full house with no time at all to fully complete your work. It can become frustrating if you're the type of person who prides themselves in the work you are able to complete, but some times there are honestly not enough hours in the day or shift to do so with the amount of customers and the occasional call outs. Having cashiers and other associates at hand to help contribute to the work may or may not always be available; depending on the volume of customers and taking into consideration the tasks that they have to complete as well. Overall it is a simple job, the environment is great, management is always available to help and the connection that grows between yourself and your everyday customers is a warm bonus. Starting pay is minimum wage, but a pay increase will always come with time. Majority Part Time positions need to be filled with some Full Time positions available, typically 1 per department. The hours are flexible, but you must have an open availability to be considered for hire. Just be patient, enjoy what you're doing and always remember to smile! :-D"
good,Loved working for this company. Co-workers were awesome and sweet. Never a dull moment here. Always had special events for the staff. Always positive even with the high pace work place.
good,This is my favorite job I have worked so far! Working as a sales associate is very laid back and easy going. I love being able to keep the store clean and put misplaced items in the correct department. Working here also gives me an experience where I can work on my people skills.
good,I loved working there. The managers were awesome and my coworkers were great. I wish I could have stayed there. I miss it so much
good,Only hardest part of this job is when its closing time and doing go backs when you have only 30 minutes to an hour.  But I loved my co workers and customers.
good,Working with  this company enabled me to help customers to locate and be educated about their purchases. I learned that learning about a product will encourage purchases. The management team was helpful and understanding. The coworkers worked as a team. The hardest part of the job was merchandising and the most enjoyable part of the job was helping someone to purchase quality goods for discounted prices.
good,A lot of greeting and customer service. Any complaints or exchanges needed I made sure the customer left satisfied with the experience and the company.
good,I absolutely enjoy my job at Burlington Coat Factory. The employees and management have a relationship that is beyond work. They genuinely care about each one of their employees. We have a family atmosphere. I do need a job that is more challenging. I have had some vocational training and have gone to college so I feel I can reach my maximum potential for a company outside of Burlington while still working for Burlington nights and weekends.
good,Fun place to work. Never a dull moment in the store. Great food. A little pricey though. Had trouble communicating with management. Customer service is great!
good,This store has an amazing management staff. They work with you in learning all that you need to be successful. You walk in and start your day with smiles. Co-workers are more amazing than they know. For me the hardest part is learning the different language of retail. I personally love connecting and talking to the customers.
good,"Great place to work, room for advancement. Management is always available and also chips in to help, which is always nice. Management always provide what is needed in the stockroom for the employees, so our job can be run smooth. I love the early morning hours."
good,"There is a really good experience, work there for  about 3 and half years. Lot of work, heavy loads of cartons, furniture, uploading the program, sale floors, etc. I was focusing more about Receiving/shipping and do scanning the UPS Billing, unpacking the merchandise."

Co-workers are full of life and are very helpful if teamwork is properly demonstrated. Even-paced so you're never in much of a rush. Not much of a hard part at Burlington unless you're doing something that you aren't familiar with such as, another position other than your current position you were hired for."

My learning experience consist of knowing what to do from a managers stand point and how to handle situations that customers may have. I could always count on my peers if I didn't know how to do something they were always there to help me.

Coats, Accessories, Men's, Baby DEPO etc. The Managers Most of them were Nice and also on a fast Paste because on holidays it GOT crazy lines were extremely long. But i enjoyed the environment, First time being overwhelmed is when i had customers some were Death hearing, some had strong ascents, Most travel across the country just to buy cloths to also seal in there country.Hardest part of the job was trying to communicate with people that didn't speak English, But i had always found a way at the end to send them, out to say they had great customer service. What u have gained to learn From Burlington Coat Factory is that The hours, the amount of work isn't hard unless u put your all into your job. you have to find ways to communicate you have to find ways to do things you don't know how to do on your own. Because Sometimes i didn't always get help because it got so Packed with customers everyone was busy trying there best Just like i was. i also Learn being SHY wont get you anywhere you have to OPEN up and that's what Burlington did for me."
good,"while working for Burlington I've learned how to make a well balanced schedule for the cashiers, how to make sure the customers are always pleased as well as my front end associates. Each day I open I make sure the entire front end is clean and fully stocked from the previous night before the customers come in. when I close I make sure the sodas are replenished the counters wiped down everything up front is clear as and where it should be no clutters floors swept all bags restocked and all merchandise returned to the proper departments. For the most part  the managers are usually on the same page and all co-workers from each departments work with each other to get the store back in shape after a long business day. The one thing I don't like about my position is when a customer leaves unsatisfied. The greatest part of my day is knowing our customers are pleased when they leave."

I enjoy open boxes with shoes, actually I buy a lot of them there, because we are provided with 15-30% discount and our store has very low prices, so I can get cool nike shoes just for 20-30 backs. I like shopping so I spent half of my wage there right after work day is over. Management is very friendly and high professional, we always have pizza, donuts, salads, etc. Plus we are free to choose comfortable time to work, I study at college, so it is important for me to have balance between job and school. I work 12-20 hours per week and make $9 per hour, which is ok for me just to have some extra money, but it will not enough if you have a family. Co-workers are very friendly and always ready to help, we have fun team environment. Overall this is a great place to work, especially compare to my previous job in another store."

But it was completely different. Besides the occasional annoyance from the managers on duty (which will happen almost anywhere you go), I completely LOVE working for Burlington. I come in everyday knowing that no matter whose on schedule to work, everyone staffed at the moment has two open hands willing to help with any assignment or project I throw at them. Burlington is truly a "" Team Effort "" facility and I think that's what I love the most about it. Knowing that everything that comes our way, whether it be extremely long lines, inventory, holiday seasons, the hassle of call outs, etc., there is always someone around at all times to make sure that no one is secluded or by themselves. Absolutely the true definitely of customer service."
good,The six months I've been there I met numerous customers who I've had fun meeting. Also got too learn how managers are able to keep every section in straight order making it easier for customers to find items.
good,The first thing to do is to ask the manager what they need done for that day in retail and then go to that section and check tags or sort in whatever way they say to. I learned to be better organized and follow directions. The most interesting thing about the job was that i could work and talk with people and it was fun to help others fix problems.

good,"I've generally been very satisfied here, the work environment was very welcoming and the management staff has been very genuine in their interest to help with any concerns. For example; I was working a shift I didn't particularly like, so my boss talked to the higher ups and was able to put me on the shift of my choosing by the end of my shift (which is only 4 hours long). The company isn't too demanding as far as work expectancy, the wages feel fair for the work. There is always a chance to move up in this company, everyday in the break room there are many job openings just listed up on the bulletin board encouraging current part-time associates to apply to those positions. I would recommend working here if you're looking for a steady, hands-on sort of job."

As a layaway associate I learned a lot how to talk to customers because not only did I collect customers' items to layaway, but I also greeted them at the main entrance as soon and they walked in and help them locate the items they want to see. The managers are always around the store looking to help, whether it is a coworker or a customer. The coworkers were very straight forward in doing their respective job. The hardest part of the job was whenever I closed the store. The store had to have all areas clean and neat, and it takes a while.

Start picking up products and putting back on shelves. Help customers find what they are looking for. Coworkers helped if someone could not find the product the other coworker would help also. Management would help if they could not get the help that the coworkers could not help with. The hardest part of the job was trying to get all of the product back on the shelves so that the customers did not walk all over them. The enjoyable part of the job was getting to know your customers.

But once we hit home run we had to work hard. Multitasking was a must! I liked who I worked with, different types of people. Old, young hip or not! We all were a family. We'd see each other every morning. Having wrong orders or unexpected amount of orders happen all at once is hard. But that's just the part of the job.

The most enjoyable part of the job is talking to your fellow coworkers while also getting the job done. I personally enjoyed how time went by while enjoying what you are doing.
