rating,review
bad,"Management does not communicate what they want you to do, then they get angry if it is not done exactly as they wanted. They make you use internal ""home-grown"" tools that often do NOT work and breakdown, then YOU get blamed for it not working."
bad,"Facebook hires people through 2 contractors. you first have to be with BC-forward, then Accenture. If you do not fit the mold then you'll never be Accenture. Once you are at Accenture long enough then you have a chance to be in Facebook's social groups."
bad,Contractor for FB and I'm just going to get straight to the point. FB will string you along and give you hope of being converted to full time employment. (FTE)
bad,"You will be paid a wage insufficient for the cost of living in the area and never even given an employee evaluation or a raise. I worked there for two years. Expect to have a ridiculous schedule (some days 12-8 AM, some days 8-4 PM and some days 4-12 AM). As a contractor, you will be viewed as a second-class citizen. Your contracting agency will have little contact with you and your Manager will be a full-time employee, but they are not working for the same company so they can't help you with anything. Your contracting agency doesn't care about you because all they care about is the bottom line. They need warm bodies in seats reviewing content. That's all. There's thousands of people lined up behind you to take this ""prestigious"" job, so any complaints will be disregarded. ""You should just be happy to work here."" Everybody wants the golden egg ""FTE"" role so they won't make any waves to solve any problems you have. All of the administration staff for your contracting agency just wants to get promoted to FTE so they don't fix anything for fear of being a ""problem"" and all of your Facebook Managers are at the lowest level of FTE and they just want to get promoted to a better role so THEY won't fix anything for you. Don't make the mistake of taking this job to move up the ladder, either. It won't happen. NOBODY AT THIS COMPANY CARES ABOUT YOU. If you can accept that fact and just want to say you work there and eat the free food, then go ahead and apply."
bad,"Originally I was so excited to get to work at this company, then once you see what it's really about and how the work experience is, you realize that these are the values that are ruining the world for the decent middle people."
bad,"Relocated for this position, was not worth it, cost of living out weights what I make, have a family to support so unable to do both my job and provide a balance at home, great job for people early in their HR career but not for someone that is mid-level and want to move up. You have too much experience to fight the battles that need to be fought. FB is about 10 years away from being a great company for all. Not ready to wait around to find out."
bad,"Project is overall interesting and giving you a lot of experience."
bad,Though the idea of work/life balance is spoken about often and the concept of 'Team' and 'Family' are often loudly lauded the truth is very different.
bad,"Management talked the talk of embracing diversity, but so authoritarian. Workers treated like livestock. Had no concept of disability rights whatsoever and did nothing to accommodate disabilities well documented before hiring and accommodated by other, far less resource-rich, employers. Loved my coworkers and really feel bad for them."
bad,"While we were able to accomplish a great deal the company culture is not focused on the physical security aspects and goals of the company."
bad,"Facebook is great! Flagship has a lot of things they can work on. The turn around for this company is high, the management support is quick to fire someone."
bad,"Firstly, 7 interviews, some of which are from untrained personnel. "
bad,It's a tough grind and you're pitted against the best of the best of the best.  You're reminded of this at every turn and told to stay in line.  The pressure to perform is up to you.
bad,"I had the worst experience of my working life during my short stay at Facebook in Dublin.  My boss basically told me that I was worse than useless after only 3 weeks in the role.  I ended up in counselling days later,  on the plus side my medical insurance covered the cost.  Maybe I just got unlucky with the line manager that I ended up with.  I would like to think this particular person has now had some training in people management skills.  I am finally back to the confident person that I used to be.  This should never happen,  I am absolutely gobsmacked that it was allowed to happen at Facebook."
bad,"On the phone and email allot helping with Facebook Marketing"
bad,"-Job growth was extremely limited"
bad,"organização e compromisso, fazem do profissional um funcionário eficiente em qualquer área"
bad,At Facebook most people working there is teenagers just graduated from High School who doesn't care about anything. No opportunity to grow and learn since you do the same every day. We I joined Facebook I expected do build my career there but that was impossible.
bad,"the day to day work is nice, the colleagues are the only thing that makes you want to stay working for longer there."
bad,"There are a lot of great things about being at Facebook. The work is rewarding, they give you lots of responsibility if you're driven, and you get to see your work change the platform."
bad,"It's a great place to learn about Facebook advertising but advancement is very minimal."
bad,Weird horrible management and no room for growth. Great job to do while figuring out your career! Flexible enough and easy workload
bad,"Lots of back stabbimg, a lot like being paid to be in highschool. Management didn't seem to know answers to questions they should have. Other employees seemed very incompetent while others seemed held back in their current position. Facebook is a young company and it shows. Google or apple would be a much better place to start out in the tech world."
bad,"it's a challenge working in this environment, a lot of discrimination and promotions are given to those who are in the ""circle"" it doesn't matter if you're an outstanding employee with proven results."
bad,"Accuracy is not an objective and the mentors never know as much as the employee. I never figured out what the management culture was. Info from top to bottom rarely got through. The food was good, healthy and free."
bad,"Working for Facebook was interesting. The location was a plus but paying for parking was not. The client services department was not quite organized at all which made the job stressful. Oh yea, but you get free breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks. Plus the fb 20 lbs."
bad,"es una empresa comprometida con su gente,con sus clientes y su calidad."
bad,"Besides the food, and the fact that you can pretty much wear whatever you want working at facebook is just a glorified boring office job. Pressing the enter button all day and constantly worrying about numbers."
bad,Flexible hours... learning environment... inefficient administration...no payment for work effort... This company never gives credit where credit is due my work is always put on restriction and my account always disappears and new accounts are disabled constantly
bad,"The company made an effort in providing a good place to work with a free canteen and a nice building, however, the daily tasks are heavy, overwhelming and management is not the best as team leaders are not well trained. There is too much pressure to achieve targets and only see employees as a number instead of human beings."
bad,"Management does not communicate issues until it's too late. Also, the hierarchy is all out of wack. It's the blind leading the blind. Not a healthy environment for a working professional."
bad,"facebook is a great company allied Barton is not "
bad,"It is very busy at work, we learn a lot from everyone and the working environment is quite fun. Co-workers are very nice people that will help you whenever you need. It is amazing getting to know people from so many different cultures and backgrounds. It opens your mind and you become less ignorant. I enjoy being in the office, it's a fun place to work at."
bad,"I typically sell make-ups and clothes. This type job helped me to learn how to sales talk and deal to customers through phone. The hardest part of this job is when you lack capital to buy the items your customer ordered. But on the other hand, this job helps me to earn money for my studies."
bad,"Facebook was a fascinating place to work as a line cook. It serves 3,000+ people with varying degrees of taste and food preferences. They have two large café s with eight item menus that change daily. Experienced line cooks are responsible as well as the Chefs to write daily menus usually four or more a month. This was a valuable training skill that I took full advantage of and tried to create delicious menus that can be executed by five people in under four hours time."
bad,"in real time experience i get chance to work with different people from differnt backgrounds helps me in learning new cultures, learn tips how to handle tipical people"
bad,"I love the company and the coworkers.. but there is not place to advance within the company, and all you do is press enter all day.."
bad,This is a company that does not value work life balance.  The amount of time required to put in each week would be impossible if your colleagues aren't like your family or best friends.
bad,"I was a manager for a support department that was shut down. It was a good program, and upper management put us in a good direction and worked just as hard as anyone else."
good,"Facebook as a business model, has 0 strategy for analyzing why something failed as far as management development goes and employee happiness. They just keep going on, hiring new people instead of investing in existing employees. Having a system mindset - analyzing why something failed, investigating the failure, and looking at the decision making choices that led to this failing is completely absent from Facebook's management team. They contract and subcontract work out, and make contract workers feel less than human in a caste system of social hierarchy. Even this would be ok, if the social aspect wasn't toxic as well. Facebook encouraged people to refer their friends, but at one point, over 20 people worked there connected all to the same group of friends which led to bullying, harassment, trolling, and all types of horrible behavior in the workplace - it became a mob. Instead of analyzing why this happened, an incentivizing improvement, or investing in professional development, they punished people for not fitting in and ignored the problems destroying productivity. On the surface Facebook sounds like they encourage innovation when in reality they reward conformity in a very unhealthy social environment lacking equal standards applied to everyone."
good,"Black box is the worst company I have never worked with"
good,The management and higher-ups are more concerned with saving their own butts and covering their own butts then treating their employees fairly they constantly lie to you or they create an environment of snitching everyone tells on each other and people undercut you to get you fired when you've done nothing wrong forget to turn in paperwork or forget that you checked in on a day off so when you come back you're in trouble because all the managers conveniently have forgotten that you warned them that you needed time off
good,I love the kids I watch they are loving and easy and they are not rude they don’t push to stay up late and just do what they would do if their mother was there and that’s what I like about it
good,"- A typical day at work: Very busy"
good,"Many Managers are selected based on ability to manage a tool or program, and are clueless when dealing with real live humans"
good,"Interesting fast paced company that prides itself on moving quickly - not always smartly or well planned moves, but speed for the sake of speed.  Money and resources are not usually an issue - even if the spend is not well thought out or sustainable.  Smart people work there but due to a constantly varying mission many employees spend time on projects that ultimately get scrapped because someone changes their mind - which frustrates the employees who often work quite hard on different ideas/projects."
good,"Facebook practices on hiring recent, young grads and is constantly changing job positions within the company and team which causes a lot of toxic behavior and thus being hired into a position thinking you will grow or advance your career just isn't a reality. You will be doing the same thing, every day with no minor or major changes to the routine. Busy work almost."
good,"I was never setup to succeed from day 1 and team was not very supportive. If you're experienced and worked in various environments, it may be difficult to work in this type of culture long term."
good,"well i guess i miss read what the question was, i thought it said how did you hear about this job. i just saw that you guys were hiring on facebook. i didn't not work for facebook"
good,"Working at Facebook as a security gaurd was fun. The buildings are very interesting, modern, and cool to look at. The actual Facebook employees are very outgoing and fun to interact with. The management for the actual security company is my reason for leaving."
good,"It is ok to work here if you are looking for an entry level position however struggle comes when you are looking for the progress."
good,Always so much to do with little management. Contracted at fortune 500 companies with great atmosphere. Most enjoyable part of the day was happy hour and the many activities.
good,"Love the staff at Flagship/Facebook, but not the management.  They treat lower staff like idiots, the food is bad in taste and appearance, talent doesn't count for much but following blindly does."
good,"We would have everyday short briefings/reunions, and then everyone would go bac to their own tasks. Mine were do some secretary management tasks, and then work as a second designer of the iPhone game Fragger."
good,Facebook is a cool place to work as far as people free food & snacks. I  was a upscale Security Officer & the management treated employees poorly doesn't value diversity opinions or open minded people.
good,"Overall, I had fun working at Facebook. Built my team, developed top notch client relationship and partnership. Did not like recruiting  upper management team, they lacked professional maturity."
good,Hardware business is tough as in all businesses. Overall people are smart but hardware is new to facebook so typical growing pains. Good place to work.
good,"I gained alot of information there which fueled my desire to learn even more. I went above and beyond what was required to learn for the position there. I became an expert in Facebook Pixel and other tools. Even though I have left, I'm still advancing my knowledge learning how to design Facebook BOTS."
good,"Was able to learn from a wide array of Chefs from different backgrounds and expand upon my culinary career in a large institutional kitchen setting.   Opportunities to create eight item menus based upon a theme or region and execute your personal menu for a large group of patrons.  It also forced you to be quick on your feet and adapt to changing environment.  For example, if you had a popular dish and it was running low, you had to be prepared to come up with a substitute dish on the fly.  Also very informative to learn how large scale kitchen production works."
good,"This is ridiculous for me to have to do this to finish my resume. How is it going to help anybody when everybody's experience is different. I'm trying to get another job, i'm not here to explain what the previous job was like or help somebody else get a job."
good,"The office environment is amazing, fresh and young, the days varied and the workload immense with long hours although you have amazing benefits (not just salary).  With regards to work culture, you'll either love it or hate it....it's not for everyone."
good,"Being able to work from home is great, the work is pretty tedious but easy, but you can be let go at any time, so this only works as a temporary means to make some money."
good,"In my current role at Facebook I have the opportunity to work on exciting and impactful topics on a daily basis."
good,Yep it was a job. While the job security could have been better and the management could have as well. It paid well and I liked the work
good,"Malgré une équipe de travail agréable, la chaîne de management n'est pas optimisée, sans compter le caractère trop impétueux du directeur des opérations et sa tendance à utiliser un vocabulaire blessant. Néanmoins, je n'ai été engagé qu'en tant que stagiaire, et je ne connais donc pas les conditions d'embauche en termes de salaire, sinon par la bouche des anciens employés. Selon leurs termes, il vaut mieux être embauché à un bon salaire, car les augmentations sont inexistantes. Enfin, une impression de stagnation générale en a fait fuir plus d'un."
good,"You get to learn a lot of things on your personal and professional side of your life."
good,"fast pace company in a  very diverse environment. food and drinks all are provided for employees and guests. safe working area, with excellent security team."
good,"High expectations, fast paced environment, great food. Great benefits, sign on bonuses, great work culture, good management, also fun place to work. Nice campus facilities."
good,"This job REALLY depends on you manager. My first manager was fantastic, and very flexible with hours, my second was extremely micromanaging. "
good,"Of course, all of us contractors at Facebook want our hard labor to be recognized with regular employment, which would sure help with gentrification around the city. However, that is not the case; it is very hard to become part of the full-time Facebook family, despite substantial efforts."
good,It was great. I really miss the people a lot. It was always busy and there were always things that needed to get done. But the good thing is that there were always people to help you understand how to do better.
good,"Was a great place... real risk going on contract. "
good,Typical day is 10-12 hours. Fast paced environment. Open communication with management. Excellent benefits mostly compensate for the intense work environment and long hours.
good,I've worked for almost3 years its been a experience i know my job duties and i get job done. im involved in projects that are related to Facebook. if we have new equipment installations for all the cafes around the Facebook campus in Menlo park
good,They need to have HR and Management all on the same page. high turnover rate. I have personally had issues with both management and HR playing favorites and not being wiling to help with job related questions that I have asked.
good,I was hired with the intention of being trained on what items I was making. With time they continued to say I would be trained at some point but I was generally all by myself everynight with no instruction. My coworkers were pleasant though and they came out with a great product every day.
good,"Trabajamos 9 horas pero una es para nuestro lunch break."
good,I learnt to work under pressure and realized the importance of team coordination. The company also had events for employees which was stress busters. Co-workers showed good team spirit and bonding.
good,"Had to look into profiles that are reported as Drug use, Impersonation, Nudity and Pornography. Learnt to identify if the reported profiles really need to be taken action upon. Management was not cooperative when training was needed. Friendly co-workers. To look into Nudity and pornography profiles was the hardest part."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of arriving at work, following up on tasks (solving problems and documenting them) and receiving new tasks, to be prioritized and executed."
good,"The work is interesting, the pay is decent, but the hours could be very long depending on the group"
good,"I worked in the security department. Was not the most enjoyable, but working at the Facebook HQ was great! Facebook is a great company if you work in house."
good,Very fast paced and so much to learn! Very attentive hiring managers and humble staff. Facebook still functions like a start up.
good,"As a Facebook employee, you work amongst hundreds of people and they have offices in almost every major city in the U.S. You will have the opportunity to travel, collaborate with employees from other offices, buy stock and attend special events."
good,"Facebook is a great place to work for."
good,"However, on some teams its hard to fit in.  Its very comptetive and can cause a petty environment.  Good intentions from a lot of workers can be overlooked because of workplace culture"
good,"I couldn't say no to Facebook. Being a recruiter in San Francisco, I wanted to know what it was all about. What I love about recruiting is the diversity of talent, and one of the challenges at Facebook was that the recruiting organization was so large that recruiters were siloed into very narrow functions - and very quickly the work became mundane for me."
good,总体来说还不错，在工作中和不同国家的同事相处，大家互相学习可以了解到很多不同的文化。 工作中有困难的时候大家都互相帮忙
good,"dynamic environment"
good,Facebook companies branches start  to india facebook using l anguaes english and telugu  my openion is good respecting in facebook mangement is so good
good,"Excellent comp, benefits, and perks, great people.  It's a boiler-room of pressure and competition with an acute focus on impact and tangible results in short time-frames.  Not for the faint-of-heart."
good,"Great work environment, your co workers and benefits make the job worth it. The management was terrible, and your constantly denied reviews. The managers seemed to look out for them selves, and they often left leaving you to figure out different difficult situations."
good,"Muitas exigências e pressão, mas pouca compreensão e motivação para a equipe."
good,"I am currently working for Facebook's vendor, therefore we did not entitle the entire benefits or privileges from Facebook. Teledirect is a nice employer, I learnt a lot for 2 years in this place"
good,"Facebook is a very fast paced place to work, you are surrounded by extremely intelligent people, but the rate of change is overwhelming. The scale of people our products serve is staggering."
good,A typical day was inventory of foods for the cafe. I learned that everyone plays a part for a successful team. The commute was a hard one. I enjoyed the diversity.
good,I really enjoy working with this company it is productive work you learn a lot . the culture is relaxing the management is cooperative trying to improve the productivity of the company
good,"Milestone Technologies incorporated the lifestyle/culture that Facebook has. As a contracted worker it was amazing to have the opportunity to work for such a big name company (Facebook) and receive the benefits that came with it. The Facebook culture really made this job an amazing place to work and help bring together tons of people that will serve as great friends and previous coworkers. MIlestone needs to work on improving their HR staff and the people they put in Management, it is very clicky and has an excessive amount of ""high school drama"". There is no room for growth if you are not in the ""in-crowd"" or a favourite of certain people despite work ethic and performance."
good,Lots to prep in such a short time but the team pulls through every night. Each worker really needs to hold thier own so all is done in time. Team work is key.
good,Fijn en gemoedelijk bedrijf om voor te werken. Professionaliteit en creativiteit straalt er van af.
good,not officially employed by facebook. I am a mod and a mentor on a few pages on facebook. I direct message and walk people through tech help and tips for their computers.
good,Overall great experience very limited space for minorities to grow within the company the atmosphere was very safe great places to eat and have meetings
good,"Be wary of the kool aid. It is a great place if you are fine with long hours and a review system that has been outpaced by growth. Typical days are filled with back to back meetings and it isn’t possible to keep work from overtaking personal time at home. The majority of time can easily be spent re-inventing the wheel due to constant change. Management is focused on metrics which doesn’t leave much time for their direct reports. Best advice for an IC is to be professional and keep your feelings out of it, you’ll do great if you don’t burn yourself out. Best advice for a manager is to roll with the “program”, show up early/stay late, and align with your leadership team. Email is the primary form of communication and tasking but there are a multitude of tools and groups that you need to utilize in order to keep pace with communications and workload. Be vigilant. If you are passionate about your work, this is not the ideal place but the perks/benefits/prestige are great. "
good,"I really did enjoy working for Facebook during my tenure; however, our management of our small team was terrible. They'd change priorities on a whim, sometimes without telling anyone. They were never clear on feedback or performance issues and would not listen to their employees."
good,"Facebook has good work life balance is good."
good,"If your FTE life is good, but if your contingent worker you are a 2 class citizen. Only at FRC. At other locations not the case everyone is treated the same, focused on working together to achieve daily goals."
good,"The overall Facebook culture is great, the flexibility and the perks the company provides to its employees can’t be matched with another company in the bay area. Very well diverse company and all are accepted and honored for their choices of life. If there is one thing I would like to point out is the way people are treated based on their employment status. There is a noticeable division of treatment between contingent workers and full timers. Contingent workers are treated as second-class citizens. The division in employment status is obvious and standard across the company"
good,"There are no opportunities, they don't promote internally"
good,"The schedule is very flexible which is really nice. Management can be more communicative and hands on. There's an obvious contractor/FTE divide. The work is repetitive and mundane which gets boring despite being promised that it would switched around often, that never actually happened. There's no chance at moving up or changing roles."
good,"I would come to work a hour late so i can get ready for work and socialize and get my game plan for my shift,then i will go inside put on my uniform wash my hands and clock in and get straight to work."
good,"Facebook does so many things right that it's a great place to work if only for the experience. But you'll also get top-line benefits and compensation. Whether you do well there in the long run depends on you, your competition (co-workers), and how well you can document your impact across multiple axis."
good,Flat organization fast paced and relies on proactive employees.  Management seems to favor cheaper contractor and focus on statistics and not essential daily work.
good,"Working at Facebook is an amazing yet difficult job. You will meet some of the smartest and hardworking people of your career. Beware burnout- be sure to take advantage of your vacation days and family leave!"
good,I enjoyed working with people from all walks of life right in the heart of 42nd street. You get to help people smile with a job like this. I like making peoples day
good,"It was a dream to work at facebook. If you can get in there, totally do it. It's very fast-paced, exciting, and challenging. Top management changed while I was there so my experience differs from most, but I'd still say 99% of people there were loving their time."
good,"I was there very early on, and got to do some cool things.  The company has grown quite a bit and the culture has changed as well.  This is to be expected."
good,"One of my favorite things about Facebook was the Artists In Residence. When I'd get mentally stuck with my work, it was always nice to be able to go take a break and look at the art displays around campus. It often lead me to innovative solutions."
good,"There are greats within the realm of corporate culture. Unsurprisingly, many of them are in the tech business. Climbing out from the title of startup and moving onto a more established one. From Google and Twitter, to the non-tech businesses like Zappos and Chevron. These companies excel in treatment of their staff, growth opportunities, freedom, responsibility, company atmosphere, stock options, general fun or just having good benefits."
good,Fun company to work at. I was there as a contractor for two years. Once your two years are up you don't get to extend your contract anymore. I learned a lot of new skills and FB for sure wants you to keep growing and learning.
good,"Facebook has alot to offer, however each department has their own culture.  It is very important to probe recruiter about the type of culture that you will be going into."
good,"Because Facebook has fairly rigorous recruitment standards, you will most likely be working with some pretty smart people. Workloads are often high (not a 9-5 job), but it will challenge you and you will learn a lot. The numerous perks are also great!"
good,"Great company culture with incredibly intelligent people looking to solve the next problem."
good,"The tools to succeed are provided, and thinking outside of the box is encouraged. Thought leadership and accountability is valued."
good,I have learned a ton at Facebook while I have been working there. Facebook offices a 6 week Bootcamp for new joiners with technical experience.
good,"A typical day at work involved constantly and consistently learning new processes, technology, skills and lessons to help further my career."
good,"Used Marketing’s skills and developed virtual store worldwide using e-marketing.  Currently spread branches in various countries like  - U.K, USA, Oman, Dubai, Australia And Malaysia. Exporter & indenting agent of a wide variety of items including Food  (Rasna,Madam Agro,Duke biscuits , Lichika,London Bakers,Charlie Chikki"
good,"Grâce à sa facilité d'utilisation, la gestion de page Facebook est aisée pour ceux qui désirent administrer une page."
good,enjoyable place to work nice people great chance for advancement
good,"I have been sent abroad twice by Facebook to train an international team of employees for Facebook's Law Enforcement Response Team, including training the current International Team Supervisor."
good,"Outstanding co-workers, i learned to work with in a timeley,orderly fashion. I think the hardest part of the day for me honestly. Had to be going home, so much fun."
good,Pratique et utile. J'ai pu aider ma grand-mère à mieux gérer ses locations
good,Working at Facebook is a chance to network with in the company to see what other opportunities are out there. The culture at Facebook is one of a kind place of work environment.
good,"Good company to work for with great benefits and perks, however for the last few years a stronger level of politics started to be played on a continuous basis, which somehow affected the positive culture for employees."
good,Bra  och  enkel  sätt  att  hitta  och  söka  jobb.
good,"Facebook is growing so rapidly employees are becoming just a number at this point.  The perks help a lot with the balance."
good,"Working with customer presents new, unique, and fun challenges everyday. This is a great company to work for no matter what."
good,"1) Great place to learn"
good,"This initiative started off as a small project; a site where people could exchange political views, debate the topics of the day and even philosophise with each other on other subjects."
good,"Enjoy the people you work with and take advantage of all opportunities. There is more than one location, so depending on where you get hired, you could have a long commute."
good,"It's physically healthy but mentally unhealthy. Lots of delicious food, peers are good and easily go deal with, code review process is strict. Generally I will still recommend choose FaceBook as your first career company !"
good,"I am a student by occupation, I am learned many things from my workplace, which is called the classroom and library of IIPS. I am enjoying the whole day during the class period but in the last hour of class, I felt very tired."
good,Es una excelente empresa para poder consolidar los conocimientos adquiridos en la carrera estudiantil. no solo por el personal si no también por la infraestructura que tiene.
good,Nothing to comment at this time. Don't work for the company any more and haven't in a long time so I don't feel like I can give an accurate review of the company for current employees.
good,"Starting at Facebook as a younger professional was great, it was a looser environment that was focused on the mission. As it became more corporate it lost that great culture."
good,L'esperienza della creazione di una nuova attività dedicata al turismo ed all'outdoor comprende giornate prevalentemente all'aria aperta e gestione di escursionisti
good,"Locally facebook's data center environment is generally relaxed and has good collaboration between contractors and full time employees. The pace is busy but never beyond reason, system wide problems are easy to escalate to the next support tier. People are generally polite and professional to work with. The only substantial lacking point is review process and opportunity to advance along with the wages which is slightly below industry. Overall a good place to get your start."
good,"I loved working for the company although my contract was quick and short I wish I had more time with the company. A typical day at work was to come in, get breakfast and jump straight into a company meeting."
good,Một thị trường tiềm năng đồng nghĩa với rất nhiều cơ hội
good,"Amazing place to work. Brilliant food and travel and the company takes care of you. "
good,"-a lot of things to do to break your day up"
good,"It's a fun place to work Monday-Friday schedule with a diverse group of coworkers. There's is opportunity to grow in the company, but sometimes there is a lot of employee favoritism at the location I was at."
good,Great place to make a lot of impact provided you are in the right role matching your interests. Perks and work enviroment is great. A lot of small people to work with.
good,"The office was a fantastic place to work in and make friends.  First week was very vague and filled with confusion, as no one knew exactly what I was supposed to get up too.  Loads of fun events.  Many of the projects are run by folks who live in a different location, managing projects in Washington from over seas or in California."
good,As cognizant is my principal employer we do not have the privilege of working at client location. Not much of a fun type.bit robotic in nature.
good,"A well organized structure with a clear division of duties, which means everybody knows what they are supposed to do. Thanks to the backup system there are no problems with booking holidays."
good,"Great place to work,but a high turnover. The days are busy from the time you walk in the door until the time you leave, Clients are very demanding. The management team could be a bit more knowledgeable and up train the staff on products and processes instead of leaving it to each individual to take an effort to seek out the information. People should be trained equally to give the best possible customer experience. The best part of the day is when the customers are appreciative of the time you have spent with them and they have gained more knowledge to be successful."
good,"Enjoyed the people, free food and flexibility. The job was just not the right fit and was not what I expected. "
good,I learned a lot of cool stuff about the work I used to do there and there was training every other week. I gained knowledge of different types of servers
good,"Great benefits but grew way too fast! Going from small company to large in 2 years, they didn’t have the right leadership in place. Too much time wasted on performance reviews & pulse surveys twice a year that caused a lot of anxiety & tension with new new managers & employees."
good,"A great company to be at, the perks and benefits are out of this world, and you'll be among of the smartest people you'll ever meet.  That said, your success can highly depend upon team culture, and unless you're an engineer, you don't get to pick your team."
good,"Oculus is a fantastic place to work; the community at Oculus is extremely passionate about products they/we develop and push to market. My colleagues and supervisor care deeply not just about the success of the collective team, but the success of each individual. It can occasionally be challenging to wait for the dust to settle before moving onto the next big endeavor, but folks are quick to learn. "
good,Facebook is a laid back environment with XBOX and billiards in the break room. The greatest perk is free cooked breakfast and lunch everyday while on site.
good,Job is excellent for learning more about Data Centers and the functions of the job. People are great and the environment is friendly. Everyone works together to get the job done. Benefits are a little pricey but manageable.
good,"This was a fantastic place to work. The role itself was very interesting. It was a place to constantly learn and grow."
good,I really enjoyed working with a great staff and Co-workers. My Boss was the Best! He went above and beyond for all of his staff. Working from home as a Contractor gave me the opportunity to plan my day. Great communication between all staff and management.
good,The day to day work is feeling lighter as the team and workplace are fun. I learn many things such as analyzing content that came into Facebook. Part of the job that is enjoyable is having meals with coworkers and taking a part in internal events.
good,It is a good place to be at. The work environment lets you to collaborate with the team more than often. I had a pleasant stay during my duration. The most fun part of the job would be the free food and complimentary shuttle service. I also enjoy their basketball court as I would partake during my free time. Hardest part is that you occasionally can lose track of your day by working so hard.
good,great company to work for if you find the right group/leader.  the company has gotten so big that the culture is struggling to maintain itself.
good,"Of course I learned everything you need to know about advertising on Facebook. I had to deal with 30+ account portfolio in a vast moving environment. I advised customers with their campaigns by optimizing and measuring their performance. "
good,With every 2 week release cycle the environment was still fun place to work at. I learned several skills like time management. How there is not differentiation between higher authorities and the engineers. Contractors are treated equally and with respect. I learned to meet deadlines with less stress and efficiently. Learned to distribute work with piers and take up additional work from piers if needed. Multi-tasking several projects efficiently. Knowledge transfer to the piers and grabbing good additional skills from leads and piers. So much of diversity and yet no differentiation. Challenging part is to keep up to the fast pace. Even a week of vacation will have lots to catch up. The most exciting part of the job was to go to work everyday.
good,"> Generating reports for the advertisers which includes Excel and presentation work."
good,"At Facebook I would patrol the interior and exterior of the buildings that would constitute approximately half of the campus, providing access assistance and escorts when requested. I learned what it's like to be part of a large team that works together towards a common goal which is the safety of all present at the site. Management was rather generous with overtime, enabling me to support myself without requiring a second job while in school. My co-workers were all good people, quick to smile and assist anyone requesting it. The hardest part of the job were the first hour of every shift as you gauge the pace of the day and learn where you will be most effectively posted. The most enjoyable part of the job was the college like atmosphere as if it were a Disneyland for adults."
good,Was always great to work in an environment that is designed to change the world of Social Networking. I have learn a lot in the story of data storage and i am open to learn more.
good,I have many fond memories of Facebook. I have learned so much in a fast pace setting with mass and small production. I have grew through my management who have gave me all the tools to success. The ethics and community of face bookers are the change we need to see in our daily life.

good,"- Incredible benefits"
good,A typical day was cleaning up from other companies at Facebook. I enjoyed talking with other companies and they included alot of workplace culture. I thought it was a good company to work for but management was poor.
good,"Great company, great mission, great people"
good,"I worked as a contractor, so this is not a review for a full time Facebook position. But this was the best contractor position I've ever worked. Free food, work downtown, and a fun culture to be around. The only downside is it can be very difficult to get hired as a full time Facebook employee."
good,"Facebook's work culture is something every company should strive to become. Though the job position itself can be stressful, working amongst people who support and want to see everyone succeed, motivated and encouraged me to shoot for the best."
good,"Working for this company was great while it lasted. The pay was more than exceptional, and although there were faults in management, it wasn't the worst experience I have had. "
good,This was a fun job some of the old timers were fun some were not so fun to work with. Working at the Star had it's pluses it did like it alot it had a good work life balance. I started on a pilot program for a digital side ImPRESS LOCAL which didn't survive but it was fun while it lasted.
good,"Facebook is a very good place to work. The company initiatives always support the mission statement. Company has talented employees who have the autonomy to work out solutions and implement them, without all the politics. Its a great campus to work at and there are a ton of things that employees do to socialize which builds a better work community than most places."

good,My company has a very strong connection with its workers. My Boss is very supportive and easy with any difficult task. He gave us the courage to do any difficult task and help all workers to do what he want for his work.
good,"The work is challenging and plentiful but it's also very satisfying and your teammates are excellent. Definitely having the right mindset for this company matters. Somebody who is self motivated and ready to be jump head first into something they don't know can succeed in this environment. In my opinion it feels like people aren't competing against each other, rather they are competing against themselves to see how far they can grow. Every single day you are working hard, but you will improve a lot too."
good,"You learn a lot and grow a lot, great job culture. With roughly a quarter of the world's population being a monthly active user, Facebook users possess a wealth of combined knowledge. For all the jaw-dropping comments from your wacky relatives, there are useful tidbits of information from reasonable people."

good,"Other than the new upper management in the FacOps Department (2016-2017), the company is one of the greatest companies in the world. They stand by and believe in there mission, ""to connect the world"". Benefits and salary are very competitive to advanced depending on the location of the position. They give you opportunities to become a better version of yourself, which gives them the return of a happy, more proficient employee. The work-life balance opportunities are great and essentially depend solely on the employee's participation."

good,"Facebook hires very very young and extremely bright young people from all over the world. They then provide you with what I felt was an MBA level training in how to work the right way. This included: dealing with conflict (fast feedback), meeting cadences, star charts to evaluate work and get buy-in from peers on priorities, gobs and gobs of information and documents to do your job. BUT, and it's a big but, it is all self-directed. In other words, you must be able to thrive in ambiguity and be motivated to seek out the info you need. It won't be handed to you."
good,Facebook has provided me with the facility to earn money online. Facebook Pages that I have made are one of the main sources  of money. I earn money not a lot but a little because I did not use those pages as a permanent source of income. It was part time. Facebook is a best platform for Affiliate Marketing and I am experienced in it.
good,"Work hours were very flexible. i could work when i wanted to and where i wanted to. Food was provided but if I was looking for something else, I easily could go to a different restaurant."
good,"Facebook offers a great work environment. Great management structure with plenty of training to set you up for success. Team leads communicate well and there are daily/weekly meetings and huddles, so you know exactly what is expected of you. However to a certain degree, you may lose your job if you are not holding up to their metrics and standards in the position I held in Client Support. Overall, the morale was high and I enjoyed working with the people there."

good,"It was a great place to work because of the culture. The work becomes routine, and they don't promote much from within. It still tries to function like a startup instead of the tech juggernaut that it is."
good,Facebook was a very interesting place to work. The culture of communication and cooperation was like nothing I'd ever seen before. The level of enthusiasm among coworkers and bosses was infectious.
good,"Though I'm a contractor, I'm very much happy at my current role. The work-environment is very competitive in a healthy manner. I love working with my managers and have so much to learn from them. My day starts with a daily stand-up meeting at 9 AM and ends with brainstorming meeting at 7 PM.

good,"Cognizant, overall, is a good company to work for.

Aktuell arbeite ich als Sales-Promoter für Oculus by Facebook, wo mir der Umgang mit potentiellen Kunden aus aller Welt große Freude bereitet und ich bin mir sicher, dass ich die Qualität und das Zeug dazu habe eine gute Figur in Ihrer Branche zu machen. Zudem kommt hinzu, dass ich wöchentlich den PC aktualisiere, wie z.B. bei neuen Updates oder wenn es zu einem Defekt kommt, dass ich diesen beheben muss. Dies zeichnet aus, dass ich nicht nur kommunikativ bin sondern auch unter Druck meine Leistung erbringe."

good,"Pois disponibiliza a oportunidade de aprendizado, tanto pessoal, quanto profissional, em uma nova profissão."
good,"If you are a contracted worker, you are likely to be ignored when proposing ideas, and if they are good ideas, its extremely likely your Facebook contact will suddenly have the same idea a few days later, which of course has nothing to do with you. It was great working here, but there is a reason a large portion of the employees have worked less than two years. Still, they're at least respectful here, which is more than can be said about working with Google."
good,I had a great run with Facebook! Revana was a good company when I started in 2015. Many changes were made during that 2 years. It was definitely a very friendly world inside Facebook.

Working with fabulous smart, creative, helpful people was paramount.  Management left me with a downer view.  Though cooperative somewhat, overall mgt. was not mature in ability and at least, not well trained. A lot of reviewers expressed how they look forward to coming to work every morning. A beneficial, thriving, energetic, uplifting, results producing, fun work environment is obvious.  A great group of people within structured teams.  Tantalizing possibilities working within Facebook's culture."
good,The office culture is fun and enjoyable while allowing for an engaging work experience and are apart of a dedicated team.
good,"how to acknowledge the mails."
good,"Pros"

good,Working for Facebook was a very fun experience and has taught me a lot of things when it comes to production and how I can always up my level and make it better in whatever way that is. I just wished they gave more attention and helped out when there was a technical difficulty with the software and being black listed for no reason that admins couldn't figure out. But nerveless it was a fun and entertaining experience.
good,Getting hired at Facebook has been the highlight of my career. It's hard to get in but once you're an employee you know why. They are very generous and take care of their people. The mission is clear and the culture is fun. People work well together and respect each other. Facebook is very big on treating everyone the same. I feel very blessed to be doing the type of work I enjoy at a place that has a global impact and is a household name. It's a great place to be and I plan on staying as long as they will have me.
good,"The best ting about FB is the people.  They are all truly great to work with and everyone is helpful.  I felt like people truly cared about me there. My manager was great and when I went on maternity leave, I was literally on leave.  The only communication I received was people wishing me well and checking on how my little one was doing. I cherished the time I got to spend with her bonding."

good,"Working at Facebook it self was very enlightening. A lot of times I felt very jaded. The only thing I didn't agree with the management was the way they selected which contractors. There was a good amount of them who performed horribly, but due to seniority they were picked over the high performing contractors. Other than that, everyone there is great."
good,"Facebook provides a good opportunity to grow and develop (and the food is excellent). I loved being able to work from home whenever I needed. The company provided a lot of opportunity for me to coach others who were not as experienced in my field, which led to advancements in process improvements in privacy documentation and audits."
