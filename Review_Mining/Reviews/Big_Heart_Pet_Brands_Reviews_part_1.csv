rating,review
bad,"The manager is a terrible person  to work for. Did not train properly. Plus she is not a VERY stable persons. You will not learn from this person whatsoever. THEE upper manager is awful, condescending and TERRIBLE. Perhaps a management class MAY help them, doubtful. They need a clean sweep of ALL managermenrt"
bad,nobody seems to know whats going on.Management always lying right to your face and smile about it.Overtime overtime and more overtime plus they have a company union that lets them do whatever they want no balls too speak back about conditions.
bad,"they don""t care about you at all. got fired for calling in cause my Dad was deathly ill. and the benefits are going away. the union pension fund only has enough money to last 14yrs max,and theyre having problems getting other factories to join. health benefits are union negotiated with the company and thats the companies highest priority is to get rid of paid health care.you co-workers back stab you to your bosses, and your union reps mis-represent you when they tell the top supervisor anything you say bad. the only thing they want is a person to live at that factory.   DID I MENTION ALL THE MOLD THAT COMES OUT OF THE MIXERS EVEY FRIDAY NIGHT WHEN THEY CLEAN UP"
bad,big heart pet brands is a bad place to work management and employees are horrible. they are really back words when it comes to breaks and people of higher authority are real jerks
bad,"company sucks and doesn't care about their workers specially if you are temporary worker like i was, i was paid minimum wage with explanation that salary is well based regarding my duties which were to clean up the power plant, i actually did technicians work on daily basis and no one ever even said thank you"
bad,Managment is terrible and work is ok.  Not really a machine operator all you do is push buttons. Is ok if you don't like to be more involved with machinery.  You get hammered with overtime until you gain seniorty but the way things are people with 20yrs are getting forced overtime and its in every dept they are short of people.  Its good money though wouldn't recommend working here if you have a family and care to spend time with them....
bad,Picking orders at a fast rate to fill customers demands. Overtime is demanding and on short notice! Seniority rules. Great benefit packages!  Work closely with others everyone in distribution is driving a forklift!
good,"BHPB is a company with many good people who try hard to do a good job. However the management and culture was not a place where teamwork was expected. Many areas of the company were understaffed causing people to work extra long hours and that what was expected on a regular basis. Ten hours a day was not enough. It's interesting that the company was recently purchased by Smuckers and their review said ,much the same thing- that lots of loyal people but managed like a company from the 1980- or 90s. This review is only of one of their plants though."
good,Being in maintenance its hard to say what a typical day would be it depends on how the plant is running or what needs to be fixed. This also makes it one of the most enjoyable parts because there is never any repetitiveness. The worst part of the job is being owned by kkr they are more worried about running things as cheaply as possible without investing in the factory or the workforce.
good,"It was a fun job to work at. Supervisor was not helpful rude. Poor Leadership. Everybody is out for there self. I wanted to stay longer they were going to hire me for company, But would not give me time to get my paperwork in order. I would love another chance. Thank you"
good,"Promotions, reviews and raises are based on favoritism and not employee education or skill.  Coworkers are backstabbers and management believes the person who cries the loudest"
good,No area wide climate control gets 95 plus in the summer time.  so many over time hours you wont be able to spend your money. Not a terrible place to work but be willing to work all the time
good,Enjoy working with co workers. Not a lot commucation between workers and management. There ot police and proceeders was difficult to understand and hard to plan any time away from the job
good,"Since acquired a year ago, the company has gone through significant changes: new way of doing everything, layoffs, changing org structure etc. The ""growing pain"" continues. "
good,Fast pace but pays well. Will work alot of overtime.  Could definitely use some better supervisors. Over all I would definitely recommend this job to anyone I can.
good,Worked under some great leadership under tough conditions. Problems I worked on were moderately interesting. Above all it was an absolutely dead culture.
good,"The job is demanding, but the benefits and pay is great. Long hours, but its worth it. There is always something to learn and management opportunities are there."
good,"Big Heart offered at least 50% discounts on products such as dog and cat food, JIF peanut butter and Smuckers jelly as well as other snack foods, coffee, brownie mix, etc..."
good,"My typical day entails significant collaboration across all functional areas, including Marketing, Demand Planning, Production Planning, Sales, Finance, Innovation, and Creative Services."
good,"Multitasking for example load boxes from conveyor belt, and then stack boxes onto pellet. Work in different areas, and different tasks of the building."
good,"Check them out yourself,  Everyone has a different experience at a new job.  Stay true to yourself and your family.  Sometimes at this employer people forget what is really important in their lives."
good,Great pay compesation for the physically demanding work..the hours were very hard to maintain a sleep pattern with 3rd shift..lots of hours created issues in family life but pay comphisated for that..
good,"This has been a Company of change - first taken private as part of Del Monte Foods and then separated into an independent Pet Food Company which was purchased and integrated into the JM Smucker Company all within several years.  As a result, changes in leadership, locations and systems all followed...  Big Heart Pet Brands has been a company that responds to a crisis - people coming together to manage through big challenges.  Consistent Planning and execution falls short and with that comes a culture of challenges and heroes."
good,There is always something new to learn here.  Each shift works like a team and feels like family.  Career advancement is possible but limited.  It is a well run facility.
good,Sales Associate.  BHPB is a great place to work.  It has a unique environment.  Great people to work with.  Allowed to bring pets to work.  Lost some great people when BHPB was acquired by Smuckers.
good,Great people to work with and work for.  New challenges daily. clean enviroment to work in coworkers really help each other. I really liked the team envirioment.
good,"Big Heart Pet Brands (now Smuckers) in Decatur, AL was a great place to work.  Great benefits with pleasant people to work with.  Management actually cared about employees.  Would highly recommend."
good,"Company relocated or would not have left. Great people to work with, very smart and continually looking for ways to improve.  Would recommend company to any future employees."
good,This is a great Company to work for unfortunately the company is relocating to Ohio the end of  March 2016. Good company. If you plan to move to Ohio or already live there look into this company.
good,Good pay and benefits. Overtime is available. its part of smuckers now so hopefully production will go up. I run an extruder which hot work but for the pay in lawrence ks you cant beat it.
good,BHP is a great place to work with many core family values displayed. The management team is phenomenal and everyone seems to look out for each other. The only downside is little room to grow in a fast time.
good,"Open door culture here, really builds and fosters the participation and learning from all levels."
good,I really wnjoyed my job there however it was only a temp position
good,"Exceptional employer, would still be working with them if company had not been sold!"
good,"Training wasn't the most technical, learn on the fly.  Plenty of OT, very lucrative place to work. Benefits and paid time off was worth the extra hours worked."
good,"Big Heart Pet Brands was a wonderful place to work with a very exciting, fast-paced environment, quick decision-making culture, and bright future.  Unfortunately, company was recently acquired and is being dismantled by the JM Smucker company."
good,This was an amazing company to work for. I really wish more consideration would have been given to the employees and to keep the company in Pittsburgh. We were so innovative and just happy to go to work everyday. So sad to see it go. There will never be a company that I feel I will work for that will have the cultural fit that I had there.
good,"Wonderful national company to work for. I work independantly in pet stores and interact with customers in the educating of food for their dog or cat's specific nutritional needs."
good,World class supply chain.  Industry leader in pet snacks.  A company that takes care of its people.  Excellent work environment. Excellent compensation.
good,"My 10 years at Big Heart in Topeka Kansas, which was Heinz and later Del Monte Pet Products, were some of the happiest of my life. My salary was well above what I needed to live comfortably. My co-workers were wonderful and caring and the management was both competent and employee centered. It was by far the best place I'd ever worked before or since."
good,Love the company and the people! This has been a great place to work and I would encourage anyone looking at CPG companies to consider Big Heart Pet Brands
good,"Good company, respectful workers, and managers. I really like the fact on how they do hire felons and do not judge and turn us away do to our past.some of is felons are really trying to get our lives on the right path"
good,I absolutely liked the job and am so grateful that they gave me the opportunity to work there. I appreciate all the skills they gave me and the patience it took to teach me those skills.
good,The company culture is great! They are constantly innovating and create an experience that is hard to match. Best internship opportunity I have had.
good,Great place to work the culture is collaborative and everyone's ideas count.  I would recommend this employee to people who are interested in working here.
