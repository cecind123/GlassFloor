rating,review
bad,do not work here toxic and racist place to work for. Anyone who wants to be depressed go work here and you will feel the depression the first day of work.
bad,"Unorganized, inefficient, non-communicative, lazy journalistic standards, 60 hr weeks and terrible management. Zero basic human decency. Other than that, great."
bad,Small company with ineffective management. Disorganised and lacking direction to grow new markets. Very dirty and unsafe working environment. Dirty toilets and nowhere to eat lunch. This company has now ceased to exist and this is not a surprise to me.
bad,"It was a great opportunity as I was asked to use my talent and gifts on the radio, doing voice overs.  I came away with an experience that helped empower me on my next career adventure."
bad,"very fast paced job and had to learn a lot of material in a short amount of time. busy call center work and phones ring all the time, high volume work experience"
bad,"Company was extremely cut-throat with zero job security.  Had to work 50+ hours a week, including weekends.  Had one manager who actually sent emails and requests for response on Christmas Day."
bad,"A company that can frustrate your work ethics, many times in the past they have betrayed my trust, management had a very poor relationship with a union contract that was in place. They on many occasions even tho they agreed to maintain in tact the c.B.A. (Collective bargaining agreement) standards, they did totally the opposite. I have nothing good to say about the fair treatment nor respect to myself or of other employees that I have observed unfair treatment towards."
bad,Great place to work.  The only thing that they could do better is rewarded employees that go out of their way and beyond what their job requires because they care about their product.
bad,Corporate trickle down effect to local managers causing unrealistic expectations and unprofessional treatment of all employees throughout the building.
bad,Nepotism runs wild at CBS. If you aren't related to somebody high up you aren't going to go anywhere in this company. Best to look elsewhere if you want to provide for your family.
bad,"- Average Leadership"
bad,"First and foremost, the pay was way too low, considering my experience. "
bad,apesar de tudo aprendi muito trabalhando em varias áreas da empresa
bad,"Cleaning and maintaining all areas of the Arena on a daily basis.  Worked with a team of four as well as on my own.  Each day was different, some days we worked a minimum of four hours or a maximum of six hours because the job is a part time posisition."
bad,Horrible Company. Stay far away. Managers are horrible. System is horrible. It's a dinosaur of a company
bad,One of the greates company's to weork for! Great supervisor's and the out you with the right companys.
bad,CBS is a temp service that is no longer in business. worked at several positions the best one was a Evenflo as a call center person.
bad,"mucho oseo, mal salario. horarios de doce horas,pocos descansos"
bad,Management does not support employees. Instills fear to get results. Not productive. High turnover rate of employees.
bad,You have to sacrifice your morals and christian beliefs for this job
bad,"no aprendi nada, mucho tiempo sin hacer nada, mal salario, mucha presion , pocos descasos, horarios de doce horas, rotativos , sobre carga de horas ,no pagas"
bad,interactive dept poorly managed VP constantly bullied and harassed me.
bad,Poor management but fun environement. very stressful to where the controller caused one of the accountants to break down and be Physically ill.
bad,Poor Management.  Machinery and work environment unsafe.  Mgt has their favorites and these people reap the rewards.  Certain employees stand around but if your a favorite you can get away with it.  The real workers get punished.
bad,"The CBS Corporation had strong benefits.  Then the radio division split off, and outside of a strong holiday calendar, the benefits were much worse."
bad,Overall management bad.  The upper management people are “grinders” asking a lot without providing tools or emotional support.  Not enough guidance from line supervisors or top management.
bad,The job was very cut-throat. Some of my co-workers were rude and would not help me. The schedule I was originally offered was not the schedule I ended up working. I found it difficult to manage a good work-life balance. They do not cover moving expenses and basically expect newcomers to fiend for themselves. The most enjoyable part of my job were the friendships I made with three women (and one guy) who warned me that I was likely about to lose my role and comforted me when I was let go. Worst job experience ever.
bad,"You're given the impression there's a ton of perks when you work for CBS. There aren't. They hire the worst managers and leaders somehow or the culture corrupts the good ones as well. The culture is terrible, if you're not a manager or executive you don't count and it's felt every single day. They are so behind on technology it takes them a year or years to do things it should take much less time to do. They pinch pennies everywhere they can so they can pay their Sr. Directors and above their nice salaries and bonuses. Oh yeah they also hid the fact that people were getting bonuses and then once it was known they informed everyone it was for Sr Directors and above only."
bad,There was no structured in training more of a sink or swim environment. It is also very clickish and like all jobs the politics of it all makes for an unprofessional environment.
bad,"poor management, and employee communications, too many levels of management, lack of feedback, and no job performance review. No ability to communicate with upper management."
bad,"100% cold calling. No auto allowance. New reps are not assigned active accounts. If you do not have multiple sales within 90 days you are gone. Plan on doing a lot of driving and spending your own money for gas. Prime prospect's are on secured account lists of the veteran reps. No assigned territories, everything is fair game to anyone."
bad,It would have been more fun working in a morgue. No real reviewing going on.
bad,"Company lacked effective leadership from the top down.  Most employees ran scared because the workplace culture lacked any positive reinforcement on any given day.  Most Account Executives knew how to perform in job, but management never had grasped the ability lead.  The general impression in the workplace was that most people were coasting through the day.  Not a lot of autonomy either.  It was apparent CBS did not want to invest in their product, which hurt morale."
bad,a typical day at work is ok when you get to inter act with the  residents  i get to listen to there ideas and i get to put a smile one there face also learn from others
bad,"even the supervisors are out to throw you under the bus, as a per diem employee your union dues arent taken from your checks, the supervisors will lay you off if someone blames you for their mistakes."
bad,"This organization makes it impossible to make a decent living unless you have been there for 15+ years.  They do not assign leads in a fair fashion, you have to do every other departments work because it doesn't matter to them or not if things get done.  They get paid regardless - when you are 100% commission, the only way you get paid is if things get executed in the appropriate fashion.  They force account executives to sell ""packages"" that are not in the best interest of the client or that do not work and then clients bail.  The Director of Sales doesn't understand ""solution selling"" and will retaliate against you if you do not do what he tells you to do even if it means losing a client.  He has ""favorites"" that are allowed to do what they want, come and go as they please and are given large accounts that are too complicated for the person to handle."
bad,No room for advancement or growth. Management tries its best to hold you in one place
bad,"Very poor management(non-approachable), extremely stiff environment, high turn over of accounting personel."
bad,"Terrible place to work.  Management is god awful and its still a man's world.  Perhaps now that viacom is in the fold, cbs will bring on new management and get rid of the old FOLKS WHO ARE DINOSAURS"
bad,The work environment was very redundant and uneventful. There was no room for advancement. Management could have been a lot better. I learned at this company it's best to do your job and go home.
bad,"Unstable work environment, poor managment, low wage raises, no advancement in technology needed to do job sufficiently."
bad,no training bad management revolving door. Very disappointed that CBS doesn't have better on boarding process
bad,"Unfortunately, I found that EcoMedia makes promises that CBS can/will not uphold."
bad,"Operation of switchboard for “On Air” content, roll/insert commercials within program content, program computers for automation of daily schedule, add commercial spots to digital video library as needed, tune satellite receivers for on air viewing and recording, cut into programming as needed, direct and execute daily live cut-ins for morning news, tape-delay programs, operate second satellite station simultaneously with primary station"
bad,dismissed during probation despite the reason being caused by my disability of which they were informed of. No warning just dismissal for gross misconduct which was not the case and difficult for the fight to resolve.
bad,"Micromanagement, they have more cameras watching the employees, than they do watching for bad guys. Management does not take outside threats seriously, leaving employees at risk."
bad,Management is not supportive and will not have your back. Often times feel like management just wants to stretch you thin and then try to give you less.
bad,Big Corporation but small business feel ! Coworkers are good people. It gets busy sometimes what place of business does not. Work life balance can use some improvement and pay could be higher but otherwise an  okay place to work.
bad,CBS Interactive is the premier online content network for information and entertainment. Our brands delve deep into the things people care most about.
bad,"Worked in a variety of warehouses where we pick/pack, work on assembly line, and scanned floor merchandise into computer system."
bad,Wasn’t informed correctly about the job position and needed something more suitable for my life and family needs as I have a partner and child and also a child on the way
bad,me dejaron sin obra durante 1 año me despidieron abonando el sueldo nada mas
bad,Everyone is running for a reason.  Pay is less than other industries that is a standard.  Problem is the place is run by people who are more concerned about a popularity contest than actually attempting to better the work environment.  Management cut employee outings but somehow some select few wound up with extra perks.  If you are unfortunately bound to radio...you know you have to suck it up.  If not steer clear.
bad,"no hay alguien que se haga cargo de las deciciones que se toman dentro de la empresa, tanto sea en sueldos como en articulos de limpieza , seguridad e higiene y mucho menos administracion tecnica (ya q yo soy tecnico , mis superiores son irresponsables en todos los sentidos) no hay tiempo para almorzar/cenar, no brindan elementos de seguridad ni vestimenta minima y necesaria, no hay herramientas por lo que yo tengo que llevar mis propias herramientas a los distintos lugares de trabajo. los supervisores Brillan por su Ausencia. El Sueño y los Sueldos, estan Abandonados hace mas de  1 año"
bad,There is no room for advancement in this company. People are hired based on who they know within the company. It is all politics.
bad,"Poor management. If you're not from Philly and especially if they see that you're from New York City, you will be shunned somewhat. Very cliquey ""Philly"" atmosphere. "
bad,"Weekly I was responsible for all events of the 6 station cluster, sales applications & activations. I managed AE's from all six stations inviolved with the various events."
bad,A empresa paga o vale transporte fatiado o alimentação também isso faz que venho o desmotivo do funcionário
bad,"Las Vegas management does not know how to be honest, the benefits are the best reason to work here, the culture sucks and the people in accounting make life miserable."
bad,Employees are overworked and underpaid. You're just a number to them.
bad,did lots of walking. not a lot of communication with management
bad,Viacom is the parent company. CBS radio has 7 stations in Chicago.
bad,"If you like your career stagnant, and a work environment where everyone is miserable; this is your place."
bad,"The Interactive group has a lot of talent and youth, but the silos and autonomy take away from the dynamic work that is done there. Decentralized teams, inconsistent direction and the lack of support create a lot of unnecessary tension for some incredibly hard-working people."
bad,"It's a place where you get your experience and GET OUT! Ideal for recent college grads or anyone just breaking into the industry but for anyone with glamorous long-term goals, this small station in Richmond won't cut it and surely neither will the salary!"
bad,"A typical day at work is fustrations in dealing with the office staff, not due to personal differences but the working systems in place and the unwillingness to change. The comment of ""we've done it like this for years"" is a regular occurance. All this leads to tension on the shop floor."
bad,"Trabajas 8 hs corridas. Con un descanso de media hs."
bad,"riunione forza vendita, analisi concorrenza, assegnazione clienti potenziali. contatto clienti potenziale, back office, gestione contratti in essere. controllo impianti cartellonistica propri e concorrenza; visita clienti."
bad,"This is a very old fashion company. They rarely promote. If you want to stay in the same position for years come here, if not don't waste your time applying. Management on all levels could improve."
bad,The company is more interested in saving money and shows little consideration for employees home life and family time.  They have a mission to eliminate labor costs through outsourcing and automation sadly. The management culture is not really concerned with motivating employees or long term continuation of the company.  They are mostly concerned with the short term.
bad,"It's not a nice place to work, especially if you are pre diem.   "
bad,"no base salary, all commission. They start you on a draw and then take away your base after 3 months. the role is all new business and you're expected to hit the ground running and close. Great role if you come from an agency -- very high commission. terrible role if you want to do honest developmental business as there is no base during slower months."
bad,My boss hated me from the beginning.  The technology is very old and IT can't do anything about it.  Company laid people off every 6 months or so.  Facilities were old.
bad,"If you are going to be in the sales support team, don't. Or the bare minimum you will at least learn a lot, learn as much, then leave that toxic place. Because the sales support team seriously gets abused, they think that with little parties here and there ""people will be happy"". But what about the paychecks?"
bad,Big company.  Too many managers.  Lots of politics.  Ok opportunities to advance.  Nice office.  Decent people.  Good healthcare.  Micro management of staff at times.
bad,"most of the faculties are of same age group so less chances of learning from senior persons."
bad,"El trabajo es bastante esclavizante casi no tenes derecho a nada y no te reconocen nada sobre tu desempeño, en fin el sueldo es poco renumerable y eso lo desgasta a uno."
bad,No abusar de lo derecho de la persona por creer tener poder en su cargo ser humanitario es aser creser a una empresa no hundirla
bad,CBS views employees as a nuisance.  The arrogance and incompetence of some of the corporate HR areas is mind-boggling.  This is not an employee friendly place and employee training is non-existent.
bad,It was a typical media company with low pay and no career advancement. All the tech were really old school and no work life balance at all. Didn't learn much from work there.
bad,"Confused department with incompetent, troubled person managing experienced, frustrated professionals. Nothing got done easily or efficiently, or correctly."
bad,"Overall management doesn't really care for the little people, unless you are making them some sort of money--talent, AE's-- they don't care for the administrative team. They will fire people and pile on work to the team without any monetary compensation. I guess it's good to get your foot in the door if you are a recent grad, and it looks good in a resume-but other then that-- it's best you start looking for a new job soon after your first year there."
bad,"great schedule."
bad,"The managers do not manage people, only paper. Rude, abrasive management, screams and curses all the time, hates thier upper manager, flips him off when he walks by. Reps very rude, make great money but treat management bad, management let's them do it to get money. No policing of established reps, they wander in and out on days they choose."
bad,lot great people met there just didnt seem productive enough i like challages and to stay busy lot standing around here
bad,"I worked several jobs for CBS Radio. 1. Promotions- A typical day would consist of 2 things, warehouse or on site. In the warehouse is where the fun stuff happened, we build, sculpt, create, construct anything and everything for certain promotional events like Gasperilla pirate fest, haunted forests, ZooBoo, Howl O scream, Photo Ops, the state fair, etc...On-Site we would be the face of the radio, promoting up and coming and current concerts or events, hand out t-shirts and tickets to on air winners, assist in give away's, cover venues with banners, posters and flags for station recognition, and be the life of the station identity."
bad,It was a nice place to work. Then they went to nepotism and we all know how that works you do the work for someone else to take the credit. So i had to leave.
bad,Out of the 8 hours you must be on the phones for 7.5 of those hours. Some of the other staff were self proclaimed mean people. The others were extremely nice. The manager was fair.
bad,"You work 5 hours straight before getting a break which is only a half hour.  For all of the work involved you deserve two 15 minute breaks as well. Most of the people are miserable and pumped up on redbull and other energy drinks just to get through the day and meet their weekly performance quota. Conveyors are down alot. Leaks in the building etc. They pay well but the upkeep in the building is terrible. A lot of the coworkers are rude and don't want you to work with them. Everyone is flustered and moving like robots to keep their jobs. Just about everyday people are let go. Many times management has been cursed out by angry  workers being fired for little or no reason. Security does nothing but watch cameras, which explaims the  fatal imcident that happened in bristol, pa before they moved to new jersey. Safety is not their priority at all .You walk in everyday stressed about meeting your 100% goal every week and never know if it's going to be your last day of work.  There are undercover lawsuits for claims of discrimination from multiple  people. There clearly is favoritism and unfair treatment. It's a good job to work temporarily but not for a career. The environment is too stressful, its made to not communicate with each other and just work  like a slave until you have your 30minute break."
bad,Management team is not good. No job security. Work environment is not good. Managemement team is very politicized. I will not recommend this place to anyone.
bad,"A typically day of work consist of going out to events and promoting the brands of CBS Radio. For example, last week I worked the Lo Cash Concert at House of Blues. We typically have deals with local venues and we go out and interact with the listeners. We play games and keep the social media pages updated through out the night."
bad,this job was a lot of fun.  I started interning as a promotions assistant in college to fulfill the credit I needed to graduate. While interning I got to meet a lot of cool people and got to go to concerts for free.
bad,"However, if you have ambition to learn and or move forward within the corporation! GOOD LUCK! Being someone who pushed myself and yearned to learn on my own was the only reason for a good work experience here!"
bad,Learning things were essential but no matter how great you do you'll still be told you're doing terrible. Literally. The best thing to do if you work for CBS-7 is to learn what you can and get out as soon as possible before you have a heart-attack.
bad,"Fun place to work, but a whole lot of politics. Great benefits, and great atmosphere depending on what floor you work."
bad,"Management is not very strong. Kissing up is regarded as more important than hard work and creative ideas. Not a stable environment for long term employment (unless you are higher management DOS, GSM, VP, etc)."
bad,Trabajo muy exigente pero solo contrataban por tres meses.
bad,Sinceramente una manejadora tenía una relación amorosa secreta con el jefe  y eso influia mucho en las horas que me daban
bad,"péssima administração e gestores despreparados, gostava de trabalhar, na área de logística porém fui prejudicado por gestor incompetente."
bad,Poor work life balance and too many incompetent long-timers in the jobs affecting the overall productivity. Totally unrealistic resourcing and schedules established by management that doesn't care about the employees but only their budgets and bonuses.
bad,"loading and unloading trucks, staging products to be shipped scanning products into system and staging them to go to proper machine. Learned a great deal about transmissions what is involved in making them and how many are shipped out per day. The hardest part of the job finding room for staging. The best part getting moved around to differnt areas learning more and more."
bad,Really nothing special about it. Just a media company that still considers many IT and back-office functions an after-thought. Decent workload but really no opportunity for career advancement.
bad,"The people are nice.  However, there is no structure or commitment to growth, development, or career advancement.  Leadership is in transition and no signs of a clear strategic plan."
bad,"Once management changed, company moral plummeted, due to their harsh criticisms, constantly changing values, and knee-jerk reactions to the smallest things. By the end of my time at CBS 21, the work environment was downright toxic."
bad,"co-workers are great, hardest part of the job is year round non breaks, the work is good, learned a few things not much, typical work day is nonstop work"
bad,"Busy and Stressful; Sometimes go without lunch breaks."
bad,"Compensation is good, but there is no work life balance.  You are always 'on' regardless of vacation, illness, or natural disaster.  Aging, legacy applications and the refusal to invest in new technologies will be the downfall of some brands.  There is no single mission or leader to unify."
bad,"A typical day would be to go to office and schedule meetings with prospective advertisers or meet with them. The best time to meet clients is 9am-11am Monday thru Friday. During baseball season I would entertain clients in the CBS Radio suite and watch a Chicago White Sox home game."
bad,stocked ladies rooms with toilet paper paper towels an feminine products it was only seasonal did not teach anything so was unable to learn and grow.
bad,Exceeded revenue projections with this Atlanta based sales and marketing team
bad,"I was at this internship for about a month. I mostly read books. The place was very slow during that particular time, there was not much for me to do."
bad,"Management is very cooperative, respect giving and a passionate listener.I learned different psychology of human nature  which is of a core importance in Hr Profile. There is no hard and fast regulation and professionalism for the work . "
good,typical day would be slow paced outbound call center very quiet not to much interaction with other employees or with manager
good,working environment is very good in this company and the product of this company Is CBS ( Core Banking Solution) which is used in banking software....
good,i like working for cbs but the jobs they assigned me wasnt always a good match of my work history.
good,Het beleid mag wel een opfriscursus gebruiken en daarnaast zijn er geen doorgroeimogelijkheden aangezien het tijdelijke functies betreffen.
good,"Dit was voor mij een ""tussenstation"" totdat ik beters zou vinden."
good,"i would proof read all orders to make sure names, numbers, addressed were on the orders."
good,CBS is a great company because of it's flexible hours but it doesn't value its staff. The company has great communication but little benefits and support.
good,"Challenging job due to lack and decrease in television viewership.  Audience appeal tends to be 65+, which is no longer as attractive to potential advertisers."
good,Reps need to complete invest themselves in order to succeed.
good,"Depends on the company, but most jobs are warehouse positions"
good,"There is not alot to say of recent activity I did have good experience in past. Pay was a little low for duties but, I was able to supplement my income with the work."
good,"Werk interessant, collega's fijn. Management en leiderschap beneden alle peil. Zeer onderdrukkende angst cultuur. Geen doorgroei mogelijkheden."
good,Micro-management makes it difficult to do simple tasks and thrive
good,"My coworkers / Boss have a great sense of humor."
good,There are lots of talented people in the company with lots of potential.
good,"Mi horario de entrada es a las 7 am y el horario de salida es 15 pm   cumplir el rol de encargado de turno durante un (1) año asi como tambien las rotaciones de horario, mañana, tarde y noche. todas estas experiencias me dejan a lo largo de estos dos (2) años y medios buenos compañeros y un buen ambito laboral."
good,"You get what is left over, and the pay is awful. Hard work, lots of heavy lifting. Not much help from the employees there, who hate temporary help."
good,"good place to work at, can have better management. Overall a good experience. Co workers were great, doing what I love is what I enjoyed."
good,"My experience at CBS taught my the importance of execution. I learn to become more aware of my client needs which lead to better presentations, closing ratios, and overall success."
good,"busy work in the commercial dept. early mornings, lates nights"
good,"Verantwoorden en administratie vorige werkdag,"
good,Managers need to mentor. Everyone lives with their head down. There is no team mentality. Would love to see a more creative and up to date management.
good,"Managed Poorly, flexible hours, flexible work environment. Kind and Helpful Staff. Most enjoyable was speaking with co-workers. Hardest part of the job was large influx of calls at time and too many tasks to complete with limited staff."
good,"Although CBS and Showtime are within the same company, they pay structure is very different. Showtime pays significantly less."
good,"lots of work, willing to pay overtime but not promote to full-time for benefits. promotions from within are difficult."
good,"The work hours are long, your responsibility is 24/7, your pay is way below average. Micromanagement from the corporate financial department is intense. Corporate does not invest in the company."
good,"very busy, electric, challenging"
good,"Compensation is not on par with other firms. Mentoring is not available, but good office environment"
good,"The work day is pretty long with expected hours of 8:00-5:00pm. This has been an eye-opening experience in terms of learning about advertising. They don't make it easy for you mainly due to no CRM, no training until you're halfway through the 6 month introductory period. It was nice to gain some experience but because of this job, I will not be seeking a sales position within radio advertising again. Its a dying sector which is why it's difficult to develop new business."
good,"CBS was a great place to gain valuable experience of what it's like to work in a corporate based world. People will have power that don't deserve it and you'll have to take your lumps. "
good,The job I had was good st the start then it got worse as the days went on earlier starts later finishes no social life at all the job was very strenuous and didn’t care much for the people and age of the person doing it
good,"Most of the people are extremely nice, and the atmosphere is relaxed, but the salary and benefits are not competitive. They have also let go of a a lot of people, and now you have one person doing multiple jobs without extra pay."
good,"This was a temporary position for me."
good,"CBS in an ever changing environment.  The senior employees are knowledgeable and willing to share experiences.  The new employees are happy and unaware.  The management is in flux.  The hardest part of the job is to not know more than your bosses and if you do, present the possible answer is a non threatening manner."
good,"cbs c est une entreprise  de chaudronnerie ou on trouve plusieurs culture  "
good,"CBS is a great company to get started and begin networking. However, can be a bit difficult to move up in ranking. Can be rewarding at times, but can have long and difficult hours."
good,Great place to get your foot in the door. Otherwise you'll be underpaid with lack of growth and advancement. Decent perks if you know someone.
good,"Good compensation for radio. Busy but rewarding work. Atmosphere can be fun, but a little loud at times."
good,"a typical day i got to my desk do insurance reimbursement, sent out letters, updating patients medical records.i remember this one girl was very friendly to me and willing to show me the ropes because i was new there. the hardest part out of the job was no one to laugh or smile with. the only thing i enjoyed was going to the mail room that piece of equipment was fun."
good,It's a radio gig. There is no loyalty but it is a good way to get your foot in door.
good,Required traveling and lots of documenting. Provided one on one assistance to child with special needs.
good,A lot has changed there since the economy has gotten bad and consumers have started to purchase books electronically. Technology has severely hurt the business.
good,"A typical day was very redundant, with little to know room for change. I learned a good deal about the radio industry, but mostly that it was not for me. Management was lax, but effective. Co-workers were often fellow college students working on non-paid internships for college credit. The job was not difficult at all. I most enjoyed brainstorming market strategies and promotion tactics."
good,"Advertising sales is what it is, not easy in a down economy but fun place to work, people for the most part are awesome."
good,"You must come in and be ready to work right away. There's minimal direction in terms of progressing skills, business development, thus you must be ready to create your own enterprise in a constantly evolving industry."
good,Bonne entreprises  !! Manque d'évolution malheureusement malgré les années et les demande...
good,Management seems less and less concerned about its employees with every passing year. This is a good place to work but it used to be great. Corporate had added some incentives to retain/attract quality employees but local management is counteracting that with poor choices.
good,"Culture and environment have drastically gone over a cliff at the station level. Good people leaving locally and from the corporate level, focus revolve around their own agenda."
good,"There were many changes happening at the time of my employment. Most of the change was with upper management. It seemed that at the time, lower management was under negative pressure and that feeling would trickle down to regular employees."
good,"CBS was OK. Lot is small so you get to know everyone pretty quickly but parking is really bad, especially when a show is taping or a visiting production/movie comes."
good,training was abysmal; my trainer told me i had set up an on air mistake.  when i said i couldnt figure it out and asked for help she refused and let the mistake go ON AIR.
good,"CBS is a company with a long history, and it shows in their culture. Many people stay in the same position for decades and CBS continues to succeed in a changing media and broadcasting landscape.  Occasionally innovation is resisted with the attitude of ""we have always done it this way"", but there is something to be said for ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"".  The company is very stable and the established leader in the media and broadcasting field."
good,Not the best place to work but will get you by for the time being. Theres no energy. its really strict. If you are not anyone of importance then the boss is inconsiderate when it comes to certain things.
good,"CBS is a good company to work for, yet the department I work in has had many faults. I don't feel like I've been given proper training. Co-workers are great but management has been subpar in properly allowing new workers to train."
good,Unfortunately due to technical layoffs the job that I held for 16 years is longer available. Downsizing and hubbing out to non union companies to save money.
good,"I feel like they don't need to hire me full-time even though there are two open positions in my department. They get close to F/T work out of me, but won't offer me benefits even though I've been there nine months."
good,La polyvalence du poste (achats - assistance commerciale - sélection des produits pour les clients)
good,"The people of the company were very and the employees were knowledgeable in the areas of interest; however, the government impeded process, work performance, production, and interfered with company decisions.  This affected employee morale and job security."
good,It depends on what department you work in but in the promotions department everything is super shady and they don't tell you what you need to know until its too late.
good,"The co-worers are great, most of the managers are not. The culture around the office is extremely poor. The company is currently being shopped."
good,"- Prospecting and qualifying clients for 1 hour"
good,"Workday consists of writing orders, doing powerpoint presentations for account execs, nice coworker, salary is not great, not a ton of room for advancement but once in awhile something comes up"
good,"Good company, help the community. However, CBS would rather hire someone new than to promote someone within their team that already knows the system."
good,Co-workers are helpful to one another and look to achieve job performance.
good,"CBS is an awful hard place to move up in. If you need a start in radio it, is a great place to start."
good,"making plenty of calls every day was fun at the beginning but you finish getting used to it, and enjoying it time to time, also it depends on the campaign."
good,CBS is a good company to work for as long as you have a good DOS and GSM.
good,Since the CBS take over the culture of GameSpot.com has become very sterile and almost like a vacuum.  The priorities have shifted off of building a core audience to chasing trends for high view counts.  Much of what every CBSi property has become this way since the acquisition.
good,"There is NEVER a dull moment and you're sure to meet many of your favorite celebrities and entertainers. Certainly, a great place to network and build industry connections. Unfortunately, the environment misses the mark in morale and lives up to the typical ""overworked/underpaid"" scenario... severely underpaid."
good,Great place to start to get your foot in the door of the music industry. Compensation on the other hand is not great.
good,"This has been a difficult position because most people in this department work from 9am to 9pm and are stressed out.  "
good,"You report to the radio station, make sure you have everything you need prior to leaving for a remote in the company car. I've learned to deal with all sorts of customers and that everything is strictly business. Management is pretty standard do your job. You may or may not get praised for your hard work. If you mess up, you will be hearing from management. The co-workers are all excellent teachers, have great conversation skills and each have a distinct personality. They are more like family than anything else.The hardest part of the job is weather conditions. The most enjoyable part of the job is the opportunity to meet people, normal people do not have access to. It also doesn't always feel like a job since you usually have fun doing your ""events"""
good,Loved the people and environment. Everyone had a pleasant personality.
good,AE's run the show...culture sucks. VP and Director of Sales have no clue how to treat human beings let alone sell based on client's needs.
good,"Lack of consistency in the departments in terms of compensation, flexibility, growth and career advancement. Steps are being taken to correct past poor culture but can be slow moving."
good,"Enjoyed working with multitude personality types, and executives on a daily basis. highly stressful but very rewarding environment. "
good,"Management is never around to help or answer questions it's like you are on an Island, you have to relaid on your experience and not enough staff not what i expected."
good,during survey work time i feel it one of the hardest work but interactive program for me like bachelor level student. I have know about how can we deal with public during survey. though their management process are poor but i successfully completed the given responsibility. During work i have to spent long time for work in a day. I feel delightful during interaction process with public.
good,"The workload is extremely heavy and requires the ability to successfully prioritize and multitask among various tasks in a day, often in time sensitive situations.  This a great position for anyone looking to gain a great deal of production legal knowledge."
good,"While I loved my co-workers and direct manager, I couldn't achieve any career advancement because there were never any openings. This was frustrating and discouraging."
good,"For the most part, working at CBS Sports Digital was a positive experience but the company took advantage of its employees, using the fringe benefits to justify long hours, skeleton crews and low wages. The management team was disjointed, located in NY while the majority of the workforce was in CA. They lacked a clear direction for the company, rarely making decisions based on data or analytics. Wasted a lot of time / resources on failed projects or items that never launched."
good,"I've had a good experience being a freelancer at CBS Sports Network for the past 3 years.  My coworkers are great.  Being that I work at the TV studio when shows are taped, however, the hours aren't great."
good,"CBS Radio Dallas made very questionable moves regarding who stayed and who went when layoffs came down.  Also, the company wasn't very advancement-friendly.  Once you in the job you're in, you stay there."
good,"While the salaries are comparable to other networks, there seems to be a a little stagnation in the past few years. Everyone who is currently employed seems to be a ""lifer."" Many people have been there for 20-30 years. It can make it difficult to climb the corporate ladder if you are young and enthusiastic. The company as a whole is compartmentalized and resistant to change or collaboration. "
good,"I learned how to work with a very diverse group of people, as well as how to effectively resolve technical problems. Staying on top of current developments that might impact my field. How to prioritize issues by level of importance."
good,A typical day in radio is arriving at work and not knowing what or who you're going to run into. More importantly it never seemed like work because I had so much fun.
good,This a great company to hone your skills and grow especially out of college. CEO wonderful person but middle management unable to motivate staff. Typical day involves many tasks. Good thing about company is that they allow you to learn new tasks.
good,"Desorganizacion, bajos sueldos, muchas tareas a realizar."
good,"Always a busy place in and out of meetings. Overall a great place to work, learn a lot in this type of environment."
good,"A very hands-on role.  very physical.  I managed a whole shop floor, which was a great experience at sch a young age."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of overseeing our on-air live club broadcasts, and a syndicated show we had contracted on the weekends. I learned industry values as well as ways to execute a radio show that engages the my target audience. The environment was easy going and laid-back seeing as I mainly worked overnight. The most enjoyable part of the job was gaining the experience to be able to move forward and eventually be an on-air personality."
good,My experience was good at the company and I can recommend this company.
good,"CBS Radio is okay. A place you can make a career if lucky, but for many, it's simply a stepping stone."
good,I would go to children home and work on their goals set by mental health
good,Great place to work for journalists and software engineers; not as much opportunity for marketers.
good,My employment with CBS was a great run. I worked for the company in San Antonio until we got bought out and the family atmosphere was broken. Great company.
good,"CBS has a terrific culture where everyone is involved in deciding new ventures, we share ideas and are constantly asked for our opinions. Great place to work in sports"
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was when we had breaking news and it really got busy in the newsroom. The team I worked with were a real joy and pleasure to work with.
good,We can see the owner of the company from time to time. Easy access to affordable food. Friendly environment and not toxic. We meet new people everyday.
good,"The people here are great, but it's a revolving door at the moment. Low pay and high expectations, while not receiving a lot of credit for accomplishments."
good,"Great experience with cameras and audio equipment and chances to advance with graphic training and and technical direction, but hard to obtain more than a few hours a week of work."
good,While I was at this CBS affiliate there were several management changes. The company struggled and had to cancel several newscasts. This meant that about 40 people lost their job all on the same day.
good,"I handled all incoming accounts in this busy dept collecting firm."
good,Cbs maintenance is great when meeting the building expectations. Cleaniness is key clean professional look is also a plus . staff is alsoo considerate.
good,"I was mainly a reporter for real estate and development. I am much more interested in doing reporting on polictics and the environment, and it seems as though the only way that I could achieve that goal is by looking for a different company to work for. I thought that I would be able to prove myself with CBS, so that I could start reporting on politics and the environment, which are things that truly matter to me, but I was unable to transition to a reporting job within CBS that would allow me to focus more on those topics. I kept getting passed over, and I'm not sure why, or if it was due to biases or people simply getting those jobs based off who they know or who they hang out with. I just want to be able to prove myself, and not be concerned with getting assignments or promoted based off who my friends may be."
good,CBS is currently spinning some of it's business off including the division I worked for. It would be difficult to predict the impact that this might have for the future. When I first began working there though it was a very rewarding job. They utilized many new technologies and had a novel approach to cluster architecture.
good,Great place to begin in the radio and marketing field.This place will help you become a part of iconic industry that can effect the community in positive ways
good,"Overall CBS is a good company to work for. The pay is fair and benefits are good and a lot of the people who work there are nice. Dealing with the different sub divisions can be frustrating.  My team is also understaffed, making it difficult to perform our day to day and do projects at the same time."
good,"This job wasn't full time and the hours were all evening hours. I liked all the staff I worked with , and the residents as well. I met alot of neat people and have continue to see some of the residents where I work now."
good,"Typical day consists of cooking, cleaning laundry and caring for sick"
good,Great benefits but pay was low and wasn't given the freedom to learn by experience from my manager. Would have liked to gain more experience and knowledge for future careers in management but felt like I was not given the opportunity.
good,"good work life balance, compensation is good but weak management. too many cooks in the kitchen. great people, you can laugh and have fun but there will also be stressful days."
good,From mid-August to the end of March you are working relentlessly as that is CBS Sports busy season.  The days can be long but seeing the finished product on TV is a great feeling.
good,"Primary focus on new biz development, lots of time spent outside the office cold calling and meeting clients in person. No corporate card allowance for networking and client lunches, travel expenses, or car allowance."
good,"CBS had poor management and poor pay for the amount of work you did. Nothing was ever in its place, co-workers were rude and childish."
good,"Suite à un pref temps d'emploi, malheureusement cette société "
good,Great place to begin your career. It is very hard to move up the corporate ladder and get individual recognition for working on projects due to the size of the company and poor management.
good,"Great benefits, management was ok, really nice place to work for a short while and learn as much as you could about the business"
good,CBS is a great place to start as an intern. There are lots of opportunities to work on projects and gain exposure to the happenings of the company.
good,I have been working at CBS over 2 years and in that time I have met great people who are fully invested in working hard and being team players.
good,Internship with the news department.  Logged tapes and answered phone calls at the news desk.  The reporters would sometimes let you tag along with them to cover stories.
good,"CBS RADIO is one of the largest major-market broadcast media operators in the United States and the undisputed leader in news and sports radio. Producing original audio and video content, live events and exclusive programming broadcast via on-air, online and mobile platforms, CBS RADIO reaches more than 72 million consumers nationwide each week.  As a part of CBS Corporation, the division owns and operates 117 radio stations in 26 markets."
good,I was only an intern and completed 150 hours there but during my time I did learn a lot. Most of the people were friendly and there was always something new to learn.
good,Decent job-Hard sale=tough to find clients. No protected area
good,Was a great place to work until management started changing every 6 months. No consistency.
good,Great company to work directly with local advertisers and national agencies to develop and grow new and current business.
good,It wasn't the situation I was presented prior to signing. There wasn't the familial environment that was presented. Seemed to be a situation where it was everyone for themselves.
good,Really enjoyed the job early on but later on it got really corporate and management became too involved and micro managed.
good,Working to serve the public was most enjoyable. Getting results and giving people a voice was extremely satisfying.
good,"Had a great time working there but radio isn't for me. Lots of cold calling, accounts are a free for all. Management is stuck in the 90's. But it is a fun atmosphere and has plenty of perks like concerts, sporting events, creativity is encouraged. There are some great people there who are nice outside of work but they'll cut your throat over accounts."
good,"Good place to work at. You are given opportunities to work on your craft, but I am trying to grow within the company, but it is harder than expected."
good,"easy and free working environment."
good,"I worked at this temp service . It paid $10 a hour . While working there I sodered computer boards , performed quality control , and inventory ."
good,".Answer all incoming telephone lines and route them to the appropriate person/department while assisting walk in customers/vendors with cash and/or credit card transactions. Create and modify documents and reports using Microsoft word and excel. Perform general clerical duties to include, but not limited to: photocopying, faxing, mailing correspondence and filing. Enter and invoice all parts orders into the computer system, pull orders from the warehouse and arrange shipping for them with the local trucking companies while maintaining the customer files. Assist with payroll each week for over 40 employees."
good,This was an internship I did. I learned how to work some of the radio equipment in the studio.  We also learned how to edit some of the shows.
good,"Je gaat de deur uit en je weet niet waar en bij wie je later op de dag een kop koffie zit te drinken en een interview mag doen."
good,"fhhfhfhfh"
good,"I enjoyed working with the Promotions Team. We were able to watch some of the concerts we were working when we were finished promoting. The team members were really nice and we all worked hard, but also had a lot of fun. "
good,"Learned all aspects of producing a television show, collected stories online as topics for the show"
good,"I have learned a great deal about sales, sports marketing, and the radio industry during my time with the company.  Despite decent compensation, excellent health benefits, and a few other great perks, there is no room for advancement if one is not suited for sales."
good,"I worked on daily promotions for a show. I felt I learned the general workings of the show. I just never learned the specifics. Management was average, I can't really say anything really that negative. Just felt like a number many times during my employment. My co-workers were some of the best people I have worked with. They had a great work ethic and all had great attitudes which made work enjoyable. The hardest part of the job was trying to make our deadline feed time while our boss was changing everything up to the last minute. The job was very stressful but we always managed to make air. The most enjoyable part of the job was it was always challenging and the co-workers were great people."
good,at first it was hard because i really did not know how to clean but my house. there are requirements in cleaning these big buildings in manhattan. the supervisor really liked me she would give me alot of overtime nd it was a seasonal job.
good,"During my tenure for the second time with CBS, I was promoted into management and saw significant growth in my industry knowledge and management skills."
good,The flexibility of the job allowed staff to take care of family and complete a full work schedule.
good,Great work environment and a fun place to work took cofee breaks
good,"Un trabajo de mantenimiento y limpiez en un hospital, con horarios rotativos,aprende todo lo k es higiene y mantenimientos."
good,"mi área a cubrir era guardia turnos rotativo en el hospital, buena relación con mis compañero."
good,There were numerous billing entities requiring much knowledge from a billing and reimbursement perspective.
good,Excellent place to learn more about broadcasting and entertainment
good,"Decent working for company, management is not the greatest, coworkers are awesome, a typical day at work is lots of it most of the time not getting a break or even a lunch."
good,"Currently, I've been hired as a part-time DJ for the Mix 96 station in Sacramento, and I'm so glad to be back on the air. I do wish I was working for the station full-time because so far everyone is so nice to work with. Also, the music is fun and upbeat!"
good,"•Created letterheads, memos, and work schedules for a department of 100 employees"
good,This is a top media company. Hard work is rewarded. Moderate travel for this position. Continuous learning is expected from self-motivated employees.
good,"The culture at CBS Sports overall is excellent, nearly everybody there is enjoyable to be around and employees are encouraged to converse make friends. The hours are all over the place, just due to the nature of the sports industry. The pay is low, and has minimal increases year over year. The company generally tries to hire people from within, but there is not a ton of room for growth. CBS is constantly pinching pennies, and it seems that they generally have the sense that the employees should be thanking them for giving them a job rather than trying to keep employees happy. Long story short, it's a very fun place to work with a lot of great people, but it's a risk to spend too long at the company and expect a lot of career advancement."
good,"Because we had to recruit it was very fast paced and cut throat and competitive to recruit people. However, being a moderator was a lot of fun and exciting! I enjoyed my coworkers. Training was very good."
good,"questionable management decisions at times. They are more interested in the product than the people, so you just have to know that going in. It's not about how you can advance personally."
good,"Muy bueno, trabajas comodo sin que no tengas inconvenientes, lo unico malo por ahy son algunas supervisoras que hacen persecucion laboral."
good,"CBS this far has been a great company. I enjoy the employee benefits, and employment package. "
good,Worked with at risk teens with behavioral problems to assist with reducing the display of targeted behaviors.  Took teens out in the community to teach coping skills and interventions in addition to learning appropriate etiquette in the community.
good,"Good benefits.  The people were, generally, very friendly and transparent.  Provides really good experience to those starting off in tax."
good,its a ok place to work but gets boring and staff are  bit funny there
good,It was a great experience. Learned the logistics  behind radio sales/ advertisement
good,"Job Work/Life Balance"
good,"CBS is a great company to work for if you have the right connections within the organization. It's a large organization and trying to come to the company with new, innovative ideas was extremely challenging when working with local clients. They had below average digital products which made it very difficult to succeed in a broadcast TV sales environment. The lack of products made it difficult as a digital consultant to succeed."
good,Not how sure a day would go unless you know where you are working...
good,You need to have great time management and organizational skills to be successful. Persistency is key and knowledge of the company's products are essential. Prospecting and cold calling are an integral part of the sales process the new employee may find difficult. There are many perks to the job and can be a great company to work for once you get your accounts built up.
good,"Typical day of creating files, updating files, fufilling requests for the group. I learned that make sure you are able to manage and prioritize your work. Management was organized. My co-workers were great to work with, very cooperative and helpful. The hardest part was the workload sometimes. The most enjoyable was being able to work with a great team of people."
good,Arrive and gather materials for scheduled events for the week and load company cars. At events we typically set up our promotional display and interact with listeners for a two hour period. In the office management is usually very busy and are often not able to provide proper direction. This leads to lots of individual efforts to stay busy. I have learned what needs to be done and am able to achieve that most days within the time alotted. The hardest part of my job is staying motivated with the lack of compensation and hours I receive. The most enjoyable part is all the different events we do all over the Twin Cities.
good,"A typical day of work would include working either an event for a client or a concert for a venue. First you start off by loading up the car with the items for the event. Setting up, working the event, tearing down and returning back to the station."
good,"There's a lot to gain and a lot to learn from all of the experienced employees, fun and fast-paced environment, great starting point for anyone looking to work in broadcast media."
good,too short contract to tell.  People were great but they are a bit unorganized.  Seems like they may have had some turnover recently and they are using very old technology.  I think they are having challenges moving to new tech.
good,"Good place to work for job security and internal advancement.  A typical day of work is a mix of meetings, pen to paper office work and social interactions with co workers.  This is a more traditional work environment (versus 'trendy') which has some perks (IE still give employees offices etc.)."
good,"Handling day to day processes"
good,"Overall working at CBS was a truly great experience. The product is amazing but unfortunately, the salaries are low. CBS only offers 10 vacation days to new hires, which is a serious struggle for most adults or parents."
good,"in at 9am out at 8 pm,  long hours,  some great people but upper management only cares about the bottom line.  best part of the job was going home."
good,"A typical day at work for me was to meet and greet clients who came in building, direct them to there designated floors,handle all incoming and outgoing calls,and provide emails throughout the day.What I learned working as a contract guard at CBS is that it is always best to work in house instead of contract. I worked with many different people and it was a great experience. The hardest part of the job was not having a steady shift and not being recognized for great work. The most enjoyable part of working at CBS was meeting successful people."
good,"As a board operator the typical day is around 5 hours of managing time and making sure that the station runs smoothly.  I learned while working at CBS how to stay cool under pressure, how to clearly and concisely communicate, and work with talent.  The management was tough but fair, you knew what was expected of you, and as long as you managed to fulfill your obligations they were great to work for.  The co-workers were a fun and interesting group but you were generally working alone.  The hardest part of the job were the graveyard shifts.  The best part of the job was the perks that were provided such as concert tickets."
good,Small company that provided a/r management and billing for physicians.
good,I have learned many new skills while working for CBS Radio. It has allowed me room to grow and enhance my skills and abilities. It has made me confident in my negotiating and project management skills.
good,Not Consistant I was Freelance Per Diem called at all different hours. Lots of overtime while it lasted.
good,"The best part of CBS are the other employees.  Everyone is incredibly friendly and helpful.  There is a real ""team"" environment there and you are always surrounded by people whose main goal is to help each other.  "
good,"trabajo en equipo con mucho compromiso y responsabilidad a la hora de trabajar .Aprendi a relacionarme con jefes repositora cajeras clientes, asi tambien manejo de herrramientas para una mejor resultado."
good,"Professional environment in a big radio market. High tech, quality facilities. As usual in such an organization, interpersonal relationships were the most difficult."
good,"Früh am Morgen sortieren, scannen die Waren, laden die Ware"
good,"we are working on network improvement and protect our network from penetration.."
good,"mi occupavo della vendita diretta ottimo rapporto lavorativo ."
good,Engeteur. Onderzoeken voeren voor de overheid. oa. percentages samenstellen.
good,We covered some great stories. The people there are hard workers and someone will always pitch in to help move the story forward.
good,Good place to work and was close to home as well.  I loved working in the radio side of the industry and hoped for alot more within the time which I was working for them.
good,"large corporate atmosphere with multi stations located under one roof. lots of in office parties, drinking, talent visiting office, not a place to grow and a lot of revolving door employees."
good,I love work for CBS.  I feel that often the team is amazing to work with.  I feel like the company doesn't value part time employees as much as full time employees.
good,Loved the radio world but there was just too much drama with the staff and company.
good,Long hours and little pay! The project was mismanaged yet we somehow made a nice product.
good,The people are wonderful. The management is misguided and the pay is not the worst in the market but not the best either. When I was there they didn't want to spend money on really anything. People would leave and wouldn't be replaced.
good,"Just show up and do your job. Less is more at this studio. Too many people in the boss' office. Unsafe facility, favoritism, backstabbing, lots of broken promises and no structure."
good,"With the rotating barrel of management bullets, it's shot out one day and loaded the next."
good,"CBS has excellent culture,  but the department i worked for was extremely fast paced, with people constantly moving in and out of their roles. while immediate management was excellent, the VP would constantly belittle and talk down to us. its hard to enjoy working when you feel like your never comfortable with her around."
good,This job is based on the market where you live. It teaches you about community culture and is not available in smaller markets where the culture is less diverse.
good,I was helping out a friend who did a bunch of runner type of work for CBS and other television companies. You arrive early on game day and literally go non-stop for 12 hours. It makes you appreciate what all is really involved in setting up a broadcast for a sporting event.
good,"i am freelance so unable to really give an honest review of this company without being a full time staffer.  However, they do not hire freelancers in a timely fashion.  They wait to the last minute even though the sports calendar has been set for months.  This puts a strain on the working relationship and doesn't allow for any piece of mind on the freelancers part because of CBS's inability to commit and lock in dates for the freelancers"
good,"As an intern, you are responsible for completing estimates and returns.  All the information for completing them is provided for you.  We only enter in the information properly and have it reviewed by managers.  Sometimes we do apportionment.  Many times, we have to look through governmental documents for compliance with the tax law."
good,Cbs help me to get in the automotive /assembly business.They offer you several positions.
good,"My day would start off by delegating tasks to production crew. Paperwork, paperwork, paperwork. Trouble shooting issues as they came to my attention. Fielding questions from the crew. Formatting run through material and setting up game show with props and an interactive Power Point game. "
good,"Communication is key and if employees do not make their concerns known, no one will be aware of their well being. Management is mainly loyal to the company."
good,"Hired as part-time employee for the Promotions Team.  If you are looking to get into Promotions/Marketing, the Street Team is a great way to start. The promotions staff is extremely nice and consistently trying to help you learn the ins and outs of radio in order to move up."
good,So much fun. Great experience. Just wish it was a paid internship!
good,"At current, I am responsible for the overseeing and carrying out the directives of the VP/CSD. I thoroughly enjoy what I do and lead a great team of PrEditors and interns who assist me in making our affiliate station increase our footprint locally both on-air and socially with smart, creative broadcast promotion, online and marketing campaigns. Though it seems if there are never enough hours in a day and challenges come, I face them always with a can-do attitude and am always willing to ""sit in the chair"", for-go sleep to make it happen if need be. Seeing a challenging project come to fruition is quite gratifying still to this day."
good,"Station doesnt take itself as seriously as it should. While a decent size market, the company is run with a 100+ market mentality"
good,"I was on the road all day going,office to office"
good,"As an Executive Producer I was in charge of managing the sports department, which means I decided what stories made air, I assigned crews to the stories, I wrote copy for the sports segments and I produced all the sportscasts and special programs. I also interviewed sports figures, athletes, and covered events like The Super Bowl and the NBA All Star Game."
good,"As a photo assistant I worked with the photo publicists and VP of CBS Photography on a daily basis. Each day I edited and reviewed CBS' photography coverage for advertising and publicity purposes. Depending on what show CBS was covering, I would work as the digital tech on set and edit / send out photographs for approval by CBS' internal publicity team."
good,I enjoyed my time working for CBS. Pretty cool environment. A punctual but relaxing atmosphere. Very well rounded team. CBS always made an effort to show that they cared.
good,"A solid job to pay the bills.Corporate culture does not allow for much innovation. A lot of great people work here, and the vast amount of characters make the job interesting."
good,"Nice Work atmosphere, but management changed and went downhill. "
good,This is great company to get into but you better swim fast. You are thrown to the wolves immediately and you better learn quick.
good,It's a great company but very hard to move up and get promoted to a better position.
good,I had steady income and stayed busy but I had to wear a different color hairnet and full time employees had a different personality when it came to training a temp to hire.
good,"A typical day at work included gathering and analyzing data, providing guidance and overall leadership to the staff, motivating key stake holders, and applying a structured management plan in accordance with established policies to assure project deadlines were met. The data gathered would be used for daily, weekly, and monthly reports and also used in PowerPoint presentations to describe gains and losses in metrics and revenue."
good,"I have a great experience in my current company. Here I dealing with tax and GST return filing of different sector clients. And also keeping and maintaining of Cash book, bank ledger and party ledger, Maintaining daily transactions in tally. And I have great knowledge in excel."
good,Excellent experience I love it because everything was so relaxing I didn't have any problems with the patients I was caring for. The patient family treated me as if I was family also.
good,My supervisor was very decent they have an attendance bonus that I hear they have made better since I worked there. Overall it's not a bad place to work at all.
good,Agréable et bien former. Ils apprennent bien le travail
good,I was a runner for CBS sports for a football game and a basketball game (at USC). I learned a lot about the business and it was very cool to sit in the commentator box with the commentators.
good,"I loved working for CBS-I was a Production Assistant for 3 years. I worked every event from Super Bowl to US Open Tennis. I worked primarily in the studio for their shows or shooting features. I applied for full time position since I was considered a Freelance. At this time CBS merged with CBS SPORTS NETWORK (not even sure what that was) By my third year it was clear that they were doing a house cleaning and many people who worked their whole life were let go."
good,"ik bedoel, ik was stagiaire hier voor school, er valt niet echt veel over te zeggen."
good,"Coordination with the stakeholders which includes, management team, Finance team, Business Analyst team and end users."
good,"I host a morning TV show that is 5 and a half hours long. It starts at 4:40 am, so the hours are long but the show is creative and is worth it. Newrooms are tricky, so those who keep their heads down, seem to succeed."
good,"As a Per Diem Software Tester I work from home, but I do know quite a few people at the CBS offices from NY and LA.  Everyone is great, and it is a great company to work for."
good,Had a good flow with all who worked in the department. Work load was heavy but all was done with everyone working together to complete the tasks at hand.
good,"Poor Management and poor leadership led to high turnover on the sales and admin side. I can not speak for the talent and news side. The leadership was too lack luster, overall very friendly but no grit or growth in wanting to grow your career, advance, or make more money. Poor people in some roles make your job harder. Poor training as well."
good,"CBS Sports is a great place to work at with a great group of friendly individuals. The duties and responsibilities are challenging, but overall rewarding."
good,"They provided Car, Phone and other training to better advance my skills set. I was also given a large area to work in like New Jersey, Connecticut and N.Y. Westchester.  We all got along very well and that was just fine to me. Can not ask for more."
good,I worked for CBS for 5 years as their Executive Assistant in the IT Department.  In that time I was able to successfully complete my Certification of Microsoft  Office Specialist.  Some college credits were also added to my experience with their tuition reimbursement program.  The benefits were very good and I thoroughly enjoyed being a part of the administrative team who supported C-level executives.  The hardest part of my job was perhaps interacting with challenging personalities.
good,"I have about 14 years experience in a OB/GYN hospital as a registered nurse in China. Because of my background and experience, I would like to work in an environment where my expertise can make a difference."
good,"Working in radio in and of itself is already exciting, because most of it is live, which is an added element of excitement already. The possibilities of meeting notable and famous people are plentiful,"
good,"This job was very fast paced and high energy at all times. It is a job more suitable for a younger generation of employees in my opinion. Although it was a very fun and exciting job, I chose to go a different route."
good,Good company with growth opportunities. Large enough to interact with many different technologies and subject matter experts
good,"cbs does a great job, everyone is hard working, they have a strong journalistic code and they generally treat their employees well."
good,"Each Event that I work at, I need to make sure that I talk to all the fans of our radio station. Make sure that we have all our materials for that event. Email my boss if I have any question. Drive Company Car to event and set up at location. Sometimes I get the equipment for Sound or equipment for the dj. The best part of my job is making people smile."
good,"Fast paced environment constantly changing; good people to work with, co workers are helpful. Hours are very flexible."
good,"It's the news on a national and international scale. It's a high pressure environment, but it can be very rewarding. The people I work with are spectacular on professional and personal levels."
good,"Great people working at the company, but increased communication from management would benefit all. Many times focus changes with little or communication down to employees."
good,"CBS Network is a traditional broadcast news environment. If you want to see how a classic network with true journalistic integrity, you could not do better than to work for CBS. The company philosophy is ""if it ain't broke don't fix it"", which isn't necessarily a bad thing. When you watch a CBS news story, you can trust that what you're watching is as close to the truth as possible."
good,"typical day at work will be with morning meetings, resolving problems, there is involved a lot of communication with the clients and architects"
good,"As the General Sales Manager I worked as the sole sales manager to develop and train the sales department, create new revenue streams for growth, and grow the station local and national spot, ntr, and digital revenue."
good,Here I was an unpaid inter so the hours were flexible and I was able to gain experience in several different fields. However it was unpaid which made it difficult to stay around or keep motivated.
good,"Was here for a very short time, so cannot say anything more than the people were friendly & co operative."
good,"I loved my time with CBS."
good,"A typical day at work consists of pulling morning reports and distributing them to the appropriate recipients. I then prioritize which sales orders need to be handled first, notify the manager of what is being done to each one, and then work on them in our computer systems. I also have to pull spot detail reports or invoices for agency representatives often. I communicate directly with the agency representatives that we work with across the country multiple times a day to ask, or answer any questions that come up regarding their sales orders. "
good,Work consisted of answering phones and sorting mail. Great people to work with in an excellent neighborhood. Enjoyed every minute of it.

good,First job out of school. Very grateful to TBWA for the opportunity.
good,"When not live, everyday is in preparation for upcoming Broadcasts"
good,This place is very interesting. Never a dull moment when the building you work in is home to some of Los Angeles's best radio hosts. This place helped me break out of my shell with all the inspirational folks walking around. Management was very easy and pleasant just like the majority of co workers. Hardest duties were stocking the supplies which wasn't often and also gave you more hours. Best part was the events. Every event was an adventure.
good,Enjoyed working here and leaning about new artists! It was great to get out around Sacramento and meet new people! Interesting to see how certain events are set up.

good,CBS radio is a nice place to work. There are several different radio stations all joined together. The CBS news radio staff are extremely respected and seasoned professionals and it was a pleasure getting to learn from them
good,"I have been part of CBS for over 7 years now and have learned so much within the media industry.  I had the pleasure of working on numerous multi-million dollar accounts, activating huge campaigns, putting together events that ranged anywhere from 500-30,000 people.  This is a great company, but I would love to have the opportunity for new growth and experience at this current time in my career."
good,Great corporation. Ready and willing to offer help where needed. Not one person doing the job of five people..
good,CBS is a huge company and I enjoyed working in media.  Everyday was different and I enjoyed my co-workers.
good,Productive newsroom environment with many moving parts on both the web and broadcast sides. Opportunities to utilize cross-platform media and wear many hats.
good,Learned a lot making parts working with good people and i did help out others when i could
good,I learned how to truly work as a team player at a very hectic pace
good,"would wash dishes, clean counters stock the back fridge sometimes, and clean the kitchen."
good,"The company is solid, but there is virtually no room to move up."
good,"I had to get up really early, but they provided breakfast and lunch every day, some days it was a special catering vendor and it was always great!"
good,"CBS Radio Houston was a fast paced environment. Each day we dealt with growing our revenue and growing the revenue of our clients. At the time, we were the flagship of the Houston Texans, Rockets and University Of Texas, and dealing with those properties was the most rewarding part of the job."
good,The #1 TV station in the country. They really have their act together. Tons of marketing opportunities
good,"The management team was great. They worked hard at keeping me employed. One problem, it was a temp service, and being hired on to a company through from an agency is tough. However, once one job ended, the next day, I had another."
good,"I typical day for an Account Executive at CBS Radio includes new client prospecting, cold calling and qualifying and ultimately creating multi-platform sales campaigns to meet client needs. Existing clients require account management of ad delivery, creating broadcast copy, delivering online and digital banner creative, and securing payment terms."
good,Radio is what I love most and this place was the best. Great coworkers and a fun environment!
good,"• Involved in the selling of on air and digital advertising across the CBS Radio family of radio stations which include, 98.5 WNCX, 92.3 The Fan, Q104 and The New 102.1"
good,I enjoyed my time there and would definitely work there again.
good,"Setting up, operating, and taking down remote promotional sites to promote radio stations and events. I learned how to be part of a promotions team, interacting with the public, and meeting important persons. Management was very professional and fun. Co-workers were fun and helpful. Hardest part of the job was lifting heavy equipment. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with radio DJs."
good,"Great place to work, but to much paperwork and miscommunication between departments."
good,I really liked working there. Would be open to working there again.

good,"•Worked with incident response team, engineering team, and application security/vulnerability management teams to ensure infrastructure was secure and up to date with the latest patches"
good,Hardest part of the position was being on call 24/7. Otherwise it can be a fun place to work. Senior management is top notch.
good,"A typical work day consisted of answering customer calls and emails.  Representatives were responsible for assigning and answering the emails and managing their own responsibilities.  I learned the inner workings of the fantasy website, was in charge of several of the products.  The management was cooperative and had an open door policy.  Not much micro managing as employees were trusted to execute their responsibilities in a timely fashion.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the freedom and ability to openly learn.  The hardest part was dealing with coworkers who did not pull their weight."
good,It is very hard to get in and move up but the experience of working there is great.  You work interesting events and get many fringe benefits but the pay is minimal and advancement opportunities are few and far between.  That being said I had some really incredible experiences working for the Sports Hub Street Team that I would not have had otherwise.  This is a great job to get into the industry but expecting to work there full time is generally not realistic.
good,"It was fun while it lasted.  However, the commute was a killer.  2 hours each way every day.  I was looking for a change of career and a greater income.  But this was over 20 years ago."
good,"I typical work day was different every day. Some days would be helping the day-to-day activities with your assigned Account Executive, while other days might be doing some paperwork or helping with the mailing. Everyone was pretty nice, and when they had a musician come to the radio station for an interview -- sometimes you would be able to meet them."
good,CBSi goes out of its way to please its employees with monthly activities and fun lay out.
good,Válido como uma ótima experiência pois foi uma grande contribuição para minha vida profissional ter feito parte desta equipe.
good,"Excellent work environment. Pleasant co-workers."

good,"CBS as a company is great to work for. CBS Worldwide Distribution, not so much. Upper Management had a laissez faire attitute and left most decisions to inexperienced middle management."
good,The department that I worked for which was the Accounting and Finance was a dynamic group.
good,A typical day at my job would be getting in 30 minutes early to return e-mails and check voice-mails. Then proceed to schedule meeting with 501(3)c organizations and then finally collecting data to include in the FCC quarterly reports.
good,Typical days include working events. You do something different everyday and meet new people everywhere you go.
good,"Loved my job. Then one day was outsourced after creating a manual for how to do my job. So I worked hard on a manual for someone to replace me with. Big corporation, no heart."

good,good place to work. Was happy going to work every day. Great people to work with. Good manager. Good work life balance. unfortunately they had a reduction in workforce
good,I learned a lot working at this company. I am thankful for the experience. This ACT Team really cares about the clients. The most enjoyable part of this job was when a client transitioned down to a lower level of care. The hardest part of the job was when you have a client who just isn't ready to change.
good,"I came in to work on projects.  Everyone has a lot on their plate and works hard. "
good,"The job is definitely exciting. The company was amazing to work for up until the point that Les Moonves announced that CBS wanted to part with it's Radio Division. At this point, I think things will be very quiet until the merger of Entercom and CBS is approved."
good,"While working for CBS I was a driver, for the talent. I would pick them up from events, studios , and get them home safely. It was an amazing experience  working on set with American idol."
good,Working for TV news can be hectic but it is also very rewarding. EACH DAY is very different and presents new challenges. It is necessary to learn balance and patience but also have the ability to work fast and think on your feet.
good,"Overall Very good company, provides you with ample knowledge about information and technology. It provides you an opportunity to work in the filed of your choice. "
good,"There is always something new to learn every day along with new people to meet as the news and media industry is always changing.  The great part about working in this environment is that there is always a sense of ""team"".  If we made decisions based on how to only help ourselves, then the whole thing comes crumbling down.  Depending on where you see yourself, there isn't too much room for advancement as they don't want to lose good workers in those positions"
good,"You truly need a love of sports to be successful at CBS Sports. The company is fantastic. As a member of the editorial team, I had a lot of freedom to write and produce content on various topics throughout sports."
good,"CBS feels much more like a family than a giant corporation. There is genuine care for you and your life at home. Unfortunately, the yearly pay increases are well beneath 3% and there are no bonuses."
good,This job was extremly gratifying. The employees were light and airy fun to work with . the job it self was fairly easy. the hours were great but a little long. overal the worksites were clean  The management was horible. good place to work.

good,See previous review - CBS Corporation is a great place to work.
good,"The best about it was that it is within 3 miles from home"
good,"CBS radio is a great place to start you career, but there is not much room for growth. Radio is changing and less opportunities are available."
good,CBS Corporation is a great company to work for. The company offers great benefits. It gives you a lot of exposure to the media industry. The management team in my department a great mentors and they are always looking to train you to do better.
good,"The day starts looking through emails and press releases for stories. Once you find something, making phone calls to set up interviews. Once that is complete you then meet up with your interview subject either in the studio or in the field and film a series of questions and answers. You return to the news room and type up a script and edit together pieces of footage you gathered from the story and complete it all by the the time news runs. While it can be stressful at times everyday is usually different and stimulating."
good,"CBS Radio in Baltimore is a great company with great people."
good,"CBS is a great place to work. I don't have any complaints. The culture is fun, there is a great work/ life balance, and the management is good."
good,"A typical day starts at 7am, I get my group for the day and then we are given our assignments of what cables we need to run for the day. Everyday I would learn something new. Different types of cables we would use or how to hook the cables into the server boards or even just how to set up the cameras."

good,I am a seasonal freelancer who mostly works local NFL games. Pretty relaxed environment with a sense of teamwork. Plenty of employees so individuals dont feel overworked.
good,"As an intern, I was able to have a more relaxed environment. Each day something new happened but did not learn as much as I hoped I would from the internship. Was given some responsibility but also had a lot of busy work handed to me."
good,Fun environment but pay and benefits not so great.  I learned a lot about radio and advertising.  Management was good.  Tough environment if you're just starting out in sales with no book of business.
good,"Great experience, great people. Minimum wage as an intern and learned a lot. If you want to make it in the entertainment industry after acquiring some work experience I recommend working at CBS."

good,The work/life balance is awesome. My manager was outstanding. If you used to a laid back company culture this would not be it as it is very corporate.
good,"Working in radio is such a rewarding job/career. The experience that you walk away with is priceless and helps to prepare you for a career in other fields. "
good,"Typical day I create custom Motion Graphics for On-Air Production.  I learned so much here just from my co-workers alone, graduated to an expert in After Effects and Cinema 4D. My manager is pretty cool, always on time with payments and scheduling. Co-Workers are like a mini family, lol. Hardest part I'd say is letting go of projects you're working on to meet deadlines, when you know there's so much more you can do with it! Most enjoyable part is the people and work environment, flexibility of hours and scheduling."
good,I enjoy working at Coca-Cola in the CBS department.  The whole office environment is very enjoyable with a flexible schedule to manage work and life activities.

good,"A great company, and an incredible place to learn the media industry."
good,Great job to learn how to edit commercial spots! Not so good pay or advancement possibilities.
good,"CBS Radio and Digital Media is a great company. I learned a great deal about sales and marketing but sales is very hard which is why I am looking elsewhere. My coworkers are great as well as the management, but at the end of the day I have to do what is best for myself and what will make me the most money!"
good,"I have been involved in radio for almost 3 years. When I was first employees at CBS Radio, I was taken on when 104.3 was JACK FM. Currently, 104.3 is K-HITS and it was a pleasure watching the station switch over to a new station and watching it transition. My time spent here I have gotten the opportunity to work with all of the radio personalities, attend many concerts, partake in live broadcasts, be apart of special events hosted by K-HITS and setup promotional trades with various events throughout the Chicagoland area."
good,"Pace of work was slower than I preferred. I came in with very little knowledge on the industry and learned not only about the business, but about leadership and communication in the workplace."

good,"Boa empresa para se trabalhar, possui ótimos benefícios"
good,"Working at CBS has allowed me to gain necessary experience in the field of accounting, specifically in tax. My problem with the company and working for it, is that they hire from outside for management roles making it difficult to move up. I also do not like the working environment since my supervisor is ready to attack me for a mistake then help to understand why and how it occurred. Also the boss condemns talking and makes a big deal out of being late, even when its only once and a while by 5 minutes."
good,First job in the entertainment business so a great place to get my feet wet and learn from those around me.  Was my first exposure to a big corporation and had an opportunity to seesaw a mass media empire works.

good,"Good place to work for your first security job, very friendly. Decent amount of policies and procedures. The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them."
good,"Getting hands-on interaction with on-air products is fun and invaluable, but comes at a cost. Like most jobs in this industry, the top 1% of producers and talent get great shifts and are paid accordingly.  Those who are neither incredibly driven or gifted might have trouble moving up beyond a middling salary and working weekends/overnights as a career.  Management is always willing to help and listen--they're great--but there's a limit on what they can do for you.  Sometimes you either have it...or you don't."
good,"CBS Broadcasting is a unique place to work. As far as the major 3 TV networks (NBC, ABC and CBS,) CBS is the most demanding. I have grown tremendously because of the expectations placed on me."
good,TV Statistician for college and professional sports contests around the country. Team atmosphere. The object is to complete the task at hand and bring the viewer an entertaining broadcast.

good,"My job was to direct thirty nine cameras, five of which were mobile, in order to capture the lives of the people in the house.  I switched between the different cameras in different rooms and created scenes on the fly.  I used my sense of story and directing ability to follow the action.  The experience was exciting.  I had to literally set up a new scene every two to ten minutes.  I coordinated with the producers, audio engineers and directors in order to mold the show into a successful reality show  I learned how to work fast and trust my instincts.  Everyone who worked there was helpfull and fun.  The hardest part of the job was leaving each day.The most enjoyable part of the job was being in control of so many cameras."
good,Great starting position for anyone in the broadcasting industry. Working with various clients and helping drive traffic to small businesses to boost their revenue. Tough and not the best pay for the work.
good,"Mondays and Wednesdays i would go to the studio to help with pod casting and editing audio.  Would also have to go to on site locations for promotional events.  On Fridays i would go into the office and input data from the past week, edit the website, or go to a on site location for a promotional event for the company."

good,I work a daily plan and enjoy interacting with clients to develop customized marketing programs to enhance a grow business. Co- workers and management are supportive. However the corporate culture can create challenges.
good,the sales dynamic in media is very different today. not as much fun. The media market is much more crowded and buyers deal through email rather than in person. Thus - less control in the sales process.

good,"The workplace culture is great.  Everyone gets along.  This makes it enjoyable to work for this company.   However, people have to fight for promotions and salary increases that are well deserved, including simple cost of living increases.  I was not given one for 3 years and then for another 4 years despite saving the company money.  I remained per diem my entire time at this company due to the work/life balance.  I witnessed people working from 9am to 9pm and this wasn't possible for me due to outside responsibilities."

good,"My day was always different . My boss took a chance on me at 19 years old . The biggest thing i learned from him was to never say I cant do something . He taught me that I can do anything  I wanted i just have to go get it. I had some of the best coworkers I could have ever asked for well all knew that to get everything done the right way it took all of us . The only way it could work is if every dept worked together . One of the hardest things about my job was the was all the last minute changes with events but, one thing my boss showed me early was be prepared for everything to go wrong that way noting will go wrong . The biggest joy i got from my job was all the great memories. Being able to do things that people wanted to do and i was being sent to for work. knowing that all my hard work all the live shows could go off with out a hitch . I learned they can talk about me but they cant talk with out me ."

good,"I started working at CBS in 1997 as a news writer and they took a chance on me because I had only done on-air work.  After I proved myself I because to anchor the news and that was when the real learning came in.  CBS encourages well-read, well-informed journalists and not just ""writers or anchors."" They want everyone there to a burning passion for the messy and chaotic news business.  The management is strict, but not overwhelming,  the workplace culture is competitive, but balanced.  The hardest part of the job is deciding what you will lead with.  Local news?  National news?  Sometimes even a celebrity story can make you wonder is that's the lead story.  But it always turns out exactly as it should.  The most enjoyable part of the job for me is getting a story FIRST and getting it out there for the listeners to know immediately.  Recently when The President green-lighted a missile attack on Syria, I got to tell our millions of listeners that military action was underway in a joint attack with Britain and France.  Those are the stories  I live for."

My co-workers come from a range of backgrounds- some have been here for years and some are just starting. The hardest part of my job is being recognized for all the hard work my manager and I do.

good,I worked at CBS for over 30 years.  I had a good supervisor and a good job with a degree of flexibility and autonomy.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with.  The management with whom I worked directly was very good - I was always treated with respect.
good,It is an easy gig to work for extra money during the fall and a good way to enjoy broncos games while making a few bucks in the process. It is by no means full time work.
good,"As this position was located at CBS Studio City production facility (40+ acres), the position was extremely busy.  Multiple productions taking place on as many as 15 stages.  The site required a  large, efficient security group.  But the security management team and the Operations group that run the studio are excellent and supportive, making for a demanding but rewarding experience."
good,CBS has excellent benefits and great place work for.  Days were bit hectic but it was part of the job.  Very fast paced work environment. Lots great employees that are very nice to work with.  The hardest part of the job was getting weekend logs completed.  The most enjoyable part of this job w is everyone gets along well.

good,CBS is a good company to work for from the top to bottom. The best part of the job is the friendships built with the people that have been employed .
good,"CBS Radio by far has been the most influential part of my young professional career.  The environment is electric, and no one day at work is the same.  One day we may be out of the office working a promotional event, which could be anything from a huge country music concert in the cities or a fundraiser for a local or national charity.  "
good,Very productive and fun workplace. Had the opportunity to learn a lot about production as well as travel to work related events.

good,"There is no typical day at work which makes the job enjoyable, because you are always doing something different. I have learned to become a strong communicator and to follow precise directions. At CBS co-workers are considered family, because everyone is so enjoyable to work with. The hardest part of the job is sometimes the lack of communication in directions in which leaves co-workers in a bind. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing what type of ideas we can come up with that will excite listeners."
good,for a temp service they keep good paying jobs and most are temp to hire
good,I did a POWERade internship and absolutely loved it!! I had a blast meeting new people and promoting the POWERade brand. The intramurals were so much fun to be a part of and it was a pleasure being able to provide students with some free stuff
good,"Wonderful learning experience. This was my time to fall and get up. I was lucky to have a great manager who understood my personality very well. I love to be the best at everything I do. I won awards for being over goal starting the first month of starting my job at WGN. While I have a great people skills, and selling is not ""selling for me, it is truly finding a way to help businesses or agencies, I was very young and still didn't understand the politics of the corporate world. I fell few times, by believing that I was bringing results for WGN, and while I did bring the result, I was not aware of some politics that came before the results. It was a priceless experience to see the world from another perspective."
good,"Inputted pre-produced commercials into on-air system for playback. Wrote, voiced and produced numerous advertisements that ran on-air. Conducted an independent study about careers in radio broadcasting which gave me a thorough understanding of the skills and or education needed to succeed within each department. Management was a guiding presence that gave me the room to thrive while teaching me the skills needed to succeed in the radio industry. Co-workers were always friendly and supportive of my efforts. The hardest part of the job was staying mentally engaged through the really dull parts of my intern responsibilities such as filing and inputting production orders into the on-air system. I enjoyed creating an audio portfolio that reflected all the skills I learned throughout my internship experience with CBS Radio. I also enjoyed voicing commercial spots for the air."

good,"Relaxed Environment, work comes in waves but when there is crest then it becomes busy, when its trough then we work on building skillset that can be applied to latest projects."
good,"Again, it's a tv job. There is no job security. When you have done your job for the production, it is OVAH! Then you go home, and hopefully saved some of the big bucks they paid you, and you sleep. And then you sleep some more, because these jobs mean you are sleep deprived and just plain exhausted. But, and here's the thing, if you like being stressed, being where Entertainment is being made, it can be very exciting stuff. And then you take those big bucks you made and you take a very nice vacay.  And ps, at the bottom of this page, they ask me to rate the CEO of CBS. Gee, I don't even know who that is, so how would I know how to rate that person. C'mon."
good,"Was to date the best place I have worked. Awesome coworkers, very competitive pay and benefits, free parking in the city. Smart with how they spend money on average.  World class producers and talent."

good,My typical day at work is meet with my Supervisor review the work checklist. I learn how to take on responsibilities in my environment follow policies and procedures.

The enjoyable part of my job is helping people needs and providing customer satisfaction.
good,Great environment to grow and contribute right away. People are friendly and helpful. Working in a top 5 broadcast market is always a plus.
good,"The fellow employees are an absolute wonder, The senior directors and the team leaders and very instructive on what you need to do. The lead is a bit serious at times, but be friendly and everyone's more than willing to be friendly back. Heck, they force you to join in their reindeer games. The work load can be extremely light to extremely heavy. The more you know, the more you do and the better you are to getting a job in the creative department. And the more you know, the more creative you can be too. THough the deadlines are serious though. The little stuff (such as editing photos, and deinterlacing etc.) is usually requested hours in advance and can be knocked out in five seconds and is generally expected to be knocked out in 5 seconds. The more advance stuff is usually an hour in advance and is expected to be in ON TIME so deadlines are no joke. After Effects is a major must know program to know so if don't know it and want to work there after internship, grab a book and get to studying. Overall great place to get your feet wet, internship payment (minimum wage) and elementary hours (9-5)."

I learned the value of hard work and being prepared each and every day to do what was asked of me. The people I met while working for CBS have become life long friends. The hardest part of the Job was when it ended... very sad, but the most enjoyable part of the job was going to work each and every day."
good,"During my day I would tipicly answer thirty to fourty-five sales calls. I usualy answered simple question about the company and talked to upset customers. This compamy halped me to have more empathy, and how to deal with individuals that are misplacing there anger. The Supervisore are stern but easy to love, they are very understanding, yet refuse to tolerate lazyness. My peers are easy to get along with and are willing to help a new confused co-worker. The most difficult part of this job would be calming down up a customer. Now the most enjoyable part of working at DLM would be there company cook outs they are fun and gave me the ecelent opritunity to get to know more about my superiors and co-workerd."
good,"I worked hard to serve the customers each day in the Business Center. In the Business Center I worked as a Business Manager to satisfy all of the customers. I have also typed papers, filed papers, scanned and copied papers, and I also wrote customer complaints and orders. This type of business is good for my knowledge skills, not only in customer service, but also in computer programming. Customer Service is a good job, but it is very challenging."

good,"I worked for CBS radio throughout college and beyond.  It was such an exciting time in my life and I loved the culture of my environment.  The people were so fun and we worked hard, but loved our jobs.  I left only because I had other career aspirations.  It was a fun time in my life."
good,Working as a mail messenger was difficult with the fast paced energy that surrounds the workplace. Overall a great and competitive work environment and full of great people involved in the environment. Made many good contacts and I miss them all very much. The hardest part was keeping up with the difficult work tasks of sending out certain mail documents that didn't go out to the offices in the building.
good,"The staff is highly professional."
good,The people I worked with are extremely good at their jobs. The office may be a bit run-down but the camaraderie makes up for it. The supervisors are incredible people that you want to work hard for. The lines between everyone's jobs are extremely clear; there is no overlap. Sometimes the office picks up additional video products for CBS and Discovery and it's exciting to be able to work on something out of the ordinary of the typical day.

good,"CBS Television City was a godsend when I was searching for a new challenge in a field in which I had no previous experience. Getting the opportunity to work in television research and data collection was fun and challenging. My typical day involved bringing hotel guests into the part of television that is rarely seen by the outside world, research. Instructing them how to use data collection dials, and fill out response surveys about what they just saw."

good,There is no other place I would've rather started my career. The company has given me every opportunity to grow and learn from some of the very best in the business.
good,"Working for CBS News & The New York Times on a typical day at work would consist of doing surveys on the phone while multi-tasking with using the head set, the computer screen and data entry.  I learned how people in New York and other states in America feel about political matters affecting our country today. My management skills were improved in that I learned how to do my job without expressing my opinions to maintain the scientific purpose of the questions being asked to clients.  My co-workers mingled well with me when snacking but we all had our own individual stations so we rarely communicated on a personal level.  The hardest part of the job was working 2 shifts and leaving work at 1am after calling the West Coast to complete polls.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to complete surveys with over 150 questions in English and Spanish without offering a prize or gift and knowing that my completed polls were successful due to respondents respecting my professional speaking voice over the phone."
good,Great company to work for just was temping cannot wait to get a call back!
good,"I was a promotions assistant for Radio Alice in San Francisco. Although I had been a promotions assistant for other stations for over 4 years throughout college, the few months I spent at CBS was equally as rewarding. It was my first time working in a major market and working with this team has taught me so much. This promotions team was very active online and throughout the social networking community. I also learned how to be nifty with a budget and how to work with managers that might have a different vision than you. I often worked at concerts and festivals and was able to see live performances."
good,work and see to it that everything is done
good,I love working at CBS radio. Everyone I work with is a joy to be around and always starts their day with a smile. My boss and the rest of the staff members are there for each other at any time of day when something is needed and it goes to show that healthy work environments really do exist.

good,How can i explain this. Well its a sports place where you watch sports and get paid for it. Sounds like dream job.
good,Day would begin with a team meeting and had assigned facilities to me.  Would check in with Chief engineer/assistant chief engineer before heading to my assigned buildings.  Learned to be diverse with each building having its own unique building systems.  Communication and prioritizing was critical.  Hardest part sometimes was getting parts as we were just transitioning from past contractor.  Seeing clients comfortable after finding solution to their service request was the most rewarding.
good,I enjoyed my time there and learned a lot about the industry. The work itself wasn't too hard and I had fun talking to the writers of the show. They were very nice when it came to not coming into work one day.

good,a typical day is scheduled and inclusive. I learned to enjoy the job of a sales person. Management was ever changing and the workplace culture was great. everyone got along. The hardest part of my job was doing my work in a culture of people having fun. I had a schedule to adhere to and the radio guys were never serious. the most enjoyable part of my job was when artist would come and perform for the staff.
good,"I loved working for CBS. Fast-paced work environment, but once you get the hang of things, it becomes second nature. The office can be a tough crowd, but if you work hard and put your best foot forward, they really take care of you."
good,"I have an excellent experience with stage operations at CBS Television City.  I just feel that i'm ready for the next step in my career with moving into being a Director and Producer.

The hardest part of my job is dealing with prize winners and having to be patient with them. And the most enjoyable part of my job is getting to work with amazing people, meeting new people, and getting to listen to music all day."

Managing time creates self-discipline, a learning experience.  Enjoyed the flexibility and the unknown of what each day would bring."
good,"My review of this company is very positive. I have been with the company 4 months now and the core values of this company far exceed anything I have ever experienced before. What initially intrigued me was the mission and their commitment to Teamwork, Personal Development, and Growth all things I was looking for in a career. Being at  a entry level point in my career I was careful what type of industry I should pursue and interviewed at allot of company's before selecting CBS. I felt at home here the moment I walked in the building and met the manager and employees and have had a enjoyable and fruitful career thus far. This company is full of so many driven individuals I have enhanced my skills so much in a short time getting to work alongside them daily, and can't wait for what my future brings here!, thanks."

In five years moved from a cumbersome, coast to coast, three tier approval process to today's tape less, paper less delivery.

The challenges I faced as a Director, was terminating employees on my watch. It was part of my responsibilities that I enforced as Director of four divisions. I enjoyed everything relative to Broadcast News. Their was never a dull moment in our newsrooms, but most importantly we enjoyed BEATING our competiton on Breaking News. That was very rewarding because we won and the entire viewing audience would recognized that."

The job prepared me to take on anything with a well executed plan and overcome objections on the fly."
