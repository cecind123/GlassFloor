good,A day at Staples is typically laid back and easy going. Time easily passes serving customers and helping them find the right solution for their home and business so I have had to learn a lot of good time management and self discipline. Management is superb and willing to listen and help solve issues when they arise and are very timely in their promises and actions. The hardest part of the job are the rare occasions of not having a solution for a customer and being only one of two sales associates that have been there longer than a year. But I love troubleshooting and working on customers computers and seeing how happy they are to get their repaired computer back.
good,Overall staples is great company to work for. I never knew how different the culture was from working on the retail side then growing into the contract side of the company. Love that fact you are able to grow within an organization and experience new roles.

Customer service was very important along with multitasking, answering phones helping with online orders and paging different departments for customer needs.

A team of three we were like a close knit family every one worked well together. There was nothing hard about working there because it didn't seem like work. We made copies, made banners and flyers. As well as binding books and lamination. We were able to play a little radio so we managed to have fun with a little singing all while being able to give customers excellent customer service."
good,"When I show up at work I may be filling the role of many positions. It always felt as if we had the bare minimum of associates working each day. This was mostly good because it forced us to work hard and time flew by most days. Although, since this was an entry level job, it was common that people wouldn't show up for work. I found my self learning all the positions at Staples. A regular day would involve me selling laptops and computers with service plans and attachments. Moving over to the copy center and laminating a poster or binding pages together. Possibly sifting through overstock to keep the shelves stocked throughout the store. Selling furniture with protection plans and finally being the cashier for any of these transactions. The people I worked with, especially the managers, were excellent to work with. Always felt motivated throughout the day."
good,My typical day at work was driving sales and providing outstanding service to every customer. I've learn to appreciate the people that you meet on a daily basis and not take things personal. the hardest part of my job was  letting go of associate through termination.

I average about 45 stops a day and 7 pick ups I have a great customer driver relationship on route. My management equips me with the tools I need to succeed. my co-workers are always ready to help if needed. The hardest part of my job is trying to beat time. The most enjoyable part is the smile the customer gives and knowing they are satisfied with the service.

good,"Go in at 7 am, work in the copy center/cashier.  Assist Customers, with electronics and copies, lunch do that some more then go home.  Learned how to work copiers, computers, and more about electronics than I already knew.  Management was awesome, I enjoyed them alot.  Co-Workers were good. Some better than others.  Hours, early one day, late the next and off in the middle of the week.  Work Holiday Eve's, but thats part of Retail.  Working with a unique set of indivuals and learning interacting with others."

good,Wonderful co-workers. Lots of opportunities to be involved work place activities. Very busy on a day to day basis
good,"Most people wouldn't describe retail as the best job but working in a ""small box"" retail store like Staples has major benefits over a larger ""big box"" store. The associates and managers were close knit and leared from each other. My managers and fellow associates were a major highlight to this job. The managers were very understanding of personal issues and provided guidance on a personal level. They were more customer service minded over profit minded, which gave our store a very positive feel to it, that many of our customers also experienced."

good,"would recommend to anyone willing to work.time went very fast,always things to be done."
good,"A typical day at work would depend on whether or not if it was peak season or during a slow season. If it were slow the supervisor would allow you to cross train into another area of the warehouse. If it was during the peak season, then the main focus was to provide the customer with expedient customer service. I learned many things at this particular facilities such as Shipping and Receiving, Inventory Control, Reverse Logistics, Small Order Preparation, and the management of freight on our small delivery trucks. Management was sufficient, and co-workers ensured that the facilities ran smoothly. The hardest part of the job was learning the function of everything within logistics, but it was also the most enjoyable."
good,"The job changes every minute depending on the volume and guest that eigther walk in, email or submit web orders. Meeting the projected time for compleation can prove to be challenging and amusing. There is also a sence of accomplishment when the guest pick up the completed product and they are 100% happy with the final product."
good,"A typical day of work includes many e-mail communications, half individual work, half team projects. I've gained an incredible amount supply chain knowledge; everything from where a product idea starts through vendor manufacturing, or customer orders. My direct manager sets a wonderful professional example, gives direction and advice when needed and values her employees."
good,"Typical day would include high volume customer base, and joint team efforts in order to perform to management standards. Management is very lay back, but numbers are key. Sales and customer report is crucial. Co-workers are a joy to work with an don't work against you. As far as difficulty, depending on volume it could be stress full, but still accomplish-able. The most enjoyable part of the job would be customer interaction, and to see satisfaction once a service or sale is performed. We did not work of commission, so customer satisfaction is our reward to us."

good,Great company to work for compared to values and structure.
good,I liked staples becasuse of the people and the atmosphere of the job enviorment.
good,"Overall it was good. If you work hard and meet target, there are some decent pay bonuses. They do regional contests regularly. It's a great job if you like people, and know your product. My only complaint is that our store went through 2 store managers in a little over a year. This created some instability as systems and procedures were regularly being changed."
good,I would have hoped to make this a permanent position but I was a contractor and my time ran out.  I would absolutely recommend to work on the Database Engineering team at Staples nice people and strong helpful managers
good,"I loved working here and I'm disappointed every day that I could not continue to work there (I had to move, unrelated to employment). The store I worked at was staffed by lovely people who genuinely worked together as a team and supported each other. I know the corporate ""We're family here."" comment garners an eye roll from anyone who's ever actually worked in retail, but it was true for everyone in that store. We looked out for each other and the store, working to make sure our customers were happy and that everyone was able to get done what they need to. I hope every day that everyone I knew when I worked there has a genuinely good day and are doing well now."
good,"Trabalhar na Staples como Jovem aprendiz me rendeu muito conhecimentos, foi realmente uma fase muito boa em minha vida, haviam tarefas difíceis, porem havia muita colaboração, ambiente maravilhoso de se trabalhar, uma pena meu contrato ter acabado se me chamassem novamente eu iria sem duvidas."
good,It's a great company to work for. The managers are nice and treat their employees with respect. The people that work there are nice too! Best place I ever worked at.
good,I was told 14.45 plus a 1.00 but that wasn't true. It was 14.45 and a extra 1.00 for every hr you worked. No team work. Once your coworkers are done they will move up leaving you to finish what's left to do
good,"The managers and coworkers were amazing people. Although the job can be very stressful at times, they always had my back whenever I had to deal with a rude customer or was overwhelmed with a long line. Team work played a big part in the success of the copy center."

good,Staples is an awesome company to work for! The people I worked for were like a second family to me. We all worked very well together. I wanted to stay with the company but I had moved out of town and there was no Staples there but I am always welcome back to this Staples.
good,"Good pay, but in sales you can make much more and should have the opportunity to make more--but you simply can't. It's a good base pay, but low commissions. The ability to make $50,000-$150,000 is only in upper positions. No sales reps who've been there 1-10 years make more than $35-$45000; you have to get a promotion to do so."

good,"be prepared to hit the ground running as soon as you clock in ."
good,this was probably one of my favorite jobs. great company to work for and the team I had was amazing. the pay isn't the top but they are very flexible and we had a great management team at my store
good,If the pay were higher I would work at Staples Copy and Print center for a long time. But it's not a job worth working too hard for because the pay is below $10. It gives you great fundamentals as far as customer service experience and skills working with computers.
good,Its a great place to learn how to work in retail. The difficult part is getting customer to bring in their computer for fixing.  management is grade a
good,"Buen salario y beneficios, en algunas ocaciones se manipa el horario de trabajo"
good,Get to know your business customers. They are regular shoppers and you address them by name. You usually know what they are shopping for and can better serve them. Copy and Print customers were the most rewarding to assist.
good,A typical day at work consists of helping customers with the assistance of great coworkers and knowledgeable management. I enjoy customer service and Staples helps me hone those skills.
good,Equipment poorly maintained and work frustration is due to lack of consistently in training. Way too many stories are told about previuos customers not happy with order production.

good,"A typical day at work involves majority printing, copying, faxing, and scanning things to email. We create business cards, banners, posters, stamps, labels, etc. I've learned a lot about the machines we use daily: copiers, fax machines, computers. My knowledge has grown about certain programs on the computer. Management is great! Our manager always looks out for us and informs us of what we have to do to be successful at our jobs. The workplace culture is a friendly environment. The hardest part of the job is dealing with several customers while you're alone. I get the job done but sometimes it gets overwhelming. The most enjoyable part of the job is spending time with coworkers, and seeing how grateful the customers are after we've successfully completed their order."
good,"Besides the poor management and lack of management, staples is a great company in itself to work for, almost every staples I go into, it is very neat and organized. I love Staples!"

good,"Parts Department (Former Employee), Dayton, NJ – January 29, 2018"
good,Worked here in HS and It was a really good part time job. Made good friends and was thought a lot about the job. It was sad to leave but I had to go to bed.
good,"There was never a day like another, it's a good place to work, good environment. For me it was to come to a meeting, where we were told that we do that day and how we had left all the previous day, As a driver I had to go through the machine I used that day and start working immediately, I miss my job very much, but for personal reasons I had to leave it."
good,"Work environment was very relaxed.  Great moral among the different teams.  During my career at Staples, I learned how to read business credit reports through Experian and Duns & Bradstreet."

The associates are taught that the customer always comes first and to always ensure 100% satisfaction! I loved working with the other associates, as well as, the managers. Staples also allowed me to do an internship with them while I was going to college. I learned a great deal during the internship that gave me knowledge for the future!"
good,"Working here was decent, I would have liked to advance sooner than later and it was taking quite awhile to even be considered full time. I would recommend this if you are okay with staying at entry level."

good,Staples was a great environment to be in. They taught me how to drive sales and give good customer service. There wasn't really anything hard about the job but the best part was working around good people.
good,Depending on the call volume it could be very stressful on customer service end.  They are always contests and other opportunities for each individual to participate in.   Staples is very fair with a competitive pay and with managers being fair.  The hardest part of the job was the high volume of calls that would come into the call center.
good,I actually loved working at Staples! The atmosphere was always fun. The incentives are great at Staples. The only negative thing that I can say about the company is that the Associates are underpaid and deserve more.
good,"sold manangement"

I started on our out of stock percentage reports, then continued onto other paperwork, receiving and order fulfillment. I learned about inventory and sales trends. Our management team were great leaders and encouraged the staff to hit sales numbers by suggestive selling. Co workers were decent and usually friendly. The hardest part was learning the system initially but that only took a few days. I most enjoyed the flexible hours."
good,"Emploi idéal pour étudiants,"
good,Staples has a wonderful atmosphere. The managers make sure all of the team members work well together. The pay is competitive and they will work around scheduling conflicts well.
good,"Staples is a great company to work for. The one that I was working for unfortunately was very far away from my home, and there wasn't the same opportunity near me."
good,"Honestly Staples, for the kind of job I had as a cashier, it was nearly perfect. Others would disagree but I think those are people who have unreasonable demands of an employer. My bosses wanted you to work but were all rational (I might have been lucky with that, I heard stories about a store manager shortly before my employment). I had a couple minor issues with management, but those were alleviated by the relevant parties themselves. Management was easy to communicate with and I became friends with all of them (but always did my job). I received expected pay increases as well as recognition and advancement opportunities."
good,The company has great products and people working here. The company upper management is very supportive. The only draw back is there are few stores in the area and opportunity for advancement are slim. When it comes to the staff I really enjoy working with them.

I working with customers and showed them where product was that they could not locate. I would typically work in the copy and print department. I made copies for customers. I sometimes made books and business cards. I sent things in to be made of canvas prints and for large orders our store was not equipped to fulfill."
good,"Typically the day starts off slow, most of the time we spend re stocking our items and unloading and putting tags on expensive merchandise. In my area I'd deal with finding viruses,repairing computers,adding software & selling laptops and towers as well as printers and insurance and furniture."
good,"Approachable staff and management alike."
good,"Staples was a great place to work. Although it was only a work experience I learned more about stock taking, proper cleaning procedures, customer care and time keeping. I would gladly go back and work in this store. My manager was very helpful in getting me started and my co-workers were all very supportive. The hardest part of this job was saying goodbye after my work experience. The best part of the job was the experience of it and working with such a great team of people. Staples staff are very friendly and very supportive."

good,My day basically starts off with a fun group meeting....stretching and talking about the product count and what is expected for the day. I never had a bad day at this job....until they told us they were laying us off....that's why I rated job security low.
good,Fun place to work. Chance to meet new people every day. Nice coworkers and managers. Good training. Requires customer service skills.
good,you will learn to balance your time and prioritize all projects in this fast paced environment. The best part was always having the next new thing to plan for while finishing the old.

good,"A typical day at work would vary according to what department needed my assistance. I could cashier or copy center or work the computer tech desk. I explained computers to people the hardware and the programs. I made portfolios, books, posters, business cards, canvas art. My co- workers were all good workers the hardest part of the job was the short staffing the best was the satisfaction of completing sales goals or producing perfect orders."

Management was great as they listened to our ideas and allowed us to act upon them to see how they worked out within the scope of the Staples Australia. My co-workers also became friends as we all cared about each other after the workday was done."
good,"Staples SDO was an excellent place to work, but with the changing business structure, uncertainty is what the future holds.  Before the business plan changed, it was amazing.  Management was competent, the staff was got along great; everyone knew what was expected of them.  The salary was competitive.  However, I write this review in February 2015.  We just acquired Office Depot a few days earlier and drastic changes loom ahead."
good,"The opportunity to advance within the company."
good,"Staples has given me many skill sets that make me a great asset in many verticals. They teach management to be business owners not employees and give the tools to maintain that development in others. The sales culture is aggressive for current demands, which sometimes puts management in a position to choose work needs over family needs. I would say that is the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable is the tight networking environment created between management and customers and knowing that any resource is either a click or call away"
good,Always changing but very rewarding. No other comments. Great Environment.
good,perfect job for this time of my life my children wee young and I could pick my schedule

I learned how to become a better sales person, a great cashier, good at customer service and to stock shelves and do recovery.

good,"I had a great time working with this company, once you get past those who do not want to work.  The co workers were like family and everyone was on the same page, and helped each other out.  Management always looked out for the employees, something I have not seen in other jobs."
good,"From my time working at the Staples fulfillment center , Ive noticed that management is very hands on with the work that goes on , and works with the regular associates on floor moving product and showing them the right procedures on how to get things done ."

Everyday I learn more and more about the ins and outs of Staples as a whole. The management team here is great. They are very understanding and professional.

The most enjoyable part of being there is that the co-workers make it not even feel like work."

good,"Responsible for on-site tech work along with in-store tech work. You have to manage a tight schedule with having to worry about all in-store sales and tech related tasks but with good management it is possible. Hardest part about the job is getting use to the time consuming task the are involved with inventory management, and if you are not a chromatic person getting use to sales might be a hurdle. I love working with my Co-works and I know they enjoy working with me. I love technology so every moment that I am at someone's house working on a computer and in-store repairing a computer I feel great joy. Most of the information that I received from Staples I already obtained from day to day reading to give myself enrichment in all technical fields."

good,"Most distribution center employees start off with a low-end pay scale as a temporary associate. However, with hard work and determination, there is a lot of growth to be had in the warehouse.

good,i have learned a lot from this job
good,"Staples is a fantastic company to work for, though corporate does tie the hands of local managers to the point that they can't operate at peak efficiency."

good,"Staples' focus is on Customer service, and they treat their employees much like they do their customers... Very very well. The job tightened and honed my diagnostic skillset. The management would give you your jobs for the day, and allow you to do them, as opposed to micromanaging every moment of your day. My colleagues became my friends within weeks with the occasional exception."
good,"Staples is a great place to work, it keeps you on your toes, it just really depends on the management, i worked for two different stores and management is want makes the environment. great customer service in both places. Palm desert was the one that is tough to work at but palm springs is perfect."
good,"Normally i'd come in, and clock in. Immediately start assisting customers answering any questions they had. I learned the basics of retail while working here. Management was friendly and never negative towards customers and employees. I got along well with co-workers as they did the same with me. The hardest part of the day would only occur when we got super busy (during back-to-school), but it was never too much. I mostly enjoyed communicating and assisting the customers."
good,"Management helpfully offer suggestions on how to improve your technique, and offer friendly reminders of what they expect. Associates work as one to get it done. This is a great team to work for."
good,Staples has almost got everything figured out when it comes to customer service. They do strive do what is best for the customer and the company. The one thing that they do need to remember is where they started at. When Staples was first introduced they were one of the major Office Supply Stores in the nation. Now I understand that times are changing and we have to changed with it but we still need to remember where we came from. Why I am saying that is that the Electronics department in these stores are great but they are not the only department. I was in Office Supplies my entire 5 year career and saw the role in office supplies grow bigger and bigger due to the fact that the responsibilities of the electronics depart shrinking. Now I understand that they need to be made available to customers but so does the office supply people. In the later part of my career with Staples my role had grown so large I felt I should have compensated with a Full time offer but no such luck. Even has I left they were having me train the person that they promoted over me.
good,"To be honest, I worked here right out of high school so I had a great time. I don't really know much about the benefits or anything like that because I didn't need those at the time. But management is a lot of fun and I had a great time with my co workers! We definately got stuff done. The copy center gets a little fast paced especially around the end of the year because companies, families, groups, etc. are getting next year's calenders made (and they usually want a pretty large amount). But it's not too complicated and it's kind of like doing arts and crafts (on the computer) all day. There's a lot of really cool people that would come in and you got to see what they did. Musicians would come in with pieces they had composed and were going to send off, artists would make copies of their drawings, photographers would blow their pictures up and have them laminated to be hung in their house, etc. Really cool job."
good,-good company
good,I learned a lot while working at Staples. Its a great company to work for . My co-workers and managers were very easy to get along with.
good,I absolutely loved working a Staples. There was always a positive atmosphere. I really miss working there and the only reason I am no longer apart of the Staples team is because I relocated after marriage. I recommend Staples to anyone looking to grow and advance.
good,"In the brief time I was there, I was made to feel a part of a productive and energetic team. My fellow employees were always kind and courteous while the management team made us all feel like a part of something great. They always pushed for us to help our clients to the best of our ability; they also showed us how to improve our best."
good,The GM is part of the selling team. Learned how to multi-task because you have to be able to do many things at once.

good,"Regular training is available and paid time was given to complete this training."
good,"I love working at Staples, and all of the people I work with. Even when were really busy, we all work together to provide an amazing shopping experience. The only downside is the only employees who are allowed more than 25 hours/week are managers and supervisors, and even though I've worked there for almost 2 years, there's no advancement opportunities in my feild."
good,Great environment and local management team. As a corporation it's transforming it's core business to stay relevant.
good,"In my personal opinion I felt very well received in the store, however for my personal and professional goals, working for staples won't help me achieving them because the more you grow the focus is shifted toward sales metrics than what I really like to do."
good,Staples is a great company to work for.  I had to relocate to another city and I am currently looking for greater opportunities.  The staff was fun and friendly and the managers were helpful.
good,"This is a great job, assuming you have the drive to succeed. The job is 100% what you put in to it. The leadership team is with you every step of the way and there to support you. The training at first is rough and not focused, but once you are on your own. It will all make sense."
good,"The pay isn’t the best but is a wonderful place to work. I enjoy helping customers and recommending other purchase items.  I have learned very good stocking skills and how important it is to place items in correct location. I have learned more about troubleshooting computers.

good,"I started working for Staples in January 2018 and the atmosphere was calm and quite which for me is good because I can get a lot of work done. They really admired my work ethic and decided to move me over to their Easy Tech department. From there I worked as a Tech Associate, and thats where I really wanted to be."

good,"Started as a Sales associate and was quickly promoted to Sales Coaching Specialist.  In one year, our sales numbers improved by over 25%.  Later moved on to become a Business Development manager in the Mississauga office"
good,"Fun at workplace is very important nowadays in not only in retail industry but in every industry as well. Everything is fast paced and lots of stresses and pressure at workplace. However most importantly, it's people who make the difference. Eventually to motivate people and making them happy and stress free, we have to make our workplace a fun loving environment focusing on goals and business. If people are stressed, they can't provide the best they can. So, as a manager in a leadership role, to bring out the best from the people, there is no exception without making them motivated, happy and highly energetic. Fun in workplace is a great culture in the business. With fun, we have to develop and coach our respective team and heading towards our main objective i.e. Business by ensuring best customer experience."
good,Staples is a good company to work for actually. I was with the company for 7 yrs until they started making part-timers work less hrs. I use to work 35-40hrs . The pay sucked but the work atmosphere made up for it.
good,"Having been with the company twice so far in my working life, it has been one of the most enjoyable environments to work in. If I get the chance to go back, I will not hesitate. The hardest part, or more-so time in the job, would have to be the ""Back to School."" sales. It was a chaotic time in the store, but even with the mess of supplies scattered through the aisles, our team managed to pull through unscathed."
good,This professional group is by far the best I have worked with. The management is legit and provides individuals with opportunity to succeed.  I would work here again!

good,"Management is awesome at this Staples where everyone does a little something to complete the day. I kept my managers up to date with any missed days and they always helped me plan ahead on scheduling. Training was a great experience where I learned everything I needed to before my first day on the job with little supervision. Hardest part of the job is customer satisfaction so far, since we have to keep on top of the copy machines working properly. Everything else has been a great experience so far."
good,"This was the best retail place that I have worked. The management was great, and there were many opportunities to move up in the company if you worked well."
good,A typical day at work is helping customers finding the best product for them. I learned a lot about different types of paper. The workplace culture is nice. The hardest part of the job is that sometimes the workplace is slow. It was also hard trying to sell a certain type of paper because we were in competition against other stores. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning how to be a cashier and meeting the customers.
good,I would say staples was nice and easy. They would not give to much work but you  weren't always bored. Also the staff is amazing there highly recommend working there if you are a good team member.
good,As a sales assiociate we were responsible for assisting all customers that entered the building to help them find what they were looking for in a timely and polite manner.
good,Great standards/model of what retail can be. Helped shaped who me in terms of understanding how to run a business such as approaching potential problems/obstacles. Staples works to advance anyone further in their career path if that is what they desire.

good,"Great Company to work for, a lot  of team building opportunity."
good,"Everyone was so helpful and when the supervisor realized i was useful in other departments i was given the chance to transfer to copy center which i enjoyed very much.  Unfortunately, work was slow and i was let go."
good,Management is amazing.  They really promote a work/life balance.  Very understanding and willing to help with career advancement.  Coworkers are always available to assist whenever help is needed.
good,"I liked working there , You create relationships with clients which was pretty cool. Somedays its slow and some days its not but I enjoyed doing copies and things like that ."
good,"Very competitive salary, commision structure (uncapped - top performers usually earn an extra $15,000 - $40,000 annually), work flexibility, weekly cash/gift cards awards for top performers. $2000 bonus for referrals, and if they get hired. "

good,"Busy, help customers, train associates, listen to customer complaints, customer is NOT always right. Made schedules, did planograms, ensured smooth operation of store"
good,"Activo muitas actividades diferentes tanto no  escritório como no armazém."
good,"Would support all the staples stores in US with any technical issues that would occur. Every morning would fix any polling issues stores would get through cisco notifications. Work with store managers and associates to try to troubleshoot over the phone with remote access. If unable to resolve remotely, would open a vendor to go to site and fix issue. Would rotate on call, holidays and weekends."
good,"I really enjoyed working in Staples Corner."
good,"I was hired by Staples with no prior sales experience. This was a great opportunity to gain sales and professional experience. The expectations continued to rise throughout my first year which was hard to manage at times. The management support the B2B's with more training whenever a new technique was introduced. Overall, this job is al about what you put into it."
good,This job was everything to me because of the simple fact when Staples first came down south i had the opportunity to help and put up a few stores before they all opened. And i had the chance to meet some really good people and even met my manager before our store opened and became really good friends.
good,"This particular location had very well communication, displayed strong work ethic, High potential to advance, Excellent management, and was very informative with training procedures"
good,"Working at Staples was a great experience! I experienced many obstacles and learned great customer skills.

good,"Repair desktop and laptops, data backups, ordering parts for serviced computers"
good,"A typical day at work at Staples, is first reading our management emails to see what is expected for the day as far as sales and customer service. We then coach and train the team on what they need to know, so that we as a team meet that goal. The management at Staples does everything that they can to help us excel in the company. Since I've been at Staples, I have learned to transition from being an associate to management and how to deal with those relationships. The workplace culture is always interesting. It is never boring, that's for sure. It's always something happening, whether it is the busy back to school season or just a typical day. The hardest part of the job would have to be trying to sell to someone that just doesn't want the product we are tying to sell for whatever reason. Some associates get discouraged and feel as though, they can't sell, but we have to keep pushing them. Last but not least, the most enjoyable part of the job would be getting to talk to people and meeting new people and finding what they need everyday."
good,"Staples was a great place to work and grow in a retail environment. It was very fast paced, and could be particularly fun in a challenging and exciting way."

good,"Friendly environment, and they have excellent benefits package for full-time employees. Management is superb and personal. Wonderful learning experience and management wants to see you succeed."
good,Staples is a great company to work for. It's the management team that keeps the team focus. If everybody do what they get paid to do than the team will meet the goals every time. If you have a broken wheel than you keep hitting pot holes and you can't finish what you started.
good,"Working for this company was great. Everybody was friendly and lighthearted, and the work was very worthwhile. I learned a lot about inventory control, how to use a wide variety of machinery, learned a lot about the distribution process, and the workplace itself felt great to be in.

good,"Ideal for any part-time student job. Management is extremely friendly, flexible and open to employee suggestions. Co-workers are mostly young adults which makes it a very hip and friendly work environment. Downside of this job is that management can't afford to allocate many hours for their employees for the greater part of the year. On the other hand, all employees become full-time employees during the back to school period; it can get pretty crazy at times."

good,"An average day at staples is very much focused on customer service and sales. At the beginning of every workday the associates receive a set of goals; and are informed on key stats like conversion; dpt, and esp. I learned how to multitask and become a successful leader. Management is a diverse team of dedicated individuals; working towards a single goal."
good,"pick orders for shipping using a riding pallet jack, create a pallet for shipping, move pallets to loading area for inspection and loading onto trailers for delivery."
good,Fast paced environment meant to challenge you. Meet new people everyday. Feel empowered to make choices. Scheduling was always very flexible and fairly balanced. The company have labour challenges to reduce labour hours that resulted in lowered staff morale.
good,When I come to work to start my day I check for oral instruction if none I start my knowing what needs to be done. I learned to work with others and enjoy helping customers. Management are good people and we get alone fine. MY coworkers are like family from home and we have a great relationship. The hardest part of my job is is putting things together with no instruction. When customers come to the store and ask for help regardless the problem I am here to help.
good,I started as an 'older' associate in the office.  It was both challenging and rewarding with team support and encouragement.  Opportunities to try new things and support to get there.  Fun times with a professional approach.  Lots of efforts to maintain good morale and offer training and development.  Willing to try to do new things with a well educated or experienced management team.
good,"A typical day at work would be, from the time I start my shift, I am on the till all day. I great the customers coming in and leaving. I scan their items, put the items in a bag when needed, complete transactions in cash, debit/credit, hand their receipt and wish them a great day before they leave. Sometimes I would get a customer with a return or exchange and I would gladly help them out. I also offer guidance and assistance with finding certain products or services. I learned a great deal of communication skills, organizational skills and interpersonal skills. The management and co-workers are friendly and they treat everyone like a working family. The hardest part of the job is when it gets really busy and stressful. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my co-workers and having some fun activities every once in a while."
good,easy work with little micro management.  They treat you like an adult as long as you behave like one.  If the pauy was higher wouldve stayed longer.
good,"i worked at the stapes in okotoks for two years, in that time we went from a teranical general manager with overly kind and helpfull.that first year was hellish. after that we had a substitute manager unti one was found."

good,"A typical day at work consisted of greeting customers and making sure their needs come first. Next I would begin daily routine projects such as inventory, stalking shelves, adjusting price changes through out the store. I would provide back up coverage for all departments such as copy center, cashiers and technology, I enjoyed this the most. It gave me a chance to learn something new and meet new people in every department which made me much more flexible and more knowledgeable of the store itself. Management was always there when needed and trusted in the employees."

good,I have been with the company for about 2 years and I love it! The management team rally's behind you and encourages you to grow and move up in the company. There is ongoing training opportunities not only for the role that you are in but for additional fields as well. The mentor program is a valuable asset both to the company as well as to the staff.

good,Great place to work. Good benefits and decent hours. You get to meet a lot of interesting people.  The people you work with are friends for life.

good,"Talking with customers, adding attachments."
good,Although I was laid off with this company I consider working here a valuable work experience.
good,"I am experienced with the entire process / cycle of inventory control. This includes information to supervision of loading, unloading, labeling and storing of goods: maintenance of records of income and outgoing goods, and projection / forecast based filing of orders to replenish depleting / depleted stock. Other responsibilities that I have handles induce preparing and filing reconciliation report to the used by other department, providing supplies to assist the production line, review of bills and purchase data, and to provide analysis of prices of company products. I am also well aware of legal, safety, and technical issues related to inventory / warehouse management."
good,Enjoyed working with my co-workers. Just like family. All team players. The part I enjoy most is  when I am able to resolve a problem for a customer and they were satisfied. I always do my best  to please the customer.
good,Staples Advantage program is a great place to work for.   The company culture maintains a positive work environment with the ability to not bring the job home.   The amount of resources this company provides for its employees are out of this world.   I would recommend working for them to anyone.
good,Highly productive warehouse were you picked orders via pick to voice. Computer told you what to pick and place in which box. I would check the orders after they were picked to increase accuracy.
good,Associates are dedicated to their jobs because the company recognize and live the core values
good,"I was part of a team that did not stop, did not let up until this brand new store became the top store in the company.  I ran the technology department and was in charge of personnel decisions, sales numbers, operations, and scheduling.  I was also counted on as a manager on duty to open/close the store, and step in for managers whenever necessary.  I loved meeting new people everyday and developing personal relationships with them."
good,"Staples was a great first job very easy and comfortable although the people i worked with were just as young as me, and it always felt like highschool drama in there other than that the managers and everything was very fun to work with."
good,"um dia de trabalho; abertura da loja, caixas, ligar maquinas confirmar  preços, ver faltas, rever horários, assegurar o atendimento e satisfação do cliente."
good,"Day and night shift work to choose from, many different possitions available so theres something for everyone. Shift begins with a briefing on company news and the production goal for the shift. Then there's group stretching exercises to minimize risk of injury which is a brilliant idea. Theres normally two 15 minute breaks and a 50 minute lunch break on each shift. After the lunch break there's another briefing and stretch then back to work. Staples is a very high-pace diverse workforce; so you will learn the importance of team work and helping your neighbor when they are in need. Management is very understanding and conducts thorough investigations whenever there's conflict in the workplace. "
good,"I worked my way up from being just a production picker to a department lead, and then up to department supervisor. I love doing that kind of work and I enjoyed all the people that I had worked with over the years."

good,Learned a lot about picking inventory. I learned how to drive a forklift as well. 
good,"Staples is one of the best place i ever worked. its a store of encouragement and teaches you till you meet your destiny. i started my title as a cashier and in three years time , i am a supervisor and all this is because of encouragement by my managers."
good,"a typical day at work is simple, just your basic stocking, being a cashier when it gets busy, helping out customers. i learned how to work out the as-400 and order supplies or receiving supplies. The mangers there is very friendly. the co-workers are good too. "
good,"What I learned working for this company is training and good people are key. They are all about getting you the right tools to succeed. Its a fast paced enviornment and you have to have exceptional customer service. I enjoyed my work with staples so much if I was shopping at a different retailer I would smile and say hello to their customers. The hardest part of working with customers is you can only bend the rules so far to make them happy, some times that isnt enough. The best part were the people they have great people from cashiers all the way up to the president!"
good,My experince at Staples has been very heartfelt. Over the years i've seen a lot of people come and go. My first encounter with a customer was very over whelming i really didn't take well to some one screaming at me when i was only trying to help them or follow company policy and procedures. But through the years and dealing with people i learned to just be myself .With talking to my mamagers i learned not to take my job too seriously but to do my job consistently as possible. My District Manager was my mentor any time that a situation would occur i would go to her to help me to resolve certain issues. My co-workers whom i enjoyed working with all of them will say that i am easy going and they enjoy working with me. Well of course we bump heads but we would overcome them. I didn't see my job at staples as being hard because it was a challenge to me which i met head on. Being able to multitask was not hard for me that became very easy. I also learned not to over think what i did involving my job because icould be overwhelming at times. Was there times when i got frustrated of course their was being pulled in different directions can be .But i learned how to deal with that as well. Again by not over thinking all that had to be made it easy for me to do my job. My managers who i have enjoyed working with and through leadership i learned alot. Every day at Staples was enjoyable. I worked with good people throughout the years. I have nothing bad to say upon my leaving Staples. I still would say that Staples is a good company to work for. Even though they have a lot of training i would
good,I enjoyed the flexability of being able to go to school full time and working part-time. I came into work as the head cashier of the day and at times during my shift I did the bookkeeping for the store.
good,"Full time positions are great. Pay to start is minimum, but monthly bonuses compensate.Alot of face to face with customers. Need to be people friendly especially around back to school time."
good,Good benefits and nice customer service well put together . Co-workers was okay just learned we had to get along for sales and group meetings. Hardest part is meeting the goals over and beyond not the point.
good,"big store, alot of products. gotta learn fast where everything is. some knowledge of office products and electronics will be a big help. push to sell protection plans if offered on products. thats a big part of the job but the co-works and managers are nice and helpful."
good,"A typical day at work involved constant communication with customers, organizing of new and old inventories, and short meetings with co-workers and managers. As a sales floor associate it was my duty to educate customers about our products and direct them to the right solution. If I was ever in a situation where I was unable to help a customer, or if a coworker faced the same situation, we could always count on our sales floor team to be there for one another and assist each other in any way possible. The entire experience at Staples was an enjoyable one; it was an extremely valuable learning opportunity and I enjoyed every minute of it."
good,"Over the past five years, I have grown from a cashier associate to a part of management. I have the desire to learn and engage in every opportunity to advance and challenge myself. I have had great mentors along the way and am appreciative of all the hard work to get me to the position I am today. Currently, I am the Sales Manager at Staples. I am resposible for total store sales and growth initiatives such as the Easy Tech Department. I am also responsible for hiring, coaching, and developing my associates. I enjoy being able to help the customer whenever I possibly can by offering the best service I can."

I learned a lot while working at Staples, Management was supportive most of the time, I made friends with most of my co workers, There wasn't a single hard thing about the Job everything was simple, Was my first Full Time Job and the most enjoyable"
good,Liked the job but it was only part time and low starting pay and slow advancement

good,"I enjoy working at staples, because besides working there they offer a lot of helpful benefits."
good,Come in at various times and leave at various times depending on the shift i was assigned for the day. Did everything from computer tech work to stocking shelves and unloading freight. The co-workers were great and management was great as well. Hardest part of the job was actually the tech work and the most enjoyable part was the atmosphere and helping customers get what they needed.
good,"Being as though Staples was my very first job, I will always have a big apperciation for it. I learned how to work the register, how to accept various forms of payment, how to merchandise, learned customer service. And most of all being responsible. My manager was very nice. She helped me alot. My co'workers were just as helpful. The one thing I really loved about working there was the fact that it is a school supply store and I was in high school so it was easy for me to buy the items I needed."

good,Staples is a great company to work and to learn at the same time . I have been part of the staples family for a while now and I have learned ally of new things and have great customer service experience
good,typical day at work would be get there then do my opening duties then wait for customers to arrive and check them through the checkout. I learned that a job is very important and that you should always work hard towards what you believe in. the hardest part as it being my first ever real job always work hard towards the job. the most enjoyable part was coming into work and having wonderful co-workers by my side that made the day go easier
good,"Learn that customers are priority."
good,"get in and fill shelves and do pull downs, then if load is in throw load. and help customers.  long as you don't mess up its great. management is great most of the time .

good,I learned more experience with customer service and sales most enjoyable part of my day was working with my managers and coworkers the environment was very friendly
good,A wonderful place to work and advance your career very customer service focused. And if you’re willing to work you can grow with this company the scheduling was fair the workload was fair the company is very team oriented
good,"Working at Staples was always fun. Everyday was something new, everyone there is one big family. I really enjoyed it. Management was understanding and flexible with scheduling."
good,With me still working for Staples i might be a little biased. this is my favorite work environment. The bosses are knowledgeable and care about the employees. the only reason i would leave is for more money!
good,"I loved working here! Management and co-workers were great. Hours varied and I was usual the one called in to cover shifts, but I was okay with that. Money was decent but the work atmosphere was what made working here so great."
good,"Good work environment  nice benefits friendly workers"

good,"You can learn so much at Staples from chairs to pencils to computers. The place, in general, is a nice place to work. Break time is very good. They treat very kindly."
good,If I was not selling computers or ITC's I was stocking the shelves or helping copy & print. When new easy tech computers come in I would promptly get all of the customers information needed and printed out. I would then start work on the computer if my manager had not assigned me to another task.
good,fast paced work provided with plenty of work to do. Working in the easy tech area provided me with the chance to advance my knowledge of computers and electronics.
good,very very help full co working and management is also.they give training for all so we can work on any filed at staples. the manger was very positive and motivation to everyone at work.

good,This store really helped me become a fast paced worker. It showed me what team work really was about and that we all really need each other. Communication is key with such a big store.
good,"A great job to help get me through college. Over the summer, I got to experience full-time hours for about two weeks during a remodel and it didn't diminish the experience at all. I believe I would enjoy it just as much full time as part-time. The managers at my location go out of their way to make a schedule that works for everyone and try to create a positive environment for all employees. Obviously, some customers act up, but that's beyond the control of anyone working there. Though they do expect you to get numbers, you don't risk losing your job if you get a bad sale every now and then. Difficult for me to rate the benefits, as I do not partake in all of them as a part-timer. They do offer some pretty great benefits, just wish the employee discount gave a little more off for food products.  The way the systems work here make sense and benefit the customers and the company alike. I look forward to starting my shift every day here and highly recommend working at a Staples store if you want a nice job."
good,I loved my time at Staples and was very upset when I had to leave due to moving out of state. Your coworkers and management are fun and relaxed but are firm if you take the laid back atmosphere too far. Pay was decent and I loved my job.
good,i am a nice person who take my job as a plus when it comes to doing my job and i am always on time and i do not like to be off from work because that is not what i like to do and to be a team player and do my job
good,It is a pleasure to work at Staples. The competitive environment is great for me because I like hitting goals and setting the bar higher. I would not be leaving if not for the fact that I am searching for a higher paying job.
good,"Many jobs are the same, people leave and they come back for the next day. Staples is different, management welcome you in every day for your shift and even ask how you're doing. The customers are wonderful and I have never had to deal with a customer having a bad day, and if they are, a simple ""Can I help you find anything?"" or ""Have a lovely rest of your day"" has always turned that around for them. Everyone tries so hard to be a team and even helps you see how amazing it is to be in one and that you DO matter to everyone, even if you believe in your mind that you don't. Staples is like a second family, one I wouldn't want to replace or leave. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing people leave with a smile everyday, and of course seeing the children playing with the Ne-dohs. Sometimes juggling more than one task can be difficult, but there's plenty of people always willing to help and are just one radio call away."
good,"A friendly, fast-paced environment that offers potential advancement. Great benefits provided and fun meetings to attend. Few coworkers in each area to avoid overcrowding or lack of proper work equipment."
good,"It has been so long since i have  worked at Staples. My duties included many things, mostly customer service and working with customers to insure they have the best product to meet their individual needs."

good,I enjoyed working at Staples customer analytics department and collaborating on cross-functional analytical projects .Great place to learn and grow. The workplace culture is good.
good,"Typical work day was typical at all. There is always something to change up the day and challenge you.  It's retail, so that's what you expect.  Best part of the job is working with a team.  Hardest part was staffing, imagine that."
good,This was my first call center job. I absolutely love working here. Our customers are fantastic and my co-workers are like family. I would recommend working here to everyone I know.
good,"The managers are very friendly and understanding. The environment is very light and comfortable, which makes it fun to work there. However, they need more copy and print associates as it gets stressful at times when there is a lot of orders and only one person working."
good,Great management and excellent place to work work recommend to anyone looking for employment - they have great benefits and let me work from home - they hire the best of the best

Was able to consistently hire, train, develop, and promote many managers in order to be able to open these stores on time and on budget.  In addition I consistently beat sales and profit budgets while having outstanding customer service results with low turnover."
good,"Excellent support from team, multiple job advancement opportunities. Work was good, easy in some departments and difficult in others. Great training routine."
good,Great place to work with great health benefits and good compensation.  It is better pay than most fulfillment centers.  It is a stable and reliable job environment.
good,"great place to work ,good benifits ,management stood behind you if anything would have happen.staples was a great place to work ,with great people to work with decent benifits,"
good,"This was my first retail experience and it has been awesome, co-workers are like family, management as well, the three managers I had has been the best managers ever, the GM was like my dad. A very team orientated place"
good,"I absolutely loved my 8 years at the Ammon Staples. The management is welcoming and real. They obey the rules but they still treat you as human. There is a lot of room for advancement, especially in ez-tech. I miss this place. It was like a home to me."
good,"Sometimes work isnt always fun, and ya sometimes have to incorperate fun into it. ive learned that its alwayts a bonus to help out someone who is having a rough time at work, or even while im working. the positive outcome of it always puts smiles on. negitivity is for outside of work. always have a positive attitude. Hardest part of a job would be different for everyone. i alway say there is never a stupid question, to learn ya must ask questions, & the most enjoyable part of work would be the social life & learning new skills and abilities."
good,"Working at Staples was a Great Experience A typical day as a sales associate would be greeting customers, making sure store front was neat and clean, putting merchandise where they needed to be, stocking the shelves, and helping customers throughout the day. The most enjoyable part of a regular day was making sure the customer was happy and satisfied. Sometimes it would be days where the store did not have what the customer needed, or the merchandise wasn't in stock. What I learned about management was working in a fast paced worksite you have to be always be focused, and make sure stock and merchandise is always, neat and where it needs to be. Make sure we engage with the customer, understand their needs and demonstrate deep knowledge of information about the products in the store."
good,I enjoyed the team work among the staff and how smoothly things ran through day to day. And it showed by having reoccurring customers who knew how well we worked together.
good,Staples is a great company to work for. Personal accountability is important in any role within this organization. Be prepared to work hard and play hard.
good,I loved working for Staples. Unfortunately my time had to come to an end because I got a degree in accounting and a job offer in that field. Loved everyone that worked there.
good,Staples is a good company to work for. I found them very accomodating with scheduling hours and taking time off. I've learned valuable skills from working here.
good,"My typical day at work was to come in and find out what needs to be done as far as what endcaps, planograms, etc. I would be responsible of making sure my employees had the tools to do their job whether it would be training to physical tools to do their job.  The hardest part of the job would have to be able to accommodate everybody at the same time which does happens more than you would think.  I enjoyed coming to work and there was always something new in it."

good,"Great Company with advancement opportunities.  Excellent benefits including tuition assistance, insurance, 401k, etc.  Team atmosphere and environment."
good,"A diverse work environment both in culture and age. When the team works together the day goes smoothly. The hardest part of the job as management is the unfortunate issues that can occur for the customer. You learn to pick you battles but always take care of the customer. Stick up for you crew when the time is right. I find that meeting new people and helping them solve issues, leaving with what they came for and all that they need is rewarding."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Staples The Business Depot, and have nothing but pleasant things to say about the staff and management. The schedule were reasonable, and the management was more than open minded."

Training was by far the best i have experienced, really goes in depth with training and very thorough. There is absolutely nothing bad to say about the company and people i have worked with. The most enjoyable part of the job was when i was promoted to Technology, really enjoyed making sales, the customer interactions, and learning the knowledge of the products and becoming more aware of the knew products coming out. Made you really stay at the top of your game. However it was time for me to move on after the years in order to progress in my career that will offer more."

ALL the coworkers there are very happy to be there energetic and outgoing, it was never a dull moment there. I t was stressful at times where we had to get orders done by a short deadline but rewarding to see the smile on customer's faces when they received their order in the EXACT way they asked for it."

good,"I worked in a fulfillment center location for about two years. It was my first real job out of high school so I didn't know exactly what to expect. Turns out that the people there were great. The management team especially is very understanding compared to what I have seen at other places. The work wasn't very difficult, we just dragged a big cart around a track and scanned items into boxes on it through a headset. Fairly physical but the compensation more than made up for that. Would recommend"
good,"Coworkers are easy to get along with, fast paced environment helps time go by. The hardest part of my job is standing for eight to ten hours each day and wrapping pallets."

good,"A typical work day, at Staples, consisted of restocking shelves and assisting customers with getting what they wanted. I learned to have lots of patience with customers as well as get them to make the best deal choices to help the business. The workplace culture was calm, slow paced, but productive. I worked a 9am to 4pm shift and customers did not flood the store until around lunch hours(12pm and until closing). From 9am until 12pm, I usually made sure I organized and restocked shelves, and of course I did volunteer my help to customers that were wondering in the store in the early hours of my shift.The hardest part about working at Staples was the managers complaining about the staff and never directly confronting us. It would have helped if they gave us constructive feedback instead of complaining. However, I did enjoy working at Staples because I was able to be on my feet all day and help customers."

At first the hardest part of the job was during closing when the sales associates have to put everything in the return box back in the aisles where they belong, but after a while as you continue to do that you get use to the aisles and get better at knowing where certain items are which makes it easier to help a customer find what they need."

good,"Staples's primary goal is customer satisfaction; having a positive attitude and giving your full attention to the customers is essential to anyone who works there regardless of what position you are in.

good,I absolutely loved working here. It was a great start-out job for me right out of high school. The staff was amazing although it got hectic at times in the copy center between trying to keep customers happy and keep production moving.
good,"everyday i would have to see what is there to do. no one would tell me what i have to do because they know i go looking on my own to see what i can do for the day. i take care of customers, i put ink on the ink wall like we are suppose too and that helped me have more fast pace then i ever did before. After the boxes are full of ink we put them in the back (which contains empty recycling ink). The managers were very helpful and wonderful people. they make you feel like your home."
good,"All the time that I work for this company, it was very rewarding, I met wonderful people from whom I learned many things, it was time for me to start with new projects, every day there was something different, I always had a good relationship with my supervisors and managers, who always tried to help us with our needs and doubts, the hardest part for me was during summer, the heat was unbearable, but we got used to it, I really enjoyed driving the machines and working in putaway next to my partners was a nice adventure. I'm going to miss that place."

It was extremely easy getting a customer to sign up with us, and I would really let them know the benefits so my customer wouldn't walk out without one because when a customer signs up for one, it serves as an assurance for us that that person will receive money in return for shopping with us, which means that person will have to come back in and possibly purchase more items. I was also selling and offering our deals to the customers, such as pens, or whatever we had for the season. Also, I'd offer product insurance and replacement plans, as well as savings passes which would give them 20% off of their purchases with a one time fee of $10.00.

I've learned all of the qualities of being in a retail environment and in turn that made me more of an aggressive person in terms of getting things done for the company and for myself. Management in the store was terrific because it was orderly and I was always put pressure to make sure things were done according to our superiors. The hardest part of the job I have to say was recovering the department at the end of the day and replacing signs on Saturdays. The most enjoyable part about working at Staples was gaining experiences that I never thought I would able to experience, working with a team and speaking to complete strangers about equipment that I use in my everyday life and love.
