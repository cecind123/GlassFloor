bad,Awful experience. No organization micro management rushing workers to fill there quotes long hours no apprehension of the work they do so very unskilled management
bad,"Bad place to work"
bad,"The management here is horrible, they show no interest in their employees. They want you to do your work, cash your checks and keep quiet, which I would have gladly done if the paid better and provided the necessary tools to do the job. This is a high risk job that requires you to have an armed guard watch your back while you work on atms, a guard was almost never available."
bad,"The job is ok, it's the management and ridiculous policies that are implemented by certain departments.  One department has their set of rules, another theirs and there is the ""call center"" and their polices, even though were all under ""the same umbrella"". Moral is  is awful and large turn over."
bad,There is no time limit for this job for ATM service engineer.  we start work at morning 6 may be it will completed around 11 pm to 12 pm. increment is around 500 rs to 1000 rs. there is no leaves. 24*7 should available. travelling job. please don't join as a ATM service engineer in dieboldnixdorf.   other than this job in diebold it is nice.
bad,"Very political environment and back stabbing . Terrible work life balance "
bad,"The company's shares dropped because the company is poorly ran I've been aboard for three years and there is no opportunity to grow. "
bad,"Ich war etwas über 2 Jahre als Callcenter-Agent in diesem Laden und kann nur jeden warnen, dort anzufangen. Es sei denn, er hat Lust, bald einen gehörigen Knacks im Oberstübchen zu bekommen oder aber komplett abzustumpfen. Das fängt schon mit der ""Ausbildung"" dort an, die ganze 3 Wochen dauert. Das klingt nach genügend Zeit, aber bei der Zahl der zu supportenden Geräte ist es der berühmte Tropfen auf den heißen Stein. Danach folgt eine Woche, in der einem ein erfahrener Agent an die Seite gesetzt wird und einen unterstützt, während man ins kalte Wasser geworfen,d.h. den Kunden zum Fraß vorgeworfen wird."
bad,I didn't have a great experience while working here management was no good the people there were really nice but management started firing a lot of good works!  It was like you could never do enough
bad,"Corporate decisions were driven in Paderborn, Germany and either they didn't understand or didn't want to invest in what was needed to make US banking customers happy.  Low margin deals with huge vendors made supporting our customers extremely challenging."
bad,"Underpay big time, The zones where to big you run about 80K miles a year, boss nonexistence poor leadership does not manage bad employee's well at all. The health benefits where bad I always end paying out of pocket even after the insurance pays there share. The problem is they sell ATM's to banks and the bank's put its own software which ends up causing a lot of problems. The repeated system they have always make the tech look bad and is never explain or train on how to do better. The pay raises are a joke 2% always across the board and sometimes no raises at all the problem is they sold off the departments that were making this company money. You have to work every holiday unless you request it off you always have put in your vacation for the year and whatever you don't use you lose. The ATM's are not made to work on at all the parts are so hard to get or find you end up having to stop what you're doing to ship a part to another tech in another state. You used to be able to have parts ship to your house not anymore I find this company lacking so much in every part I don't miss it at all. Had one technician super lazy and my supervisor could care less Florida management was the poorest I have ever seen. I don't miss the GPS and the weekly reports about your driving yet making our zone smaller or better hours would never happen."
bad,"The atm businesses is rough on techs to say the least and especially in the tri state area. The SLA's are brutal(90 mins or less!) "
bad,"TRASH A toxic work environment is any that makes you feel uncomfortable, unappreciated, or undervalued. This can range from all out bullying, screaming and talked down to, to more subtle forms of poor communication, setting people up for failure, mismanagement and an air of hostility. It can come from your boss, your peers, your juniors and even your clients"
bad,"Empresa agradavel , boa para crescimento profissional"
bad,"-There is no progress in terms of work"
bad,offices closed in Tampa with new CEO change.  HR had a closed door policy.  Staff was miserable working in these awful conditions.  Regional VP would ask the employees how he could save the region.  Really.
bad,"Société d'hipocrites ou un nouveau responsable jamais présent permet de se plaindre du travail fourni par un service."
bad,"VERY stressful, unreasonable expectations. Supervisor was okay but the stress got to her and she stepped down. Upper management did not have any realistic view of the job. Some Temps were working for several years and not getting hired on."
bad,Trained for one shift on how to do things but after training you get stuck on a different shift with no training on different thing that you didn't see while training. Also can't make any plans with family or friends on any working days.
bad,I would warn anyone who applies to note this company will break you! They will drive you into the ground with the hours and destroy your family life. I have watched people pass out from working so hard and asked to do more! The life style is horrible!
bad,"It consist of 14 hour work days, nights and weekends, audit of inventory, communication with teammembers, troubleshooting atm machines, filling out reports"
bad,"get in to conference call, receive assignment for the day for different locations go out and fix problems. drive around with parts in the van and if part is not available go get parts at warehouse."
bad,"The CEO came on  board with the mission of turning the company around.  So far, a boat load of money was spent acquiring a competitor and a software company.  Yet the stock price continues to slide. Long history of increased dividend came to end...and the stock price continues to slide.  Many valuable and loyal employees RIFed over the last 4 years to cut costs to fund acquisitions...and the stock price continues to slide.  Even the managers the CEO brought in from Siemens and HP have cut and run."
bad,"push you to work to many hours, they don't care about their employees. Worse job I ever had. I only lasted 8 months before I got burned out, and left."
bad,"This company will use you for a few years and then once they get out of you what they want,they will drain you and your family by working you over 40 hours and you will not get any extra money for your time. You could start here but you won't finish better off to look someplace else.. Their are much better opportunities out there."
bad,Terminated me seven months before my contract was to expire.  Could not get access to servers and software to do my work.  I was told I would get access but they kept putting it off.  Then terminated me because of poor performance when I was working as hard as I could and doing what they told me to do.
bad,"In the day of a Diebold service tech:"
bad,The work environment was poor due to the fact that Diebold was out sourcing all the current jobs to India.  They wanted everyone to work 150% and take work home with them although their jobs would eventually end.  Not a good work atmosphere.
bad,"I worked there for 4 days.  First things first, I received a training by projector for 2 days that was of no use and "
bad,You will get worked to death. Sent across the US. Never see you family. Also never get a raise.
bad,"While working at this company I learned there was lots of favoritism. Management was not set up to lead the company in a positive direction. Management would try and pit employees against each other by pulling employees aside and saying one employee said this and another employee said that. Very unhealthy environment to work in. Management would make snide or insulting comments to employees, along with talking down to them."
bad,Work with Mgr's that did not. Know nothing about managing it was. Who you know to get the job. The ppl I worked with did not know nothing. It was 3 out of the team. That were nit and will never be good techs. I had to go behind them everytime. They worked on atm' s. I had go every where from Baltimore To DC to VA to Delaware to West VA to Pa. And still had to go behind them and guess what because. I was a person that tried. To make it better it got worse. Running behind. Techs that worked on ATM s for 5 mins And left. Or worked. For hours knowing that they could not fix a thing.
bad,Management don't know how to run the company in US. They lied to customers and employees. No training
bad,Stay away. Management will throw you under the bus.
bad,poorly managed company that was constantly trying to get around California labor laws. Poor management with no concern for their employees. Every day was chaos and confusion.
bad,"Used to be strong union based company, new management does not have a clue how to manage the busines and new technology requirements when they ventured into the voting booth arena. Very bad company to work for."
bad,"Poor job culture, extremely bad life/work balance, lack of job security, poor management, no career and compensation growth. No holidays, hard to get full vacation time (have to plan 12 months in advance). Constantly on- call."
bad,Worst experience i ever did working for Diebold. Territory management are the worst people I have been met in my career as a field service Technician. Where they don't nothing to do just micro management Technicians.
bad,"Chances of cost cutting is more"
bad,Las platas para viajes no salen nunca.............hasta tres viajes gastando dinero propio para salir a terreno.
bad,They moved all IT operations to India for expenses. That lasted about a month. No matter what they do they falter and can't get out of their own way. I left when I could see they were sending work overseas.
bad,"Diebold is the security command center for Bank of America, and currently they are become securitas, I am a contractor with CRG, and we are promised to go permanent after a year. Even if offered I would not like to work here, the management is terrible and co-workers don't have the same work ethic as I do. The most enjoyable part of my job is we can wear headphone."
bad,"No any work/life balance, terrible job security and conditions, non-effective management, low job culture. Hire / Fire style of employment. Chronicle shortage of service technicians.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ."
bad,"Poor overall. Impossible targets. Constant bulling by top heavy management. Training (if you are lucky) by PDF document but always ambiguous. Very long hours, one in three weeks on call and expect to work 80 to 90 hours in that week. You locations are tracked. Only positives is the pay is paid on time and the work can be interesting."
bad,"im Unternehmen herrscht eine unmenschliche Personalführung. Bewertet wird nicht die eigene Leistung und die daraus resultierende Kundenzufriedenheit. Wer nicht ""gemoppt"" wird, ist im Vorteil."
bad,Tremendous stress and fear of loss of job if you didn't work incredible hours. Working yourself to death was never good enough. Even after heroic efforts.
bad,"Ok, here it is point blank. Can be end of shift and NOPE, you're working another 4 hrs. Production schedule changes like the wind. Literally. Inventory at Greensboro is a joke at best. Constantly going to warehouse to snag some parts and never enter those removed into the Oracle system. Better to blame to inventory team for making mistake. Approximately 1.4 million dollars discrepancy in inventory. Line workers are taught short cuts by supervisors that are driven to get ATM finished and not to worry about down stream. Build 300 ATM's then have them sit unfinished then go to remove some parts from them to be used on production lines. Have a VP that rants and raves, he literally yells at people about topics that they have no control over. Supervisors will lie right to you. The buyers need to be retrained but easier to blame others on their errors. Talk about making customer goals....NOT! BofA ready to cancel contract. Oracle problems.... turn over is so bad, an in house temp agency has an office space on the supervisor platform."
bad,"This used to be a great company. Management lacks leadership, everything is politics, poor training, no room for growth, too much traveling, no raises (I can go all day). This is a terrible company and the techs culture is laziness. The manager is too emotional and lacks managerial skills. You get promoted if you're in the clique not for experience and ability to do the job. Their stock is very cheap just like their service. Glad I quit last year and found a better job that appreciate their employees."
bad,Diebold built its reputation as a vault an safe manufacture (most notably during the Great Fire of Chicago). Over the years they have grown and acquired many other physical security companies.
bad,"Travel—road warrior"
bad,"Company is manufacturer of ATMs.  I was hired to have a territory in Brookfield & Danbury CT. areas.  My very first day I ended up in Boston for 12 hours.  Four technicians covered the state of CT. with more manpower to come aboard which never occurred.  Hired for 8:00 am till 5:30 PM.  We were never told if an ATM went down at 11:00 pm 60 miles from our home, we were instructed to go.  Job description misled the 4 of us. Wachovia and Chase Banks were misled about product being ready to roll out.  Software and printers were hardly functional and we all followed up traveling on recalls.It was to recruit for a job no one in their right mind would work.  Needless to say all four of us ended up leaving.  I can go on and on."
bad,"If you need a filler job until you find something better, then use them as they will use you! Company is attempting to re-invent & modernize, but it remains a quagmire of overlapping & multi-layered middle management that bogs down all decision making."
bad,No problems I would fix atm machines for them. I would travel in their company going place to place. They also would fly me sometimes.I had day work..
bad,"Management plays favorites, if you are not best friends with your manager, you will be overlooked. Information is not passed around fairly to be able to do well at your job. For example, if a policy changes and you are not ""popular"", you will be left out of the loop...and then held accountable for things that were not your decision. When you have a concern, management will refuse to talk to you about. Sales are responsible for communicating ACCURATE information in a timely manner order to put contracts together, but if they don't you are still held responsible. Management is clueless as to what really goes on or they tailor situations to suit themselves. If you want to work for people who have integrity and actually care about the people who work for them (not just their favorites) keep looking. Completely biased and unfair work practices and very poor management. Coworkers are allowed to leave anytime they want to get lunch or Starbucks often with the manager, but then the manager will say they have no time for you. Managers and coworkers will lie about you because no one is checking to see what they say is actually true or not."
bad,i worked as a service engineer for eight months and now am searching for a job of core side in production or in maintenance in ELECTRICAL STREAM
bad,"The absolute worst run, managed company I have ever seen anywhere."
bad,"I absolutely hated this job. Work hours for call center employees were horrible. Dress code was positively silly (no capri pants) Expected those same employees to work Holidays Luke Easter, Christmas, etc while the conservative stuffed shirts were with their families. Supervisors also a joke. Always threatened you with telling you they haven't decided if you were going to be a permanent Diebold employee. So i decided to decide my fate myself. I cried every day on the way to work. Glad I am out of there."
bad,I was working for wincor for 11 months and doing a very good job. On a Thursday everything was fine. Had no idea that I would be unemployed that Friday.
bad,"Zero corporate culture."
bad,"Keep looking, Try to do better. Don't come here unless you're desperate. There is no respect here. There is very very unfair treatment here and favoritism."
bad,"Managers are put into positions because of who they know not what they know  "
bad,"I was tupe'd into Diebold Nixdorf last year. I am a mobile engineer in southern England. The pay is ok and the actual job is good. Repairing / fixing tills and general epos kit is the aim of the game. When I had my joining up meeting, the manager span a great yarn about all your jobs will be in a general area, this was complete rubbish. A daily mileage is on average around 150 miles, 300 at weekends. There is a huge amount of monthly admin to do which they like to push you to do in your own time. They are not keen on the working time directive either. The 1 in 3 week standby rota is very hard going. And the week following this week your 2 days off are regularly changed to forced to work days. The company has an awful bullying culture. Managers bully low level staff and higher managers bully middle managers. They also have a terrible parts system where all parts have to be returned within 3 days. Avoid this company like a rampant bull!"
bad,"Loved working with the customers, but management made it very difficult to do a job in an efficient way. The job was high stress and pay was not comparable to the level of skills needed."
bad,You will do the job of 3 people. Management is all saying something different. They will cut staff  and overload who is left until they leave too. Then everything is in chaos and they must finally hire back only to cut again.
bad,"There is zero job security at Diebold.  I worked at Diebold 10 years and the company reorganized every single year.  Everyone's number is called eventually.  The company changes their CFO, CEO, and directors constantly.  The company is failing. You should only work for this company if you are looking for a temp job.  DO NOT leave a stable job for this company."
bad,"my work day consists of doing my job and someone else  job, low moral on the floor. The company just doesn't care, then how can I care.  The hardest part is wanting to just walk out knowing I can't. I kinda need this job right now. Best part of the day is leaving."
bad,"No communication especially with last minute changes. Not everyone gets to be on board. Their philosophy is that it is all about them and get used to it or has been mentioned in morning meetings ""You know where the door is"". It is a stressful place to work with so much overtime that morale stays at a bottom low. You feel if you have a problem you cannot really say anything because it seems to always be a ""deal with it, sink or swim"" idealology and they simply don't have time to hear your concern. There seems to be a knee jerk reaction to things with the management to ""bandaid"" a situation. They won't leave people already in place that do a great job and have a talent for it and then they panic when that person's job starts lacking because of pulling them. This is called ""band aiding""."
bad,"prometen incluir en la planilla, pero nunca lo hacen,"
bad,"day to day activities are ok."
bad,"I have been working here since 5 year.This is my first company and I am lucky to get good team members over here ,only team members not managers or leads. Good pay given but there is no job security."
bad,"Working in Diebold HR requires a person who is content with status-quo, does not challenge authority or process, and is not an independent thinker. Diebold is a company with great potential but the Human Resources department holds the company back by hiding incompetence behind rigidity and convoluted process."
bad,"Seeing how I was recently ""laid off"" from this exact location and this exact position, as well as 2 other coworkers of mine I am not entirely sure why this job is posted here."
bad,"Working at Diebold was an AWFUL experience. The trainer is AWESOME, but she is clueless to what actually happens in the call center itself."
bad,"Dispatch didn't know our area so we were sent to jobs 80 miles apart then questioned why we took so long to get from site to site.  And why we didn't do jobs in between sites.  Management only cared about the ""bottom line"".  Training was minimal and we were left on our own in remote locations.  If we were stuck in traffic, the monitor on our vehicles alarmed to dispatch, and we were chewed out. even if the traffic was stopped."
bad,"Ohio office worried about shareholders more than the employee. This is purely a production based operation, but will withhold this mantra in front of field employees. Upper level management WILL do what it takes to work out employees that do not fit their good ol boy network. It has even been observed where fictitious information was used to collaborate with company attorneys to remove or squeeze out employees that to not fit a executive's group"
bad,Company going thru a huge reorganization. Financially unstable. Good salaries but you will be always exposed to lose your job. Lack of market focus. Do your due diligence before accepting any position.
bad,"Never saw a manager unless they wanted to yell about something"
bad,"Numa empresa se segurança absoluta, onde se manipula com valores e segredos de segurança bancários, ter uma gerência com suspensão de conchavo com alguns profissionais, é inadminissível. Falta reciclagem aos gerentes e feedback dos subordinados diretamente à CIA."
bad,"Management has changed hands frequently. You will be overworked and underpaid, coming home every night filthy and exhausted. Many techs have come and go. Lack of future growth / opportunities. Absolutely zero response from HR when needed. Too much work with no praises or reward. This company will suck the life out of you and take advantage their employees by threats. Random mandatory OT; doctor's notice required when using one sick day; cannot request vacation time off unless coworker covers shift, which is impossible when they're no resources. Vacation time does not roll over; so if you don't use it, you lose it. Also if you resign, they will not pay your aquired vacation time. Last management want all vacation time off to be scheduled for the entire year by March. The company will judge you based on excel reports, different categories of numbers that are meaningless for a hard worker. According to the job posting, they offer college tuition but that's a lie and you will not be given the time for classes. They worst of all -if you're in the ER and need surgery, they will deny your time off; if your family member is sick and dying, HR and company's health insurance will deny your time off to take care of loved ones. "
bad,"Diebold has decided to give up their tried and true methods to expand their place in the market. They've done so by selling off their security services and outsourcing night shift jobs to India. Not only would I not recommend working for them, I would actively avoid their services due to lack of ample staff and qualified techs."
bad,"Highly unknown to the general public this is a fairly big security (now a Software Services) company that spans across the world. It is only second to NCR corporation in the ATM domain. "
bad,"Diebold is transforming itself to a services lead, software enabled company.  Lots of growth opportunity post Wincor merger...."
bad,"Beaucoup d'heure de garde, mais peu de reconnaissance de la direction"
bad,Not very good environment to work in.manager not helping their staff.employee feel under appreciated.salary not worth with workloads.too many job scope to cover .
bad,"Challenging work.   However, management above my immediate supervisor was horrible.   When wincor/nixdorf was going through merger with Diebold, management and account managers were clueless."
bad,"Een bedrijf die goed omgaat met zijn personeel."
bad,"Management at top level VP and directors eating up the revenue and unable to provide right direction.  They are busy in protecting their jobs and  their buddy associates who dance to their tune."
bad,"Poor management and lack of freedom. Micromanaged and work dumped on you from all avenues, along with being responsible for answering for problems that you have no control over."
bad,"(Recently) Former CEO ran the business poorly. Laid off hundreds of employees, sacrificing a massive amount of tribal knowledge in the process. In turn, hired contractors to replace the needed work and hired high priced cronies from previous companies. Was know as a hatchet-man when he was brought in. Bought/merged with 2 companies to help with software deficiencies yet neither company had a product that fit the marketplace need. New software 'solution' required thousands of man hours to re-engineer it to fit the need and that was delivered late and bug filled. This resulted in sagging sales, bad margins and plummeting stock prices. The obvious cause was not the product but the front line field employees trying to make it work..."
bad,"I am looking for a non voice job , morning shifts would be much more better to balance my personal life."
bad,"Told from start that we used to hire people outright but people were not staying for a variety of reasons.  As a regular employee you would receive a company vehicle, a company gasoline card, a company parking card, and a toll transponder.  As a temp you do not.  But we pay I think 50 something cents per mile and you are reimbursed for parking in downtown Boston 8-10 times a night.  Temp agency said after check came in we only pay 35 cents per mile take it up with Diebold. And you would be reimbursed with tolls, parking, etc.  NONE of that was happening!!  The temp agency out of TX did not pay for detours like Fenway Park during concerts or games, did not pay for a detour around Mass Ave bridge THAT WAS TORN DOWN THAT MONTH!  They would only pay toll expenses if you gave it to them week to week and you get state transcripts 1xmonth.  Temp agency used some phone app to track you butt hen checked mileages via google maps so no detours even though the app verified it.  After about 95 days asked when I could be permanent answer was ""you will definitely be permanent but not days or months only when we have an opening and I don't have an opening.  So it couod be ten years?  Maybe!  Told I would start looking elsewhere and I will let you know when my 2-3 weeks would be I was let go!"
bad,Diebold did an acquisition about 2 years ago and has yet to shed the costs associated with the planned integration.  There is essentially two separate companies trying to co-exist with one sitting on top of a large debt obligation.
bad,"Don't work here! Temp agency only hires ex-cons. They come in and control management. People are scared to stand up to them so they do what they want. Leave early or don't come in at all. Nothing is said or done. They treat the good workers like trash. Diebold employees fo something wrong, deny it and temps get blamed. Glad I got out when I did!!"
bad,Diebold does hiring sprees when they need extra projects completed. You will go through months of training and when you hit the field you get a little more time until the higher ups need to show percentages to CEOS and stock holders. Then to no fault of your own you will be let go. Then you have to sign off on never being able to work there again (not that I can think of a reason to do so).  The training and the job itself is great. Work out of your vehicle and a lot of travel. The management is not there for you and micromanage to a fault. Your coworkers are very clicky and go out of their way to stab you in the back. If you are looking for paid training into this field and are prepared to move on to different employment this is the job for you.
bad,Uma  ótima empresa solida no mercado que da oportunidade ao funcionário e líder no ramo de automação bancaria.
bad,"Used to be great to work there, now in turmoil with massive layoffs and cutting measures."
bad,"Long days , very stressful enviornment you can't even have more than 5 misspelled words without getting wrote up."
bad,"I enjoyed working at Diebold until 2016 when they purchased Wincor Nixdorf of Germany. Since they were purchased, and because of no divestiture plan by the executives who made that decision, over 2,500 employees were let go from their position, in my case the entire tax department was outsourced to Ernst & Young, they were laid off and all executives other that the former CFO and CEO were able to maintain their employment."
bad,"Random availability at best, trainer is given job security by turning away candidates. The work is easy but they will tell you it is hard and complicated in order to preserve the illusion that others cannot do the job."
bad,"Empresa com sérios problemas de hierarquia seus gestores sem preparo de gestão / técnico / administrativo, gasta dinheiro com burocracia, cortando custos no corpo técnico decaindo a qualidade técnica de seus serviços."
bad,I spent 10 years here and for the most part its a secure job. But in order to advance you either have to know some one or some how cheat the system. People are nice but management was very poor and no room to advance
bad,"Foi uma experiência profissional que eu não avia conhecido ainda, é uma empresa boa de trabalhar..."
bad,They expect a lot of work without the proper pay. Very long hours and then would have no work. Very inconsistent work flow and stressful environment to stay in constantly lots of playing favorites.
bad,"The company does not have a clue on how to run a business, they have people in charge that does not know what the field is doing and makes MAJOR mistake that cost the company money and then turn around and start laying off people for there mistakes. There is unlimited overtime if you are a Second Line Technician or even First Line Technician.The company does provide a Car, Laptop and Uniforms.Being a Second Line Technician does require a lot of Admin work and on top of this you still need to work on the Product. I would not recommend this Job for someone that does not work at all, this job will take all of your personal time because THIS JOB IS NOT A 9 - 5 JOB AND WILL REQUIRE OVERTIME! AND I MEAN ALOT OF OVERTIME. The company will not care about you and will only care about having a body to run the service calls.The pay raise in this company does not happen every year but will happen if the company is doing good, there was a time when the company did not give a pay raise for 4 years so make sure you will get a good starting pay because you will never know when is the next pay raise."
bad,"Same individuals are given overtime/mandatory overtime"
bad,"Too much of politics."
bad,"The work is only great because you get to work on your own, at your own pace."
bad,"Unreasonable expectation of workload to be carried, as well as hours to be worked...without O/T compensation.  Projects assigned prior to completion of training.  PM's leaving due to workload, not to mention health issues from stress.  No thanks."
bad,Not enough technicians in the field to support the customers. Need to hire additional technicians to avoid causing burn out of employees in the field.
bad,"pay raises were given when the company had the funds or when the employee reminded the company of the annual time acquired, the company placed too much responsibility on the employee for training and job functions, the supervisor very seldom-ed helped the employee to advance and always gave low evaluation remarks even though the employee was giving 150%"
bad,Many associates are frustrated with the company.  Unfortunately associates are not very important anymore so many are leaving and finding better jobs elsewhere.
bad,não prega a cultura de empresa de ponta e seus metodos administrativos são arcaicos.
bad,Dallas had all African Americans and the HQ was 95% white and it played factor on the Dallas office clousure..........................................
bad,"Worked with Diebold for just under 10 years.  The company is going down hill.  The customer is placed exactly last in line and we are encouraged to lie to them about their service.  They CEO keeps laying people off to show Profit gains.  This has resulted in less techs in the field to service customers. They act like the amount of work goes away when they get rid of field service men and women.   "
bad,No leadership skills to be found other than authoritative. Lots of new VPs with high salaries. Top line growth is anemic. Not a great situation.
bad,La naturaleza del negocio exige un alto nivel de resistencia a la presión.
bad,"Poor management in my department, and absolutely no room for advancement opportunities or pay increase in my situation."
bad,"Diebold is an old conservative hardware company trying to become a software company, unfortunately they are real bad at writting software code.  Their Agilis product that resides on all their ATM's is riddled with issues, difficult to install and even the so called ""Hot Fixes"" break more than they fix.  I was an SE for them and after two years laid off with many other SE's,  company does not care about their employees and has a long history of hiring and laying off it's work force.  Very little expertise stays with the company so there is no hope of things ever getting better until Senior Management starts looking at things in a more progressive manor, bringing in new technologies and following software development principles to create a new software application that is reliable and gets the job done.  Even Bank of America knows to run Diebold hardware with NCR software, they have working ATM's."
bad,"The company is financial trouble. Its been laying off people every 6 months. Now recently, it lost CEO and sold manufacturing plants."
bad,"Overall the company is nice to work for. The benefits that are offered to the employees is nice. However, management does not seem to care about its employees, they are more focused on what makes them look good."
bad,THey needed a sales rep for a short period of time because of a windows 10 conversion period.  Stock price is terrible and restructuring theiur debt. No project managment andcustomers are not happy about it.
bad,This company is at the bottom of the pay scale..:.They require to much for the dollar amount they will pay....Travel with cheapest hotel rooms. They are top heavy with Management...... who at most times... never show up for work....???
bad,"No existía un equipo de trabajo. Aprendí mucho y por mi cuenta, la gerencia de la empresa en Perú no respeta la parte ética de la corporación, eso lo demostraba aprobando las acciones del área comercial."
bad,"Where do I start. When interviewing with the company you are told if you are there within 90 days you will have a pay increase and put on to the company Diebold. This is a complete lie shorty after working there I learned there’s people that have been on the job a year still working with alliance. Speaking of alliance that who you will be working for not Diebold meaning that can let u go whenever they please! "
bad,"My overall experience with Diebold was not so good. Although I stayed there for only 1.5 years but still feel so, the main reason behind that was my manager. I don't want to go in too much details here but she was the only reason I left diebold."
bad,When I first was hired in it was a fun place to work.  That did not last long.  Management had no idea what happens outside of their 4 wall offices.  They demand things without realizing what it will effect.  It is %70 temps and they can't figure out why they have such bad workers. They are pretty much told from the moment they walk in they aren't going to be hired in.
bad,"terrible management "
bad,"Because of the nature of 24 hour service and inadequate personnel at times, employees are routinely forced to work huge amounts of overtime, this also increases the danger of on the job accidents."
bad,"Pay is decent if you get hired at a good rate but get use to your pay because it will never get any higher. As a Tech you will work OT almost everyday because almost every area is under staffed. Benefits are OK. Management is hit and miss. some are very hands off and seems like they are at a complete loss of what their job actually is and others feel they need to micro manage. Corporate will promise the customers the world and you will have to deliver. If anything goes wrong with the equipment it is the tech's fault. This was a once great company but they have wondered too far from their roots and the entire company is suffering. So if you're looking to work long hours for the same pay year after year, constantly being forced to learn more equipment and stock more parts while at the same time   being forced to try and sell the customer stuff they don't need or want and make your all important performance numbers then this is the place for you."
bad,"Não valoriza o profissional, pressão exercida pela supervisão sem dar condições para isso, diretoria mente para seus funcionários, pagamento de quilometragem errado"
bad,"A filial onde trabalho não é boa. Contratam supervisores mesmo não tendo um RH e sem avaliar se tal pessoa tem competência para assumir o cargo."
bad,"A empresa é ótima,mas entrou em declínio gerencial e moral nos últimos anos."
bad,"Management is stuck up, the whole company is compiled of contractors.  They let people go for no reason every month and only hire fellow employees friends or families.  If you like to be worried everyday if you have a job or not no matter your performance, this job is for you! Management litterally sit in there offices all day and either play candy crush, facebook or gossip about other employees, take 90 min lunches and turn around and fire people still doing a waaaaay better job than they could ever do."
bad,"worked as an atm technician for 17 years, they have layoffs every year, management is constantly changing, I had over 10 changes in my 'boss' over my time there. I got taken out by a layoff, not a place to plan on retiring from. No company loyalty"
bad,I have learn a lot despite having very low salary benefits. Sometimes very hectic to work there but overall it was a good place to learn for a fresher.
bad,Worse management team ever.  Constantly asked me and other technician to work off clock. Had busiest area in state and wouldn’t give us any help.  Would bring former employees back and would pay them more and they would do less work rather than give that raise to someone else that sticks around during the hard times.   There’s a reason that everybody I worked with has left.   We all still talk and it’s all the same reasons why we left
bad,"The management has no clue. This is a thankless job. Only told about the negative. Refuse to hire anyone. We went from 6 guys to 3, soon to be 2. I’m ready to drop dead. We cover a large area with a lot of driving yet get bitched at constantly because we dont get calls done on time. Hello. If I’m two hours away working on another call what am I supposed to do?  Get me a helicopter? Used to be a great job. Now I’m just trying to survive. Management is completely disconnected."
bad,"Diebold hires you as a contract worker promising to hire you in permanently after a year.  At about the 11 month mark, they let you go - or completely ignore your year in, string you along for a while, then inform you through your contractor that you're no longer needed.  That happened to everyone in my department, then they started over with new people."
bad,The lack of professionalism in the management team as far up as the VPs was disheartening and very disappointing for such a large company and only worsened after the merge with the German company.
bad,being an MNC it is good for freshers. but we can't find growth at Diebold. No hikes for Electronic Security division. It is not a good company for those who are career oriented. no job security.
bad,"A typical day starts out with leaving my home and driving to my first call, which could be anywhere from 10 minutes to 1 1/2 hours, depending on traffic.   Repairs generally take under an hour, depending on what the problem is,  then off to my next call.  "
bad,"- Empresa líder de mercado em seu segmento;"
bad,"I enjoyed what I was doing.  When I was a Field Service Engineer, they were ups and down.  At times I did not understand their philosophy but maybe it was a way to keep us in line.  I have been doing this type of work for over 25 years.  I can tell you that you are no longer “part of a family.”  Even though they treat you like they are doing you a favor by letting you work for them, in reality, without people like me servicing the equipment, they might as well close up shop."
bad,"Everyday work was OK.  Co-workers are friendly.  Overall upper management seemed to be focus on the numbers, instead of their employees and working conditions."
bad,"The actual company has a great deal of potential.  Unfortunately they will never recognize nor achieve it.  Diebold, being a publicly traded company is only worried with the ""bottom line"".  Their is no concern for the customer, nor the employee.  "
bad,"Empresa regular em organização, gerencial e comprometimento com o profissional."
bad,"This job depends on where you work some areas are slower and you will work 45 hours a week while other areas especially small towns away from metro areas you will average 70 hours a week. Micro managed to the point where there are transponders in work trucks to monitor your movements and to make sure you leave for work on time and don't dare go home before 5 pm and be prepared to work some 16 hour days. Divorce rate is high for techs due to stress . Middle managers have high turnover due to reorganization and high stress. Very little room for advancement. When you interview you need to get as much salary as you can due to limited pay raises usually at 2% and a some years no raises . Being a lock technician would be the best position with the least amount of stress , alarm techs and ATM techs should look elsewhere unless they are go getters and love their work more than their family."
bad,Too little pay for constant workplace drama. They recently cleaned house.
bad,"The definition of over worked and under paid. Absolutely no regard for a work/life balance. The inmates are running the asylum. Expect you to be in the field all day yet don't reduce the ""desk work"" to allow you to be out of the office. They are fully aware and just don't care. Co-Workers were great."
bad,"I am writing this after taking early retirement before the Nixdorf addition. Working for Diebold 20yrs ago was a source of pride, as we were the best in the business. Upon leaving in 2013, it was a source of embarrassment due to the poor customer service and substandard equipment. I hope it has improved over the last 6yrs, but the stock prices and online information aren't promising. "
bad,Single man's job...shady practices..you will work all holidays as a fl...actual starting pay for. Fl is 14hr..dont believe the 22 hour posting u see..high risk high expectations low to no rewards..
bad,"It would take forever to be moved to full time and even after that salary increases are minimal. Most employees have been there for a decade or longer and the benefits have been gradually suspended or cut, like no match on your contribution to 401k."
bad,"Typical day was to go in, respond to requests from employees and/or human resources to update payroll records.  Once payroll is run, typical day is to look for any errors, etc... fix, and then finalize payroll.  "
bad,"Not a great place to work for at the time, but this has no doubt improved over the years. Plenty of benefits, but the location was also a problem. Not a great experience."
bad,"Poor management, and drive A LOT. They provide you a company car, gas card, credit card, cell phone, laptop, and wifi hotspot. You work about 70 per week every other week"
bad,It seemed as though all ideas of made in the USA are gone from there with their foreign CEO. The purchase of a major company in Germany and the minimal manufacturing of products in the USA.
bad,Stressful and very unpredictable/ No job security anynore.  The company has changed for the worst.  All employees are just a number; not appreciated like years ago
bad,"The internal structure of Diebold/Nixdorf is going through many internal transitions and the nature of navigating their overly complicated internal web is not user friendly. The company utilizes many outdated systems and a constant shifting of internal structure has left them with a frustrated work force. As well, many upper management decisions have lead to numerous monetary problems and concerns that have left a top company once flush with cash desperate to collect on their promises made to their clientele. As well, in the process the clientele are just as confused if not more so of how to navigate the overly complex web of people within the company. There are rough days ahead for the company which is why I left in order to find something more structured and less stressful."
bad,In the process of buying/merging with other company's to save money during that process they are outsourcing jobs to India. There is almost no room for Advancement and no Security.
bad,Use to be a good place to work. Now they want to much from associates. No work family balance. Nothing to get called in all hours of the night. No raises in some years.
bad,"if you are a workaholic, this is a company for you. management only cares about making bonuses and making themselves look good to their bosses.  quality of life of field personnel does not matter to them. seniority and sacrifices you make to get promoted does not mean it will pay off."
bad,"Not a bad company in general, just lots of changes over the past several years has left management and employees disjointed. Lots of good people and lots of not so good people. The hardest part is knowing what needs to be done, wanting to make a difference, but being blocked at every turn. The best part is if the USA division can ever agree on the vision and execute, the future could be very bright."
bad,"A ton of driving, working in very in climate conditions, expected to work long hours, too many changes with no organization."
bad,"I started out in the Tax Department completing Payroll taxes.  I advanced into with the help of previous management into State & Local, Federal, International & Foundation returns.  I worked with a great group of people.  The hardest part of the job was seeing the department being outsourced when Tax Director retired and new manger came in."
bad,"Greats co-workers, bad managers and not excitement company to work and grow as a profissional."
bad,Test & Repair Center of Automated Teller Machine Modules..
bad,"The Chicago office was overloaded with staff whose main job was to keep track of the dwindling field techs.  When layoffs and write ups came it was always on the technicians. No raises, cut in benefits, and ever rising health care costs !!  Very sad  how the company deteriorated after 15 years."
bad,"Diebold is currently in an operationally downsizing mode. Until complete, no additional comments at this time."
bad,"Having a team building makes my team to become close to each other."
bad,8-5 with a hour lunch break
bad,"Was not very happy here. four direct managers to answer to who do not communicate with eachother, so much confusion on where to be and who to listen to. Constant fear put on techs by management about possibility of losing job. Management promotes dishonesty on automated disptch and call closure system to keep overall performance numbers at acceptable level."
bad,"I left a really good job 3 months ago to come to Diebold DNA in Green. I really regret that decision. Constant reduction in wirk force, a real lack of organization, total free for all on a daily basis, don't do it!"
bad,SIento que faltan muchas prestaciones en salario es bajo faltan actividades deportivas
bad,Job was ok for the pay. I did all engineers work and was never compensated. Learned a lot of products but was unable to advance in the company. Was great company untill the took away a lot of benefits and extras.
bad,"schleichender Stellenabbau"
bad,"Fast paced work flow. Lack of communication among employees and management. High turnover rate, with low retention. Mostly temporary employees. Lack of voice within the organization. Work schedule is fairly flexible when given acceptable notice in advance. Overall experience is neutral, there is little to no incentive and lack of job advancement."
bad,"Gran experiencia internacional como nº1 de este mercado, aunque sus políticas de conciliación laboral/familiar son inexistentes, a pesar de lo que dicen. Estabilidad laboral incierta durante mucho tiempo, incomprensible..."
bad,"Interessado em aprender, buscando sempre trazer novas idéias para estimular a melhoria continua da empresa, já tenho uma bagagem de conhecimento técnico que adquiri em outra empresa do ramo,leal, bastante trabalhador."
bad,US culture leaves much to be desired. Company has a lot of people just hanging on without contributing. Very much the good 'ol boys club with sub-quality employees allowed to continue with no plan in place for them to improve or leave.
bad,"Bad management, constant changes in leadership"
bad,"US operations were micro-managed overseas by parent company in Germany."
bad,"Employees are great to work with. Management, however, looms over and makes the work experience uneasy.  Constant threat of company wide layoffs and ""restructuring""."
bad,Wincor Nixdorf is a configuration and installation shop for Software Engineers. Possibilities to grow in ATM business are limited to few companies in the market. Their technology stack is being for a long time. The diversity is one of the good things of this company. Team environment is enjoyable for the most part. Management does not encourage people to grow or develop.
bad,"Lots of turnover, layoffs common, combination of jobs functions, too much work for one person. Stressful job and the work-life balance is not great."
bad,"Lack of R&D products, No innovations projects are in pipe line, Only looking to merge/acquire new software development companies"
bad,This business is simply dreadful.  No growth prospects and culture is the work I have ever seen. Could use a large make over.
bad,"A security and technology company that fails at both. Computer servers are allways down, company uses ancient software, poor buisness practices and every other person is a temp. if you temp with them don't expect to get hired at all and they fire you after 2 years"
bad,"I am midnight support desk, with no chance of getting a normal shift. There is no shift differential. I've been here over a year and I was just told that I need to work harder, but I'm not getting a raise. The pay is awful for how much that's expected of us. Its hard to trust anyone because its survival of the fittest and anyone could throw you under the bus if they hear something just to get ahead. There are a few good people there though. The company is transitioning, laying off a ton of people and CRC is picking up all the work. None of the supervisors know how to do it, much less us as employees. No matter how good you do, there is nothing positive said during reviews, always whats wrong or what you could be doing better and honestly, I always leave my review upset or in tears."
bad,"A typical day, start off with conference calls as soon as you walk in the door which continue throughout the day. You search through the company systems looking for information to answer everybody's questions and explain to Diebold why the customer is not happy with them."
bad,Very little loyalty towards employees. Upper level leadership has no trouble sweeping bad behavoir by management under the rug. Allows management to belittle employees. Very little respect for veterens.
bad,"Como esse estágio foi quando eu estava ainda no começo do curso. Eu fiquei preso as pessoas que trabalhavam há tempo no local. Não consegui desenvolver nada sozinho, geralmente precisa de ajudar de um engenheiro, no qual aprendi muito com ele. Fui voltado mais para parte de processos, porém sempre revia normas da qualidade e verificar documentos técnicos. Comecei depois de um tempo a trabalhar juntamente com o técnico de segurança do trabalho, no qual desenvolvemos alguns estudos ergonômicos. A direção é muito difícil de conversar, colegas sempre reclamavam das condições de trabalhos."
bad,"Was responsible for developing and maintaining the global sourcing strategy of embedded/Cloud (IaaS/PaaS/Saas)/IT infrastructure software and firmware as well as the subcontract management of all managed services in support of near-field communication (NFC), ATM remote diagnostic/actuation/key loading, logical security, security surveillance (cameras/alarm systems), integrated private network wireless applications, and predictive data analytic platforms designed for major financial institutions around the world. Collaboratively negotiated master license, hardware, and service agreements (MLAs/MSAs) with software and managed service providers that leverage Diebold's new product introduction and emerging technology objectives, while affording annual cost deflation, optimal return on investment (ROI) and intellectual property control, with service value enhancement opportunities that promoted extended business enterprise and sourcing best practice ideals."
bad,"perhaps the most unorganized rigid company i've worked for. Definitly not somewhere do work if you want to advance in your career at all. Very little employee improvement or learning opportunities, poor reviews, bad management. The most emjoyale part of the job were the people who I did have some fun times with, the workplace culture was very drab but not stressful. the hardest part of the job was not being able to make improvements to processes without a million people looking it over and ok'ing it even though they wern't in the weeds to decide if the improvements were helpful."
bad,"I've worked here for over 10 years and have several roles within the Organization.  I started here working in the warehouse as a Supervisor and then went into my position as an Operations Coordinator. I work with all Vendors, as far as issuing PO's, returning equipment and getting Advance Replacements for defective parts shipped overnight to our customer sites."
bad,"As a temporary worker your goal is to usually get hired in. The only way to get hired in to this company is to suck up as much as possible. Apparently being a good and hard worker doesn’t mean anything to upper management. "
bad,"Not bad but glad to be away.  There was no warning of the very long hours to be put in and the micromanaging that was done.  They expect you to hit the ground running, with very little training.  Oh well."
bad,"OVERALL Disaster"
bad,Required on line training was antiquated.Very difficult computer system to operate.Spent more time on computer and an overload of emails than actual work.
bad,"This Company has taken itself from the top, to a middle of the road company, over the past 20 years. Upper and Middle management quit using experienced project managers, and started hiring young managers with more Excel experience than on the job experience."
bad,"This company is a typical large corporate giant, and treats its employees in the way you would expect from a large company. Layoff should be expected in 5-7 years. No loyalty to employees past next Friday. Sorry this review could not be more positive, just the way it really is with Diebold."
bad,There is no joy being an engineering employee at Diebold. Profit over people. I saw good managers leave and poor ones promoted. If you don't drink the cool-lade you are considered a no-one.
bad,Management needs much more trainings how to do the business...
bad,Buyer beware. A tough company to work for. When I left all the rank and file were in chaos. Not a pleasant experience to work with. Do your homework before you join this company.
bad,"No flexibility with schedules. Needs of the business, supersede family. Need a balance between work and family life. Need to concentrate on formal training for some positions."
bad,The company has a high rate of turnover in almost every position.  Layoffs are common and the workload can be very heavy most of the time.  The pay and benefits are very competitive.
bad,"Was there for many years, however the management over the past 10 years has caused the company to be too big and have no concern for employees.  Wage increases non existant."
bad,"For Wincor Nixdorf  Company was so organized for doing well job i improve our IT Skills even our languages."
bad,"I'ma call management coordinator for NROC.  I have to work mandatory overtime of 10 hours per week.  Supervisors never leave their desks. If you ask for help, they only instant message you. You have to take calls, read and manage messages from technicians, schedule calls and handle escalations all at the same time.  If you don't do your messages and escalations within a certain amount of time, you get low scores.  It's impossible to do to it all at the same time.  absolutely impossible.  They don't care if you have to work 12 hour days.  The only way you can get a pay raise if you get a promotion.  They don't tell you about no raises or the mandatory overtime when they hire you.  Trust me, the stress is not worth it!  The sups are cool guys, but you only see them twice a day when they come around to say hi once and tell you they're leaving.  I've never seen the department manager on the floor.  It's cubicle city, not a fun place at all."
bad,"A typical day at this company was very busy and fast paced, ever-changing environment. The culture is diverse and laid back, however too laid back in some instances. Thing  are brushed under the rug and when you seek for guidance support and help it is challenging and you have no support. Its best to keep things to your self and document everything."
bad,Stable career and can be challenging at times.  management changes very often. On call schedule can be tough at most times. no company/dinner parties during the Holidays for field technicians.  always out in the field.
bad,"•	Preparing Leave Data Report send to Germany."
bad,"a lhe dar com publico, como atender um cliente, como me comportar."
bad,"no comment at the moment, great company to work for. alot of over time and uninformed managers, do your research before working, no for people with families"
bad,"The culture has changed so much with the merger, people don't seem to care, policies are not upheld, the amount of work they expect does not allow for success. Leadership does not exist."
bad,"Correcte mais le salaire tire vers le bas, trop de délocalisation."
bad,"Allows people with zero people skills to manage people.  Management is rude, condescending and disrespectful.  Lets good workers go due to their age."
bad,"This company does not care about its people and has been consistently outsourcing their positions to India, etc. The work is monotonous and there is not much interaction between people."

good,Diebold Nixdorf no longer offers the benefits or recognition to their employees they once offered.  They do not value employee loyalty and no longer offer 401 K or raises.
good,"Good jumping off point. I learned a lot about their proprietary software, which is hard to transfer to a new job. Got a ton more experience with Java, HTML, and CSS."
good,Decent environment to work in. Not to hot or cold. Clean. Availability to train for different positions if motivated. Tons of overtime. Management not very good at communicating effectively. Tools available as needed. Parts available as needed. Fast paced and sometimes stressful.
good,"Les falta mucho para poder ser una empresa que tenga una buena administración de recursos. Por querer generar ingresos y no estar en números rojos mandan a la gente fuera del país sin importarles nada. Puede llegar a ser una buena empresa si mejoraran esa parte. "
good,"l entreprise se reconstruit après une fusion, difficile dans ce contexte particulier d exprimer ses talents."
good,"Empresa da treinamento, trabalho em campo, da segura de vida, combustível para atendimento em campo, participação de lucros."
good,"People are expendable.  There is no work life balance unless you are an 8-5er in an office.  Jobs get so overdone without reason.  Sales force is a  sales farce, always making mistakes and EXPECTING others to do their job for them so they can go to the Winners Circle.  No other employees have such rewards for getting the job done poorly.  Production is slow.  This is a great job if you want people to base your good qualities and your strides with the same goals for all.  No Pension, but a 401K is offered.  Minimal if any raises are given.  Middle management are thwarted by upper management.  People are let go to make the ROI good for the stockholders, while service and installation work suffer.  Keep on looking as even hard, seasoned, and smart  workers are not appreciated."

good,"Learning the different parts of a atms. Friendly people to work with. Management not so good. Things should be looked over closer. The hardest part about the job is testing a part you repaired and it does not pass the testing,"
good,"Local agradável, com colaboradores qualificados. Empresa em desenvolvimento."
good,The pay is low. Management is terrible. The actual work is fine. Moral is down. Times have changed and the quality and work ethic has gone down over the years.
good,"El trabajo es relativamente sencillo. Te asignan de tres a cuatro servicios por día. Debes cargar una mochila con herramienta,la cual pesa aproximadamente 12 kg. El problema es que no recibes mucho apoyo de tus jefes en caso de que tuvieras problemas con algún servicio, pero los compañeros si te apoyan. "
good,Diebold has the greatest group of people I have ever worked with. Hard-working people who sacrifice a lot in order to better the company.
good,Company cares about its customers. Weekends off. Hard to get hired in in any position. Some micromanagement from higher ups.

good,"Praca w jednym z projektów anglojęzycznych była wyjątkowo nieprzyjemna biorąc pod uwagę brak zaangażowania managerów oraz wysokie wymaganie postawione przez lidera projektu. "
good,"The management at Diebold was less than ideal.  The goal for management was to have an employee work against another to get more calls.  Even though I am a team player and would do anything to ensure a co-worker would succeed with their goals, management preferred that we didn't work together.  This seemed to work against a team work environment.  The work was exciting and I learned many new things thru my career with them."
good,"I learned a lot of things"
good,As a North Alabama employee you were kind of left to your own. Management was not very easy to go to with issues. Evaluations were completed but raises were not given due to corporate restructuring .
good,"Long hours are required, not much of a work/life balance, not many opportunities for growth and advancement, stuck in same position for a long time and same pay for a long time, hardly any recognition to team thats putting in all the hard work. Ok management."
good,not enough support for the clients to correct their issues.  internal departments do not have enough staff to provide solutions timely. overseas order processing hard to work with.
good,"Technically interesting and varied but spoilt by management & inconsistent process."
good,"They like to pile on the work, and not pay you for the extra stress and responsibilities.  There is NO 40 hour week.  More like 55-60."
good,"Not much organization within the company, not structure or even a handbook on how anything is done. There was no room for growth. They loved contractors and would never hire anyone on. "

good,"Initially I was a first level agent, monitoring ATM's service availablity, liaising with branch staff offering assistance to return ATM back in to service whitout any delays or need for an engineer to attend a branch ensuring Barclays customer service is maintained.

good,Giving bad hike to employee. Lot of Partiality.  Not recognize hard working people. Leaves provided.  Good to speak with colleagues. HR's not available to speak at any time.
good,"While the job is interesting,  most of what I was told when being hired no longer applies.  401k match was removed. Merit increases have been replaced with no pay increases.  Mandatory weekends for all techs just means for 2 techs.  There really is no incentive to make or keep your numbers high.  It's a job with no reward."
good,Job was ok pay could be higher and upper management could care more for lower positions. Alot of people get terminated for petty reasons. Alot of unorganized stuff going on from getting parts to complete work to job just keeping lazy employees because of friendships.
good,Great work environment. It was challenging to sell big ticket items over the phone. Management was supportive however there was a high turnover rate amongst co-workers
good,"Job started out good, however, with the change over and changing culture the job wasn't the same. Too much uncertainty at the top and different focus left our department without much direction."
good,"Highly Stressful organization, promoting management and workmates to come and go, unobtainable and unrealistic goals set with expectation of succeeding."

good,"I worked extremely long hours, weekends and holidays.  We cycled through about eight managers in five years and they push hard to get as much work out of you until you have had enough.  I liked the work I did but it could become overwhelming at times."
good,The company was driven by EPS.  This meant that there was  a lot of management changes and restructuring of the organization.  During my tenure at the company there were approximately 5 different CEOs.
good,The position Customer Service Engineer is really a job for those interested working in the field. It's a very tiring job wherein you must go from one place to another in which you must fulfil customer's expectations.
good,"A typical day at work would be to first evaluate calls and adjust according to time of call cam in and set as priority. Then drive to each site to resolve atm issues as needed. I've learned how to service atms and cash dispenser through training and on the job. I've also learned how to configure tcp/ip settings to connect atms to the network. How to create a back-up copy of software to recover an atm if the software crashes. With management there really is no management. He prefers not to work as a team, has not taken the time to talk to us as a team to discuss how things work here at diebold, and making poor choices that directly affect my family life. My co-workers are great. I've built a relationship with them where if there's something that I need they would be able to assist me when needed as I assist them when I'm needed. If I have trouble on an atm I can call them for support to help resolve the issue. Overall great co-workers that I work with. The hardest part of my job is working for a manager who makes poor decisions and has no concern for family life for his employees. The most enjoyable part of my job is my fellow co-workers that I work with and when I can get off early enough to be with my family."
good,"I defined measurable and realistic project objectives and contractual milestones.  I completed project organization: sub-projects, advisory board and steering committee;  aligning Service, Operations, and Sales departments towards fulfilling the project objectives and ensuring the project success.  I also participated in the selection of  project team members, external/internal partners, and sub-contractors on a National as well as International level."
good,Lack of leadership & infrastructure has led to downfall of this once great company. Still using DB2 querries to mainframe to run the day to day business rather than investing in technology. Customers not pleased with service performance & product offerings at this time. Significant changes will be required to win back customer base & employee loyalty.
good,"New management in NH poor! Pro is you have a vehicle to use all the time. This is due to job, but also the very low pay. Unarmed position makes it very risky job."
good,150 year old company that is currently in a state of re-invention.
good,"Diebold was once a great company that anyone would be proud to work for...myself one of those. As hard times feel the economy so did they fall on Diebold. Changes were made as well as a lot of mistakes and a lot of people were let go in a desperate effort to bring the company back to where it was."
good,Productive atmosphere.
good,Rotate on call nights and weekends. Lots of traveling. Working outside in the elements.  Job was easy.  Not much room for advancement.  Pay could be better.  Working from home was nice.
good,"Again the resort and surrounding and culture of people was very pleasing , The boss was ease to talk to, who occasional in me on network technical issue through the resort site. I was able to gain some knowledge  on routers and switches."
good,To learn new thing is good for freshers.as a learning aspect is very helpful for freshers.Seniors are very cooperative with task as well as supportive nature.
good,"Management style is to degrade, demean and keep any creativity to a minimum. Neopotism is rampant, and to be recognized for a great job is rare. I went to HR, after going to 5 EAP sessions, to find out just how demeaning culture it was. They would use trees (like maybe 3 o4 ) to represent teams. Then everyones name was on a leaf on the tree. If you received an error, your leaf came off the tree, and went down to the bottom. It was like kindergarten."
good,"Team and customers are good. Work/life balance is satisfactory, but unstable company due to company merger."
good,Travail agréable très bonne formation très respectueux des règle d'hygiène et de travail
good,Boa empresa porém apenas contrata temporariamente e não está economicamente estável no brasil.
good,"I love that I was learning new task putting info into the ATM machine. Also printing labels/logos, Entered instructional info into computer to produce labels"
good,The company was a good place to work but the management made it hard when they didn't trust any of the employees & shows favoritism to employees that don't work as hard as the rest of the team. We did like being able to schedule our own appointments with customers.
good,"i was taking of material pickup and arranging the same to dispatch for the required project managers."
good,"Typical day at work"
good,Uma empresa onde aprendi muito muito companherismo entre os colega de trabalho
good,"Project Management, Compliance, SAP operation, Operation, Liasioning, customer relation Management. Outsourcing, Finance & coordination with external team"
good,"Work culture is good but no job security. Once business drops down, management simply starts removing staff. Nothing much new learing, coz I was already experienced and seen corporate culture. Company *management) hardly thinks on cost of highly paid HOD / SENIORS but instead targeting mid-level staff ."
good,"Apesar de ser uma empresa agradável de se trabalhar porém peca por não premiar os colaboradores que se destacam com promoções ou com subsídios, você entra em uma função e saí na mesma função, não há um reconhecimento por meritocracia."
good,"Durante os dias na empresa o trabalho era versátil e diversificado diante do grande numero de equipamentos, os lideres diretos foram fantásticos apesar da falta de comunicação interna e a instabilidade de rondava nos últimos dias. A cultura de promoção era precária contudo a empresa em si era muito boa, uma empresa onde fiquei prox. a 17 anos com expectativas de nela me aposentar."
good,"Diebold was a very promising company when they first hired me. My boss at the time, sound as he had a great plan and was completely interested in customer satisfaction but not at the expense employee humiliation. They fired him because he stood up for his crew and replaced him with people that were fired from their competition. They ran the company just like the company they came from, created an atmosphere of mistrust and division. "
good,"High volume work day, job was different every day.  Co-workers were great and worked in a real team environment, but job security was a concern"
good,"Ótima empresa,porém não há certeza de trabalho efetivo."
good,"The work/life balance was awful. When I began forced medical leave, I was covering 120 hours a week, 7 days a week for 3 weeks. While also being on emergency call overnight, so essentially working 24 hours for 21 days straight. A 2 man team was good enough for Diebold, which meant 12 on and 2 off for months at a time. Most said Diebold was not a job, it was a lifestyle. However, the benefits were quite abundant, if not adequate. Double time available, health, disability and life insurance at good rates. Bottom line, I was not too unhappy when I found out my position had been eliminated due to overstaffing. (See the beginning of this to really appreciate the irony.)"
good,I am part of great PMO team that enjoys working with each other.
good,"to much micro management, bad management, not enough name value"
good,"As a past remote technician for Diebold, I have to say they put a few bucks into you but the turn out is you work around the clock, even if you are home and off the clock. Theres no down time. Management, at least in the location I was in was completely unorganized. Training was slow but yet I was placed in positions I could not work. "
good,This job is very fast paced. You are moving alot and will be doing a lot of driving.
good,"Overall: Company is moving in the right direction but I feel as if they still lack the infrastructure and processes to move as fast as they would like. A lot of opportunity for advancement as the company grows and is starting to fill some of the holes they lost during mass layoff and voluntary retirement in the past few years. I think the CEO has a great vision I just hope that the rest of his inherited senior staff can follow through. "
good,"The moral is low, not a fun place to work, there are no raises, the work load is to big for the amount of people working, hard to move up in the company"
good,"Productive and fun workplace with ping pong table."
good,"working on ATMs for banks in souther Ca, by driving to the site and call the network"
good,"Every day is working day, 24*7 service hour. Much more strong communication need between co-workers.  Followup is need to be strong to avoid escalation on higher end."
good,"Durante mi paso por esta empresa aprendí mucho, acerca de la seguridad electronica y el manejo de clientes, asi como el levantamiento de datos para cotizaciones."
good,"They created an enviroment that everyone is afraid for their jobs, Managing for the stock holders adn the hell with the employees"
good,The people at Diebold are all great people for the most part but in many cases management stifles creativity and engagement by front line workers.  They are trying to make changes to this culture but it has been very slow.  Some areas are more successful than others in listening to their people and allowing them to make their own decisions.
good,work from home.
good,Work day is at least 8 hours.
good,Company works all but its management to death. Management is a
good,"Worked for company for almost 7 years, promoted once to team lead, but was overlooked for future promotions that I was HIGHLY qualified for, all while outsiders were hired. Very disappointing."
good,"Was a great company to work for as Wincor-Nixdorf but following take over by Diebold became less personal and very competitive internally rather than collaborative.Real shame as the colleagues I once worked with were amazing (now mostly moved on too). Basin American attitude seems to revolve decision making around the ability to make money with little respect for the people that build the company, its employees."
good,Meh.  There were good days and bad days.  Mostly bad.  The systems don't work and managers are made managers because of who they know rather than based on their skills.
good,"Diebold is a great place to work. The opportunity for lots of overtime is available. However if you chose so, there will not be much time left for a personal life."
good,My manager never talked to me at all and the whole comepany moved very slow. Didn't care much for the job I never had work to do or anything most of the day I just sat around.
good,"Good company, poor management, some  teams member are like  a snake in the grass, just to move up in the company. some tech just nose around, looking other tech to screw up, just to report them, instead of help them with the issue."
good,"Too much change and it has not been stabilized.  Difficult to focus on customers with constant divestitures, mergers and acquisitions.  Management changes all the time."
good,We can learn a lot about the culture and how the chinesse works.
good,Diebold Nixdorf Philippines has a productive and fun workplace. Friendly workmates/staff that will help you develop your personal and professional skills.
good,"At first Diebold was a good company to work for, but as time went out, I found out the company was very political.  If you weren't a manager or above, the company did not take the time to recognize you."
good,"It was a very positive experience I learned a lot of things. I learned how to install security systems such as cameras and door alarms and contacts. I learned how to deal with many personalities, to get the job done. The most enjoyable part of the job meeting some great people who showed me the ropes of the job. For the most part I enjoyed working with my co-workers and my time with Diebold. "
good,I'm working with a team of true knowledgeable professionals that assist and are available for any problems that may occur during the working period.The hardest part of the job is dealing with security issues while performing my duties.
good,Management lacking in the ability to lead. They overload the hard working employees while the others just skate by. Expect results without the proper authority or tools to complete task assigned. Bully mentality. Production top priority with no concern with he quality of product being produced.
good,Was contracted from the Cooperative Group and then from then on seemed to work twice as hard and get half as much done. Had pressure from my immediate boss to do overtime at weekends which I did not want to do as we already worked 1 weekend in 3 with 2 days off in the week. He kept pressuring me and eventually I handed in my notice.
good,Half in office and half out on site dealing with a good group of people. I have learnt a number of different skills and gained a CSCS certification. Friendly and helpful group of work colleagues.
good,"Diebold is in an ongoing evolution which is both exciting and very challenging.  There are many opportunities for learning and growth here.  There are also regular shifts in strategic direction and management, which can be very frustrating."
good,"Diebold was an interesting place to work. At times I found it to be rewarding and I developed relationships with my customers and coworkers. As time went by it became much more stressful, which caused me to be looking over my shoulder at times."
good,"Llegar a la oficina, preguntar a los administrativos que averías te toca cubrir y cual es el problema del aviso para saber la posible avería para posteriormente salir hacia el destino."
good,Very good work environment with cultural rules for deplometic creation activity. Good to think about new customer satisfaction procedure. But not well for hired staffs for providing all work environment .
good,"DIEBOLD is a good Company to learn many things. Work timing was 24*7*365 days."
good,"muita cobrança,pressão psicológica, e nada de valorização pessoal."
good,"The best the position offered me was a chance to learn and develop network troubleshooting skills (and I want more).  Because they are closing / relocating network facilities, opportunities are very limited."
good,"When I started with the company I loved it, but as I stayed longer I saw the other side.  The company at least in my area has horrible management, there is no real chance at making good money, and people who start after you will make more money.  There hasn't been raises in over 4 years."
good,"Diebold-OLTP is a company that has an atypical structure to others institutions which have worked previously, which in certain times to complexity the communication between manager. My daily activities required to analyze financial data of department in order to build reports on possible scenarios occur and offer solution how solved. The working environment was highly professional or approach to excellence."
good,"Perform trouble shooting via detailed analysis of HW and SW failures with the usage of all available diagnostic tools. This includes repair of HW on component level, cleaning and adjustment of mechanical components and configuration and installation of SW. "
good,"muita correria onde deslocamentos são constantes e necessário, tendo um desgaste físico ao termino do dia muito grande, principal mante nas grandes viagens para cidades do estado."
good,"Hectisch maar leuk bedrijf"
good,"Empresa boa para se trabalhar, mas bastante exigente e rigorosa em algumas situações!"
good,"Empresa muito boa para desafios, apesar de necessitar de reestruturação organizacional e mudança de cultura."
good,A typical day at work you are pretty much overwhelmed with the workload that they give to you. Very hard to advance within the company.
good,Learned something new everyday.  Allowed to work without direct supervision. 
good,trabajo en campo desagradable no tener hora de ingreso o de salida  de administracion poco responsable
good,"Decent company to work for, noy bad, but not great. Some layoffs, so always nervous about that."
good,"Diebold has a decent work place, it is very fast paced, nice people for the most part."
good,"muito boa de se trabalhar,mas precisa melhorar no processo de enxergar os talentos que tem entre seus colaboradores."
good,"Each day, begins with a reivew of the escalations, incomplete or deferred service calls that are a priority for the day. Schedule the technicians for the special projects and on the street coverage. Next, review the customer billing reports and daily financials for the team. Review and reply to all emails. Meeting with business team members for daily conference update. Alert the team of current status toward internal and external monthly goals. Meet a technician in the field for ongoing coaching and customer visit along with review update of performance and areas of improvement. Evenings were filled with more emails and being on call for any escalations, by customers or internal co-workers."
good,"Long hours, poor management, excellent equipment, excellent peers to work with."
good,"Diebold Thane is not that great to work."
good,Das Unternehmen wird zusehends komplett nach amerikanischen Stil geführt.
good,"Empresa possui bons benefícios, porém, peca na elaboração de um plano de carreira."
good,A busy and productive environment. The role is very varied liaising with multiple companies and contacts each day.  It's a great feeling to be in a partner environment with the customer.
good,"Diebold has been stuck in a rut for years.  Recent domestic and foreign competition has forced it to cut out a bloated infrastructure.  It still has the problem of hiring CEO's that place next quarters earnings over the companies overall prospects.  "
good,"DN has been my home for many years and has offered me the flexibility to work as a female professional, and take care of my family as needed. I am forever grateful for the opportunities I have had here."
good,working at diebold it s not a bad job the way we work its not right doing three a nd for jobs i think we sounld get paid more they what theypay use cut out 401k. they more you aruond all the time from job to job then when you make amistak they write you up.they hire al these temps keep them there for for long time then they get rid of them when we need the help.
good,Throughout the years I experienced many different trials  and tribulations.  I have learned a lot but also felt it lagged in training when entering new roles.
good,"Contract position paid by the job and not by the hour or salaried. Mileage paid for use of personal car. Ample training with few permanent positions available. By the time I was offered a full time permanent position, I had accepted a position with NCR."
good,It would have been better there if I wasn't just a temp when I got in. they had to let me go because there just wasn't enough work there for me to actually do.
good,"They over hire the area and then lay off. We work comes back they don't call for you to come back. They hire again then it repeats and repeats.  Get truck, phone and laptop. FUN work and customers nice. Co-workers nice and great to get along with as well. Just horrible at retaining work in the area."
good,The people were friendly and respectable. The production was timed. Had to be very precise and  accurate measuring components. The work was redundant but a learning experience.
good,"Politics is considerably high. Management needs to improve. Work culture needs big reforms."
good,To much uncertainty in the company and culture. Seen a lot of good people leave the company and more changes are in the works. The company has great potential
good,The local management team is second to none!  The company however has been in a bad position for the last 5 years.  Multiple sweeping changes to the upper management team and their direction has created issues with our most loyal customers.  We are constantly in recovery mode trying to fix the blunders made by previous management.  Pay does not reflect current cost of living standards.  Work weeks can be hectic.  If not for my current manager I would be well below the pay grade I am now.  Once Diebold finally finds a CEO that is a keeper and not overly concerned with fulfilling his own agenda I think it will get back to the service and employee focused organization it was when I first started years ago.
good,did not really care for the fact that you had to work for there own temp service in order to be even considered for a position.And the fact that the job I was doing just stopped at the end of the year.
good,Enjoyed the job. Low stress position for workload. Fostered great relationships.  Always  concerned when the next layoff was going to happen and if it was going to be your group.
good,"I worked there over 10 years ago so don't feel comfortable reviewing.At the time, I don't feel the company understood our customer niche (college and university) and tried to mold us to the banking industry, which just didn't work."
good,"Diebold is a very diverse workplace as they are a global company that work with regions all around the globe. This can make for a challenging, yet exciting work day as you have many time zone to contend with when working with each other."
good,"Good for freshers or Managerial positions."
good,As a co-op got plenty of opportunity for work.Work atmosphere was friendly though was not there long enough to give a good review one way or the other.
good,"Uma boa empresa, voltada a tecnologia bancária."
good,"Pros: Decent salary, decent salary hike, sometimes less work"
good,"Una buena empresa, lo malo son los bajos salarios en comparación con la competencia."
good,"Muy buen ambiente de trabajo, únicamente no tenían muy buena administración"
good,"Ich arbeite in dieser Firma im Callcenter, wir supporten die Leergutautomaten,die diese Firma herstellt. D.h. die Kunden rufen bei uns in der Hotline an und geben ihre Fehlermeldungen ab, welche wir dann telefonisch bzw remote zu lösen versuchen und einen Techniker zum Teiletausch rausschicken. Dabei hilft uns ein Fehlerbaum,in dem die gängigsten Fehler enthalten sind und durch den man den Anrufer quasi ""hindurchführt"", um eine Lösung zu finden. "
good,"Diverse work enviroment that almost never starts off in the same location.  The San Diego team was great, the communication among the team was professional and coworkers were generally willing to help out if needed.  Management was solid, but at times overwhelmed due to being understaffed.  The job perks were great with the company car, gas card, and freedom to do your job with minimal supervision.  Good company to work for overall, would recommend."
good,"Run service calls during the day and learn quite a bit about electro-mechanical systems along with physical and electronic security products. You receive training which is good for advancement but what advancement? Cannot get a raise in this company anymore, its all year end bonus based of performance. Meanwhile the CEOs and higher ups get million dollar bonuses every quarter. Its a good job to start out in and I'm sure it used to be great. Now it is not somewhere to advance in. Also your personal life gets put on the back burner if you are a remote technician; 7 day on call for your area gets really old fast. Have to compete for time off with veteran technicians who have 6 weeks of vacation time saved up. "
good,"I have been a field technician with Diebold for 8 years.  Three years ago, it seems they stopped giving raises to field technicians and layoffs began.  Having taken every opportunity to advance my career, either internal courses or receiving my college degree, there has been no place to advance.  Would love to move into the management role, but since I have been with the company, I have seen the business team's ""restructured"" and managers pretty much get an ultimatum of taking an early retirement or risk the possibility of a layoff down the road.  "
good,"The company has been in a constant state of change for the past few years. My perspective of a typical day pertains only to the field offices. The service teams (technicians, project managers, service managers and installers) have very heavy work loads. These areas provide job security and advancement."
good,"I liked my work - not the salary, as there was no recognition, that I did my job in 3 languages. I shall miss my colleagues. We really all worked well together."
good,"I travel most of the week. I have learned to use Sales Force."
good,"Company is attempting to change culture with changing market."
good,It provided a paycheck every two weeks. Was your typical break/fix company.
good,"Imediate stress,trying to manage your calls,running histories, answering & making phone calls, sending email & text messages. Setting up vendor meets,getting to the site to service the atm fault. Completing and closing the call in a 2 hour time limit. Repeating the same procedure until my shift ended."
good,"There was much to learn and a lot of processes that are helpful as you move on to other careers.  As a ""middle"" manager the workload was ridiculous.  You could never get caught up.  Not a good job for a family.  Vacations and days off were impossible to enjoy, there is always a crisis somewhere."
good,"I learn how to work in Pressure Situation."
good,"I am currently employed through a staff agency as a temporary employee for Wincor Nixdorf, however, I have been with the company almost for 4 years.  We were recently told that our jobs are being outsourced to a company in Mexico and we will no longer be employed as of June 1st."
good,Traditional workplace environment.  Company 100+ years old.
good,"Handled Axis Bank 700 Atms For Cash Takeovers, Monitoring, Forecasting And Preparing Cash Indents & Currently Handling 600 Atms for Cash Takeovers, Monitoring, Forecasting And Preparing Cash Indents for State Bank Of India."
good,Diebold seemed like a great company to work for and I still think it would be. The co-workers are great and the project mangement teams are helpful when I request missing information for terminals and banks im working with. I have met some brilliant minds here but it is unfortunate that most of those brilliant minds are not in the positions they need to be in. With the recent layoffs and downsizing to the company really makes me question why I am here. And the Chances of getting Hired in seems to be based off who your best buddy is and not on performance or work that you do.
good,Troubleshoot customer DVR or IP camera issues. Load and test sofware
good,"Extremely High paced work environment - Overtime was a daily event to make sure to get the time sensitive tasks completed."
good,My day started with logging on to my laptop and downloading the service calls for the day and setting up priorities. I ran the calls in the order and then did shipping and paperwork. I learned about all diebold bank equipment. Management was constantly changing. My co-workers were great. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the changing rules and regulations. The enjoyable part of the job was the freedom and the medical benefits. 
good,Hard to get unbaised reviews or pertinent information. Will withhold information until can be used to their advantage. No reward for loyalty.
good,Nothing amazing but nothing terrible. It really depends on which one of your 9 bosses you have to deal with.
good,This company typically runs very lean causing staff to be overworked. The compensation is decent however the work life balance is not good.
good,Many great professional but leadership consistent direction is lacking
good,"Das Kollegium hält die Firma zusammen, die Kommunikation untereinander funktioniert. Von den meisten Prozessen und der Kommunikation mit dem US Management kann man dies nicht unbedingt sagen. Hier wird man doch das ein oder andere Mal vor Herausforderungen gestellt."
good,"Management is good."
good,Travail agréable malgré tout. L'équipe est très sympa.
good,"I only worked here for 3.5 weeks"
good,"I do a daily conference call (team lead) to go over important daily task. I log into our system and determine which customer site I will be servicing first. I trouble shoot and repair banking equipment, hospital equipment, PC repairs, manage my vehicle inventory.  I make sure my team (12 member) is being productive, while providing support to team members, customers."
good,"I maintain, troubleshoot and repair banking equipment to include automatic teller machines, drive up drawers, pneumatic tube systems.  Maintain and order parts on a daily basis."
good,"Worked as a contractor. Excellent manager in finance.  Workload varies by day and employees are nice.  If you work here as a contractor, you have some flexibility"
good,"Do work until finish,if not you in big trouble. Minimum supervision by manager but always stress by person that give you job. Always in hurry to clear their job without thinking site situation. Very difficultist if working on weekend or public,not enough specialist to backup for Malaysia.You need to survive yourself. Company rule always change,  one engineer for all jobs."
good,"Chaotische Planung der Touren man könnte viele Fahrwege sparen , Kollege aus Augsburg bekommt Auftrag in München und Münchner bekommen Aufträge in Augsburg"
good,"Pessoal competente e agradavel de se conviver.Empresa competente no Mercado ,com profissionais de alto nivel profissional."
good,Their benefits are decent.  They are a large company that should have room for advancement and encourage on the job training. Their acquisition with Nixdorf appears to be sucessful
good,"A lot of time spent on the road as field service."
good,"Monitor alarms and take phone calls from ATM technicians across the country. Dispatch police, fire, FBI and medical assistance as needed per alarm response. "
good,Working here has improved my technical skills a lot. We usually work long hours but I don't really mind it because I enjoy what I am doing. The stress does not come from my work itself but from external factors such salary/benefits package.
good,good company.  changed many times while I was there.  Got laid off/rehired and laid off.  which was confusing and potential rehire after last layoff as a contractor
good,I started working at Diebold as a support engineer and learnt very quickly how some short sighted decisions made by higher level leaders could result in hollowing out of core capabilities.
good,"In recent years, continual restructuring and workload efficiencies not realized, as promised. Work-life balance can be a challenge based on demands and many roles continue to expand past a reasonable span of control."
good,Not for everybody but my 18 years here has been enjoyable. It's fast and have to be able to quickly adapt to the changes in your work day. Multi-tasking is a must here.
good,Constant organizational change. Stock price is an indicator of current state.  Turn over at all levels.  Job description did not match what was discussed in interview
good,Chưa được phát triển bản thân . Chế độ và chính sách ngày càng đi xuống.
good,Excellent opportunities to advance if you're willing to go the extra mile.  Excellent opportunity for overtime if willing to train in different areas and cross train.
good,Houve uma grande restruturação na gerencia nacional
good,Time to through the motions again.  I just want to move on from this stuff.  Please stop this and just allow me to use your service?  this is unbelievable!
good,"Challenging job scope."
good,Empresa do ramo da tecnologia muito sólida que vem passando por um difícil processo de transformação e recolocação no mercado.
good,overwhelming at time but always stressful
good,"Uma boa empresa para investir no funcionário. "
good,I like what I am doing but it is mentally challenging and is geared more for a younger or single person due to the fact that you are on a on call rotation every week and have to work a ton of overtime.
good,Typical day was answering phone calls and assisting internal employees with IT issues. Collaborating with other team members to help better our online solutions.
good,Company experienced a lot of financial problems causing a lot of internal restructure and employee layoffs. The internal management structure was too much of a layer causing delays in good decisions.
good,This company helps you obtain a good skill set but pays employees poorly. Other company's offer about 15-20k more a year. If this company paid better it would be a great job.
good,"A company with more than 150 years, with a large market share in Americas. International Presence Diebold Nixdorf is an American financial self-service, security and services corporationengaged primarily in the sale, manufacture, installation and service of self-service transaction"
good,like any place lots of people lots of personalities. it would be up to someone to figure out the work environment for themselves. i have no insight for this company.
good,"Managed the sub- contract for Diebold. Upgraded ATMs by loading new software , replacing monitor and key pads and along with installing security systems."
good,This is one employer that took prior experience into account and promoted advancement within its organization.  Travel and training was an opportunity that was highly shared
good,"Good work-life balance and salary and other benefits."
good,Good people work here.  It's a decent place to work.  Educational benefits are generous.   Lots of things going on and sometimes its hard to keep up with the changes.
good,Job is a good job since I haven't graduated collage yet but would much rather have room to move up in a company and not have to stay in the same position  forever.
good,normal day at work would be as with any other employer. Flexible work schedule was a definite plus and decent benefits.  Different company since the merger and significant changes have resulted.
good,"Culture and overall experience has regressed over the years."
good,"Diebold is a rapidly changing company. Since acquiring Wincor Nixdorf out of Germany, there have been many changes and a lot of restructuring. Workplace culture is fast-paced and numbers-focused.  The hardest part of the job were the many additional evening and weekend hours that were needed to keep up with job demands. The most enjoyable part of the job was definitely interacting with customers."
good,was a very fun company   to work  at with plenty of flexibility and freedom must be able to work with minimal supervision a complete minor repairs to atm machines
good,fast paced--multitasking is necessary--must have good customer service skill and telephone etiquette--must have computer skills and the ability to learn new software programs
good,This was temporary seasonal work but was very informative and I acquired new skills and networked with great people. The hire seasonal workers in the last quarter of every year to complete their workload.
good,j'ai eu la chance d'avoir un bon manager qui m'a permis de faire un sacré gap au niveau de l'expérience professionnelle
good,"The company has tons of good benefits and pros. I love never seeing my boss and being out on the road all alone, but management essentially hates doing their job. Ask them to do anything and you are no longer on the good list. People are need to be fired, remain as dead weight while the rest of us receive emails with blanket threats not really directed at us"
good,was always somthing new in training. working with multiple screens wasnt tricky. just all the extra moving around because they were moving offices down the street.
good,"This is a very good company, with a good reputation. But the recent acquisition has really put that into question. Many good, talented people have been laid off recently. The reputation around Diebold is quickly changing."
good,Diebold is a150+ year old company changing its ways to fit  the needs of today's bank and pressing towards future innovations.
good,"Great company to work for if you like a challenging environment and the opportunity to see something new day to day.

good,"Working in Diebold, you do not have to worry about being late to company as there is flexible working hours."

good,The company provides required training for the specific tasks.  It is a good company for the beginners in SAP application.

good,"Empresa Dinâmica e agradável de trabalhar. Valoriza os funcionários, dá condições de trabalho adequadas."
good,"Good job wise, management likes to control everything even though it could be better if they left a tech alone to complete items their requirements."
good,"Stable company with many years of operation.  Looking to grow into new markets yet not fully supporting the infrastructure required to grow into this very competitive retail space,  High turnover in our sales team several members have left over the course of my employment."
good,Was able to work and increase areas of knowledge by moving to various organization within the company.  The last position was within corporate accounting.
good,It was a job to keep me close to home.  The job did not require too much trouble shooting skills.  Communication skills were essential.

good,The people at work are helpful and we learn from one another.
good,"Siendo una empresa con valor internacional, descuida las operaciones de niveles inferiores (almacén) en lo personal, cumpli con todos los requerimientos y obligaciones asignadas"
good,I enjoyed working for Diebold but it was going through a national reorganization and I was given very little notice of my position elimination.  I made a valiant effort to take on additional branch office responsibilities and was appreciated for my efforts.
good,A variety of equipment to work on always made things interesting. Being on call was not so much fun. Decent money.
good,Was the same thing everyday for as long as I been there.My co-worker was good manage was good.They showed me ho to do machines it james quite few time but I finally got the machine working.Was seeing my co- workers I worked with.They was nice.They just did not pay enough money.

good,"A global leader in providing integrated self service, security systems and services.  Annual company revenues of $3.2B, employing 17,000 associates in 90 countries, and ranked number 665 in the Fortune 1000."
good,"Individuals are not self-motivated and are unfortunately always looking over their shoulder to see if they will be the next one to be laid off.  There are great people here, but the best ones continue to leave for better/more stable/higher paying jobs.  The toughest part of the job is working with an increasingly global (Indian) workforce as the company looks for every opportunity to squeeze the last penny out of operational costs.  The most enjoyable part of the job has been the opportunities to travel and to learn about how corporations are run - both well and poorly."
good,customers were great. manager was good at letting me self direct myself. training was a little to be desired. was sent out on jobs without all instructions or training to complete job. stressful job spent alot of time away from home but on the good part was home for weekends.
good,"Empresa do ramo de tecnologia , de grande porte.Fazia um trabalho para o banco ITAU."
good,Transitioned from hardware to software and learn that side of the business.  Problem was I was allowed to build a dead end career and not offered and chance to expand my talents.
good,11 plus years of banking experience in retail and opeartions...
good,My day at work is usually divided in two parts.
good,lo bueno de este trabajo es que siempre ando en la calle ya que soy un tecnino de campo . y se aprende mucho ya que trabajo con cajeros automaticos y se puede saber muy bien cuales son ls fallas que presentan estos equipos .
good,Began a test equipment department with three others in a small office building over a bank in down town Canton. Job was to design test fixtures and write software for testing circuit boards for prototype ATMs the first ones.
good,"Established company with strong history. Atmosphere is professional, yet relaxed. Revenue has been tied to the financial sector which has caused some cutbacks in recent years. There have been a lot of executive management changes which creates additional stress and uncertainty. Multiple reorganizations have created a lot of confusion."
good,"a typical day is different every day, sometimes starting early in the morning and ending very late in the evening, as I cover a wide-range of time zones for this position. I learned a lot about working with all different types of people,personalities, customers, management and ever-changing procedures and policies. The hardest part of the job is often the work hours, as a typical day can vary from 8 hours to 14 hours and sometimes more. The most enjoyable part is working with all different types of people from other states and time zones."
good,Temporary position but enjoyed the work and co-workers. The assignment was fulfilling.
good,My Experice taught me How to build a Good Customer Relation.
good,"Traveled throughout the Houston area repairing and maintaining banking industry equipment including: alarms, ATMs, cameras, locks and safes, modems and routers, and provided secure access to multiple third party vendors."

good,"Not much room for grownth if your not located in ohio, bad holiday hours, 16 hr shifts, micro management, salary way below cost of living margin, while handling cash daily."
good,"Empresa com boa indicação para inicio de carreira, para funcionarios, precisa melhorar no tratamento de terceiros. Porém, fornece boa estabilidade, cultura organizacional e probabilidade de crescimento."
good,"Not an extremely difficult job, however the scheduling is horrible."
good,"it was a good place to work before the merger. Diebold management needs to be driving instead of the Wincor management. Diebold attained Wincor however most of the changes during the merger were backward steps for Diebold including databases, hardware, software, & personnel"
good,"I loved the job, and my managers were great, but the managers above them were out of touch with what it was like to work with the customers, and what was important on a day to day basis. Their management was based strictly on numbers that only exist under perfect conditions. It was unrealistic.  That being said I would recommend them, overall it was a descent company to work for"
good,It's been a few years but when I interned at Diebold there were a few rounds of mass layoffs. Everyone was very stressed as after the layoffs we were expected to produce the same amount of work.
good,Diverse company. Very unorganized. Use you and then outsource the job. Management works you hard to reach deadlines with no reward if your not a permanent employee.
good,"Wincor Nixdor, actual Diebold Nixdorf es una multinacional con muchos años a sus espaldas, saben trabajar muy bien con viejos recursos y métodos desfasados, el equipo tiene una habilidad especial para enfrentarse a los problemas actuales con soluciones del pasado, es un gran equipo de personas con herramientas que dejan mucho que desear."
good,Nice environment but not opportunity to grow. Very clean and safe place but they hire a lot of temporary resources and hardly hire permanent employees.
good,"Diebold Nixdorf is een internationaal bedrijf gevestigd wereldwijd met als hoofdtaak onderhoud, repareren van geldautomaten."
good,This company needs to figure out what it wants to be when it grows up.  Paid a very high price to acquire German competitor and I do not believe that they will be able to integrate the businesses effectively enough to make it worth the price.  3 major changes in top management in less than 15 years.  No clear direction from the top of what the key strategies for growth will be.
good,busy job lots of travel and many calls to do. freedom of travel as a remote tech with no supervision and tech support was very good when needed  on site .
good,ambiente bom de se trabalhar porem algumas informações são desencontradas por parte da supervisão podendo melhorar em alguns aspectos mais no geral ótima empresa bom relacionamento com colegas
good,Typical day was starting from home.  Your home was basically your office.  Waited for calls to come in and managed your own calls.  My area manager was decent because he only bothered you when he needed to.  Co-workers were fun to work with.  We tried to help each other whenever needed.  Hardest part of the job was having to deal with personal safety.  We serviced ATM's which was exposed to public.  Most enjoyable of the job was seeing customers happy and also seeing our products work properly.
good,They have good pay for contractors. Getting hired in and feeling like your apart of the company is important and as I contractor I definitely didn't feel like I was apart of the team.
good,la empresa es buenas mis funciones eran muy básicas y no tenia crecimeinto
good,Good learning in Diebold since when i had Joined. Got many oppertunities to show my talent. Lack of Good Process in the System.
good,The Work was great. Upper management was terrible. I really enjoyed working with my co-workers. Great bunch of guys. Hard workers. Middle management was OK but upper management keep things from being done efficiently.
good,Excellent company to develop and expert job skills.  Agency has vast contracts for job security.  Typical day?  There is not a typical day.  Everyday is different and a new challenge.
good,Diebold has been around for over 150 years.  I'm just not interested in the direction the company is going and would like to enter a new company with new challenges in the data center field.
good,I work for and with a lot of great people that are intelligent and hard working.  I like this kind of environment.  I enjoy challenges and this job provides plenty.
good,"*días típicos muy activos ya que se trabajaba en la calle."
good,"Each day was a challenge meeting the internal and external customer demands.  Prioritizing duties was most important.  Management was very supportive and the mutual respect among co-workers a plus.  The most difficult part of the job was never having a moment to breathe and feeling the pressures of deadlines.  The most enjoyable and fulfilling part of the job was at the end of the day, that the customer was satisfied.  Customer satisfaction was key, but in order to get to that point, the internal customers needed to be on one page.  Overall, a good company to work for."
good,I enjoyed my stay here just wasnt long enough there for explore my possibilities for advancement
good,"Diebold is flexible when it comes to operating from remote work locations.  I worked with many bright, intelligent and innovative people who came from the specific industries in which Diebold serves. Diebold's biggest weakness are the internal silos, which stunts innovation and service.  Its culture of longevity seems to prevent it from moving forward.  The good news is that Diebold's new leadership knows this and is working hard to change the structure and culture."
good,"My compensation is terrible for the amount of work that I am expected to produce. I also live in fear that at any moment the office may be closed and I will be without work. Diebold, Inc., is not a company that cares for it's lower tier employees. Top executives are all that really matter."
good,drove to sites and preformed maitenance on atms. replaced and returned parts as needed.
good,produção avaliação de falhas e defeitos com otimo ambiente de trabalho
good,salaire nécessite une revision et le personnelle est correct
good,"Diebold Nixdorf is going downhill, no annual raises, stopped 401k matching and very little job advancement. Management doesn't bother you as long as you do your work. You're pretty much on your own and have to coordinate with other techs in the area."
good,Its a great place to work. I was able to learn customer service skills along with gaining call center experience. I was able to have a flexible schedule so that I could attend school .
good,Pay is horrible but the people you work with are amazing. Benefits are also great. Hours can be long. Management can be difficult with micromanagement.
good,"I worked from home with the closest employee 200+ miles away. My manager was 500+ miles away. The system for checking on order status and ordering parts, was extremely difficult to manage and support was through my co-workers who were too busy to provide assistance. Management decided to eliminate the majority of sales positions therefore relying on subcontractors who didn't always understand the installation process and the labor and miscellaneous materials portion of the customers quote was insufficient which leads to dissatisfied sales staff, customers and contractor and stress for me."
good,Technicians aren't being taking care of or appreciated. The company morale has gone down. The a lot of techs haven't received an increase in pay in some cases more than 2yrs and it's not enough when they do increase.
good,a good place to work for a start to get some training. no room for progress. you can stay there for the rest of your life being service tech and no one would appreciate it.
good,good management team always looking out for their employees. worked in a small cell team environment with good collaboration for improving the local business
good,Some days better than others.  Can be stressful when on family due to weekend on call.  Seemed slow to hire replacement bodies.  Benefits were good and stock buy in was a good bonus.
good,"First thing in the morning going through many emails to respond as needed, clearing out all questions in billing Siebel system so completed calls could be processed for payment. Answering questions to the field about billable or non-billable calls and supporting account team and field services, technicians."
good,it is a place you work hard and hope to get aheadAs a tech you only have so much room to move up or move out. It is a place to get a job and a paycheck.
good,"Diebold Nixdorf is currently in a transformative state after having acquired Wincor Nixdorf. Days can be busy or slow depending on the  area you work (metro vs. rural). Technicians work in self-managed teams and have the opportunity to collaborate well as long as everyone on the team is committed. Upper management can often be  disconnected and far removed from actual service operations at a ground level. Recent migration to Oracle has created some operational chaos for the company. Overall, Diebold Nixdorf is a good company to work for if you apply yourself and work well as part of a team."
good,"Banking service division. Monitoring ATM / CDM nationwide and assigned FE to rectify machine problem. Handling customer (bankers), reporting and updating daily report via OCM system."
good,"No advancement in position or pay. "
good,"Good working environment, good management, salary is not satisfactory, manager and staff is very good, motivational events year, every friday games for staff member, free passes for good employees"
good,It is good workplace. Good management and recently acquired large company Nixdorf.                                                                                                  A Collaborative environment.
good,"Es una muy buena empresa, con el único problema es que el recambio de gente es muy extremo, de esta manera la gente no trabaja muy cómoda ya que en cualquier momento es despedida. Sin aviso, lleve 1 mes o 10 años."
good,"Want to switch this job... no areas for learning more in this field.. only increment of salary     ..... no holidays even in Festivals also ..."
good,"WE are working as a leading ATM service provider in India, We learned lot of things related to ATM Operations"
good,"A typical day for a First Line tech working for Diebold starts about an hour prior to start time reviewing service calls in a queue and other team members. Arrival on site requirement time is less than two hours from when the call was generated. I've worked many hours overtime to complete service calls in my queue as well as others. Things seem to move slow with management (replies, notifications, etc). Due to the financial position of Diebold hiring, promotions, and bonuses were suspended indefinitely."
good,"I enjoy everyday at work, the most interesting thing is that you do not know what to expect on the next day, its mostly entirely dependent on the Testers."
good,very busy..alot about the environment..still will not go back there to seek employment
good,"Life at Diebold was a very exciting next step in my career. My manager was a good guy who looked out for the welfare of everyone on our team, encouraging us to work when it was time to work, and to leave work behind when we were off the clock for our own mental and physical health. Because our team was spread out over the northwest states, I only got to directly work with a couple of others on our team, and they were both Subject Matter Experts in their specializations."
good,overall a met and worked with great people and I really enjoyed my job.
good,They are an alright compnay to work for. The pay is awesome but the stress is not.
good,Great opportunity to learn and grow. Industry is prospering in the ilatile market.
good,"Great employees, Fun working environment. Good training and knowledge base."
good,I had a positive work experience at DieboldNixdorf. The work environment is relaxed and not stressful. The salary for this position is not commensurate with the skill set needed.
good,"My day is mostly meetings, 1/2 of which are scheduled without much notice.  Can't get real 'work' done during the workday due to the meetings."
good,"It's pretty chill at Diebold."
good,"good place to work. bank holidays off, good benefits. if you're a field guy its not weekdays only. could have some long days but overall no issues. they bought Wincor-Nixdorf so not sure of changes"
good,As with any company it comes down to the people you worked with.  I really had a great supporting cast of people around me and that helped me grow within the company.
good,"a typical day is everyday commute"
good,"otima, amplos beneficios incluidos treinamentos e suporte tecnico"
good,Team oriented environment due to complex sales structure.  Workplace culture was great.  Hardest part of the job was navigating the many internal systems in place.
good,"The people were great, and the training was excellent. The management team did not do a good job of being personable and communicating with employees unless there was an issue"
good,"Responsible for troubleshooting, servicing, and performing all necessary maintenance on equipment such as ATM's, alarm systems, CCTV networks, card readers and miscellaneous bank equipment for major clients like TD Bank, PNC, Bank of America and Provident at locations throughout northern New Jersey. Extremely cooperative and upfront management. Slow but definite room for growth and promotions. Team leaders not so interactive or vital in day to day operations, something that has to be worked on. hardest part of the job was the constant drive, 150+ miles a day to locations for servicing equipment."
good,"Attività di  cost reduction management, strategic purchasing, negoziazione, redazione contratti."
good,"This is a great job for a ""SINGLE"" Person. You are constantly on the road and away from home. The hours are long, but the pay is good and there is as much OT as you want. You will always be ""ON Call"" 24x7. It makes it hard for a family man to spend time with kids and spouse."
good,"manager shawn was great easy to work with and get information from for expectations in the workplace. let my team be self directed whether it was an install, training the customer, or trouble machine with multiple prob;ems he would just ask to stay in the information loop. he moved on and the new manager liked to micro manage from over 70 miles away. The company started to downsize the service department because they invested to much in their tech support my personal thought"
good,Typical day included troubleshooting downed machines and getting them back inservice ASAP. Enjoyed working with the customers and informing them on Discoveries and solutions.With downsizing the ultimate goal of outside sales was becoming obsolete
good,"Job is great, and every day is different working on ATMs. However promotions have been promised and never given. For type of work and risk to ourselves the compensation is not high enough."
good,"Here you'll get good salary but the work is the same from the day one you joined to after 1year. Apart from that we have team outings for every 3months, cultural activities, Friday fun and all. If the management likes you they are OK with whatever the mistakes you do but if they do not like you then they will throw you out even for the silly mistakes."
good,"Its very good experiences there with DN india but surely it's not safe at all in India because many places we dont have any security & you are working alone , so it's quite difficult to focus on atm issues if it's late night."
good,Empresa sobrecarrega funcionários com muitas funções
good,Expected to do a very high number of accounts and the pay did not constitute it. Also people were not  held responsible for mistakes they made while others had to clean them up.
good,Infelizmente o projeto de terceirização acabou com a empresa.
good,"Typical day at DieboldNixdorf for First Line ATM technician"
good,"Nice day work"
good,it was nice experience working with Diebold. learned lot of things & have fun while learning.
good,"ATM business is like a volcano which keep on erupting everyday. "
good,Big company Steady work  Always something new to learn.  Not all about the numbers but does allow you to grow and devolope your skills
good,Installed and Preventive Maintenance ATM machines Train Bank personal. Install computers and software also tracked inventory.Started out at 1st job in the am and completed calls all day.
good,"atendimento a campo em vários clientes diferentes como bradesco , cef, banco do brasil , itau ,lotéricas e outros onde desenvolvi habilidades tanto na área técnica como no atendimento ao cliente de um modo geral., sendo a parte mais difícil reparar eqptos vandalizados por explosão por exemplos e a parte mais agradável era instalação e atualizaçao de software, quanto aos colegas de trabalho o contato era pequeno devido o trabalho ser em campo"
good,Gostei de trabalhar na Diebold. Nos anos que fiquei lá. Salário em dia. Houve boas condições e aceitação para eu me candidatar para novos cargos. No geral foi uma boa empresa. Salario não era ruim.
good,"Al inicio los primeros años fueron buenos, tanto en ambiente como resultados y compensaciones salariales, no obstante con la última fusión el ambiente se ha enrarecido, sumado a la carga de viajes todo ello crea un ambiente complicado."
good,diebold is very nice company i learn many more thing from  this company very nice people i got but there is politics was going on there reward for any hard  working person
good,Uma empresa que foi boa até o momento em que quiseram terceirizar a empresa toda
good,"Empresa com bons beneficios para os empregados, porem esta passando por grandes mudanças estruturais que estão refletindo na qualidade de vida dos funcionarios."
good,"Every day was different filled with designing, solving problems and inventing.  The co-workers were like family and everyone got along very well.  The hardest part of the job was trying to adopt a quality system which required much more time in the schedule that was never given or anticipated for.  The most enjoyable part of the job was using team work to come up with solutions."
good,"A typical work day is driving to and completing 10-15 service calls at various locations.  Overtime is usually available due to service call request, but it is optional and rarely required.  "
good,"Empresa sem muitas oportunidades de crescimento, remuneração acima da média, bons benefícios."
good,"_Domínio nas funções dentro do prazo de solução na carga horária de trabalho."
good,"uma otina empresa Profissional dinâmico e líder, de fácil relacionamento interpessoal, capaz de trabalhar em equipe e delegar atividades, dedicado ao trabalho com assiduidade, responsabilidade, determinação."
good,Low pay for the responsibilities.  For the security clearances and the responsibilities we deal with each day the pay is too low and the turn over far to high.
good,"I have two and half years of experience in software testing field"
good,"the most enjoyable part of the job is there is never a dull moment"
good,"Not a bad place to work,  worked there twice thru a temp agency and was laid off both times, would have liked to have been hired in for full time employment"
good,"Better projects but still can accommodate many automation in terms of capturing production and utilisation. "
good,"Good experience working with this company learned a lot technically earned much knowledge related to ATMs"
good,"La capacitación técnica de la mayoría de los productos se realiza en la Ciudad de México, (cubren costos)."
good,Empresa boa de trabalhar. Aprendi muito sobre a área de Comex. Tive pessoas que permitiram compartilhar seus conhecimentos.. Infelizmente a empresa não possui um plano de carreira mas ademais gostei muito de fazer parte desta equipe.
good,Diebold has been a great starting point for me. I have been able to gain skills that will definitely help me out in my future endeavors.
good,"I worked from a remote office from the rest of my team. As a result, management often forgot to include me on possible training opportunities and only contacted me if I had not done something the way they liked (less than monthly). I spent my days mostly at my desk analyzing inventory levels and determining replenishment quantities and requested delivery dates. My contact with my co-workers was almost all through E-mail but twice a year I was able to work for a week in the main office and strengthen our relationship. So I knew who I could contact for additional information and get a quick response. I enjoyed meeting the inventory goals."
good,"I have enjoyed every moment working in this company. The staff and management share the same goals."
good,La mayoría de los días son pesados porque no hay un horario fijo de actividades.
good,A famous atm manufacture and supplier  mnc company.. I have installed a large no of atms in assam during my jobs. But in comparison to job sallary is very poor here.
good,Good place to work. Management was great. I learned a lot about customer service and how to be a good technician. normal day i would check calls for the day and plan out routes to take for best timing of service calls. Monthly meetings with manager and service team.
good,"If you are good at your work and your project is under capable Managers, you will enjoy working."
good,"I really like working here but recently have been looking elsewhere, pay, advancement not great, 2% in past 2 years. i guess it is better than having your pay frozen like teachers do? hope things improve.... the people are great, seems politcal in higher level of management"
good,Germany calls the shots for everything that needs to get done in the USA. No pay raise in 5 years and no bonus and if you do get one its a slap in the face.
good,Alguns dos seus líderes não estão preocupado com o sucesso na conclusão dos serviços.
good,Productive and challenging place to work with highly motivated and committed people where teamwork is encouraged.  A lot of cross-functional activity takes place and very good opportunities for advancement.
good,"Very good for people who want to work hard and and be reward for that."
good,It's a Big company with good labor terms and wellfare
good,"Not a bad job to get into but dynamic call volume, the pay wasn't worth going out at 11 at night to fix an ATM. All and all it wasn't worth the risk. Company car and phone were provided and could use it on personal time."
good,"Empresa ja foi muito boa de se trabalhar, devido a ma gestão anterior passa por dificuldades"
good,"Empresa con muchos desafios contables,implementacion de erps,auditorias de sunat y financieras,evaluacion de recursos humanos y del corporativo."
good,"Good for fresher"
good,I didn't work for Diebold Nixdorf France. I worked for Diebold Nixdorf North America. I understand them to be different entities under the same umbrella so to speak. I enjoyed the independent work environment and the abundance of tools and trainnig available to aid me in doing my job.
good,"Serviços programados, na área de assistência técnica, desenvolve no funcionário  o controle e logística de todos os insumos utilizados nas rotinas de manutenção, controle de sobressalentes, custos e otimização de tempo  nas rotinas de manutenção. Empresa que desperta no funcionário a capacidade de gerir conflitos e solucioná-los de forma eficaz"
good,I worked at this company for 22 years and thought I would be there until I retired.  During the combination of the two companies there were jobs that were eliminated.   I believe that this company is a good company and will rebound in time as things settle down with the merger.
good,DieboldNixdorf is a great company to work and the employees that Diebold hires are great.  It’s a company you would love to retire in this company. This  is one of the best company in the world.
good,"The Sales Department has operated with their hands tied by slow product development and poor focus on what customers really need.  Products that were introduced to clients 3 years ago, that were critical to the company, were never completed. Though the company ""vision"" was very relevant to the market, Diebold has been late with the technology they have been advertising for years and their financial mistakes allowed competition to use the poor financial condition as a selling tool. "
good,"Every day in work was a new challenge for me either by learning new things or transfer skills and knowledge to my team "
good,"Empresa boa de trabalhar mais muito instável com relação as tomadas de decisão das gerencias em relação ao bem estar dos funcionarios , pressão total para atingir metas e objetivos propostos."
good,"Diebold use to be a great place to work and still can be if you are in the right department. Indecent Handler department, previously NROC, has went down hill. The management is poor and there is little to no communication. The company hires from temp agency to save on costs and the temps are always late or calling off and never held accountable. The rules and expectations are constantly changing. You have to deal with customers escalating their tickets because the company promises ATM's will be repaired within hours of the ticket creation but we do not have enough techs to do as they promise. This company has great potential if management would be shifted and if they took input from lower employees."
good,"Nice place to make new friends and learn how to deal with the clients. Very good organization, well structured and their teaching program goes straight to the point."
good,La empresa es buena pero para surgir profecionalmente es costoso
good,"leave about 7am,multiple accounts through bay area banks.Sometimes not back home till 1-2 am,in company vehicle.Independent work ethics.long hrs,independant"
good,The  company is a good company and will train the right person for their Technicians positions. the technicians in my area are not team players and do not like to work with you. ( kind of a fin for yourself place) other areas of the country is not that way. The work is not hard but is Demanding on you work on call regaurdless of the weather or area needed.
good,Good company to work. Resource is having liberty to take up the new role and deliver which helps them to grow in career. Job security is also imp which Diebold provides.
good,diebold is a very good company to work for . the company is faie and I think it a great company to work for. and some time it the best company I every for .

I tend to worry about job security quite often though. Some managers here seem to be on the management side and less on the being a leader side. I have worked in the finance area and in R&D.

Excelente treinamento e conscientização da missão da empresa e as práticas corporativas da matriz. A gerência me pareceu sem muita autonomia da matriz para resolução de problemas específicos locais. Colegas de trabalhos dispersos e concorrentes, talvez pela falta de um trabalho de entrosamento extra profissional, que ao meu modo de ver deveria ser promovido regularmente pela empresa. A parte mais difícil do trabalho foi a falta de peças para solução de problemas, omitido pela administração local, levando a seguinte situação: 1.atendimento do cliente não resolvido, mas PRAZO da O.S. resolvido, 2. como O.S. foi resolvida, não foi registrado no sistema que o problema de verdade era a falta de peças, o que poderia ser melhor tratado pela matriz, 3. como O.S. foi fechada, mas não como falha de peças, o registro foi que o TÉCNICO não conseguiu terminar o serviço, afetando sua média de performance. A parte mais agradável do serviço foi a confiança e alegria dos clientes ao me ver chegando, pois tinham a certeza que eu resolveria o problema com rapidez, presteza e educação."

good,"Some great people, some great executive talent, decent career opportunities if you are bright and hardworking.  Also very challenging as this previously shining star chases its own tail into the future, focused on cost reduction and consolidation.  Organic growth opportunities are minimal.  Too much competition in a commoditized marketplace.  Customer satisfaction used to drive everything and profit was the natural result.  These days profit is the tail that wags the dog.  We all understand that profit is necessary for corporate survival.  But the future looks pretty bleak when that is all anyone inside the four walls seems to care about."

Techs have mixed feelings about the field.  We had a very close family oriented team.  Most of the staff are contractors, therefore the pay was great, but there are no benefits, and no holidays.  The hardest part about the job was the fact that it is a German based company.  A number of processes were implemented without touching base with the US team.  The network was slow and the systems crashed a lot.  Nothing that would cause me to not work there again if given the opportunity."

I did enjoy working with my co-workers and I did develop friendships with some of my co-workers, there was a real teamwork attitude. The hardest part of the job was trying to resolve a customers issue with regards to the service they needed or have received and sometimes the business teams were not as effective and responsive as you needed them to be. Overall I did enjoy the job in general, I enjoyed the work environment as well as working with my co-workers."

As with any company there are challenges, but for the most part, it is a very enjoyable place to work especially as it affords many opportunities to connect with internal and external customers."
good,The job is stressful in trying to get as m any installs completed per month and manage all of the different subcontractors. There isn't enough training for all of the different job duties that are placed upon you. Each installation manager is tasked with making a certain quota per month and you take a hit if the quota isn't met. It's long hours per day and it's hard to get time off.

good,"Mis compañeros de trabajo eran personas deseosas de aprender aunque con pocos conocimientos técnicos, por lo mismo muchos procesos no estaban automatizados y había una gran oportunidad de llevar a cabo algunas ideas para mejorar los mismos. Tuve la suerte de tener un jefe que nos dejaba desarrollar estas ideas, así logre implementar una macro para un mejor control de sotcks de rollos de impresión, formularios en Excel para que se identifiquen las ubicaciones de los productos de forma más rápida y para que se tenga un mejor control de los productos que salían del almacén. Lo más complicado de mi experiencia fue hacer que mis compañeros se adaptasen a usar estas herramientas ya que no tenían conocimientos en Excel, pero a la vez este reto representó la mejor parte ya que el enseñarles día a día ayudó a tener una buena relación con ellos, y sobre todo me hizo aprender a tratar con formas de pensar diferentes a la mía. Otra de las cosas que me gustó mucho fue que mi jefe constantemente nos ayudara y contara experiencias pasadas para que nosotros no caigamos en algunos errores, y cuando cometiamos alguno, nos daba ideas y la oportunidad de corregirlos, definitivamente eso me hizo crecer como trabajador y persona."

My co-workers were excellent and provided me with good insight to some of the systems we worked on.  The hardest part of the job was traveling four hours one way to get to the job then four hours back home at night.

My chain of management has changed many times in the past year as they search for the correct person to fit in the chain. My co-workers are very ethical, moral, intelligent and helpful. The hardest part of my job is getting answers within the company to questions that I may have about ""one off"" issues that happen. The most enjoyable part of my job is the freedom to be out on the road with the customers, doing business across a boardroom table and creating or finding a common solution to their everyday needs."

Through my changing roles and responsibilities, it has taught me so much about the ups and downs of being such a large and successful business.  I admired people within and outside of my team for what they could accomplish for the global company that this is.  I enjoyed my job entirely on a professional level, and then some.  I liked the mobility, the activities, and the concentration it took to be a successful employee of Diebold.  Although there were transitions throughout my tenure, that tended to make things harder personally, it remained a high-standing company in my books.

Esto hacía que agendar una videoconferencia o una reunión con varias personas que se encontraban al otro lado del globo resultase harto complicado (por ejemplo, una conference call entre alguien en España, mi jefe en EE.UU. y otra persona en Singapur). El día a día consistía en atender la oficina de mi jefe (correo, llamadas, etc. y gestionarlos o desviarlo convenientemente)."

The team in our area had different experience with different products such as different alarm and camera systems.  This experience is shared with our team to provide excellent service to our customers.  The challenge and always learning is the best part of the job.

good,"Electronics & Technology has always piqued my interest because everyday is never the same. A day's work can either become a stressful or an enjoyable experience -- in all my years working as a technician -- I have learned to always look at any given situation whether bad or worse into a skill and character building opportunity. A good day is unfortunately becoming a rare commodity, thus, in my opinion, is the hardest part of the job due to (sometimes) lack of appreciation when the opportunity presents itself. How an individual act and/or react will always affect his or hers attitude not because of salary, bonus..etc. but I believe in the old saying,""a happy worker is a productive worker"". very much enjoy what I do and I will never stop expanding my knowledge and gain wisdom; moreover, I am constantly looking to acquire and hone my skills as a Technician, for the reason that, I desire to be just 'slightly' ahead of the game."

I worked in the department that built the ""brains"" and security systems for the ATMs. In my department there was 7 different work areas that built different things for the ATMs. Such as fans to keep it cool, deposit boxes, security alarms. I would take all those parts and attach them together and made sure that the correct cables were used (for different country's), then I would hook all that to a computer to test it to make sure it all passed so that it could then be installed into the ATMs. I would have a quota to meet by the end of the day. The management was great. They would make sure that I had all the parts needed to complete my work. All my co-workers were wonderful in making sure that all the parts I needed were assembled and redy for me to install it on the ""lowers"". The hardest part about my job was when my co-workers would call off and I would then have to build all the parts in my department, there was 7 different stations. Management was very impressed that I was able to do all that and still meet my quota for the day. Sometimes they would send me co-workers over from different departments for me to train how to build what I needed. Management was impressed by how well I trained them. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting my quotas at the end of the day after facing some difficulties and thinking that I would not be able to get my work done. I always left at the end of the day feeling proud of myself."
