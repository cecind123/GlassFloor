rating,review
bad,Management's take favoritism management world pretty much set up or trap somebody to get them fired the meat manager of the warehouse fired every 6 months we get a new one worst place ever
bad,"Unsafe lift drivers"
bad,"Rlterrible pay, was welding, with Insane quota's per hour, placed on cnc, sub assembly, spot welding, cleaning cnc mind you no pay advance at all...ever."
bad,Don't care for how management is. Everyone is leaving due to unfriendly environment. High turnover rate. All the good workers are leaving. They look for things to write you up.
bad,Make up there own rules ever it sees fit. Was not like this when I hired in. It was a fun place with equality. I have seen discrimination at its worst
bad,"Transitioned straight from the military, bad place for the 1st job in the real world. Not taken seriously as an FFCL, promotion opportunities are scarce."
bad,"Ignore the warnings at your own peril. "
bad,Poor safety they don't care about proper safety rules seen many people who wear there electric grounding shoe straps improper if they had them on at all. Was decent job but cut throat environment
bad,"fue una mal movimiento en mi vida profesional, te pintan de rosa la empresa y no es lo que parece."
bad,Not truthful in interview regarding daily job duties and resposibilities. No formal job training. Direct management extremely unprofessional. Upper management not aware of true atmosphere of the team.
bad,Start up no one knows what needs to be done. Union started due to mistreated employees. Management has to many responsibilities to support the assembly line. The HR department is in another state. No upward mobility for supervisors. Experienced employees ideas get ignored.
bad,"There wasn't an option for no stars so i had to give it a 1 star.i worked in the Edison office as a financial analyst consultant and it was a horrible experience. the accounting department is a small smelly disgusting hole in the wall much like a prison cell. took the incompetent IT department 2 weeks to figure out how to give me access to one accounting software and another 2 weeks for the other accounting software. i literally did nothing for the month i was there. there seems to be a lot of o/t involved which i am not interested in either and the pay sucked as well! and by this new post i see the turn over rate is quite high as there had been 2 other financial analyst before me that quit within weeks. this place sucks..stay away!! "
bad,To much standing around and not working. I learnrd to be a fabrication setup operator. Management does not stay on top of workers to make sure orders are completed promply. Several employees were there just for a paycheck. Having to stand in one places for long periods at a time. Gained a tremendous amount of experience.
bad,"a union shop in name only."
bad,"Horrible Views on their manual labor. "
bad,Acuity is a company with a vision... But nothing else. They have policies for everything with nobody to enforce them. They only promote people when they aren't any good at their current position. Year-round overtime with no way out.
bad,I hired as a Buyer/Planner in 2010.  They have been running ads for Buyer/Planner jobs nonstop since then.  What's that tell you?  12+ hours per day and still not able to get everything done.  Never happier to leave a company.
bad,"Unethical work environment. Despite working 12+ hour days in a warehouse next to the trash collection doors working in 32 degree weather, unprotected from the elements, salaried staff still guilted for not putting in the hours. Building was not built suitable for power source, so constant loss of power. Material handlers not properly trained, then blamed for unsafe working conditions. Only $40k daily sales despite $2million in excess inventory not organized in the business system making identifying necessary raw materials for production nearly impossible"
bad,"This company started off good and then in the last two months has gone terribly wrong. Cutting people and stretching already overstretched resources with impossible goals."
bad,"Very poor management. You have to bend backwards for them to notice your work and brown-nose the supervisors. A lot of Hispanic opportunity. Not pulling any ""racial card"" just the truth. And if you have a problem with management they don't talk to you like a man or woman, much rather fire you and blame it on attendance even though you are on time every day."
bad,"Change management required, but rejected. Operated entire Contractor Payments department out of Outlook email program, including for the use of filing and accessing crucial vendor-related contracts and agreements.  No reliable technology, processes or procedures for efficient workflow process. Very poor management. No KPIs or metrics set for the department or its employees."
bad,Upper management got rid of managers to have incompetent group leads to run the floor. Trying to save money. Company discriminates against African American people.
bad,"Supervisors have no experience with product and are often hired for having military experience or other qualities not related to the job. There is zero official training for production line employees, yet workers are held accountable for mistakes. Management does ALL business behind closed doors, action is taken with no warning or explanation. Supervisors constantly complain about each other, intentionally misplace orders and complain to subordinates. deadlines are unrealistic. A disappointing amount of employees (some of them operate machines and forklifts) are caught drinking alcohol on the job. The company has fired people caught in the act but in my 3.5 years I have not seen a single random drug screen, the results would certainly shut down the company. there has been a number of incidents to include 3 fingers cut off by a saw, cuts from saw, nail guns shooting into body parts and electrocution. Photos are constantly taken by laborers, supervisors and management and have been used to black mail, terminate employees and construct law suits. Petitions and other propaganda are circulated by personnel with no affiliation and some with. The company recently fired the plant manager of 8 years, a few veteran buyer planners and numerous supervisors due to union intimidation. Under the new plant manager this company almost closed due to Safety violations."
bad,This company will suck the life right out of you. If you love your family or friends prepare to never see them again if you work at ACUITY. Also never make plans again because they blanket post overtime for everyone. If your department doesnt need to work over they send you to an area that does.
bad,"The child-director of the Dallas location would yell, throw fits and embarrass employees in front of everyone if he thought they were doing something wrong. I really hope for the sake of him and the people working for him that he was able to learn some management technique and reign in the tantrums.  What a horrible environment he facilitated.  Leaving was like waking from a nightmare."
bad,"High stress culture of intimidation from the CEO down. Good pay, but at what cost? Terrible benefits and unrealistic expectations. I would never go back."
bad,"I could write a book about this company.  When Acuity bought out Lithonia things went down hill.  The Crawfordsville, IN. plant is a union shop, but the union is a shadow of what it once was.  In all of my years I have never seen a more poorly managed company.  I wrote many letters to the CEO, but nothing ever changed.  The business model of Acuity is to buy out all the little guys to be the top dog.  A few years back they completely did away with QC.  Their returns on any given day are in the thousands of dollars, but they just don't care.  The company talks about Lean Manufacturing and 5S, but it's just that.  The place is dirty and so poorly run I don't see how they turn a profit.  The turn-over-rate and employee moral is so bad they leave the ""Hiring"" sign in the front yard all the time."
bad,They are always changing the management staff. As well as changing shifts on people last minute ans not caring about peoples familys lives. and the hours are dumb and the overtime is crazy.
bad,"The company is too focused on LEAN and where they want to be that they are not staffing for where they are.  Focus needs to be shifted back to quality and meeting the needs of their customers.  There are too many meetings to be effective."
bad,"Just a really disappointing company. Senior management lies through omission constantly. No clear directive. The companies culture consists of repeating the word culture. Management slots anyone who asks for help, in any way, as someone to remove. Company actively works to not pay gain share bonuses. Rampant racism and sexism. Just the latest conglomerate to send American jobs to India."
bad,Enjoyed the position that I was hired for but management and reporting changed that did not support the required efforts needed to perform my job and met customer and facility needs.
bad,"Above average pay is the only redeeming quality of this company, but you are paid to compensate for the hours you’re expected to work. Management is awful; lack of clear direction, little to no training, lack of resources in vital support positions, and a good ole boys club that limits advancement opportunities."
bad,Too much pressure from management to make numbers without needed parts/support. They don’t accept any of excuse. The employees work hard for little to no incentive and are made to feel to blame for things out of their control. Management feels micromanaging and being demanding is the key to getting things done. They cut the mount of associates and then expected a 50% increase in production. They dont have the tools needed to cut down wasted time and make poor decisions like moving the departments in the busiest season so that there was too much time wasted looking for lost parts around the whole facility.
bad,"The management of this company should be placed on an island in the middle of the ocean with nothing but a bucket with a hole in it and a broken exacto knife. Let's see how well they fare in learning how to survive. "
bad,"My personal role as a contract employee was okay since I did not interact with upper management on a daily basis.  My managers were excellent and always challenged by in a healthy way.  They praised excellent work and grew to expect that from me regularly.  The team I worked for at Acuity was excellent, but I would not want to go back and work there again in fear of how the company has changed since I left."
bad,"I stayed because I saw opportunity for improvement."
bad,The department I used to work in used to be good but when management changed so did the department. It became very stressful. Expectations were not reasonable. They would put you in a position that you never worked before and expected you to do the job like a fellow employee had done for years.
bad,"It's a fun place to work, music, and all but ALOT of favoritism. Too many Paid salary people that dont do anything besides watch Hourly work. When you constantly have managment looking over your shoulder it really gets old. I was there for 4 years and these FFCLS not even 6 months, we were hitting rate and they were trying to change rate that wasnt relevant, went to RED numbers and they complain more. FIGURE IT OUT. Let the employees do it how they do it!!"
bad,"High turnover rate, people leave and are let go all the time. Your experience there greatly depends on which department you work for and who your boss is."
bad,I wouldn't refer any one to do this the management is very unorganized they have no structure what so ever the pay is not manageable at all and everything with them is so short notice.
bad,"Long hours, work every weekend as well. Pay is really good, but expect to earn that money, and never have time to spend it!!"
bad,Typical day is fast paced. Management is ok depending on who that is. There's nothing more to elaborate on. No advancement in the distribution side unless it's to drving a forklift and nit everyone is interested in doing that.
bad,"Management plays a lot of favorites. Work life balance is poor. If you want to work 60 hour weeks and only one day off, then this is for you. Don’t assume everyone is treated equal by management."
bad,"This company is misnamed , Acuity means to be clear and if there's one thing company don't have it's that. Management is the worse I have ever dealt with. Virtually it's a free for all in blame and accountability. They hire mechanical engineers but no electrical engineers. Buyer planners are left in the dark and Management sit in their offices and look how to blame failures on the buyer planners and group leaders. If group leaders have problems with operators they are told to deal with it or get disqualified. Group leaders and operators are both union employees and the group leaders cannot discipline or even tell operators what to do. Now the union is worthless. Stewards do nothing in protecting the union members unless they are friends. The union takes monies for dues and yet do nothing. Seniority don't mean anything and you are left helpless. The company went to lean manufacturing and skipped so many steps that it is failing and they are too blind to see it. The company blankets overtime and you are stuck working 12 hr days plus weekends. They don't care about families.I am looking to move on and out from this wrecked company."
bad,Management needs to listen to employees more.  Constant management changes.  They need to value their employees and provide better health insurance.  Constant reorganizations without prior research.
bad,"Lots of stress and no time off. People constantly breathing down you neck and no leisure time away from work. you get 2 weeks of vacation after 2 years, and then you dont get another week until year 10 and then you top out at 4 weeks at year 20."
bad,"Forced overtime for salaried employees.  Dirty environment.  Unwilling to accept change or improvement.  The pay is decent, but the workday is long and unproductive.  If you choose to work there, all I can say is GOOD LUCK."
bad,They were completely afraid of Law Suits and had no backbone to run the Company and enforce equal rules for both Management and Employees.  One Employee threw parts at another person and nothing was done.
bad,The money is good. But they make no room for anyone with family. Especially if you are a single parent they have a double point system that is honestly designed to fail.
bad,"At it's core, Acuity is still a lighting company. It struggles mightily trying to embrace this IoT concept. "
bad,This place does not care about their employees I just worry about making money Can you work for acuity You have no life and management sucks this place went downhill fast after we were sold I don’t miss the job but I do miss the people
bad,"In the 10 months that I worked at Acuity, I had 4 different manager and they tripled the size of the work force only to discover that a computer glitch caused them to over produce 3 years worth of product.  After the glitch was discover, 80% of the workforce was laid-off."
bad,"I cannot comment on any other department other than the one I worked in. Although I was brought in and told that they like to promote from within, that was not what I saw.  At first, I was very excited to work for a growing company within the lighting industry.  After working there for 6+ months, it became evident that although they touted loving new ideas, that was actually not the case.  New procedures came down to us to change something ""effective two days ago"" without any notice and seemingly without thought into what effects the changes would have in our daily work lives.  The morale there was atrocious because some people were let go without any notice whatsoever every so often.  There was a change in upper management once every 8 months or something like that and many people would get fired and then others would get hired and want to change different aspects of what we would do. As much money as the company continued to bring in (always touted ""better than the year before!""), none of it ever went into getting us more training or updating our work station equipment let alone our salaries.   Most people who managed our group were expected to work crazy late and/or early hours from home if they didn't get everything done during the day - regardless of whether or not the workload was really heavy and should have been spread around more.  Although I did learn quite a bit there, I would not want to work for them again.  If you are considering a similar position there, I would inquire about their high turnover rate."
bad,They have a good old boy system they hold you back and lie about how to get promotions. They tell you they want you to grow and be better but the come up with lies to stop you.
bad,"MUY DEFICIENTE, debido a que no llevan un control."
bad,"They work you like a dog and nothing is ever enough. The pay is okay. Plant manager will swear at and threaten you but never stays to help or mentor, only blame. The only time that he actually will help you is if he gets to call another plant and be cruel to someone else."
bad,"Lab technicians get treated like the red headed step child.  No growth opportunities, once you get in the lab, you are stuck forever until you quit or get fired.  The big wigs get bonuses and promotions regularly, every one else stays stagnant"
bad,This company has taught me so much. The demand is incredible though.The hours are long and there isn't a good work/family balance I'm thankful for the opportunity that I had but this was not the company for me with small children. My career is very important but my family will always come first.
bad,"when this company was Sensorswitch, it was a great place to work and the old manager was a great person and a really people person.  The new management needs to take classes on how to treat people and take all the higher ups with him.  Worked there for about 18 years and had a good relationship with co-workers. If you like working more than 9-10 hours a day, this job is for you.  As the other person said in the review, putting them all on an island would be just fine."
bad,First 16 yrs=GREAT. Last 16 mgmt pitted employees against each other. Other facilities against each other. Manipulation of numbers to judge employees unfairly. Numbers replacing qualified management. Fair pay with OT. Ins. is expensive with less coverage. Great co-workers in a very stressfull & unfair environment. No advancement from blue collar level at all.
bad,buena empresa solo que es dificil creser  ayi  ya que por todo te quieren poner reporte asta por ir y tardarse 1 min enel bano
bad,Most the employees are helpful and welcoming. If you need help we all help each other as a team.  Needs better management team that acts upon safety and not just talks about it. You learn the job by asking one another.
bad,A typical day at Acuity would always make sure the line was set and ready to run. I've learned that you have to be organized in order to run properly. Management needs a little work. The hardest part of the job was to make sure all the parts where in to clear orders to  stay running and the co-workers stay busy on the line. I enjoyed my job and the co-workers.
bad,This place has a plentiful amount of mandatory overtime. Get ready to see that your line is working 12 hours all week long including occasional Saturdays. You will be posted from 6:30 to 7:00 all the time. They won't let you go until your goals have been met. Even then if you finish early they'll give you another order to start on until they're satisfied in which they hardly ever are. Higher ups and supervisors only care about self gain and receiving all the bonus checks they can get in their pockets. They do not give a d**n about their employees. You're nothing but a number to them. Have a family or friends? Say goodbye to having a life. You'll do nothing but live for working in this s**t hole. Over all very low employee moral in this place. Management needs an overhaul. It's decent pay but that's about it. You've been warned..
bad,Total lack of a continuous improvement environment throughout the organization. Poor communications. Complete lack of established procedures.
bad,It is expected to be there at 7:00 AM and start schedule set to do the job. Base off the set time periods you can complete the non-negiotables but anything extra will require two to three hours. The non-negiotables are required to be completed on a daily basis. It is an union manufacturing facility and there is some resentment between the manufacturing operators and the management. The hardest part of the job is completing the tasks that assigned to you.
bad,Is to much for my health problems i have diabetes complications and they don't care or i feel that way the people thing they are better in others and i don't like feel that way
bad,Management doesn’t listen to workers. High expectations of workers even when not staffed properly. Extreme heat. Extremely fast pace work is expected and you are expected to do the work of more than one person.
bad,"I do not regret my time at Acuity.  It helped me through a rough time in my life.  I was able to make Group Leader within 18 months.  What I regret is ever becoming a Group Leader.  I could deal with the endless overtime, the lying, cussing, screaming management.  What killed the job for me was being thrown into two of the busiest, most important lines as a Group Leader.  With all the vets running 1 or 2 lines my boss got the bright idea to throw me into the biggest lines with very little training and then kept lying to me about how long I would be, ""covering"" them.  He then forwarded an email I sent him asking for help to every other group leader, and gave them extra work in my name.  He was the only manager I liked so you can guess what the other ones were like: rude, loud, and having all the moral fiber of a Cheerio.  Unless you need a lot of money and a great savings plan (no time to spend it) I would avoid this place.  I should add that the laborers are some of the best people one could ever hope to work with.  I made a lot of friends there."
bad,never know if your going to have a job day to day twice year lay offs  management only out to protect themselves no back up from upper management staff
bad,Learning the tasks at hand that you had to do everyday was pretty easy. Lifting some of the BIG lights wasn't fun at all... I would come home everyday with muscle pains and my feet hurt also from standing on the concrete floors. They expected you to work overtime everyday including weekends. Some days I would walk in there and literally just stand around and do nothing and the group leader wouldn't even assign some of us something to do. It was as if he/she would play favorites. You also really have to get used to the people you are around to be able to like working there.
bad,"loved the people but had no life.... union does nothing for the people so if you mess up consider yourself gone,"
bad,"This is a complex place to work at. Employees are given contradictory orders and directions that can be counter productive to progress and improvement. Training employees is non-existent and that culture is passed down from top management. However, pay is great and benefits are equally great if your vision matches the top management."
bad,a typical day would be to make sure that the line had set up before they needed to start the next order. I have learned to be punctual and a leader as well. The management i really didn't know anything about but the co-workers were always a joy to be around. The hardest part of the day is when we don't have the part when its keyed in the computer saying that it's there. Everyone involved with that line has to go and search for that part. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people. I got to know the people i worked with. Even though i was a forklift operator i did give them a helping hand on the line as well
bad,Company does not value employees want to push employees to work faster and harder by setting goal that are unattainable there setting them up for constant failure
bad,"my job was eliminated / reduction in workforce."
good,"Working at Acuity as a Temp forklift operator you come in the door making 14.61 a hour after 90 days it’s 19.61 a hr, They’ll tell you your going to work 40 hours a week but I worked there for 2 yrs and worked 10 hour days the entire time employed there and maybe worked 40 hours twice my whole career there.. In the first 90 days of being hired they give you two weeks to learn there system, If you don’t meet there standards you will receive a call from the temp agency not to return.. The turnover rate is threw the roof! Due to the older associates being there for yrs it’s rare that a person will get to work on the morning shift.. Once you qualify you will be moved to 3rd shift regardless if you signed up for 1st or Mid shift.. Management is horrible  But the pay is great.. Don’t waste your time they’ll sale you a dream of we only hire professionals and how much some employees make a yr but they leave out all the bad.. If you need good quick money go for it just plan on never having a life.."
good,"Working seven days a week, with no solutions to get us out of overtime. Management doesn't care because the more parts you get, the more bonus theyget"
good,"Long hours, 60+ hours a week as a Buyer Planner.  No team work, and if you're a woman forget about any type of advancement."
good,La empresa tiene un clima laboral no tan agradable y es mucha presion por nada relevante
good,"Was one of the best companies to work for 10 years ago. Good company to work for if you can survive the culture. The deep state executives require you to be a member of the ""in"" crowd in order to survive. Many of the current employees would leave if the had a better opportunity, but the industry leading compensation keeps ones who don't get laid off intact"
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with and stayed consistently busy everyday.   Advancement opportunities are lacking on every level of business.   Management changed so often that it became hard to keep track of who reported to who.   Pay and benefits were good for the position.
good,Management was no good they had certain people they would cater too all the time and give them what they wanted or needed instead of moving them around like they did everyone else they would keep them in certain areas if they didn't like the job they were doing
good,"I assembled units standing on my feet 40-50 hours a week. I learned a lot on this job such as how to assemble units, soldering, testing and packing. The hardest part was the long hours and lifting heavy objects. I enjoyed working with the people on this job."
good,"The people are great, the management is lacking.  They are willing to let people go on a whim and not hire in someone to fill that position so it became increasingly more work for those around them and never slacked off."
good,"As I thought before working here, companies with unions are bad companies. There is a separation and it is hard to advance, even when one has a degree."
good,Too many meetings each day end up working on off days.  Bad for work life balance. Many of which can be covered in an email---total waste of time.  Spent over 16 hours in meetings last week!
good,A typical day at works is fairly fast pace. I have learned quite a bit about the job that I was doing. Depending on what department you work in the management isn't that great. The hardest part of the job is the mandatory overtime.
good,This company isn't hard work but there is no balance between work and home. The overtime is never ending and you don't have an option to request time off.
good,"The Sales Team (Holophane Division) I supported was and is the BEST in the Ligjting Business. The job was demanding and very stressful at times, however was also very rewarding."
good,"over worked and under paid, they over work you, and do not want to pay more, there group leads don't make the same amount of money and isn't fair"
good,Long hours expected. Basically you have to find out everything on your own. Right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing and somehow its your fault.
good,Everyday was a challenge. Some days were hard work and some were easy going. My co-workers were the best to work with. Benefits slacked towards the middle of years worked there. The best part of this job was meeting new people that I hope to work with again
good,I spent 4 plus years with this company and would seek progression and development towards a group leader role and always come up short. This is a good place to work for money wise. I would’ve stayed if I would have been given a chance to progress
good,"Work schedule 4x10hr days- off most Fridays."
good,"a typical day at work is awesome"
good,"Un lugar con buenas prestaciones y buen sueldo muy por encima del promedio, pero a la vez con jornadas de trabajo extensas de tiempo extra todos los días, es difícil el trabajo en equipo ya que muchos tienes miles de años trabajando allí y solo ellos creen tener el control de la empresa y las mejores decisiones creen tomarlas ellos. En cuanto a la gerencia en mi caso solo veo que hay un completo abandono de las áreas en cuestión de apoyo para resolver los problemas,(esperan que se resuelvan solos o cuando regresen). En mi opinión es una buena empresa y solo requiere un buen cambio cultural iniciando por la gerencia hacia abajo."
good,"A huge company that doesn't really care about their employees, all numbers to them. Always who you know not what you know or knowledge."
good,"ok•a typical day at work"
good,It's a tough place to work.  There is very little time to review the next days project and complete the sites in the assigned time.  Completing the paperwork in the required time can become difficult with some of the project schedules.  The paperwork is the biggest metric.  If it's not complete they'll put you on notice.  It's a tough place to stick with because it's pretty fast paced.  Good luck if you take it.  Be prepared to move.
good,"Too many meetings.  Makes getting work done very difficult.  Otherwise the employees there are some of the best people I’ve ever worked with.  "
good,"at Acuity Brands the change is constant, always improving. Good benefits,  personal and professional development courses provided. Many opportunities for advancement if you are qualified."
good,"Un dia normal es llegar en la mañana saludar al personal despues revisar programas de produccion y acomodar al personal en sus areas dependiendo de la carga de trabajo, se realiza un gemba para ver como estara el dia de produccion y afinar detalles para las diferentes areas y cumplir con los programas....lo que mas me gusta es el ambiente que genera el personal."
good,El ambiente de trabajo está bien nada fuera de lo normal
good,"El salario es muy bueno, pero se pierde mucho el balance vida laboral vs familia. El extra que ganas es por que realmente lo trabajas."
good,Es un buen trabajo con buen ambiente laboral pero hace falta  mas comunicación con los jefes
good,"There was always something to do, fast-paced workplace.  Opportunities to work on several different projects.  Very customer service oriented.  Change in ownership vastly changed the work environment."
good,Micromanagement a strong part of the culture. Management focus is on financial growth. Not big on promoting or developing. Don't waste your time.
good,"Acuity is the largest North American lighting company for a reason--their products are excellent.  But their IT support team is a mess, primarily because there are no functional sponsors for any of the projects that are undertaken."
good,"Team effort exhibited, work load consistent. Practice lean manufacturing principles that ensure that we produce a quality product in a timely fashion for each perspective customer."
good,It was an okay place to work and management was average. The co-workers was okay and the hardest part of that job was accepting that it was closing up and taking most of them overseas. The most enjoyable part of that job was getting experience in learning how to do different things.
good,"The experience at Acuity Brands really depended on the manager under which you worked. Over the 11 years, I had eight different managers in the different departments. While the company focuses on top down strategy deployment, the individual units don't always do a good job of sticking with that strategy. Career advancement was never really a subject which was discussed."
good,"not a bad place towork but not able to talk to fellow workers ."
good,"Like most engineers here I was not familiar with the lighting industry or the company name, so my introduction was my recruiter who was honestly really helpful. However I was interested in this role with the understanding between the interviewer and I that I would eventually be progressing to more design work and that the team would only be in its current facility for a month to two months longer... both of which were lies. To be fair, at least on our team, I feel as if pay is pretty decent in regards to most local companies but things have gotten more and more mundane as time has progressed and my career goals that we discussed seem further and further away. I have had all positive reviews, so this is not at all an angry retaliation to the company but I would be remiss if I were not honest in my disappointment in the lack of excitement, challenge, and growth. They have also been acquiring a lot of smaller companies in different parts of north america and it has caused more of a ""political"" challenge than anything else. Most teams only work Monday-Thursday, 10 hour days, but it's start to become apparent that this may be some strange way to make a thing to ask employees to work on that Friday ""just to help out""."
good,"It's a good place to work for, and the wage is not too bad compared to other places in town.  Safety is priority and then 5s."
good,"Every day is a little different, the people are friendly and the management team is commited to being successful."
good,"Large company with several divisions all over North America. Pretty old fashioned since its been around for over 150 years. Headquartered in Atlanta, GA."
good,loved this place but they could use some better management  the bank hours are about a joke. easy money lots of overtime  drama everywhere but i still liked this job the most
good,"The work was constant at times but when it slows down your job is in jeopardy at no fault of your own, even if your job performance is good you might get laid off. No job security unless you are higher up on the totem pole."
good,It was a good place to work at but they wanted all fast pace people if you weren’t on a fast pace you didn’t quality for the job leads where just leads something they left sometimes they didn’t there management changed 2x since I worked there .
good,Es muy común que haya trabajo Sábados y Domingo y no hay la presencia de los departamentos de soporte
good,"My short time as a temp was enjoyable with good employees, management could care less about temps our permanent workers.  No good time evaluation is given to potential temp to hire employee. No reason(s) is given for assignment ended. Worked there nearly three weeks before being pushed out the door. Arrived on time everyday and not missed a day. Most of the tasks were easy, some were challenging, I would never through an agency or off the street work for or recommend this company again. If you decide to try working there, don.t expect to be there long until your 120 days are completed, then you can relax. Good Luck."
good,Es muy buena empresa paga muy bien tiene como preferible la seguridad del operador
good,"They mostly follow a 10hr/day, 4 day work week so days can get pretty long.  Projects can be interesting and challenging depending on what group you are in and rewarding opportunities can be found."
good,Algo que me gusto del trabajo es que se encuentra muy cerca de mi casa
good,Fun job fun peoople good work place nice forklifts helpped alot and had a good lead and a good supervisoer and I like the job and it was fun to work for
good,Upper Management was disappointing. Company goes through a downsizing about every 18 months. There is no compassion for a downsized employee. Immediate manager was exceptional to work with.
good,"Flexible time. Work M-Th 10 hour days and have Fridays off!"
good,"plant job so it gets very hot and cold depending on time of year, big ceiling fans that give out great amount of air"
good,"•	Work as an interface between production floor and customer care to achieve delivery rate goals of zero stock outs, zero past due and 2 day back log in 4 month period."
good,Poor communication between management and staff.You feel there is no room for advancement. The culture and management often give you the feeling like you are being bullied.
good,"Expect to have limited work life balance however the job is challenging in a good way and you will be compensated well. "
good,"Lots of organizational changes and consolidations"
good,The work itself was not that hard to learn if trained correctly. The workplace was typical as any other. Some of the supervisors were not people friendly at times. For the area the pay was good and benefits were good. Before the closing the work became very tedious and heavy lifting. Some of the production goals were not inline with the assembly requirements to perfect good quality work.
good,Typical day is 8-5 with some other emergency time as required.  Company is making money with future in lighting the world with LED
good,"El ambiente de trabajo es muy bueno dentro de la empresa, situación que aminora el hecho que la distribución de responsabilidades es algo desigual, por lo que en el mismo puesto algunas personas están muy cargadas y otras no (recibiendo la misma compensación).  La empresa es muy buena escuela en Lean Manufacturing y Mejora Contínua y tienen la mayoría de sus procesos bien documentados y estandarizados."
good,"Quality Products, solid industry reputation, metric and process improvement focused culture.  Fast-paced, room for growth in this  large corporate environment."
good,"Alot of overtime, nice people and good environment. "
good,The company is no longer a production facility. They have downsized. I did like working for the company until they laid everyone off.  A lot of people lost their jobs. People that have been there for many many years. It was very disheartening of what happened.
good,"tienen muy buen suelo de eso no hay queja al igual que las horas extras, el fallo esta en no tener a cell lideres realmente aptos para el puesto (SE CREN MUY SUPERIORES) al igual que los shift lideres en ocasiones presionan de mas al personal o los sancionan muy fácilmente y el colmo es PAGAN JUSTOS POR PECADORES TANTO EN CELDAS COMO CON RH Y SUS REPORTES EXAGERADOS."
good,"Before the company take over, the old company was a pretty nice place to work, not perfect, but much better than the company that took over-life goes on."
good,"En si la compañia es excelente lugar de trabajo, solo que hay personas en los puestos claves que son recomendados, que no tienen experiencia y las personas que si tienen experiencia y/o titulo acaban haciendo el trabajo de esas personas o acaban reajustandolos. Rh y nominas esta mal administrado no les dan oportunidada a los contratistas, solo esta puro recomendado"
good,"No esta climatizada la planta, pero al paso del tiempo obtines categorias."
good,"There is always the chance to advance here. You just have to sign the bids. The problem is you have to be careful where you go because you want to watch where they are working the overtime. If you don't want to work the overtime then you want to make sure you get a department that isn't working too much overtime, but almost all departments work 10-12 hour days along with 6 days a week. Especially in the summer."
good,This company is a very good company to work for. They're the number one Lighting company right now. They are starting to do even more with commercial and home lighting.
good,"Pretty enjoyable with coworkers but very competitive even though its mostly in the assembly line side. Competition is good but not at that level where they get jealous because 1st shift or 2nd shift got the ""easier"" assembly job. If you work here and are young use it as a stepping stone to advance your career and try to be like a sponge an absorb as much knowledge as you can around the workplace because even if you work there for 2+ yrs you will be getting the same pay as everyone else. Even as the newest employee who got hired."
good,"I have worked for Acuity Brands for almost 3 years. I was a yard jockey and forklift operator. I would move trucks around first thing in the morning and then unload those trucks and put product away. Management was rarely on my side. I worked hard 50 plus hours a week. And they would not let me make up my days that I would miss. However they would let other associates make up their days. I have tried to go back to Acuity brands for work. Because 4 other associates have gotten their jobs back while I was there. However The company is refusing to allow me to come back for whatever reason. I do not recommend this company to anyone. I worked hard doing whatever I could and got treated like a slave!! Also How is it that I work 6 days a week, stayed late every other day, worked in the yard moving trailers, and been full time for almost 3 years and I cant get my job back?? How? That reason by itself explains why I cant recommend anyone. WAY to much FAVORITISM not enough work being done!!"
good,"Esta empresa se dedica a realizar lamparas, hay mucho trabajo, descansas los fines de semana, sin embargo no hay tiempo para estudiar, pero en general me gustó"
good,Good place to work if you get hired on job will be around for a long time. Good people to work with but not a lot of opportunity to take care of you or personal business on mid shift. Not a good shift if you have small children you like spending time with.
good,Aprendí a desarrollarme en áreas de mi interés y a conocer a grandes personas
good,"fast paced, competitive, collaborative.   The company is growing and innovative. CEO has the right vision and is interested in investing in people and processes."
good,"The people were great. We did our best to keep the company running. It provided me with the chance of developing my skills. I learned Lean manufacturing,"
good,Working at Juno an Acuity Brands Company is slow paced and expectations are fairly low. There is a lot of red tape and unnecessary paper work which makes the job worse. I would not tell a friend to work there unless they are the type of person that just wants to get by in life.
good,"Working at Acuity Brands Lighting was a good time, the first job I had after retiring from the military.  My supervisor helped me a lot with my transition from the military to civilian culture. Coworkers were helpful and willing to help.  Management was ready for the changes developing with new products and supportive of their employees"
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, en diez años aprendi mucho sobre el mantenimiento de prensas  y sus funcionamientos"
good,un dia normal subir y bajar tarimas de las envolvedoras lo k aprendi pues nada no ay nada k aprender y no te dan la oportunidad recursos humanos pesimos gente prepotente k se cren los dueños eso si muchos amistadesl la parte mas dificil son los turnos k son de dose horas pero te tienes k quedar 3 horas para k sean las 15 horas diarias lo k mas ne gusto las instalaciones son buenas
good,The most enjoyable part of the job: To work with the suppliers and my co-workers.
good,aprendi a trabajar con prensas y roladoras y a trabajar en equipo
good,"- mentor supervisors/leads"
good,A lot of overtime. Managed poorly as far as getting parts to get orders done. The people responsible for that job are not held accountable. Not able to fulfill orders because of parts
good,"el trato no es bueno como fabrica , por eso muchos se salen de la fabrica por que quieren favores y no los regresan."
good,it gets uncomfortably hot in the summer months and extremely cold in the winter months. there are many departments so no one persons review covers the entire facility.
good,"Acuity Brands Lighting is good place to work, This is a great industry but the benefits at Acuity Brands are lacking big time!!!. Nothing else to say.."
good,"Buena paga y buenas prestaciones, horarios muy complicados de 12 hrs. Demasiadas preferencias para los hombres, no cuenta con transporte"
good,Stay on your job and watch you back.  You will be here one day and gone tomorrow.  Stick to the script and think before making any suggestions.  And be on time
good,Acuity was an overall great place to work . Continous growth throughout the company . Rules where simple the most you could do there is Point out . They have a high turn over due to that .Management was always willing to help you succeed as a team .
good,"Acuity has mandatory overtime which means if they say you work 12 hours a day for 3 weeks straight no days off you have to. Don't get me wrong you can make a lot of money from overtime, but say goodbye to family and friends."
good,It's a decent place to work.  Most of the employees are friendly and helpful.  Very lean environment with management and staff.  There is mandatory overtime.
good,"Laborar en esta empresa consistió en actividades muy dinámicas pero de aprendizaje que me ayudaron a desarrollar algunas habilidades y visualizar las operaciones que realiza una industria para generar valor al cliente."
good,It’s a really good place to work. It’s a really fast paced job. It’s a job that you will get stressed out by working a lot but in the in end the money does show.
good,"In an effort to position itself as a technology company, millennial magnets such as free snacks, a cafeteria, game rooms, and sleeping pods are provided. Workload, however, did not encourage the use of the latter."
good,"Good job for single folk (Field Service Engineer). Meet new people everyday, travel the US, but you are gone from home pretty much all the time. There are a lot of smart people to work with and for."
good,"The work here was easy but hard at first because you have to learn to pick up the pace quick to keep up with the SOPs."
good,"El trabajo es muy arduo y constante, eso es bueno, mas no hay momento para un break de descanso, salvo los normales, que están establecidos."
good,"great co-workers- always a laugh to be had to make the day go smoothly, learned lots about the lighting industry, very challenging industry, management fair, great customers to deal with."
good,"Team leader in assembly line over 6 months"
good,"Steady place to work great dayshift hours, however management changes very frequently... meaning new and different rules all the time... employee opinions really never matter. GREAT PAY THOUGH!"

good,"Overall a good company to work with."
good,"The pay was good not great, lots of overtime opportunity and opportunity to move up. Company downsizing is the reason im not there anymore and I hear its closing down permanent soon."
good,"Acuity Brands Lighting, as the name suggests, is made up of multiple business units, separated by brand and function. The majority of the business is made up by lighting fixtures with the rest in lighting controls technologies. As such, they are diversified in products and ready for swings in the construction industry."
good,"The management and departments are far too dispersed and need to start working together more efficiently, there is far too much double work being done"
good,Working at Acuity is professorial and friendly. There are different departments with their own management teams.Each department contributes to the whole.
good,"Your potential to grow truly relies on how hard you are willing to work. Acuity does not care about time severed when it comes to promotions. If you work hard and prove you can driver results your career path is endless. However, the company is relentless when it comes to productivity and results. You have to be willing to drive your KPI's above and beyond your goals, and this can be mentally and physically exhausting after some time. They operate with a very lean salaried staff and you will need to wear multiple ""hats"" on a day to day basis. This company is not for the lazy or unmotivated. You must bring your ""A"" game daily."
good,"I work in a cell assembling electro mechanical control panels, it's"
good,Pues se necesita culturizar mas o infundir mejores valores laborales
good,"llegar para las juntas de calidad."
good,"He aprendido, desarrollado y adquirido mucha experiencia debido a la intensidad de produccion que se genera. He podido desarrolar mas y mejores habilidades para la solucion de problemas."
good,"Given the size of the company, there are many diverse opportunities at Acuity, and the company has had strong growth in recent years.  This was my first experience working for a manufacturer selling into the construction industry, which is very fast-paced and can often be very stressful when things go awry."
good,They work alot of overtime. Need people who will do their jobs and care if they are done. You have a pick list for parts. They have locations in the racks. Pull the parts and amounts on the list. Then take to the line that are pulling for.
good,"Hay mucha oportunidad de tiempo extra."

good,"Elaboración de reportes,seguimiento a métricos, arranque de linea, análisis de defectos y plan de producción."
good,llegaba al trabajo 15 o 10 minutos antes de enpesar a trabajar sacaba las herramientas de trabajo las colocaba en las lineas de operación para cuando llegaran los operadores enpesaran a trabajar rápido les daba la hoja de  componentes que llevaba las ordenes les pasaba los materiales y enpesaban a trabajar después yo chocaba mi plan de trabajo y me iba a traer los siguientes materiales que faltaban para las demás ordenes despues iba ala computadora y sacaba los tickets para el personal de embarques para cada orden terminada  y al finalizar el día  retiraba las herramientas de trabajo y las guardaba   allí aprendí a manejar el plan de trabajo a empacar rápido los materiales terminados  los ingenieros eran accesibles cuando necesitabas ayuda con algún material al cual no encendiera como iba ensamblado  o  de falta de materiales o cualquier cosa mis compañeros en su mayoría cuando llegue se portaron bien y me enseñaron todo lo que aprendí ay  la parte mas difícil era cuando me pegaba la falta de materiales por que  se me acumulaba el trabajo y para no parar no parar la linea metía las ordenes  que si tenían material  pero como eran pocas  tenia que meter rápido todo sino paraba la linea aparte de que tenia que ir por los materiales que no tenia ala mano eso era lo mas difícil  y lo que mas me gusto de mi trabajo es que si trabajábamos rápido se iba el día rápido que los viernes salia temprano y que tenia buen salario prestaciones
good,Normal operations conducted daily with everyone pitching in to make the best of each day.
good,"When I started the company, their claim was to be the trendy, hip place to work. That faded slowly. Very little interaction with other departments and employees. If you didn't start out in a high position, chances are you aren't going to move up unless you leave."
good,"Empresa estable, con ambiente bueno, pero muy estricta en cuestiones de tiempo"
good,Company provides a challenging environment with large growth potential. There is also the dedication to payment based on performance. Achieving results will be followed adequately.
good,"Working in Acuity Brands means hard work. Since the morning until the end of the day is busy time at office. For some people this kind of environment is not healthy for their personal life, but in my opinion I'm busy all day and keeps me focused all the time in things I like to do."
good,"Great company. However, high turnover and no direct leadership.  Not departmental structure.  Management constantly changing and job descriptions and actual positions do not matched."
good,"Overall a good place to work.  Four day work weeks, with almost no overtime.  Flexible hours after you prove yourself.  Coffee/Tea and juice drinks and snacks provided.  On-site cafeteria.  Pool table, ping pong table, a couple arcade machines."
good,"Greeting incoming guest. "

good,Very productive and very busy day

good,"There are a variety of groups/divisions with Acuity to work.  Most days are extremely busy, management is friendly, easy to work with.  The dress code is casual, jean every day are the norm. "
good,Was busy your whole shift but with adequate breaks and lunches. Company would provide lunches for everyone temp or full time and would ket you knoe in advance if there was overtime coming up or not.
good,Pretty fun place to work with an amazing work-life balance. Had a hard time moving into a more challenging role. Cool people to work with and some awesome managers.

good,"As a Buyer/Planner with Acuity Brands I have obtained the skills to successfully manage a fast paced production environment using LEAN manufacturing techniques as well as using KANBAN to manage excess inventory. In addition, I have worked many years in Customer Service as well as served my country as a United States Soldier.  I have trained many Soldiers, Sailors, and Airmen to a high standard on Active Duty in the United States Army. As an Officer in the Army and a Buyer/Planner with Acuity Brands, I hold my employees and Soldiers to a high standard as well as the products we produce. In short, working in logistics has given me the skills to plan, resource, and execute a variety of day to day logistical operations. Training is a direct parallel to providing great customer service, in short I believe my skills would be a great asset to any organization."
good,"This company is a good place to work for to get ahead in life, good pay. Good people, but if you want  a future its not the greatest place to advance."
good,During the last 8 years I worked from home full time.  Great customers and co-workers.  Most of the work was technical in nature.
good,"Ambiente muy agradable donde trabajar y convivir area accesible, los retos estaban a cada rato sacando la creatividad y el talento de todo el personal, el trabajo entre departamentos era de ayuda mutua."
good,"Being to work on time,Being productive ,Respecting others ,getting along well with others. Finishihg work orders on time."
good,very good place to work...every day has its challenges...good teamwork...management team is helpful...dealing with union issues is the hardest part...best part is being able to express opinions freely
good,"If you like money and not having the time to spend it EVER, this is the place for you. We worked between nine and a half and twelve hours a day plus most Saturdays and an occasional Sunday. Working only eight hours was an unexpected treat. I LOVED the encouragement to move up within the company that I received, but they expect you to put your home life second."
good,"There is a lot that can be learned at Acuity, some of my favorite things were about the inner-workings of the lights themselves. Management is great there as well, very friendly and accommodating when needed"

good,"buen ambiente de trabajo, trabajo en equipo, buena cultura laboral, rapidez, y buen compañerismo"
good,"Muy buen ambiente laboral "
good,"The work is easy and doable by anyone, good pay and ability to move up. Management is a lot better than it has been in years. Communication can be better between management and employees, since it is a union shop, employees are dependent on that."
good,This was the best job I ever had. I hate that it had to move to Mexico because I would still be working there today. And everybody work together to help each other out.

good,Aprendí a trabajar en equipo y a ser mas responsable.
good,El trabajo a sencillo y hay buenas prestaciones...
good,"Acuity is a great place to work. The people are very hard working, the culture is very collaborative, but they do take on too many projects at once and do not plan and forecast very well."
good,"Benefits were great"
good,"A fast paced job where it requires you to be quick in your head and hands. Very well trained by the supervisors and trainers. Making light fixtures would sound hesitant for a job to anyone, but the job is well worth the work."
good,"Acuity Brands is a class leading organization that engages in Lean 6 sigma. In the spirit of Lean, Acuity Brands continues to be number 1 in its segment. Great culture and excellent onboarding makes it one of the best companies I worked for."

good,Managed short term and long term IT infrastructure projects with team of engineers. Learned multiple enterprise level information technologies. Diverse workforce that were very friendly and knowledgeable. Opportunities for travel to multiple national and international cities.

good,Excelente Corporación para laborar por sus compensaciones económicas y capacitación a su personal.
good,You really need to get your work done at Acuity. The bosses are constantly pushing for better results however they understand the work/life balance of the industry. I enjoyed my time at Acuity and learned a great amount of information being an intern in the finance department.

good,"Working 6 days a week! Too much over time, long hours! Not well organized! Great team members, Everyone worked together to get the job done!!! Fast work environment!"
good,"Es buena empresa, pero falta mas atencion por medio de los jefes del area para tratar de que los practicantes obtengan mas experiencia laboral ya que la mayoria que se obtiene es por cuenta propia."
good,I would recommend working there the oney is great for the work u do. I would enjoyed working there and it's a very fast pasted and multitask joyou have to really pay attention to ur every job. If it not a multi taskperson nor a fast paced then the job is definitely not for you. .
good,"A wonderful  place to be employeed ,very humble people.Great environment.love working for the company.Great benefits,great people.if I was not laid off ,will still be a part of a great organization.  Love working in assembly,transitioning to fabrication department,working with blueprints and side by side to engineers."
good,"Going in at 11pm to a light company was very interesting, I learned how to paint and hang light fixtures with the help of an awesome management team I was provided with full training sessions to help me get familiar with my job. I was 18 at the time and I was surrounded by co-workers who had been employed there for more than a decade so they were very experienced with the job but they welcomed me and took the time out to show me how to make my job easier. The hardest part of my job was being on probation for 6mons and trying to be a fast paced learner that was my first job so it was very challenging but the most enjoyable part was making great money at a young age and having outstanding benefits."
good,"A team player with strong management, communication and computer skills acquired through work experience and academic training."

good,"Kinetix has already done research on my background and I was set up for an interview at a major company in Conyers in no time. The recruiter guided me through the process by providing interview tips, checking with me both before and after the interview and making sure that my career goals/path aligned with the position that I was interviewing for. Kinetix was also willing to help me prepare a presentation to get a permanent job. They are very resourceful and accommodating."
good,"Awesome company with great facilities and pay, but some groups could use a lot of improvement. Like most companies there are layoffs, but some of the reasoning behind the selection of the employees involved in the layoffs are questionable at times."
good,"Una empresa que no limita a los empleados, tiene mejora continua, excelentes instalaciones, muy buenas prestaciones,"
good,El ambiente de trabajo es bueno pero falta mucha cultura en 5s. A pesar de que se realizan actividades falta seguimiento por todo el departamento para convertirlo en una cultura laboral.
good,"mostly female work environment, e-mail and telephone customer service.  Liason between the factory and sales. Great experience working with my coworkers in Mexico."
good,Acuity Brands is a awesome company that is growing at a rapid pace. The pay is competitive and the facilities are nice. The culture and consistency within management and certain leadership positions often leaves a bad taste in the mouths of the employees along with a lost sense of direction for growth within the company.
good,This is a great place to work. It will change your life for the better. However be cautious of some employees and managers if they decide they don't like you or want you in their departments.
good,"This job is where I have received most of my experience with team work. I worked on a factory assembly line and had to learn how to function with my fellow co-workers to retain efficiency and solve problems. A typical day here would be a non-stop 10 hour shift in which the mood was pleasant and conversational, but never at the expense of productivity. I most enjoyed working as part of a team and the roughest part of the job was that sometimes, the 10 hour work shift would become a bit tiring."
good,"There is no place to grow professionally talking. There is some rumors that the company is moving to Mexico."
good,"- Safety Meetings"
good,experiencia laboral de trabajos anteriores estudios etc

good,Buen ambiente de trabajo aunque algo exigentes somo toda empresa de caracter internacional
