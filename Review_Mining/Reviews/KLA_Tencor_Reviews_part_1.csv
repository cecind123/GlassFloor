good,"Working at KLA Tencor is fun if you love technical challenges, while  dealing with different flavors of problems from extremely demanding customers. KLA culture emphasizes on being forthright and consistent, which shows up in management and peer group interaction.Coworkers are smart, helpful and friendly. Hardest part of the job is the struggle to maintain work life balance while still growing in your career.Enjoyable part of the job is definitely the joy of bringing solutions to end customers"
good,it was a bright atmosphere and amazing positivity from all around the work space we usually had meeting in the beginning of the day and one towards the end.
good,"Just like any other companies that i've worked for in the past, like being a second home, and everyone is like a second family members."

good,"State of the art technology to work with not many career advancements."

good,"Challenging place to work;flexible"
good,"Well i loved to work with Kla-tencor  but the only issue that continously persists in the company is if any one challenges the  managers technically  they are sent immediately out of  the company so you cant have a healthy environment but a a submissive  environment other wise  then  all managers are very good . and all the mangers are more then 18 yrs exp and  there is no way for growth you just be happy with the salary hike  and never try to say the managers are wrong even  if  it is 100% true some times you feel it is  like a dictator  rule but personally all managers are good , in the review if you say  you want to grow as a manager  then you are immediately  shown the door  but the parent company in USA  is really good . you are  not even entitled to know the power and authority  you have but overall the company without  managers is Truly a heaven on earth to work.managers are very powerful dominating  on funds collection 6 managers to manage 8 people  so you can understand the pressure  but some powerful managers are very very    poor in technical know how,"
good,"The nice thing about KLA-Tencor was that it was a dynamic and growing place. It treated people fairly well.  The downside that it has nasty boom or bust business cycle, so as a result you were overwhelmed or worried about layoffs."
good,It is a good place to work. Fair management. I recommend working for this company to anyone who has new technical innovations and recommendations.
good,"I like working at KLA-Tencor.  I got a chance to work with cross functional team (Marketing, Designed Engineering, Manufacturing, Finance, warehouse personnel) where I learned so much."
good,"In Design Engineering, it seems there is something new every six months. As soon as one product is launched, the next improved version is already in progress. This makes it challenging to keep up with the pace yet exciting and stressful at times. Keeping commitments to schedule is difficult when depending on many people and managing multiple projects. It may be overwhelming at times but eventually everything comes together and the goal of shipping a new product is successful and everyone celebrates. In my experience, my managers are always friendly, supportive and open to discussion and new ideas. My coworkers are friendly and helpful to fix a problem or give advice. You will find many people here with over twenty years at the company and they are still motivated and working hard. The company builds the best equipment in the industry and it comes from insightful leadership and talented, hardworking employees working together to solve tough problems."
good,I really enjoyed my time there.  I worked hard and loved what I was doing.  The were so many people there and we had a great support system.  The activities were wonderful too.
good,"Company was an exciting, fun and challenging place to work at. The best from my limited perspective but that is the reason I worked there for such a long time. I found most everyone there had a very positive view of the company"
good,Good company culture with a willingness to innovate. Good company Benefits. However if you are able to enjoy them is subject to the department you are in.
good,Great place to work. Good work culture. The company provides a great opportunity to grow in your career. People here in KLA believe in teamwork and everyone are ready to help.
good,"KLA was an excellent place to work, the company is a little heavy on contractors, favoring contract work over full-time hiring, but the management is accommodating and understanding. The workplace environment is relaxed but also pragmatic."
good,"I was originally hired as the worldwide financial reporting manager.  My boss let me work independently, and we had a 3 day close each month, which is very difficult to do with 14 subsidiaries.  I was promoted to Division Controller after 4 years, and worked with the executive staff on a daily basis.  I left because I moved to the east coast."
good,"This was my first job out of engineering school.  I loved the company and it was a very valuable experience as I grew in the high tech, semiconductor industry.  Compensation was fair and I really enjoyed my time there.  The only reason I left was that I lived in Silicon Valley and couldn't afford the housing there and really wanted to own my own house.  That's why I changed companies and moved to Portland, OR."
good,KLA Tencor was a very good company and I enjoyed working there for almost three years
