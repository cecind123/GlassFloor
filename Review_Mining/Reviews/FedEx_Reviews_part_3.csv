good,"Working at the Indianapolis National Hub. I will go in and start cleanup like dust mop the designated area and try to get all the dust up that I could. The area I work in is called the Matrix. Basically there would be a flipper and a pusher. The flipper would flip boxes on a main conveyor belt so that the scanning label is facing up towards the sky while the pusher would push boxes onto a different conveyor belt. You must be able to lift up to 75 pounds. The management is nit to complain about, very well managed, The co workers acts like a family to get thousands of boxes through so the boxes are placed to the designated place to either get loaded on an airplane or a truck. The hardest part of the job was first starting because I was very sore. Another tricky part of this job is working midnight shifts. I enjoy  lifting the boxes to improve the muscle."

good,"Starting with the Company back in 1986, I have grown with the strength that synonymous with what is now FedEx.  I literally started on the ground floor and worked as a driver, trainer and several management positions.   The people I have worked with will always be a part of me."

FedEx couriers will assist customers face-to-face and over the telephone concerning packages and other FedEx services. All of the rules assigned by FedEx involving the vehicle, delivery and pickup method, and other FedEx services, are upheld by the courier at all times. We are constantly using computer peripheral devices to monitoring our time, deliveries and customer pick ups. Everyday we are under high levels of time management to complete the ""Purple Promise""."
good,This job was fun and everyone got along. Managers were cool and the employees were to. Everyone got their work done and still had fun.
good,"I load trucks while scanning every package that goes on the truck. This is a job that takes dedication, and termination.  The managers are very open with communications, check on you very often and the co-workers all have a great attitude and go out of their way to help others."
good,I enjoy working for a company that allows your input with on the road driving and friendly people.  Safety is their main concern and following up on any customers issues with packages or scheduled deliveries.

good,"Nice part time job, pay is well, and the benefits are even better. I've learned a lot about working with other people and the importance of communication."

good,everyday I punch in the first thing I made sure I did was strength . It was only part time but it was never a easy four hours. I learned if you don't stretch before picking up constant weight for hours your body was going to be in pain. Management was cool and helpful but that didn't help my body from being soar everyday. My coworkers help my day go by fast because of their unique personality kept my mind of what we was doing but they wasn't a distraction and I still completed my duties at the end of the day.
good,I enjoyed working with FedEx. Working with FedEx as a package handler taught me about responsibility.

A call would come up & customer would want to place a pickup of package, want to track a package, report a missing package or want to file a claim for a damaged package."
good,"Fed Ex was an extremely difficult workplace, at times, with many hard moments and sometimes was quite dangerous. Ramp work is always that way, and FedEx ramp employees are extremely well-compensated. Where I worked, everyone was great and a lot of fun to work with."

When we have down time we just have fun. Working together as a team is a definite due to the workload. Frequent pay raises and once you get your hours in for benefits, the benefits are great. Also, there are a lot more perks that are offered thru FedEx. Management is pretty cool, lenient and understanding. You have to really just not want to work in order to get terminated.

This also taught me how to work in a fast paced environment as you can be running back and forth between trucks. The managers are all cool, yet strict. As long as you show up on time and put your best effort forward, there really is no problems. My co-workers are good as well. The hardest part about this job is really just handling the sort at certain parts of the night. For example, if they double team a trailer. This means that two guys will unload the boxes instead of one; which means you get double the boxes in a short time. The most enjoyable part of the job is that it is early in the morning.

As long as the job gets done the right way then there are no problems. The hardest part of the job is learning all the terms, or lingo, that FedEx and the airport use on a day to day basis. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to work out on the airport, on the plane and with all the machinery."

Often meeting these request were daunting task, but a responsive dispatch team made the difficulties easier.  Management juggled many responsiblities and maintained a coaching relationship to best provide success in meeting the challenges of various customer needs.  This was coordinated with dispatch by load leveling busier routes and less congested routes so the burden was shared by willing neighbors who knew to help because help may be required from them.  Traffic weather, freight volume and plane delays were variables that could lead to many frustating situations, however our service agents were adept at handling customer request, courier situations, and mangement directives.  Being part of an elite group of couriers known for safety, relaibilty, and putting the customer first has grown our business into nearly a ubiquitous brand: Fedex."

good,"My experince at Fed-Ex was rather short but sweet gained knowledge on how to load and unload scan and track boxes, for the most part if your looking for a easy fast pace part time job I would really recommend this to a friend, the hardest part about working on a site such as Fed-ex is being able to move at a fast pace constantly while lifting heavy boxes and the easy part about the job is it's only four hours being a package handler and your just loading/unloading at the same time scanning boxes. The co-wokers and management all work as a team to bring a acccurate performance."
good,I love working for FTN! Great company to work for. Very friendly staff and Great management.
good,A typical day at FedEx starts out very busy and productive with lots of work to do in the morning. Everyday is different and filled with fun and new experiences.

good,"Great company with great benefits. Employees were always treated fairly. I was given the opportunity to grow with the company. In our department, all employees worked together. I did not consider any part of my job as ""hard"". The most enjoyable part was at the end of the day feeling as though I had accomplished what was asked of me."

good,Overall great company. You were treated like a valued employee. Great co workers.
good,"I would sort through mail, scan, and load in canisters. Would work overtime loading and unloading trucks. Management was great and always let you know what was going on that particular day and what was expected of you. Co-workers were great to work with and always gave each other a helping hand. The hardest part of the job was the hours werent enough. There were weeks where no overtime was offered.

If a group of people work together as a team, they can accomplish anything. My peers and I work together to make the station as productive as possible. We have a very strong bond which is also why we are so successful. The most Enjoyable part of my day is talking to my employees in the morning before they go on road. I like to set a tone for them for the day. I joke and just make them feel good which carries on into their onroad performance. The hardest part of my job is having to let employees go for disciplinary reasons. That is never easy but has to be done in order to run a successful business."
good,I started off loading and unloading trucks after that I got hired as administrative assoicate taking calls helping customers track their packages. If there was a pick up that needed to be made running or late we would call the driver in that area to see if they can make that pick up or see why they were running late. Again my co-workers and management team were great to work with. The hardest part of the job was when you couldn't find the package and had to tell the customer. The best part of the job was when you thought you couldn't find the package and you find it. Makaing the customer happy.
good,"the only reason I left Fedex was because I moved to california. I tried to transfer when I got to California, but the only place they had opennings was in a city over an hour and a half away."

good,"regularmente no paras en todo el dia, es estar en constante movimiento, en mi caso, cuando estas dando el servicio personalizado, te das cuenta cuando el cliente tiene confianza en la empresa, es tu trabajo darles esa confianza, en ocaciones es dificil, por ejemplo, aveces un paquete se retrasa en aduanas, tu como empleado debes hacer tu trabajo bien, para asi evitar cualquier contratiempo, y lograr la entrega en momento y forma, y no solo eso, sino dar siempre un extra."

However, the longer you work there the more your body adjusts to the physical demands of the job."
good,"A typical day would begin with a team meeting to review our production stats from the previous day. My position as a dockworker would require the use of a forklift, load shipments on a trailer while assuring weight requirements are met. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that our customers are getting their shipments due to a smooth orchestrated teamwork."
good,"This job was just a stepping stone as I was unable to find other work in my field of work. I am a disabled veteran and not sure if that played a part in my hiring or not, but they treated me with a lot of respect. It was obvious that the company firmly believed in promoting from with in and then hiring out the lower unfilled positions as opposed to many companies hiring out for the upper vacant positions. I would love to go back to work for this company, however I now live in Florida and am about 45 minutes from the closest terminal.

The hardest part of my job is getting up at 2am to get there on time, I've only been lat one time so its not that hard to overcome. The most enjoyable thing about my current job is that we stay busy for the little bit of time we are there. Staying busy makes the time go fast, so i'd rather stay busy working than to just sit around doing nothing."
good,I was a pusher on an assembly line working with very large metals to small boxes.
good,"This was my own business. I checked my load, did my pre-plan and pre-trip, then on the way to the first customer. I learned and did everything it took and needed to make a successful business.

I have never worked for a company that is as dedicated to its employees as this company is. Management wants you to move up and will help and guide you every step of the way. Your coworkers also want you to succeed and help out whenever you need something. This has been the best experience of working for that company.

We would circle around and discuss our daily schedule while we are stretching. Then everyone would break off and go to their assembly line. Once at the assembly line we would wait for the machine to start so that we can sort the packages and put them in the right bins to be sent off in the FedEx trucks.Working that FedEx thought me to work at a fast paste since the assembly lines moved so fast and to stay focus on the task at hand and to be a team player all at the same time, my co-workers helped out so much in that field.Everyone was so friendly from the general manger right down to the janitor. Especially when the lines would start getting backed up because the speed would pick up and their wasn't enough people on the assembly line, it can get really frustrating because everybody wanted to each the goal for the day and that's when team work would kick in big time. I met a lot of amazing people when working at FedEx that I would of never expected to get along with because of age difference, the drivers would bring the package handlers cookies and snacks to thank us for our hard works.We could joke and play around with one another and still stay on top of our jobs.Everyone getting along was the best part about working at FedEx, I loved working there."
