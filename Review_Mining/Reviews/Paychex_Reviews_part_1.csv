rating,review
bad,"I accepted what was to be a part-time afternoon position in administration ?n in the past year.  My co-worker (or my on-site micro-manager) was my trainer, etc.  "
bad,Don’t do it they don’t appreciate employees they will let you die and leave you at your desk waiting for the police  they really did this nothing shows how you care if your working next to someone who is dead
bad,"This is my OPINION having worked for them for quite some time: Paychex is filled with disingenuous people. Coworkers care only about themselves and no one is your friend. Management in Talent Acquisition, where I worked is pathetic. If you are young and female you will receive preferential treatment, as all of management except the director is female. Management, as they all often do, think they know more than the employees, but in reality, they only got to management status because of the the ""good old girl"" syndrome. They are proficient liars and will throw you under the bus if given an opportunity. You will never be appreciated unless you are with the ""in-crowd"". They profess culture and values then treat people as disposable. Am I angry at the way I was treated, you bet! But from my perspective, this is the absolute truth. Watch you back in HR and Talent Acquisition."
bad,"Very poor salary and commission structure. "
bad,"You are obligated to participate in things you don't agree with; baby showers for people you don't know. There is a cult atmosphere. Either you are one of THEM or an outcast. Very unfriendly managers. This was in the Allentown, PA office. Do not judge all branches by one bad team. I learned a lot working for them the 2 week schooling in NY was very beneficial."
bad,"Leadership is a joke which is why we have so many people quit. In this place it’s all about playing the game. Work life balance is preached but not lived by my husband is very ill and I have to chose between him and the job right now, unfortunately because he has a brain issue and I need the insurance I am forced to keep this job"
bad,"I had a death n my family was off for 90 days returned to 371 clients,  when you ask for help you get wrote up. Some days I worked from 6am until 8pm never got a raise or bonus. Management is  very rude and condescending, the take care of each other not the employees that's why turn over rate is SO HIGH"
bad,"HIGH turn over rate! Managers don't know what they are doing. Sure they give you lunch every now and then, but when you're weighed down with 100+ clients, lunch doesn't mean anything. I had heard so many great things about the company, and then I started working there. BIGGEST MISTAKE OF MY LIFE! Supervisors don't know anything, but apparently they ""put out our fires all day."" Family oriented is a bunch of BS. They don't care about your family or any emergencies, they expect you to be at work 8-10 hrs per day. Your clients are your life... Do yourself a favor and DO NOT APPLY HERE. The compensation sounds nice, but for all the work you have to do, IT ISN'T WORTH IT! "
bad,Horrible company that loses customers often because they can't consistently deliver good customer service.  Regardless of which department you're working in you'll have to constantly put out fires caused by incompetent employees and managers.  The company's biggest competitor is much better to work for and I'd recommend that company if you want to work in payroll services.
bad,"If you're not one of the ""favorites"", don't expect to get a fair shot of pay increase, promotion, nothing. I was a contracted employee training new hires for 10 months that I was there and did not get offered a full time position with benefits during my 12 month experience being employed. I didn't receive any pays compensation for being a ""new-hire"" trainer and supervisors assistant, performing duties OUTSIDE the job description applied. "
bad,"very stodgy and old fashioned, far too buttoned up for present day office life.  the pay was quite poor too, i'd recommend looking elsewhere unless it's your first job out of college like mine"
bad,"extremely overloaded with accounts, extremely hostile and stressfull environment. Favortism everywhere, trainings over time have dropped and management doesn't care."
bad,This company is based strictly on favoritism and who is friends with supervisors. The protocols and procedures are not followed through carefully for the job safety of the employee. Very poor management skills from supervisor. If a supervisor sees you perform in better than them they fire you. Instead of lifting you and congratulating you they become enemies and team up with others to push you out. Do not apply
bad,"There are some great managers and some terrible, just like summer camp as a kid.  Just don't get stuck with a bad counselor."
bad,I would not recommend working at Paychex to anyone. I spent eight years working at this company and they provided no resources or efforts from management to help me advance in my career with Paychex.
bad,"The entire culture was prejudiced against individuals with disabilities. I returned to the office after a traumatic brain injury and was treated poorly by management until I was finally terminated."
bad,The department I worked in was stressful and high paced with little to no pay off. I also feel the management team did not have the best interest of the employees in mind
bad,"Very unprofessional. Makes staff work without breaks. Inappropriate discussions and inappropriate touching, and once you say something they will terminate you."
bad,Racist company unless your white then your ok racist racist racist Ummm more racist they over work you just horrible experience overall so yeah they're racist
bad,"Supervisors will never assist and will throw you under the bus. Lots of management favoritism. Crazy work load with no help. If you ask for help you get no relief. You are expected to work quickly on time and to each clients expectation with no mistakes even if you have multiple appointments at one time or a large work load. "
bad,In the interview they lie and tell you that you will get a raise after you complete each step to your training and that that the training can be completed every 2 weeks but yet the supervisors will not schedule you for the training unless you pretty much beg them. The workload is more than the compensation provided. You will be told in the interview that you will be dealing with clients that have 50 employees or less with 60% of your clients have well over 100 employees. The supervisors pick and choose who they want to help. You are suppose to meet with your supervisor once a week for a one on one to discuss you stats and I can tell you I have been with the company about 9 months and have had two one on ones but I have never seen my surveys and can't tell you what my stats are like because my supervisor has never provided them to me after asking for them several times. I think this company is a waste of time and the turn over is extremely high. Instead of promoting from within where they have senior specialists who have been here for 3 plus years they are hiring supervisors with less than 6 months of payroll experience that haven't even became senior specialists. This place is a joke there is no moral and the worst place to work.
bad,A typical day consist of monitoring and distributing payroll to company's all over New England. Along with providing excellent customer service.
bad,"The job at Paychex was horrendous to say the least. The workload is heavy, the pay is low, and management morale cease to exist. The location in Baton Rouge is operated by a small minded Manager and she leads the office with not so smart Supervisors. In the interview they sell you a dream and then you enter the job and receive less than basic employment. A raise is hard to attain and they are prejudice to whom they assist in making the job a great place to work. It is a glorified Call Center."
bad,"Given too many responsibilities with no training or support from management."
bad,"Expect to cold call 50 business' a day (B2B) and call 300 companies to try and set appointments.  It is like selling ice to an Eskimo.  Their product is identical to competing companies.  Its very difficult to find companies that want to change payroll companies because it is very involved, lots of data, and lots of personal information like Social Security code.  Management is a nightmare. I had the worst manager and he no longer works there.  He was hostile, unprofessional, inappropriate, and sexually harassed the few women who worked there.  Corporate is very different that satellite locations."
bad,"My experience was unfavorable. Management was unethical and horrendous in my department. I gave 110% along with some and it was not valued! So I can only imagine other departments had the same culture and values as they say, what a joke!  "
bad,"I would never work at this company again. Coming from the military and airport, i was used to having jobs that felt like a family. To my suprise as paychex is such a refutable company it is nothing short of the opposite. Paychex has established a cut throat culture and managed to reward said individuals partaking in these actions. Run by poor management, this company is on the decline and the turnover rate is reflective of just that."
bad,if you enjoy high levels of stress and little compensation this would be perfect for you.  Little to no growth with this company based on favoritism.
bad,Your day never ends and deal with people's money is very stressful. A typical day begins with a Paychex meeting or viewing your email. Next you are visiting CPA's and /or on appointments schedule. Sale force is a daily activity.
bad,"This place is great for a recent college grad who needs to start somewhere and get something on their resume. However, if you are looking for a career and upward mobility, this is not the place for you. Low salary (and it never goes up, unless you get a promotion, which is very very rare due to the structure set in place.) There is no work/life balance. You are basically out in the field from 8-5 (not including the amount of time you are in traffic. Depending on where your territory is, you could be leaving the house as early as 6:30 and not getting home until 7PM. Culture is horrible. There is no collaboration or teamwork. Reps are always disputing over accounts and leads, managers have favorites and switch leads in the system. Very unprofessional and (for lack of a better word) shady practices. If you're desperate for a job and need to put something on the resume, put in your time here and then move on to bigger and better things. It is very hard work, for low pay (if you compare to other companies in the same field and same job requirements.)"
bad,Fast Paced like any other job. Monday through Friday 8-5. hour lunch.
bad,The rate of turnover at Paychex is very high. Many of the glowing reviews here read as if they have been submitted by firms contracted to bolster Paychex's very negative image throughout many markets.
bad,"I worked for Paychex for almost 5 years and not only hated every single minute of it, but I am not literally worse off for it.  I cannot get a job within the HR field because Paychex is not really and HR company.  They are IT based.  The concept is one of an administrative assembly line, the culture is backstabbing, negative, and one that rewards all of the wrong behaviors.  Worst employer I have ever had."
bad,"It's simple: Bad from the top down. ""Big brother"" dictates how management exploits and abuses employees, and management happily obliges. It's like spinning in a hamster wheel being watched by a cruel dictator. My manager was actually overheard saying, ""we need more staff with strong backs and weak minds"" about my Payroll Specialist position, apparently due to the fact that we have to be chained to our chairs for up to 15 hours a day. Now here's the thing, being that Paychex is politically positioned to squash any negative feedback, I'm SURE this review won't be published. However, eventually Paychex will be exposed as the den of abuse that it actually is. All you businesses out there, go to a competitor if you want service! Do yourself a favor!!"
bad,"Paychex seemed like the ideal job for me i went through a very long hiring Process 3 interviews in 4 months. The environment was very tense because the staff that was there had been there for many years so everyone was very familiar with each other, so when i came in it was like don't speak to the new Employee....I took it upon myself to be nice and introduce myself to everyone and that turned out OK. The managers were Very unorganized one manger was informed about something but the other two weren't,that caused it to be very frustrating some days,The top Boss was VERY RUDE EVERYDAY she would never speak, walk right pass you in the hall and throw her nose up as if she were better than the staff.She was very unprofessional many days you could hear her screaming to the top of her lungs which was supposed to be a private conversation with her son about a electric bill at a pool hall which had nothing to do with Paychex! but she seemed to not care and we heard the whole convo..The distribution specialist worked with very big, loud and dangerous mail machines but on more than one occasion one of the workers was allowed to bring her son to work and he would run around as if he were home which i thought was very dangerous.The receptionist would walk around the office barefoot and spent more time in the managers office than at her front desk! and if you put anything in the employee refrigerator if you did not mark it with your name do not expect it to be there the next day there was an office food thief which was so annoying like who just steals peoples food.Overall it would have been"
bad,"The company's work model is outdated as with most product offerings. Thus, making the goal of becoming a multi-billion dollar company within two-three years unattainable, unrealistic, and primarily the responsibility of the client facing employees. In addition, the upper-level management is very disconnected from the lower-level employees. Most supervisors and managers here suffer from a lack of experience and subsequently, the suboordinate also suffer from the lack of guidance. There is no understanding of the job roles and what it takes to be successful in it. If there were, then the pay and benefits would be better. The one and only enjoyable part of this job is speaking to your clients on a day-to-day basis and continuing to cultivate those business relationships. It's by far, the most rewarding feeling ever. Once Paychex realizes how much significance the lower-level employees contribution is to the company, work life here will be better."
bad,"I literally walked out and quit yesterday after being there 4 years. In Operations you will receive inadequate training, be underpaid, little guidance by mgmt. team, and impossible workloads. It's helpful for knowledge only because you basically have to teach yourself everything. It's helpful for resumes and experience history. Beyond that it's a waste of your time and not very much room for advancement. The technology is old and constant technical issues. I would not recommend."
bad,"As others stated its not a good fit for true HR professionals. Its all about numbers and revenue, not truly concerned for the clients. Caseloads are ridiculous and unmanageable. Managers are micromanagers. Departments are disconnected, setting unrealistic goals. NO work/life balance. Have to work long hours to manage caseloads. Left a bad taste."
bad,This company was very limited in creating an environment to excel. It was a part-time position which was not enough to provide for a family with.
bad,"I was so glad to have gotten this job....at first. They boast opportunity for advancement and competitive wages. What they do not tell you is that you have to complete tedious coursework to get the raises, and they do not give you time to complete the work on the clock and you cannot do it off the clock. So, those raises are basically unattainable. I experienced many prejudices with this company as well. After 8 months of employment, they started to enforce an attendance policy that was NEVER discussed, and reprimanded me for not completing my tasks which I requested my supervisors help with for WEEKS and did not receive. After realizing that management was incompetent and could not provide the support, I got tired of constantly letting my customers down and looking like a fool bc I was being led by fools. I just left. BEST DECISION EVER !!!"
bad,"Low pay,supervisors cared how to please upper management only.If somebody didn't do their job,it was ok with a supervisor! "
bad,"I worked at a branch with a manager who was rarely in the office. A supervisor who was so micromanaging that she would stand behind you while on a call and talk over you. The pay isn't competitive at all for the work you do, and the entire company basically treats payroll specialists like they are the lowest of the low. I quit as soon as I could."
bad,"The only department that makes money at this company is in sales. The other departments are paid very low, the raises are a joke, people leave and they will not hire another person to fill their role, the moral is very low and depressing, managers are across the state so, you cannot meet with your manager face to face and there is no human resources available unless you contact their headquarters in New York."
bad,The best advice run as far as you can from this company.  It’s not what you know but who you know culture.  Usually the managers are nothing but a sham.  They put you thru a stressful hiring process. Then they send you away to training. To bring you back and start the cat and mouse game with the manager .
bad,Do not work here!  No work life balance and upper management just purely numbers driven. Claims to be ethical and act with integrity but they are far from that.
bad,"After working for Paychex I am glad to have experienced a role in corporate America. I was excited when I initially got the job because they are a large local employer and pillar of the community. After arriving in the office I realized that it was an educationally diverse landscape. I went through training and got along with people there and was exciting for actually doing the job. After the overextended and barely effective training program, I was placed on the floor and in a team. This was great a sense of camaraderie and feeling like I belonged to something. This was the exact opposite. The people on my team weren't as forward thinking as I am. Clearly not as motivated as I either. Eventually, some people were hired after me. These people were nice and I trained three of them closely. The people before me spent more time making fun of me than training me. I was happy to provide a good route for the people after me. I was not paid or truly recognized for my time spent training. Most of the conversations I heard revolved around gossip, drama, or entitlement. This is what after 9 months lead me to leave. I am fortunate to say that after leaving and taking a lower paying job my general level of satisfaction with life drastically improved and now I am on the best path that I could be on. Thanks Paychex for not leading me on to the guise of corporate America."
bad,"Stressful environment, overwork yourself to only be told that a clients payroll was messed up. No respect given by managers or clients. High turnover."
bad,"Like stewards of the Titanic arranging the deck chairs, Paychex has grown to the point they're out of touch with their clients (that exist only to ""increase Paychex shareholder value"") and unable to get out of their own way should there be a good idea.  Their treatment of employees is best summed by by what a VP said ""You should all be grateful to have a job"" and oddly enough, they attract the kind of employees that should be grateful to have a job, any job, and they demonstrate their skills and motivation (the lack of both) daily. The clients are frustrated and aggressive on a good day, worse should things go bad.  With a leadership structure that hasn't changed in years, promotions are few and far between with 0% raises common as they increase the cost of their self-retained insurance beyond what you could get in the open market, so its not unusual to see your take home pay fall every year (which is why the turn over is so high)"
bad,"Overworked, underpaid, unprofessional mgmt system. High Turnover, although the education given there is second to none."
bad,"Paychex consistently finds way to wring more and more out of their already burnt out employees. This can consist of downright prehistoric technology (paychex prides itself on being a technology first company), farcical workloads and impossible time expectations. Furthermore, their cult-ish approach to company culture is truly disturbing. Everyone in the company, often jokes about the low-pay standards and lack of work-life balance."
bad,"You are metaphorically chained to your desk. They are always short staffed. The work load is not evenly distributed. They only care about the shareholders, C Level executives, and management. You are constantly in ""Survival"" mode. There is always an issue that you have to fix that could have been prevented if processes were actually followed. The management team has not had any training. The managers have the title but expect you to do all of the work. The list goes on..... If you want to be bored in an office where you will not grow and you are complacent, go for it!"
bad,Terrible training. Thrown to the wolves. If you try to get help you are made to feel like you are causing problems. They don’t care about the customer.  Internet banking issues caused major screwup for customers. We were reprimanded for taking to much time spent helping customers.
bad,Office is not diverse at all which creates an uncomfortable work environment for minorities. Training is available however workloads are so heavy that there is no time for completion which leaves employees in the same position for years unless you complete training off of the clock. Unrealistic deadlines are pushed down from company execs whom never actually monitor an entry level employee workload.
bad,They blow a lot of smoke and pressure micro manage. NOT a good place to work. It's a revolving door. It is a good place if you like meeting new people cause there is a constant parade of new faces.
bad,Paychex is not a client centric organization.  Really bad leadership that starts at the top.  My interactions with senior leadership have led me to look directly for other employment. Very disappointed.
bad,"Paychex made an unstable work environment to work for as the management and workload were both terrible. The workload expected of you was more than one person could handle, and you had to handle it with grace and dignity as much as you could. The management had no personal connection with their employees and had no time to spend on questions that they felt everyone should know about taxes, payroll, etc. The hardest part of the job was the workload and the expectations set by management. The only enjoyable part of the job were the co-workers as they were going through the same thing you were,"
bad,"RUN, don't walk, away from this bureaucratic, hypocritical, conniving, deceitful organization. "
bad,"You gain a great deal of payroll experience but pay rate is not competitive. You're better off looking elsewhere. There is no overtime allowed, so they will work you to death, literally, and make sure you are out the door by 5pm. So you are packing in 55 hours minimum of work into  40 hours. There are too many tasks placed onto one person and as your job duties are added, you are not given a raise. The stress is a given in this industry but honestly, employees aren't properly compensated for the work they put in at Paychex. The turnover is high which adds to the stress and will continue to be high as long as the pay rate is low. The people are great, you will most likely have 3-4 managers in one year, and job security is solid. If you are a slacker, like to call in a lot, or show up late, its tolerated here. There is also a great deal of communication breakdown between departments and you will most likely gain more knowledge than the supervisors. Promotions? Not really, they would rather hire from outside."
bad,"Relvoving door of employees and managers with no chance of building a long term career. High, unrealistic sales expectations in an over sold market with no support from internal departments"
bad,"Paychex provided a number of opportunities for me for which I'm grateful.  However, they do not want to pay sales leaders for their hard work.  Avoid if you are seeking a high paid leadership role.  only a fraction of leaders are at or above plan."
bad,"I worked there for over 10 years and was laid off due to no part-time positions in the company after my department was eliminated.  When I first went part time after my child was born, my then manager was very supportive.  Then, management was switched around and new manager told me I would have to go full time within 2 weeks or be let go.  I was able to find another part time position within the company, but took a pay cut.  Very few part time positions available."
bad,"Very corporate, every move you make is being watched. Was frowned upon to eat at my desk, felt like could leave desk to use the restroom, with deal of missing an incoming call."
bad,"In the sales position there is no work/life balance. In order to succeed and make good money, one must work evenings getting admin duties done and keep the days open for revenue producing tasks only. It's a very stressful place to work not only for sales but for operations. The operations teams are overworked as well and very stressed and it affects how they work with our clients. Corporate is constantly changing the way things are done in Operations and in Sales and it creates uncertainty and more work for everyone. The company is so focused on hitting a milestone in revenue produced that it is forgetting to see our clients as important. It's all about how much $ the company makes and shortcuts are being taken to ensure we get to that milestone. It's not good. Great company at one time but not any more. It's a shame."
bad,Went to work for Paychex through a temp to hire position. The temp position was extended more then once with no explanation of why.  The management will reprimand you on the middle of the floor with everyone looking. it was a horrible experience.
bad,"Overall, Paychex is a good organization to work for if you are lucky enough to be put into a territory that is lucrative.  It is not a level playing field for all sales reps, however; we are all held to the same standards.  Not all territories are given the same amount of support, tools and necessary resources to truly succeed."
bad,"In Rochester, the pay is lower than many other cities.  Over the course of more than 10 years with Paychex, I had 10 supervisors.  Out of the 10 supervisors, there's only one that I would want to work for again.  The others either had personality quirks or were not supervisor material.  Often people go into supervisor positions based on what they know, rather than a combination of that with people skills."
bad,"No training for job"
bad,"Managers can't see the trees through the forest. Everything including HR is KPM Focused and you have no room for error. I have heard that entry level jobs are a great starter but once you are in a higher position, you may want to watch your back."
bad,"a typical day at paychex is fixing errors caused by other specialist, correcting errors that clients themselves made in the online payroll system. Taking calls and answering emails"
bad,I worked in the ESR dpt at the Undy call center. Paychex is highly unorganized. Management is terrible & encouraged us to lie to clients constantly. The culture is terrible. No one in other department know anything about what other departments do. Most people are rude & miserable. They knowingly file wrong tax forms for their clients to the IRS then take no responsibility when clients call in upset. The supervisors are terrible & know nothing about the job. Low pay as well.
bad,The job was great. The co-workers were great. The management was ran like a high school cafeteria. Promotions and advancements were given based upon who you knew. Mandatory overtime in some departments would exceed legal amounts and you risked. your job if you refused.
bad,"processing and printing payroll"
bad,"If you start working at Paychex as a seasoned professional, you are not given the opportunity to take classes that help you assimilate the culture that younger professionals have been indoctrinated intro since high school. Also, there are many managers who will ""use"" the Paychex culture to weed out older professionals. It is a Stepford Culture. Employees will use the culture as a way of getting back at someone if they have an ax to grind with another employee. And Paychex lets them. HR is a joke. They do not help at all."
bad,Paychex is located in Denver and is very easy to find. Offering 40 hours a week and much room for advancement. Awesome benefits and tons of information to learn.
bad,"Remember the story of Hansel & Gretel when they were led in with treats and buttered up before being stuck in an oven? That's what working for this company felt like. The training provided appeared to be fun with tons of talk of team work. After completing training and not being assessed, the need for bodies on the phones was far greater than properly training specialist. With no structure a new specialist can be assigned senior specialist accounts that require more knowledge and eventually alert the customer at the lack of required information to maintain their account. The position has an extremely high turn over rate which customers will voice due to their confusion of having so many new people handing their accounts."
bad,This overall could be a great company but they look out more for the shareholders then they do employees making the workload and pay unbearable.
bad,"This review is specifically for the Dallas-Irving Branch. Let it be known: The 3 star rating on the compensation/benefits section is for the benefit package ONLY! Definitely not for the compensation."
bad,I did not have a good experience working at this company.  The product was not something I was interested in or passionate about.  It was a turn and burn sales job with little emphasis on building long-term relationships with clients.
bad,took away 401k match based on financials yet the company making a lot of money year over year.  great job to learn straight out of college.  micromanage folks & lots of meetings.
bad,Don't do it. Good place to start. Move on after that. Big workload not enough pay.you process payroll. There is nothing more to say read previous comments.
bad,Everything is passed down from people who no loner do the job or use the tools given to use to do the job.  People doing the job have no say in how the job is done or the tools used to do it.
bad,Micro Managed like crazy at Paychex. Terrible place for someone who is seasoned in sales. Great place for someone to learn how to sell.
bad,Great place to be if you don’t mind being just a number and if you don’t mind a negative office culture. The company itself isn’t a bad company to work for but the leadership style isn’t.
bad,Currently understaffed and focused more on numbers and money than employees or client satisfaction. There is a high turn over rate which can be stressful. Once you learn your role and team environment gets staffed it is a fun and rewarding job. Truly not compensated for work level.
bad,The compnay has a good name in the industry. Not a good place to work. There is no work-life blalance. Pay scale does not comensurate with the position. Hire outside before promoting within.
bad,Inability to achieve goals with limited client base to work with. Multiple EE call same clients daily creating a hostile relationship with clients. Only handful of senior sales people are there for more then 1 year and they receive preferential treatment. Behind the scene lead handoffs happen daily
bad,i struggled with trying to understand what the managers wanted from me in order to sell the services to the existing client base. it was a very complex sale to companies that could not afford it.
bad,"This is an old boys club company especially in the Development area.  If you are not a male you will not be promoted and often times are demoted.  Even not when all other companies are promoting women to work in the IT area."
bad,The leadership has provided a poor vision of the future and changes are made seemingly on a whim.  There is very poor communication and employees at all levels are confused and scared.
bad,Don't have any work life balance and pay and bonus are not good   for all the stress involved. The top managers are leaving. the pay is too low for the job expected. The new VP is terrible and needs a reality check.  He has made a mess of a good company.
bad,"They use antiquated and old technology, and there is no way to advance with this company. They promote people based on friendships and not knowledge or experience. The only enjoyable part of this job was the friendships that I made while I worked there."
bad,Very unorganized. All payroll systems used are not very productive.
bad,"over worked and under paid"
bad,"Customer service levels have continued to decline for our clients, so the net promoter scores have significantly declined and we have marred our reputation with clients and referral partners."
bad,Micro management to the extreme you are constantly watched.Can hardly move from your desk. Are given tasks but not enough time to complete. Over worked and a very stressful environment. You don't get much assistance from supervisors unless its something they are complaining to you about. They set you up for failure  There is always a complaint when calling off or taking off.  Always given a hard time. HR does not help much
bad,"Is a very fast paced environment, work many hrs of overtime, some mandatory, and it goes unappreciated."
bad,Hiring supervisor stated he never intended to hire me.  Did not want me working there and this was in front of all my co-workers. I always felt as if the employees were treated as idiots.
bad,"The controller here has a huge ego and don't you dare have any of your own thoughts, you will be made to feel very small and insignificant.  Our team as a whole has approached management with process improvements and they wouldn't even listen to them.  No changes!!!   Work life balance is non existent.  The owners are very generous, lunch if often provided.  But If you are in the finance department the turn over is very high."
bad,"If you are working in operations at Paychex, you will spend your time looking for another job. Paychex does offer good bandits, but the salaries are deplorable. Expectations are inconsistent with communicated metrics. Paychex offers a number of services which are deployed out of separate silos; these silos do not cooperate with one another and are all run out of the corporate office in Rochester, NY. This creates a mountain of issues for those supporting the products in the field. When something goes wrong, the service silos point the finger at one another and do little to offer solutions and often leave clients with a poor experience. These client experiences bleed into ambiguous surveys which are a signify metric for those supporting clients in the field. The most frustrating part is how upper-management tows the company line, it's borderline comical...ala Office Space. If you are ready to bury your head in the sand and settle into a mind numbing career with no hopes or dreams; Paychex might be the place for you. If you are part of the sales team, life is grand."
bad,"Extremely demanding quotas and your livelihood has a lot to do with your territory.  Turnover is extremely high for sales reps and managers.  The Director is your typical high pressure business bully.  Higher ups and management spend way too much time worrying about dials and phone time equations and pie charts rather than just focusing on selling and developing the referral channels they have.  Very unethical management behavior and the Director/Managers will constantly harass you if you're not meeting your goals when they can't even meet their own.  Since the new Director has been put in place, this division has fallen apart."
bad,"work load was not consistant, very customer orientated worked with many different machines and placed work orders on all of them"
bad,Working in Finance at Paychex was a great learning experience.  The compensation didn't cover the work load unfortunately but I loved my co workers and made life long friendships.
bad,I suggest not to be involve with this co. it not the best co to work for
bad,I was also part of the Training Safety Team in charge of creating and updating safety presentations.  I also provided input to the Safety Manual Review Team and overall Corporate Safety Leadership as well.
bad,"Client load is overloaded, no help, management is unorganized and are on breaks all the time. They do not support their employees. A lot of favoritism & yes ma'am. If you dont like being over stressed and over worked then I would not recommend this company"
bad,On the phone all day. I learned how to cold call. Workplace culture was not motivating. Hardest part of job was rejection and not being able to make quota
bad,"Unfortunately, I ended up with a very poor manager and we could not and did not work well together. It left a very bad taste in my mouth and I left for other employment. In the end, much happier now!"
bad,"Paychex used to be a great place to work until they began releasing products to clients before they worked or trained any employees on them. "
bad,Company prides itself on their values and training. But I found I received little to no day to day support from management or management that was competent in their job duties. Benefits were good but compensation was not comparable to that of other companies within the same field.
bad,Fair cost for health insurance. No remote work opportunities. Nice holiday lunch. Dress is business. Office is often cold so you will need to being a sweater.
bad,"Overall, my experience at Paychex was good, but I'll think twice about going back. I started testing the waters to leave as I felt myself getting overworked prior to leaving. Management doesn't have a good grasp on what we do. They just keep piling it on and decreasing the number of people on each team. I also didn't feel like I didn't have a lot of opportunity for growth and my manager couldn't help with that. My team was great and was the reason getting me there daily. I learned a lot and am thankful for my time there. Compensation is low though as well."
bad,"Paychex does not embrace the values that are so quickly spouted on a daily basis. The management in the Nashville MPSC, specifically is awful! Management has no knowledge or experience of the positions in which they supervise. Management is rude, dismissive, condescending and unprofessional. There is no credit given to the employees that are innovative and hard working. Management ‘controls who attends meetings when corporate comes to visit because they want things t appear perfectly fine. There are a lot of cove ups going on by management to protect themselves while throwing the account managers under the bus. !branch. Management encourages tattletale behavior and have promised the negative individuals leadership positions as long as information is provided"
bad,"Paychex is not a great company to work for.  The management does not know how to communicate to the workers and are at a complete loss when it comes to managing workers schedules.  They will overload you with too many clients because they feel they can and they won't stop-over 400 clients, expect you to stay late and ask for help. They feed you food but that is about it.  They do not realize people have families and lives outside of work.  They provide a poor atmosphere and expect you to fix it for them."
bad,Salary & benefits could be better for the revenue Paychex makes.  Don't expect to move up higher than supervisor if you're not a white male.  Paychex is known for leadership being old white males that hire their buddies.  Most of the work is done by the femaile supervisors & their employees.  Only women in leadership are in HR.  I wouldn't recommend Paychex for anyone looking for a successful & fair career.
bad,"the pay is not great, the culture leaves plenty to be desired but they give you free food on occasion.  The management plays favorites a lot, it just isn't the greatest place to work."
bad,"Depending on the region and/or sales division you are looking at, buyer beware, the turnover can be extremely high and that is not something they like to admit."
bad,"IT Management ruined the positive, productive work environment.  It is now a cut-throat, watch-your-back, get replaced by a cheaper recent college grad work place.  Avoid unless you're inexperienced looking to cut your teeth in corporate america."
bad,This company use to be nice to work for but over the past few years it has become horrible.  There is too much work and not enough people to do it.  Advancement is impossible and the pay is very low.  I do not recommend working for this company unless you have nerves of steel.  Too much stress for minimal pay.
bad,"The job, Payroll Specialist, looked great on paper, but the reality was that it was very stressful, the pay was low given the responsibility and information to which the employees had access, and the company does not treat employees well.  Managers are totally stressed out keeping unhappy customers from bailing, they are quick to throw an employee under the bus.  The company spends a lot of money on training, but unfortunately most of it is garbage.  The trainers are useless, kind of like an old boys or girls network."
bad,"Walk clients through software installs, help coworkers with technical aspects of their jobs, write custom reports, generate & support interfaces between payroll software and other programs: general ledger, Point Of Sale systems, time clocks, etc."
bad,I learned a lot from Paychex.  They have a great sales program and excellent training.  You have to be motivated on your own to exceed but you do have a lot of freedom when you're doing well.
bad,"Excellent benefits, and retirement. Not a lot of room for growth"
bad,Low employee moral and poor employee benefits. Attempted to understaff to minimize department budget.
bad,"I been told, ""It depends upon the branch that one works in"". I guess that it is true. Branches outside of So Cal really seem to appreciate their payroll specialists. The corporate mantra is"" that to the customer, the payroll specialist is Paychex"". Unfortunately, no one within the branch sees that relationship as special. Payroll specialists are treated as one-step removed from the janitor. That is too bad, because we payroll specialists really like building relationships/friendships with our customers. In addition, we also providing the best service that we can so that our customers can concentrate on other areas of their business."
bad,"The best candidates for this position are used car salesmen. If you are relationship driven, this is not a good fit for you. Your success is determined through your ability to self generate business."
bad,I used to enjoy my job but now our jobs are changing and our responsibilities are increasing and we are not being compensated for it. It decreases morale and their new philosophy doesnt work.
bad,"Look at other departments, Not payroll! Managers and top branch managers and district managers always were leaving the company. Things always changed. People always calling off and coming to work late. The work that not being addressed is spread around to add to your already over the top load. Mind you each rep., has about 400 clients (businesses) with each business having 5-100 employees to enter payrolls. Payrolls are sent by Fax, email, or left on your phones voice mail. Also there are error and corrections, garnishments and tax issues that need to always be corrected.  So when a person is late or calls off that adds to your already busy day. The company then pushes you not only to enter but correct any issues causing more delays especially when having to call the client and the calls last 30-1hr!"
bad,I was lied to and misled from the first time in walked in that office for an interview. Not to mention if you don't know someone here you r stuck right where you started. Everytime you turn around there is something new wrong with you and it needs to change. No matter how many tweeks and twerks you make to improve yourself it is never good enough.
bad,"Poor working environment.  Heavy managerial presence. Strong micromanaging."
bad,There is not structure of the jib everything is self learned and as you go. Management does not guide you to success and they do not assist you with your needs
bad,"While Paychex is a fun place to work with many enjoyable activities with co-workers, there is a distinct lack of accountability within management.  Too often, problems weren't addressed properly, or at all by manager."
bad,"Smoke and Mirrors, Management does not follow any of the culture that is forced on employees."
bad,"The company provides decent training, The management is very poor. They are not concerned with supporting the staff or development of talent. Senior management is insulting and condescending."
bad,"Very heavy workload, with minimal training. Management talks about advancement but the positions are just not available, or are filled by outside hires with no experience at all. They are always understaffed which puts added stress and workload on the team. You can expect to always be behind schedule."
bad,"I haven't worked at Paychex for awhile now. It was very antiquated at the time. Refused to use email, for example, but surely they have relented their stance by now."
bad,"This was a great company to work for a long time ago, but several changes have been made and employee's were lost in the shuffle.  As the company evolved it focused more on working for our client base instead of working with them."
bad,"There were many days where there was lack of work.  The company did not have growth opportunities.  There was only work during tax season.  If there was no work you would leave early.  The company only hired through a temp agency,"
bad,"Ok job.  They give you a lot of opportunities to sell using many practices.  There is a lot of turnover and management is kinda sucky and the place where I work is VERY clicky.  I am on my 3rd manager and feel that I really have no true friends that I work with because everyone is already in their own clicks from previous management.  I like that you can expense pretty much everything, get a nice laptop, and get credit for inbound calls but I cant deal with the culture at my office any longer."
bad,"I will say that every team seemed to be a little different. However, in my experience, my co-workers and I were very micro-managed. This caused a high level of stress in the workplace."
bad,"Payroll Sales Company, there was much overlap with Payroll Sales, HR Sales and Retirement Plan Sales.  Most clients felt bombarded by Paychex sales people.  I enjoyed the working with people on my team and other colleagues in different departments."
bad,Nothing to say.. I really have nothing t say that is positive about paychex and the company nor the people that are in lead rolls.
bad,"Cold calling"
bad,"The company has taken the focus off of its more important resource, which is it human resource and is now driven by the shareholders demands."
bad,an amazing learning experience tough work days with unrealistic quotas supervisor staff was not always excellent. learned a lot about payroll and taxes. working with outside sales reps was a great stepping stone to working with business etc
bad,Paychex is a good place to start a career but not the place to stay for a life long career.
bad,"Overworked and underpaid - by a LOT.  Management asks for feedback and then ignores it. Technology is outdated.  There's little or no flexibility with hours or working from home.  Benefits are decent, but not uniquely so, compared to other employers.  Paychex is antiquated in so many areas.  Other than they don't have layoffs, I'm not sure why their reputation is good, but the truth will get out eventually.  Ask around . . ."
bad,The IT staff is under constant pressure to perform. The manager of development is not manager material. He has the wrong temperament for the job. None of the staff likes him. He micro-manages everything and makes unrealistic demands.
bad,"You consistently have to worry about your job. The managers take the word of your clients over you. Your clients could definitely make up a lie and get you fired. Training SUCKS!! You have to train yourself and the managers rarely want to help you. "
bad,good place to work to learn about hr benefits and payroll related laws and taxes. minimal travel for training is appreciated as well. pay is on the lower side though.
bad,"- Territory based "
bad,"Very unstructured and poor management. No training, poor policy, and procedure. Great people and benefits. No training system and poor accountability."
bad,"Joined Paychex with an expectation of moving up within a year or two. After 15 months, applied for a position and my leader at the time refused to approve in spite of the fact that I was more than qualified."
bad,"I learned a lot about the workplace culture at Paychex.  A typical day at work was high paced."
bad,"Paychex is a stable employer.  Compensation is below industry standard unless you're in Sales.  Company culture preaches work/life balance, but is actually focused solely on the bottom line."
bad,may vary from location to location but in my time at Paychex I experienced a poor management team with lack of experience in the industry.Management was constantly negative The environment was also very cutthroat from Sr Sales team .
bad,"Overall the company is great to their employees. Training lasts for 5 weeks and after that you are handed a large client base and left to fend for yourself. Management is poorly run because they expect too much out of people and not prepared to help employees who are struggling and have asked for help. Pay should be increased to more than $13 an hour because the responsibilities are endless and not explained well. Basically felt like I was drowning and no one could offer support. A feeling that most employees have here. Not to mention only a handful of employees have been here for more than a year and they have 14,000 employees nationwide. Should raise a flag."
bad,"It was my managers way, or the highway. Would not recommend this person for anything. Horrible experience. Really wish I wouldn't have wasted my time."
bad,"we remained very busy -- but it was very boring work."
bad,"I had a manager that did not know what he was doing so it was impossible to have him help me when I struggled.  His boss was much more reasonable."
bad,"The person who started this company created an environment where hard work isn't rewarded, mostly because it decreases the profit."
bad,Paychex has become the typical call center.  It is more about numbers and stats then about people.  They continue to pile on the work but do not give you the tools and support to succeed.
bad,"This place was nice to work at, but the managerial procedures to handle issues for customers were very poor. Getting various issues addressed was at times impossible as departments fought over who should be addressing the issue."
bad,"I crossed over from ""operations"" to sales thinking it would be a great move and was very disappointed. I never received the training that I should and management was very unorganized and ""wishy washy"". I would not recommend working as an assistant of any sort for Paychex sales."
bad,Benefits are good and many locations across the country so if you have to move you can.
bad,There is an over abundance amount of work with not enough people and support.
bad,People are constantly leaving the company and they are not replacing the people that are leaving. They just add more work to the current specialists.   The pay is also not enough for the amount of work that you do.  They do offer good time off and the benefits are good
bad,"I am very disappointed in Paychex due to lack of training, I expected more.  In IT department, training does not exist, it's all on the job training from senior IT employees, which there is no time to train. Projects are given to teams and must be executed, any additional skills that is needed then that is done on your own time.  I am all for learning new things, in fact I want to learn but not the way they wanted me to learn"
bad,"Our branch has been unable to keep people in the Payroll specialist role. There has been a high amount of turnover for years. They burn new people out too quickly and use long term employees to maximum capacity. They have a habit of over assigning client bases resulting in overtime almost everyday of the week, yet they do not want to pay anyone for overtime and try to make you leave early a different day, which only makes you fall behind even more. They are taking away bonuses by making it nearly impossible for anyone to earn it. Communication between the different departments is strained at best. Expect to work Saturday's just to get caught up. There used to be work life balance and now it is minimal. Paychex implemented many changes this year and did not seem to have an actual step by step plan. Many employees were left wondering what their jobs were or if they still had one due to centralization. It has been extremely reactive rather than proactive. For all their expectations they do not pay well enough. You will never be told you did a great job, always what you could have done better. I do not believe they know what a compliment sandwich is."
bad,"The Branch Manager in the Pittsburgh office is clueless. He used to be the CFO at Chi Chi's (do you remember what they did?). He has no idea what our product is, has no idea how to resolve issues, has no people skills, and turns all his work over to his staff. He, himself, does nothing for this office. And this is a shame because Paychex is a good company. They are technically a little behind in the times but are basically a good place to start a career. Just stay away from Pittsburgh unless you love high stress and decisions that make no sense."
bad,"Paycheck is a good job to learn 3 years ago, now with all the changes is just a place where the pay is the minimum and the duties are very demanding, your portfolio has at least 300 companies and each one must have less than 50 employees which is not the case 100%. however the employees knowledge is great to learn from."
bad,"if you get in good with someone in management or a large clicky group, then you are ok. otherwise you are just another employee to them. I did like my job.  I liked being given ability to make decisions and not have to go to management for approval."
bad,I have been very surprised as to how many people I have met who are here at Paychex because it simply pays the bills. The company seems to be behind the eight ball when it comes to leading the charge in the space it plays in. Very commoditized space.
bad,"Great group of people to work with friendly and supportive. Tough sales meeting goals every month push people to sign on the line, lots of up selling."
bad,Good company for starting your career but be prepared to have nothing work correctly and the expectation to work around it no matter what.  Despite having system issues the general consensus is that the company under pays their employees but do have good benefits.
bad,"Good pay but unfair treatment to their employees. Typical day, I would be given a project with no proper training...their reason for that is saying ""well, we just took on this position so no really has had they proper training."" Co-workers were awesome and agreed with my opinion. Hardest part was not being able to speak to a manager or supervisor who understood my reasons on why a project was not helping anyone and doing something about it. Also, losing my job because I stood up for myself and co-workers."
bad,Great place to work but the management is awful. outside sales job but you get micro managed everyday. hostile working environment between managers and coworkers.
bad,"As far as non-Sales goes, this 3 billion dollar company gives low wages and minimal bonus/employee appreciation. They are flexible with days off and work/life balance, but you get different rules/perks based on your team even with in the same department. "
bad,"At one point I loved my job and the company, but the management has gone downhill, the pay is not appropriate to the workload and expectations, and the company tries to put out new programs or procedures without thinking it through."
bad,The pay isn't very good for the workload that you receive on a daily basis.
bad,This company used to be one of the top companies to work for. Now all they care about is money. They do not treat their employees with respect. The job becomes very stressful at the end of each quarter and year. There is really no enjoyment out of the job except the benefits. The managers are never on the same page which causes frustration among co-workers.
bad,"If you are looking for a postion with Paychex, the main opportunities are in the Human Resource position and Major market payroll Sales.  Remote workers are treated like the outcast and if you dont fit in with the main team- good luck."
bad,"I've learned a lot about myself over the last 6 years working for this company, but caring about their people can be hit or miss.  This job is busy and keeps you on your toes.  I would say the hardest part, is if you're not doing your job well, they don't have a lot of opportunity for support or coaching, just write ups and lectures, unless you have a decent supervisor.  The continuous restructuring and constant team changes leaves everyone feeling undervalued and just out of touch."
bad,"When I started, I would constantly be asked by my co-workers 'are you sure you are ready for this?"". I should have known then that I wouldn't like this position. This is essentially a call center job. You are constantly busy and that causes mistakes. I feel like I spend as much time fixing mistakes as I do helping my clients. On the plus side, the people who work for the company are so nice and helpful. I only wish I loved my position."
bad,"I process payroll for 300 + clients, and assist them with online processing through Paychex Flex application. I also confirm that all clients remain in compliance with all tax agencies, and confirm we are making timely and accurate deposits. I also amend returns and build custom reports for record keeping."
bad,"The knowledge you'll obtain from this job is substantial and very useful, however there are a lot of internal miscellaneous things such as billing a client or handling tax notices or direct deposit audit reports that you'll learn along he way and may not always be prepared for. You're essentially a jack of all trades as a payroll specialist. We call the clients for payroll, receive faxes for payroll, have them call in the payroll to us, some clients do their payroll online and we train them, we amend returns (time willing) but there is no standard pricing for a lot of the services we provide such as the billing for amendments, we handle tax notices (there was one designated person in our office that handled amendments and tax notices as well but if you're feeling the pressure of getting it done quicker, you were on your own), etc. "
bad,Not a fan of the company. Good for people who enjoy strict corporate lifestyle with lower than average pay. Not the worst place but far from the best. Look elsewhere if you want meaningful employment. Paychex felt like a good place to find a job but not a meaningful career.
bad,Paychex is a good company in order to start your sales career as they give you great training and sturcture. I am grateful to Paychex for my career starting
bad,"I find that my job at Paychex offers very little room for advancement and growth.  We are very limited in the scope of work we are allowed to perform, and in the way in which that work can be performed."
bad,"Interesting place to be employed, either it's a fit for you or it's not."
bad,"A rough environment. Dysfunctional management team applauds and rewards pessimism, condescension, and arrogance. Non-type A personalities need not apply."
bad,"This place is okay if you are stating out of college, but I would not recommend it for anyone who has great sales experience, because the pay is too low."
bad,"I would answer calls from Paychex employees that needed help with their computers and try and resolve their issue."
good,"Mostly the p and c dept and wasnt always like this only since our new director took over. Micro managed number of dials a day,  sales are given away if you take time off"
good,Paychex prides themselves on taking care of their employees. Employees were over worked underpaid and never received a good job even if it meant I would stay til 8:00PM to get everything done for the next business day.
good,"Work has many factions and cliques and is filled with people who went to same high school in Rochester. Expect favoritism, benefits good and there are some good people."
good,"As a long time employee, I've seen the culture change drastically, and although paid time off is great, being a human individual is non-existent. I would not recommend the Jacksonville office. There is ZERO employee engagement, and the site manager for this office has a power complex, yet performs his job poorly."
good,"This is a great stepping stone to get started in outside sales experience. However, high turnover and lack of resources create unrealistic expectations."
good,It was perfect as far as what the work could have been with great management and culture. But it's more about cliques and the management was no good. I think it's good work but the workplace vibe is everything.
good,"The job was super easy and great pay, small team. No real training, and the manager showed PLENT of favoritism. If the employees didnt like you they showed it and talked about you. Poor ethics"
good,"Paychex is a fine company overall, but the management they hired to take the Lake Mary MMS team is horrible. The manager has no idea what he is doing and is creepy."
good,"Not enough hours in the day to complete tasks.Work is loaded upon specialists, especially those who show any abilities. Management is unsympathetic and lacks voice in corporate decisions. Paychex would rather hire out of state and have employees managed virtually"
good,"I serviced a client based of 190 every month consisting of weekly, bi-weekly, semi-monthly, and monthly payrolls. Often I was given payrolls of other reps that were out of the office for the day due to my speed and accuracy. When I became ill with Cancer and needed help myself I didn't find the company sympathetic to my needs."
good,"This was an okay place to work. Worked in 401k Department and training is too short compared to the type of calls that you receive. "
good,Great place to start a Sales career. Great Company with a great portfolio of services to offer. Horrible Work/Life Balance. Micromanagement with total lack of care and respect for people with families. Great if you're single.
good,"Company offers good training, advancement is difficult. The will be relocating out of San Diego soon. The employee morale is very low."
good,"Learned a lot about payroll"
good,"The management is very poor, there is no appreciation, no communication, and too many changes at once. They expect too much from their employees, a help very little. But management is what makes or break a company."
good,Unrealistic expectations mixed with a undefined plan on how the role is to done made the role horrible. In addition the leadership did very little to nothing to help improve SDR's ability to book appointments.
good,"Sales dept does not offer merit increases, base salary is 32k, and has a poor commission structure.  Most reps will make much less than industry standard."
good,"The benefits for Health, Dental , and Vision were good, but management would change our role on a regular basis and demand more without compensating us for it.  The job description had not been updated since the department was formed and the role has evolved several times since then. That is how HR justifies our pay based on an outdated job description."
good,"If you choose to work at Paychex, use it as a resume builder. They are not a company that provides the most flexibility, most stock options or the best comp plan. Get in for the training and get out."
good,"If you're not adept for change this is NOT the place for you. Being aware of ongoing changes is crucial to your success. A keen eye for identifying change possibilities is crucial as well. Prepare for many many schedule changes and ability, many managers are pressed for progress and process improvement and that is laid at the feet of those working under them . Work/life balance is the culture but rarely enforced or followed."
good,"shifting to work overseas.  great benefits, sub-par pay.  not recommended.  no work-life balance.  most (not all ) departments ruled by fear.  highly political."
good,"The company has a solid product and, the company is an industry leader. But, I question the company's willingness to advance people of color to management."
good,Training is great. Lateral movement is encouraged. Career advancement is slim unless you have a friend in Leadership. More opportunities in the NY (Corporate) offices.
good,There were many things that were great at Paychex Inc. within 4 years. I was able to learn a lot and progress my way through the duties and positions required of me. There was not much assistance in the way of that learning and the company has gone through so many changes that proved of little value to all their employees. I happened to be one employee that took a path with the company that would later get trimmed up. That would have left me to unfavorably return to an old position in which I left for a reason and could see absolutely no benefit to returning. Upon my refusal of that position I was left with no other real options that made me feel comfortable. I often had no supervision or very little. I would have to explain the same situations over and over through the shifting and it got to be too disorganized and unproductive. There didn't appear to be a solid future in remaining with Paychex and the stability was not there when it came to restructuring their company.
good,"Paychex has a great local reputation. Having worked there for over 10 years and in 5 separate divisions, I can say that the reality does not hold up to the reputation. New employee training and development is lacking. Workloads and expectations are unrealistic. Management is more focused on numbers and performance than they are about developing the people they have. Morale overall is lackluster. The people who work there are great, and happily support each other. They do this even when management does not support them."
good,"Is a good company to work for, but the work life balance is missing. The pay is ok, but compared to some of the other companies in the industry we are paid at the lower end od salary"
good,"Working for Paychex was great, but  the employee retention wasn't very good people were constantly quitting and employees territories were always changing after months of building up your clientele the Manager's would just take it all away from you and move you to a new territory where you would have to start all over again, making it very difficult to be successful. There were 8 employees that left within the year on the team I was apart of. It really lowers the moral."
good,great beneftis. work life balance isn't there. you will be overworked and underpaid. it seems like 4th quarter never ends. training isn't there either.
good,This seems to be the Paychex way. They promise the moon and the stars in your interview but you'll quickly learn that the pay is very low for the avg employee.
good,"typical day at work is to come in and call clients for payroll you have to know tax liabilities. for the ,most part management is very helpful but the trainers are not helpful at all , if you ask a question they act like it is an inconvenience. the hardest part in taking on clients as a new specialist after the last one did not follow through with things that needed to be completed for the client like tax issues"
good,"Not a bad place to get your start in outside sales. Management was inconsistent at times, but overall was adequate and gave the impression that they care about your progress and about you personally. Coworkers and environment could use improvement. Product is not an easy sell, and territories are often lopsided."
good,"Paychex is more of a call center if you are in payroll"
good,At paychex I felt very underappreciated and looked over. When I first started with the company i felt it would be great to advance at the organization but i learned that they dont look to promote
good,"Not a good fit for a true HR professional.  Management style more suited to Sales people, not HR.  Its all about the revenue and numbers; heavy client load.  Quantity wins over Quality every time.  The department Queen makes most that work with her miserable with her back stabbing and sabotage tactics."
good,Very high pressure but overall a good company with good benefits. The training provided with this company is also world class.
good,"Great for sales experience, low paying and depends on the territory that you get."
good,"The people you work with are great.  Management often had unfair expectations in regards to workload.  Training is forced on people and therefore, worthless."
good,"Started optimistic, training was a comedy of errors, territory has been worked over, lots of driving, very little partner support despite good intentions"
good,The workload can be stressful but it was the environment and attitude of management that made working here miserable. You are treated as a number with no value. Management does not attempt to understand or learn the jobs they are managing. The moral in the office is low throughout the team.
good,Interesting company of do as I tell you and dont mind management. The policies are not applicable for all employees or supervisors. There are favorites and not a positive culture.
good,Paychex was  difficult environment to grow and thrive in. Most decisions were made based on the bottom line and not the overall well being of the employee.
good,"Bad:  Stressful, unappreciative, middle level management not good."
good,For the most part a great company.  They will work you to death and HATE to pay OT.  Continued employee education.  Management fails to clean out problem employees.
good,"After several years with the company, I experienced many facets of the business model and several  management styles. I began a positive working relationship with great management and moderately flexible hours, and reported to a very understanding supervisor who worked with each team member individually to ensure that career goals were met and work-life balance was achieved. "
good,"Paychex is changing the focus of the company. While I welcome change, I believe they are moving in the wrong direction. What used to be a client and employee focused business has now essentially become a call center."
good,The managers couldn't be bothered to show you anything. Immediate supervisor didn't even take the time to show anything and just asked someone else to show me the ropes. Doesn't bother looking at work.
good,Training is not extensive or specific enough for the roll of Payroll Specialist. Pay is extremely low for the work that is performed. Location is very difficult to get to and from ( Jacksonville Fl ).
good,Way too much nepotism.  Friends hiring friends.  I work in an environment that requires concentration attention to detail.  However I am surrounded by college graduates whose only concern is what time happy hour starts.  It can be extremely frustrating at times.
good,Extensive but mundane training sessions that hit a null point and had no more content to review. They made the entire training period even more so prolonged than it needed to be.
good,"work environment was good, employee's were pleasant, no room for advancement, or salary increase. Supervisor, was not the most pleasant person to work with."
good,"I began with Paychex as a Payroll specialist. The management is spread so thin that you basically have to train yourself. When you're finally (after 4-6 weeks of self-directed online training) assigned clients you find yourself faced with a multitude of tasks, questions, and issues that you are not qualified to handle. Clients are sold an accountant and are provided an undergrad with google. The volume of calls is mind boggling and we often found ourselves working through breaks and our UNPAID lunches. I did enjoy my co-workers but the sheer volume of work and the complexity of the tasks required made it nearly impossible to enjoy. Expect to be a payroll provider, an accountant, an assistant, an HR representative, a bookkeeper, and an IT support rep for just under $30,000."
good,most fun part of job was working with co-workers from all over country to resolve issues with leads going to them after I found correct branch thru zip code research.
good,"A typical day at work was pretty straightforward, I would get assigned the incoming 401k and S125 sales from the previous day and onboard clients accordingly.  I learned many things, including a great deal about emotional intelligence, better communication skills, how to manage people and personalities both below and beneath me within the hierarchy of the company.  I learned about 401k plan administration and 401k plan rules and 5500 tax filings.  The hardest part of the job was asking for help if/when I needed it, the culture of the business tried to encourage asking for help and/or asking questions when needed but in reality people who asked for help or questions in my department were viewed in a negative light.  The most enjoyable part of the job is you were left to your own devices and able to organize your day however you saw fit, you could even work and listen to music with headphones on while you worked.  My co-workers were great, we were all overworked but most of us would always help one another whenever and wherever we could."
good,The workload is soul crushing. You will be buried under the work and managers will not assist you. It is the biggest example of sink or swim employment I have experienced.
good,"Management not supportive, deceptive, unethical work practices. Policies not adhered to, everything is an exception. Individuals not held responsible for sup-par work. Benefits ++"
good,"Management uses scare tactics on their employees and views the employee as just another number."
good,"My week consists of setting up 8 new prospect appointments. Asside from the normal cold calling,  In addition, I meet with CPA's, business banker, commercial bankers, current clients and Independent insurance agents in order to prospect and obtain new business."
good,"Paychex' is no longer investing in their Illinois Branch.  They are not replacing employees that leave the company.  Although there have not been any layoffs, there are less opportunities and the future is uncertain.  Work-life balance is very poor due to ""blocked time"" policy."
good,Management at the branch level was inexperienced and non supportive.
good,"Constant changeover of management , good benefits, good pay, but pay will decrease if you consistently hit your goal...kind of a punishment for doing well."
good,"Paychex seems to have a good culture overall and the people are great to work with and smart.  That said, IT Leadership is lacking, and does not develop people, they merely have a few that are good at advancing the IT Business goals. In my time there I saw very few that were good with developing the workforce and advancing people's careers.  They need to spend less on the latest and greatest technology and more on learning how to gain and retain great people.  The amount of turnover I noted in the time I was there was alarming."
good,"There are many good aspects of the company and it's culture.  Unfortunately they are a ""small"" company trying to be a ""big"" one.  This is due to growth through acquisition.  The culture has not aligned to the size of the company.  This will need to be addressed."
good,"Typical day was cold calling and networking with payroll partners."
good,"-Work-Life balance is difficult to achieve "
good,"Has been a few years since I left, was in ES Support for 10 years.  Company was great first few years, but upgrade from legacy to new platform was rough, then had to learn how to support and interface with numerous departments and cross training became the word of the day (do multiple jobs but no pay increase).  Things did get better with better SLA guidelines but determining who you had to reach out to and get issues resolved usually never straightforward.  Had to juggle calls and also support chats and getting head count near impossible, expected to do more with less constantly.  Only had a bonus given 1 year out of 10, was lucky to get stock options early but they cut back on grants of those as well in later years."
good,"A typical day at work would be  a mix of proactive telephone marketing, email follow ups, cold calls and sales presentations along with administrative responsibilities.  "
good,"Paychex culture and values were very big when interviewing. After having the job for a while, the harder you work there, the more work of other people you have to do. Also when interviewing they talk about room for advancement, but they are really just moving horizontally to another department and not actually advancing."
good,"Sales can and was a fruitful position.  However, quotas became very high and pressure increased.  As i mentioned, due to operational errors, clients were lost and sales teams took the hit financially."
good,"Lots of busy work.  Always felt overmanaged.  The meetings seem to just try and cram material but don't have the feel a true sales meeting should possess...In fact, many facets of the company seem lackluster in this way."
good,Over the 28 years I have worked at Paychex the culture has completely changed. Benefits are great but the management no longer seems to care if the employees are happy actually doing their job. The pace is very stressful but it does make the time fly. Being able to work from home is the greatest benefit.
good,"Employees were expected to work with many different managers, each with different systems and requirements. "
good,"the company was relax and the pay was low, I was a temp whom was promised an interview but never was granted one. If seem like the tanning was little to none shank or swim"
good,There is a large amount of variability in the atmosphere based on which department you work in. The most uniform problem throughout the company is that they are cheap and do not want to compensate us based on industry standards. Everything also seems to be relatively half-assed around here.
good,"Work life balance is a plus, beyond that the culture is horrible, management is horrible and the favoritism is dependent on corporate games and more. You are treated as a number, not employee."
good,Management needs to focus on client service and engagement and stop increasing the amount of admin work they are assigning to associates so we can focus on our clients more.
good,"Great place to work! A typical day at Paychex is telemarketing prospects, Salesforce Management, meeting with prospects and selling full Hire to Retire technology."
good,"No job security, previous management was more concerned about themselves than they were about employees.  After several years of employment seasoned employees were laid off while others remained."
good,"Management has a serious goal of Billions in Revenue within the next 3 to 5 years, so instead of realizing that to do so they need to invest in their people, they have cut people (not replaced retirees or people leaving the company) and now just about every service level employee is overburdened with work with no adjustment in pay for the additional work."
good,Management fails to listen to employees other than that its a pretty good company they try to do things for the employees but fail on the work load
good,"Data entry of commercial payroll from clients for processing payroll, records and taxes.  Enjoyed my co-workers and work load."
good,"Paychex is a good company to work for if you are looking to transition into outside sales. They provide great training, and you will learn many of the best practices for success."
good,I felt that branches further away from corporate had a set of their own rules and priorities not exactly aligned with what should be happening.
good,"A typical day at work consists of listening to 3-4 voicemails from clients that i've already talked to months ago that don't understand that I'm not their direct point of contact and reading emails from other clients and our sales representatives who get upset when they dont get what they want now. We call clients for onboarding and most of the time if they're not complaining about how everything else has been screwed up, they're irritated about how the sales rep swindled them. The people I work with are great, but this company has no idea how to hire the best person for the job. We aren't paid enough for what we do--there is literally no time for a break, much less an hour lunch. The company also has no idea how to keep employees--apparently over working and underpaying everyone except management and sales is something that's still a mystery. "
good,"8-5 Monday though Friday job, co workers are nice and make it worth it"
good,Large corporate environment with many leadership responsibilities daily.
good,"Good place to work for; management is open and helpful, co-workers are friendly. I have learned a lot about tax laws but do not enjoy the sedentary position."
good,"As in any sales role, activity and persistence was key at Paychex.  The amount of qualified calls you made to determine if it was a good business fit was significant in your compensation and level of success.  Management was helpful in attempting to provide a fun environment with games and contests to motivate people to succeed."
good,ɢood place to workˌ below averaɡe pay but everyone is friendly and itˈs a solid company
good,"The company continues to look good on the balance sheet, but upper management struggles with managing change. The product set is weak in the marketplace, and the long-term question of whether or not the portfolio of services can be truly valuable remains to be seen. The work environment, consequently, is unstable and often emotionally charged."
good,Team is too small to manage the work that is delivered and is unable to get additional headcount.  The expectation of what needs to be done and in the timeframe given results in poor implementation.
good,Great work environment. Supervisor was a very nice and caring woman. Colleagues were great to work with as well and very helpful. Wasnt the easiest work to do though.
good,"Paychex was very enjoyable to work for for the first 7 years I was there.  They brought in new IT management in the last 2 years I was there and they replaced established managers and employees with people they knew from the new managers last company, thereby driving over 200 well qualified IT people to pursue other work."
good,"Loved working at Paychex, love my Branch Manager at the time of employment, however new manager made significant changes and I was laid off due to personal dislike"
good,very demanding on their expectations and have a problem with although they have a great training program they will put you in the field to meet goals set on manager and postpone training because of the managers demands on them.
good,Easy work environment. Employees are hard workers. Company has events and training.Easy going and you are not micromanaged. Technology is pretty up to date.
good,"Somethings are better left unsaid. My experience with Paychex was great I loved my job. I was pressured and stressed out to obtain certain expectations. that were obtainable. The lack of training to accomplish your goals was extreme. Although if you did make friends with someone that knew everything you could easily get the training and knowledge crucial to servicing clients in an excellent manner. "
good,Individual work ethic needed. Left alone to travel B2B daily. Cold calling and knocking on doors in Arizona was the hardest part. The most enjoyable part was the compensation when achieving above average quotas.
good,"Learned about customer experience. The workplace is conservative but, friendly. Only a temp job so I am not the most reliable source for long-term employment,"
good,Pauchex is a Great place to learn alot about payroll. Good people to work with. Pay was not comparable to the amount of training they make you go thru
good,It's a fine place to work if you don't report to a supervisor. Most are 10 year veterans that think it's a requirement to put up with a meat grinder culture to move ahead. Meet your quota only to have it raised next month.
good,Management is fair but plays favoritism. Extremely cut throat environment. long hours. Good training and good benefits. base salary is low. no work/life balance. Very competitive colleagues. No comraderie..
good,"There is potential to do very well.  Avenues of getting new opportunities from internal partners and total compensation is better than most.  "
good,this company is fast pace with quota's for calling and the same for goals of sales achieved.  Advancement is difficult due to the size and number of applicants applying for positions.
good,Senior employee can have pretty good benefits.  Taking time off at the last minute is pretty flexible in certain areas.  Too much management and not enough room for advancement or movement to other departments without taking a pay cut!
good,"Okay place to work for starters. Low salary, hard to make a lot of money. College culture and everyone wants to go drink and party. Back end departments that handle payroll and implementation and sales don't communicate the best. There are a lot of issues with clients payrolls and service."
good,"If everyone in the company shared the same passion for serving the clients it would be a greater place to work. Majority of the people are there to make money, not serve the clients."
good,"Great culture and people. Was a much better place to work a few years ago. Management making lots of changes recently increasing the workload dramatically, although they always say it will make things better which is the opposite of what happens. Extremely stressful work due to workload. Even worse in Implementation division."
good,"the work environment was bustling and seemed friendly but competitive, my trainer was less than enthusiastic to share too much information. I was able to gather the info that I needed from other employees."
good,"Learned payroll processes. Telemarketing, prospecting, meetings, referrals.  Management could have been better.  The hardest part of the job is the operations in sync with sales department."
good,"They claim to have the best training program in the world.  Beware that means they have a lot of training provided however you will be training yourself.  "
good,"During my time here,  I met a lot of great people. I gained a lot of knowledge.  I also learned how to set goals which will help me move down my career path."
good,"Although the culture and environment is great to work in you're more likely to get promoted if you're someone's friend than actually putting in work. It was stated upon hiring that I'd need to be in my position for a year before I could advance anywhere else. They seem to only advance people in one office and the employee they chose over me had only worked there for 6 months. No matter how hard you work, if you don't know the right people then you're going no where. I have put in literally twice the work than most other employees but my supervisor seems to want to keep me in my same position with no growth options."
good,"	Monitored the submission of approved time sheets, and assured valid data transfers."
good,"Reporting, checking emails, always in Sales-force for updating and making sure revenue was correct.  Audited invoices against load and Sales-force.  Handled On-boarding with all new hires and heavy job training with all new hires for the first 6 months.  "
good,"Paychex was a great company 10 years ago, but they started cutting positions and it has gone downhill since then.  The payroll specialist are over worked, and under paid. In my position the chance of advancement is very rare.  I use to enjoy my job, but now the cuts have made it very difficult."
good,"Paychex has undergone a lot of changes recently so the road is quite bumpy at the moment. However, these changes have allowed for cross training, development, work from home and flex schedule options. A typical day at work would be troubleshooting technical issues while handling client concerns regarding payroll and HR related questions. I have learned a lot about technology, taxes, IRS process and procedures as well as state laws."
good,I worked for this company for 8 years and it has undergo some structural changes that no longer suit my lifestyle. Great job with great pay and benefits.
good,"Been with them for 6 years, and advanced quickly for 3 years and then got stuck and no more movement really after, pay is a little below average.  Management for the most part is in their own little world, but the people you work with are fun for the most part."
good,"People are being shuffled in and out of roles with little communication; front line employees have been left in the dark; productivity numbers continue to increase (i.e. ""do more with less""), and 150 people were just laid off. New SVP was clearly hired to make company leaner, but engagement and morale are being directly affected. Stock price is increasing, but on the backs of front line employees who are being asked to do the impossible-serve 300+ clients with the best service possible-good luck with your 150 emails (no exaggeration) per day all while making $18 per hour. People are leaving for a reason-could earn a similar wage in a much less stressful environment, and the culture has completely eroded. "
good,Work was busy...took on many other departments and job duties. My co-workers are the ones that made it such a fun and great place to work.  I really enjoyed my job.
good,"- just taking calls "
good,"Over-worked, understaffed. Everything is a priority."
good,Great place to start your career after college if you are considering B2B sales.
good,"This company is a nice company is a good company to work for. They have great benefits and the other employees are exceptionally caring. The only issue with this company is their training is terrible. They don't really have procedures for anything you kind of learn as you go. If a supervisor doesn't like you, you might as well quit. They have so much power."
good,"Paychex used to be known as a ""Great Place to Work"" "
good,"Call people all day long"
good,"Ive been working at Paychex for a year now and trying to get promoted outside of sales and it might be the hardest thing ever. I took the job since I couldn't find a job anywhere in my field locally (sports). Working as an entry level sales rep to generate leads for the outside sales reps is the worse structure I've seen for a job. The best part is that sales is apart of measuring you're success when you have no control on the outside sales rep selling the products. There is a lot of empty promises when you take the job, after a year they wanted you to move on and get into another position. If you aren't looking to get into a sales career then this wouldn't be a place to start."
good,"Good stable job but not much incentive to stay pay wise, but great place to get your foot in the door."
good,"This is a very fast paced and high pressure job. Over all it was a good company and probably the best in the payroll industry. There is a lot going on at all times and many things to balance at once while upholding quotas. There is a ton of paper work as well. This is a 100% prospecting position with minimal to no account management for clients. There are many ""moving parts"" to the business that require constant probleme sovling. It is a large corporation which has a lot of rules, not a lot of flexibility,requires high compliance, and has rigid managment. This position is a great opportunity for someone early on in their sales career to gain experience. Good experience, but not for me in the long term."
good,Good job security and a lot of training. The fun committee is wonderful
good,"Great if you have tax knowledge, fast paced environment on going training"
good,"okay put looking for position that pays more.  the company has a great culture and great benefits but often it's too many people working on the same issue, when it could really be built into one position that pays a lot more"
good,I enjoy working at Paychex. Direction and motivation from middle management was very consistent. Not so for the upper management. The turnover of sales reps was sometimes astonishing
good,"This is a highly fast paced environment.  Must be adaptable to change, since policies and procedures change consistently.  I believe they pay on the lower side of competitive wages, depending on the position."
good,I was originally drawn to Paychex for the office environment.  The group interview I participated in showed a highly engaged group of individuals who enjoyed working together.  The atmosphere has since degraded and the majority of people I once worked with have now moved on.    The overwhelming reason for most people leaving was the shift in corporate focus away from servicing the client and more focus on data/numbers.
good,"Programmers are very professional. Gain knowledge on your own.  Limited training programs.  I can't say much, but good place to work.  "
good,Very nice coworkers. Training was not the best as the trainers were not there to answer  your questions if needed. It was a lot of training yourself with modules. Good work ethics. Pay was fair but very stressful and rude customers.
good,"This is a fair company.  However, not much room for advancement in the office once you are placed in.  the lower level positions do most of the communication with the clients.  Hard to navigate who to go to within organization."
good,"I greatly appreciated my time at Paychex. My goal was to find a company to teach me about B2B sales quickly and support my financial desires. "
good,"Call center setting & expected to answer client questions and end conversation ASAP. You will answer anywhere between 40-60 calls a day and are expected to keep conversation & document call in less than 13 minutes. "
good,"Paychex had an excellent training program, good benefits and pay.  Smaller offices didn't get the recognition as the larger offices.  The people and friendships were the most enjoyable.  The culture was ok."
good,"Young, outgoing team members, respectful to each other, nice to be around. Could be more training in specific areas to be more successful. "
good,"Some of the work there was engaging and interesting (early on in the contract period), some (in the latter part of the contract) was mundane seemed to totally ignore my actual skill set."
good,"I worked at Paychex briefly.  They provided comprehensive training that included a trip to their corporate office in Rochester, NY.  While the daily work was predictable, there was always work to do."
good,I have worked here for 19 years. some things have changed but most have not. We have a huge focus on culture and talk a lot about it and our values. Thanks!
good,this was just a temp job that I had for Paychex.  The company is a great place to work.  I did several odds and ends for them but would definitely consider looking into a full time position.
good,"everything is online via Skype and webinars, I am still currently in the training phase before I can actually get my own customers and clients, but it is a lot of computer remote trainings."
good,A very strong company to work for however they put a lot on their employees.  Most employees work to much or hard and often burn out.  The company does pay pretty well.
good,In my opinion they held back the sales force with too many meetings cutting down our ability to sell as much as we could have.  The freedom was great and the expectations of 12 appointments per week was some times hard to get.
good,I am in Insurance Sales at Paychex. Everyone has their own territory and works with partners to deliver insurance coverage to Paychex clients. Good team environment.
good,If you want to learn how to be successful in sales and have no experience you should consider Paychex. They will train you on the sales cycle from start to finish and make sure you are a skilled activity monster by the time you are finished there when you do leave.
good,"A typical day including entering payroll for the client base that has been assigned to you.  This also includes taking care of all aspects of payroll as well which included employer taxes, tax notices, adding/removing new employees/independent contractors."
good,"I have grown a lot and learned so much within my career here. For the most part the dynamic is awesome. The work is challenging, but the company does ensure you are prepared with insight training and mentor assistance. They offer amazing benefits and perks and bonuses. My only grievance is compensation. Some positions are not compensated well enough for the work load. Some positions are compensated more than others with a vast difference in work loads which makes it feel unfair. I still love the company, but will be searching for a second job to make ends meet."
good,Great benefits.  Great co-workers .  Hardest part of the job is driving 100 miles per day to see clients and clients getting multiple calls from various sales channels.
good,"This question is not applicable to submitting my resume as this is not even linked to me, I just wanted to submit my resume, not revier my previous employers."
good,"Paychex expects payroll reps to maintain client bases of over 300 clients efficiently and accurately, which is too much to ask.  Paychex is also very inconsistent with their rules and regulations on attendance policies."
good,"Good culture.    Poor product training and too may divisions calling on the same client base.    They give you excellent tools to work with and reward you if you succeed.   Quotas are the same across the country.   Should be based on individual regions of the country.  "
good,"run 2 new presentation"
good,"The environment was fun. The workload was very hard. The training did not help you to succeed. The managers were nice, but the workload was way too much for any specialist to handle."
good,"As with many corporations, advancement, opportunity, and growth goes to those who go along with management. The job was fast paced and interesting, I enjoyed what I did. I just could not get ahead or given advancement opportunities because I spoke honestly. If asked my opinion I gave it honestly not what management wanted to hear. If something isn't working or needs adjusting it should be discussed just as much as sharing what IS working. "
good,The training program at Paychex is one of the most comprehensive I have ever experienced.  It is apparent they want their employees to be as knowledgeable as possible.
good,Good job to get foot into the door in the accounting field. Learned a decent amount about AR and various accounting cycles. Good job to do while still in college and learning.
good,"great training program, must have a hunter mentality and close business.  100 calls a day to make 1 appointment.  Make sure you are meeting with the decision maker"
good,"Because my territory consisted of 1/4 of the state of Oklahoma (which is very rural), the ability to prospect for new clients or establish meaningful relationships was challenging"
good,It was just a temporary job that seemed to last longer than it should. the front desk position was the most stressful with so many phone calls to answer and being it was back before electronics were useful it was even more stressful.
good,"Paychex is a very good company to work for, and I would recommend it to others.  They strive to take care of their employees, and maintain a good work / life balance.  The pay seems fair, but that is only speaking to the offices in Western New York, where I worked."
good,"I spent 40 hours mostly  scanning the documents into the network system, filing, taking care of the jammed scanners, recycling documents to the trash."
good,Paychex is a wonderful place to work and grow. The training I received is second to none. It is a place where I can make myself better each day but working with competitive and like minded individuals.
good,Great place to work because of the people!  It's easy to go to work everyday and I look forward to seeing and working with colleagues from across various departments.
good,I worked for this company over 20 years ago and I'm sure things have changed. With that being said I don't think I could provide a valid review for this company at this time.
good,"Paychex was a great place to work a couple of years ago. They expect you to support too many clients who don't know payroll. The clients make mistakes which create more work for the specialists. Specialists have little support and are expected to do all corrections themselves. Amendments, Penalties, Garnishments, It is all done by the specialist with over 300 clients."
good,"Team oriented environment; "
good,The company offers great training  but the management needs improvement to keep quality representatives.  This job is a stepping stone to strengthen your outside sales on your resume.
good,"This company is nothing but a call center for payroll. They tell you the hours are 8 to 5, but if a client calls in at 4:59 you end up staying later. They don't like you to work overtime, so you end up taking a longer lunch to compensate for that. Training is self-directed, but it is all over the place. Too much material to learn at the beginning when they need to focus on the payroll system that you will be using every day, all day, and then learn the more in-depth parts of it. They push you to get to your next step even before you have the basics mastered. You are told to use your resources when you have a question. The problem with that is they are constantly changing the system, and there are too many places to try to find the answers. They assign you a ""mentor"" and want you to ask that person any questions you have, but they have their own load of clients and can't always help. You are graded by ""stats"" which they are too overly focused on. Every call is recorded then you are graded on what you say to the client. Emails are also monitored now. You are dumped into the queue without the proper training to answer the calls. Overall, if you like to be micro-managed and enjoy being stressed to the max, go for it!"
good,Paychex gives their employees the opportunity to build their skills. there is plenty of room for professional and personal growth. tuition reimbursement and more
good,I was always told that if you do not have anything nice to say do not say anything at all. The only reason I am filling this out is due to the fact it will not allow me to proceed unless I do
good,"CEO has created a more relaxed culture and makes sound decisions for the company."
good,"Sales is a tough job and it will be anywhere. Paychex does its best for its employees. It is very independent and what you gain is what you put in as a rep. It takes a while to build a decent pipeline and the best reps are the ones who have been in the business the longest. While building the pipeline can be fun, there is pressure to perform as little as 6 months into the role which can be very stressful. You will find yourself working on days off and even wondering if having days off is worth it."
good,"Honestly, I loved my job, but the environment just got worse and worse. Sales manager only cares about numbers! I wasn't a sales rep, and I even felt belittled. Anything you say will make its way around the office, and once someone doesn't like you, good luck. Everyone talks about everyone. The office can be fun at times, but it can be hostile too. If you don't mind inappropriate comments and conversation everyday for the majority of the day, sign up! There were very few times I felt appreciated for my work. It was like pulling teeth trying to get a raise."
good,"The people you work with are ok, the job is more time consuming, and you really aren't paid enough. The training is horrible. I wouldn't recommend working here."
good,"The instant you start taking clients expect to be handed a load of those that are upset already. If you're good at your job except to be taken advantage of by management. You'll have to do more than those who aren't as good, but you won't get any kind of extra compensation for it. Most of management is pretty good, but there are a few that seem to never have anything nice to say. Really, I don't hear much good feedback from management,  but they make sure you know when you do something wrong. They do provide a fair amount of free food, but it's hard to compensate for the amount of stress you're under. Honestly, a good company, but they expect far too much for the amount they are willing to pay. Oh, and they expect you to get a TON of training done in your nonexistent free time. If you don't get it done, expect to get a stern talking to."
good,"I was put in a very tiny work space with very little space. The supervisor prefoto keep the main set of lights off so you only had small task lights to work with."
good,"processing payroll for small business, daily appts, inbetween process corrections, garnishments, new hires, terminations, tax amendments, inbound queue, work request from queue, reply to voicemails/emails within 4 hrs, client base goal 300 per rep, set up deductions and much more"
good,"Paychex, Inc. is a great place to work for college students attending KSU.  Very flexible work environment.  Get ready to stand all day!!"
good,"I almost made 23 years with Paychex.  The pay can be good, and the insurance better,  but the company will not provide what is needed to do the job.  This could be time, kmowledge, or backup.  This become more and more apparent the longer you stay."
good,"Great company, actually cares about the client,. Typical day entails visiting referrals sources, converting leads into sales appointments.  Learned definitely how to deal with variety of people, how to work on a deadline, and since you're a territory rep, you learn how to solve problems on your own. Management definitely is very involved and invested, maybe a little too involved."
good,"Overall I really like working here. It's just that we have to do taxes and amendments and I am not qualified to do these things. I also have no desire to do them. If I was told this is what I would have to be doing, I probably wouldn't have taken the job in the first place."
good,"Paychex is a good place to start if you are looking for a career in outside sales.  Micromanaging is extremely high in the first year, so if you can't handle that then don't apply."
good,"Paychex is a good company to work for. It is a payroll comnpany and I was on a temporary assignment within the finance department. If you want a national company with a global touch, then you should try it"
good,"A typical day at work was being out on the road visiting clients, making appointments, meeting with my referral resources and taking referral resources and clients out to coffee or lunch.  Once a week, we had a team meeting at the corporate office to talk about what has been successful, what has not and where we were currently with that months numbers."
good,"Answer incoming Client calls trouble shooting time keeping software and hardware issues.  Train new administrators on correcting exceptions, approving time sheets, closing and processing the payroll report. Work with Payroll Partners to resolve syncing issue regarding Benefit Balances and Pay Code Export Matrix set up.  Review Payroll Policies settings for OT, Holidays, Rounding,Lunches, and Employee / Admin Views. Managing security by employee groups, Ip access policies, Feature Access Templates. Set up and Assign Labor Level/ Org Units for individual and multiple employees.  Set up and configure new Biometric and Proximity Time clocks.  IT support for  Clock Agent Monitor software. Review and resolve  Billing Issues.  Create Cases  for clocks,Badge orders defective clocks to be replaced. provide webinar training sessions."
good,"Typical day involves processing reported hours of payroll"
good,I think it's a great company and some opportunities are there.  I'm personally more geared for an outside sales position while this is more of a telemarketing sales job.
good,If they were to have employees doing the jobs they hire them to do things would work smoother. They need to train their employees to put out quality work as well as meeting production.
good,"Typical day consists of managing payroll clients and their needs in all aspects of payroll; time management, salary info, appropriate tax agency information.  Maintain relationships with clients based on their payroll frequency.  "
good,turn and burn type of company. only was there a few months because of the consistent change in territory management. not much else to say
good,"overall a good company, good pay bad sales support. Management is ineffective at supporting and motivating their employees."
good,"Good products and good services, but lack of documentation.  Also too many layers of management which can cause lack of communication."
good,"Typical day at work includes 100% client service and the ability to multi-task. Very high pressure."
good,"For entry level people coming into Paychex, it is a big shock. There are many things to learn, and a lot of training that is done within the first couple of months. It does seem, however, that its a fall down and pick yourself back up kind of mentality. The compensation does not nearly match the stress of the job."
good,great place to start a sales career. hopefully you have a DSM with great experience. set appointments and you'll be successful
good,"Learned alot working here, took my skills elsewhere to earn more money"
good,Busy office and constantly changing procedures.  Great team work.
good,"I loved the people at Paychex, and the training was thorough and extensive.  I learned so much while I was there.  Unfortunately, it seemed like they were trying to do everything with too few people.  This led to the burn out of many great specialists.  If corporate would increase budgets even a little, I think that it would be a great place to work."
good,"Challenging, able to get involved in emerging technology."
good,"Paychex is a great place to get real B2B sales experience.  Great benefits, decent PTO and pay.  There is not much room for advancement if you don't live in Rochester where corporate is."
good,"Managed a client base providing HR consulting and HR Strategic Guidance."
good,"Friendly co-workers."
good,"Paychex, Inc is a great company if your just starting out in the sales industry. It's a great place to learn and grow. The people are awesome to work with."
good,"I enjoyed helping small businesses create a back-office structure.  Many were unfamiliar with tax law, and I assisted in setting them up to properly budget and define cash flow.  I worked with many CPAs and accountants in helping their clients stay compliant."
good,When I worked here the people were cool and fun sometimes management would buys free lunch.
good,productive and fun place with ping pong table very  nice people work there they are very intelligent. A typical day of worked is filled with speaking to and building a rapport with your base of professional clients. You work with them on a wide range of services from payroll to health and benefits administration.
good,"Answer phone calls and emails about clients accounts.  Add locations and branches, add pto or sick accruals, change bank information, create special reports specific to clients.  "
good,My typical day was spent on the phone trying to set up appointments for outside representatives to sell Paychex products. I learned how to work Business to Business. Management was very rigid. My co-workers were supportive. The hardest part of the job for me was that I had come from an independent setting and it was a drastic change to adjust to but good training for the future. The most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers.
good,Fast paced. Busy
good,"Stable employer in the Rochester area. Many hard working, dedicated employees."
good,Placing the company's checks into the right slot for sending was fun.
good,I processed client payrolls submitted by phone and fax
good,Paychex is a fun place to work. I am now a payroll expert. I enjoy interacting with my co-workers and overcoming daily challenges.
good,"There are many good people who work for this company. Unfortunately my position is being relocated, so I am looking outside the organization for employment."
good,"Pay was okay, but benefits were great. The work was tedious, but not challenging where I worked. Management that I started with was wonderful, but they quickly moved on to other things and we were stuck with terrible management on all levels. Constant change seemed to hurt our department. The very last supervisor I had seemed nice, but I didn't work with them long. I would recommend it to someone who just wants a job, but it was not my cup of tea."
good,"I have worked at Paychex for over 3 years and I loved the atmosphere when I began! It has gone downhill, the management above doesn't work cohesively and information is different from each. No consistency and no real development."
good,Paychex is going through a transition in the Mid to Large Markets. Trainings and coaching could be improved.  There are tremendous changes coming in the near future.
good,"Fast paced, with expectation to perform when playing field is not equal. Had a great boss that left due to lack of transparency from upper management."
good,"in working here for 7 1/2 years I found that this wasn't the type of industry I wanted to be in.  Payroll is not of interest to me, and neither is sitting indoors at a desk staring at a computer every day!  The company changed over to being a large corporation while I was there and it negatively effected how the company treated its employees.  However, I was lucky enough to have a great manager in my Sales Assistant role, but that was pretty uncommon to have a great manager that valued their employees."
good,The immediate supervisors made this a great environment and truly cared about the teams.  Any upper level management only cared about money.  They recently did more layoffs.
good,The division I worked in focused on human resource management outsourcing for small businesses and the total direction lacked cohesiveness in all departments.
good,Company needs higher base pay for tenured employees. Work life balance is good but tenure seems to mayter very little. Focus needs to turn more to the employees.
good,"I loved installing and configuring the software product, loved talking to and helping clients, but there was an unreasonable amount of work, and they just kept assigning more and more clients; they never hired enough people."
good,"While the rate of pay does scale well, it does not correlate to the stress and responsibilities. The constant restructuring leaves serious gaps in support for employees."
good,"This  is a typical 9-5 job where you may have to stay late to complete your work. I learned that I can take on many tasks here. Very competitive, but everyone worked as a team. The hardest part of the job was dealing with angry clients and CPAs. I did enjoy working with some of my colleagues and seeing them outside work."
good,"Paychex, Inc. is an American provider of payroll, human resource, and benefits outsourcing services for small- to medium-sized businesses.  Have transitioned from localized offices to regional dedicated service centers with 24-7 operations."
good,"It was nice working here, there were a lot of benefits of working for Paychex.  However, they are not flexible or will allow for mom's to job share or work from home.  That is why I had to leave the company."
good,"Strong Earning Potential. Management can be shaky at times. Overall company is not focused on mission statement. Looking to grow in to many fields to soon. Company needs to look at metric and dynamics for each territory. They are strong with a quota yet the territory zips and areas do not match. For example. Someone in Cherry Hill has a quota of 14,000 per month and so does someone down the shore area. Hence a none level playing field for earning potential. I'm personally looking to travel less and move closer to my family."
good,My manager values work/life balance which is something I truly value here at Paychex. I have the flexibility to work from home and come in when I need to.
good,"Management presents a misleading message to the payroll specialists and its more about sucking up to the clients than running payroll efficiently. There are, ultimately, more pros than cons and different branches have their own culture/idea of what their employees should be."
good,"low salary for the amount of work required. great people, but the corporate bigs are out of touch "
good,"Changes within the company have caused a stressful work environment, employee's are no longer engaged in the day to day priorities."
good,Good company to work for. This is especially true if you are a fairly junior level starter-outer. Good training and benefits.
good,"Great b2b sales job to help build your resume.  Can make a good income in the right territory and with the right attitude. The base salary is average, commission structure is ok could be better. The real money is hitting your monthly bonus."
good,"This was a great opportunity for me to get outside of my comfort zone and learn to be successful. Planning out each day, hour, and minute puts responsibility solely on the rep. I enjoy having the pressure and weight on my shoulders to perform. The downfall in my experience was management/training. The payroll industry is as competitive as it has ever been. The lack of sales training makes it difficult to achieve a high level of success. Our competitors are leading the industry in technology, sales training/tools, and service. I want to join an industry leader that is consistently looking to improve their level. If a business does not emphasize the need to continuing to innovate, they will get passed up by their competitors."
good,"It's a great place to work if you have a family, they really understand that family comes first .  I appreciate that as a sole parent."
good,"My role as a Communications Representative changes daily. I work on internal communications called iComms, for business units, Requests for Proposal (RFP), and external communications, such as client letters. I am also active in the Client Relations queue, which means I can assist clients calling with various issues ranging from payroll to 401(k), benefits, or HR  issues."
good,Good place to work but definitely a grind. Lots of driving involved especially if assigned territory is not near your home. Expectations are high and goals are made to seem easily attainable through referral sources but progress with these sources only seem to attained by tenured reps. First few years of production are entirely determined by your own efforts with little assistance.
good,"Great work/life balance, limited ways in which to get sales"
good,"Worked in the sales office and would report the daily and weekly performance numbers to corporate.  Good people to work with but management was too ""hands-off"".  If something went wrong they were there to point fingers and not solve and work with it's employees."
good,"Paychex doesn't value development resources. Not the best place for developers/ IT resources. "
good,"Good benefits (health, dental, PTO, 401k, etc). Stable industry for a long-term career.  Not the best for work/life balance, as 20% of the year is blackout for PTO (including around Christmas/New Years). Compensation is low compared to workload and expected job duties plus pay caps exist within lower grade levels."
good,"Very busy and demanding job with very little pay.  Hardest part of the job is having to know so much information and not being compensated for how much you know or what kind of degree you have. I have great coworkers, but most of them feel the same way.  Management seems to only care about their reports. The benefits are decent, but again the pay is awful!"
good,"There are a lot of changes coming for this company with more products and services to offer clients.  That's a great goal to have, but it has resulted in significantly extra work for employees.  I do my best to balance the day, but it is difficult to stay current with requests and projects."
good,A typical day required constant calling of current and potential clients in order to promote Paychex services.  I learned to acquire the ability to be spontaneous while also having the ability to separate work from my personal life.  The management system was very effective in regards to consistent feedback and constructive criticism.  Co workers provided a positive and supportive atmosphere on my team which helped immensely when facing daily obstacles.  The hardest part of the job would definitely be not being in control of your sales.  Providing all of the information to the outside sales representatives and then at the end of the day not receiving the sale.  The most enjoyable part of the job would be maintaining relationships with the outside sales representatives and receiving feedback from the appointments you provided.
good,"There are some very solid leaders within Paychex.  There are times I feel leadership does not fully understand all aspect of the company can be run the same exact way."
good,If your fresh out of college you will get a good introduction into the corporate world here. Majority of employees I work with are in the 20-35 range. People are very friendly and always willing to help.
good,"A typical day for me at work started at 9 am. I logged into my computer and turned on my phone. I processed payroll or related matters such as garnishments or tax issues for my clients and their employees for 6 hours per day without stopping and then went home. I was so baffled by management decisions that I decided to get a management degree just to see what they were taught to think. I found most of my co-workers to be more interested in the choice of coffee and the wii available in the breakroom than in their work loads. The hardest part of my job was handling the overflow on phones due to co-workers not being on their phones. I found it hard to do full time work on part time pay. The most enjoyable part of my job was my sense of accomplishment and pride for being able to get my job done and some of my co-workers' workload as well in the short time I was physically at my desk each day. I also find it very rewarding to be able to help my customers and send them away feeling as though they've been helped professionaly, quickly and accurately."
good,Learned a great deal about payroll and working in small groups. Not a typical payroll position. Very fast paced. The whole landscape changed when they decided to switch everything to a call center.
good,"It was a good place to work, until some of the transition to remote work locations, with some management/employees being in different locations, sometimes across the country.  This wasn't prepared for properly, and the teams struggled to adapt."
good,They had a very bad work life balance. The work load was not spread evenly among employees. I stayed because I was promoted to another position that ended up being a bad choice. My experience was not all that great but don’t let it stop you from applying. You never know you might like it.
good,If you are a student trying to get into a good company this is an excellent temporary position for just that. You answer the phone all day and help clients navigate your website and help them file their forms.
good,"Overall, it's a good company to get your start in sales.  You work with fun people, and you are truly a part of the team.  It is a grind, at least being a SMB sales consultant.  You'll do a ton of cold calling and door knocking."
good,"There is little to no training provided - it is the blind leading the blind. Because the training is bad, clients are often misled, manual returns are incorrect and tasks are not correctly followed through.  If one could work at a Paychex with a Branch Trainer, that would be the optimal thing to do.  Otherwise, I would recommend reviewing other payroll companies before onboarding with Paychex."
good,"Good company to work for. I enjoyed my time working there. Loved my manager, She was very helpful & supportive. I miss her. My manager provided me with opportunity to learn & grow."
good,"It requires constant movement and follow-through on sales that you make. Can be quite hectic, but the team is there for each other."
good,"*Mgmt & leaders truly care about foot soldiers"
good,"solid company, good people. In IT there was change in management that had a number of smart technology people come on board but lacking in leadership experience and quality."
good,"Learned alot, good stepping stone job, dog eat dog in manhattan office. Deals become automatic after a while. can grow within company but it is difficult."
good,"Some good things, some bad things..."
good,Training and Pay were very good.  Management set goals that were difficult to attain within certain territories.  Would have liked more resources for client issues.
good,Core sales training provided is top notch to teach you fundamentals of sales and products.  Takes a self starting professional willing to put in 10-12 hours daily in order to reach goals.  Opportunity for advancement if desired based on performance.  Strong foundation and great place to start for any entry level sales role.
good,"A great part of the day to day job is dealing with business owners and learning how they got started and or stayed in business for so many years."
good,"Our Online Services Team is like a family.  "
good,Good people.  Manage your own schedule.  Work with many different types of businesses. Supportive management who will do their best to help.
good,"Great opportunities to grow and develop, lots of training, always room for more responsibility. "
good,Great sales training. Good work and life balance. Managers will work with you to reach your sales and career goals. Achievable goals
good,Paychex is a secure company with high ethical standards.  They follow strict procedures to ensure they are meeting all audit requirements for payroll processors.  The job is secure and the company is well run.
good,"they try to keep it an fun place to work, hard to go up the ladder though.  very strict on the time you arrive, they do not like you to be late and often times write you up even though you cannot predict traffic or weather"
good,"A typical day at work consists of new business meetings, prospecting your territory, establishing referral business and upselling the client base. "
good,"Great company, young workforce.  Management has come up through the ranks.  A lot of travel, not much office time.  Get to engage with wonderful clients."
good,Learned a lot about payroll!  Quarter end and year end payroll processing was grueling but fun.
good,"Very overwhelming position even for those who worked there 15+ years.  Very negative work environment.  Learned a lot about the process of payroll and Federal guideline's, laws and regulations.  Management is fantastic with the exception of a few.  Co-workers were for the most part great to work and very helpful with questions.  Come in at 8 work until 5 with a hour lunch break and two fifteens.  Hardest part of the job was when clients would call in yelling and screaming to fix this or fix that and the specialist had to inform them that they could not because it was not part of the payroll process.  Most enjoyable was the clients who truly appreciated all the hard work put into this job.  Not a Data Entry job!"
good,prospected and sold payroll services to small businesses. responsible for 6 zip codes in the heart of LA.
good,Paychex helps me maintain a healthy work /family-life balance by offerring part time positions.
good,I started as a temp. here. There are a lot of small branches accross the US.
good,"Paychex is a good company to work for if numbers are your thing. Very fast paced, very stressful, large workload and client list. Training is not the best, but co workers are always happy to assist. Employees and managers were close knit and almost like family."
good,"I learned how to enter their data from reports into the system. I learned how to research account information and would provide information requested to outside Collection Agencies and internal."
good,"Account Manager role is very stressful, especially during fourth quarter. Overtime hours are typically required.  They have a very good benefits package with good time off, and flexibility with schedules.  A lot of opportunities for growth and advancement especially in AZ, but the compensation level is very low compared to industry standards for the same roles."
good,"Paychex is a great place to work if you are built for the corporate life."
good,Working at Paychex was very demanding. You're given a lot of clients once you have completed the initial month of training. It is very corporate and not very casual. Paychex does a great job with employee appreciation and also encourages professional growth. Compensation is average.
good,"The company has made many reorg changes through the years, definitely changing the culture of what Paychex used to be.  "
good,"The company has great benefits"
good,"to help clients with payroll  a typical work day at work, you have about 300 clients that you are personally working with and you are working to help them with payroll each month"
good,"As a dedicated payroll specialist you are very busy from the time you sign into the system until the time you leave."
good,"Pay isn't he best, but flexibility out weighs compensation. Management team is the best, understanding and values feedback and input from employees."
good,My role at Paychex was to work with small business owners and their CFO or whomever did their books when the IRS came calling for back taxes or missing documentation.  It was a point of pride for me to have them coming in freaking out and leaving calm as can be.
good,"A typical day is constant phone and email interaction with clients, definitely customer service, the job is not without it's share of unhappy clients, but the reward is being able to turn that around by the end of the call and hearing the satisfaction in the clients voice. The company provides constant training, they are on top of their game there."
good,"Good company culture and values built upon a solid business plan. Very loyal to good employees, many who are promoted from within. They do work hourly employees very hard and pay is not great or competitive with market."
good,"Working as a support role for the online product, the company is in a terrible state. The online payroll system is constantly giving errors and having impairments which take hours to resolve. New products and features are released with such minimal testing when they are clearly not ready for a full production release to clients. For the most part, coworkers are great, and local management is good, depending on where you're located. Telecommuting is finally an option, although limited at best. Benefits are good."
good,I truly enjoy working with my current payroll specialist. We lean on each fr what we need and we have each others back when things get crazy.
good,"Pro: Really good benefits and pay as well as great team workers"
good,"plus additional responsibilities added including:  fork lift training (load and unload for incoming/outgoing pallets of computer equipment/paper), outside courier (driving to each of the 9 locations  picking up and dropping off documents/packages/inter-office mail, furniture, highly sensitive data media transport)"
good,Good company with a very good work life balance.  There are great benefits and they pay is also good.  On a typical day there is a lot of travel in the field and working on finding new prospects to sell to.
good,This is a very secured company to work for. They offer nice benefits and job security.
good,Paychex is a great company to work for as far as benefits and security go. They treat their employees with respect and management is friendly and accessible.
good,"I loved working at Paychex. However, multiple ""Corporate America"" decisions resulted in a highly stressful environment with little hope of improvement. Multiple instances of hiring and promoting from outside with highly competent internal applicants available. The work load is also unsustainable. I tried so hard to make Paychex my forget job it nearly broke me. I pray they will improve."
good,The employees are great to work with.  There's a strong culture there.  The company standards are very high with quality and sometimes there is a lot of pressure to meet those standards.
good,"If you are not the one with thick skin, please do not take this position. This position requires people with thick skin as most of your clients have had negative experience with the specialist before you. You will find your self trying to prove you have what it takes to the current clients."
good,"I worked for Paychex for 20 yrs but the company was restructured and my Position was Eliminated. While I worked there, I was trained and became the lead Admin Assistant. It was a great place to work."
good,Paychex has awarded me the training I needed to get experience in sales and our team and culture have been phenomenal. The most enjoyable part of my job is are the new interactions I get to have with small business owners and the building of established referral relationships.
good,Decent Paying job when you hit senior specialist. Around 15 an hour. Lots of training involved which is good but the job can be very stressful with upwards of 300 clients that you deal with on a regular basis. Good company to work for if you can handle the stress.
good,"Too many clients to maintain to give good customer service.  Good Benefits and opportunities, but the stress gets too overwhelming. Management is always making changes without taking needs of employees into account."
good,Good place to work for your new office tomorrow morning for the day to be happy for your birthday today or tomorrow night for you tomorrow night at work at the
good,i would answer multi line phones while auditing for our branch everyday and helping clients with picking up payroll packages. Ive learned a lot about excell and other word programs. Management was hit and miss some were great other were not so great. my co workers were always amazing helpful people. the hardest part of my job was actually also the most enjoyable part was my auditing experience working there
good,Everyone at Paychex is great. If it were not for the workload it would be the best place to work at. The benefits are great. The flexibility is good. Amount of work can be unmanageable.
good,"I love working here because I love the company and the people I work with. However, I have always looked for room to grow but it seems like if you do not hold a degree specifically in Accounting you will never be able to advance or climb the corporate ladder here."
good,"Poor management, lack of communication"
good,"Variety of work "
good,"Great Ideals, and culture but some managers can really ruin your experience. The micromanaging can adversely effect employees and thus customers. Some mangers won't let you post out to new positions. some are great and really help you grow and encourage training."
good,Supportive management and understanding. Alot of changes to the company that has effected many people and how they feel about company. I do enjoy working for my clients and with my colleagues. It is overwhelming with the projects and short of staff.
good,"The title says it all. There is an endless amount of compensation to be earned at Paychex. From base pay plus commissions, compensation multipliers, company trips, to something as simple as improved personal sales skills, Paychex provides you the ability to dictate your own financial earnings. Put in enough work, and you will succeed greatly."
good,Alot of room for growth if young and hungry. Can move up ranks fast. Alot of hard work but paid well for it. After establish yourself within territory dollars really start rolling in
good,"The employees and managers were great, even though the HR roles were quite rude.I was never told what team I was going to be on, so i was just there until they found a place for me to be(They hired too many people and had no where for more than half of us to go)"
good,"Great job for after college and needing experience. Doesn't pay all that well, but if you value a stable job more  thenthis is a perfect place for you."
good,Its very nice to work their and most enjoyable to work. co-workers very friendly.  management very good.  nice to work their.
good,"Advancement is slow and based on who you know not your credentials/education. The culture, atmosphere and leadership varies by entity and department (sometime even by manager.)"
good,"Worked for the company for 6 years. Job work/life balance was horrible...They do provide outstanding training. I flew to NY for 2 weeks, paid for by the company. Benefits were okay. When I first started they did give out gift cards for god performance. Great starter job when entering the payroll field."
good,no on sight managers .not enough follow up and no one cared about the employees change of management people fired no receptionist poor planning lack of enough phone line lots of technical issues constantly too many clients and not enough staff a lot of client complaints  lack of communication micro managing all of the time. new clients not being serviced properly.  no approvals on request by customer service reps
good,"Very great company to work for, just to bad they don't give much room for advancement for individuals that are over qualified and underpaid for the position they are hired for"
good,"They offer very good benefits for yourself and family, they are very caring if something occurs and you have to take time off."
good,Must be very disciplined in daily activity - has made me a much more well rounded sales rep . Fantastic product that I believe in.
good,Paychex was a nice place. There were a lot of after work social gatherings. I believe most of the team I worked with had good customer service. I learned at lot about business from this position.
good,This company is a good company to work or depending on which branch. The work environment varies from branch to branch.
good,"Co-workers are wonderful hardworking and helpful."
good,"Productive environment, culture can use improvement, career advancement can be enhanced."
good,"Scanned documents daily, maintained filing system"
good,"Paychex places primary value on its customer facing employee's, with little to no support for employee's not directly interfacing with that role.  While opportunities abound for those employees that work directly with outside clients, little to no opportunities exist for support employees."
good,People are fun to work with but very stressful during quarter-end and year-end.  Can be over-whelming.  Company going through changes so many positions have been changed.
good,Second time around working for Paychex and things havent changed much over the years.  Great culture of excellence and interpersonal relationships.  Very old school management style with little regard for employee retention.  Feels like they are always looking for someone else.
good,Payroll
good,I enjoyed my time and Paychex.  I suggest this company to anyone who is looking for an opportunity to work in sales or looking to advance their career.  This is a company who gives you great training but also allows you to have your own personality on how you sell and work with customers.  Be prepared to work in a team environment as you will have partners who are also working with the same customers you.  This is one of the parts I liked the most.
good,"I worked here for over 3 years. I enjoyed the work environment, and the benefits available to me. However, the management at the location I worked at was difficult to work with, and I didn't feel I was paid enough for the position I moved into. Overall good experience though."
good,"Paychex is a great start for someone beginning their career in the payroll field. They train you. Back when I started, they still flew you out to Rochester, NY for training and paid for fancy hotels while we were there. It was great however, now from what I understand you have to share a room with someone when you go to training which is not something I would be comfortable with. They do have policies and procedures written down so you'll always have a ""bible"" per say of what is right and what is wrong. They have a vast amount of resources and if you are good with google, you should be able to find answers to a lot of your questions. However, the work life balance was not quite there. I think it may just be the branch manager currently in position. Other branches are more flexible from what I've heard."
good,Great company to work for just very little room for advancement. Depending on the department there is little management involvement which tolls on annual reviews.
good,Great Benefits.  Most appointments scheduled for us.  Great product.  Competitively priced.  Manager was crazy.  Too much work after hours which could have been handled by secretarial staff.
good,"Admin was right there to assist me in helping updating the Citrix software and doing inputs in a timely fashion"
good,This was a decent company to work for however the advancement and pay was halted during my time here so I focused on school.
good,Overall a very nice place to work with good management.  Has a pretty good work environment as well. Has great job security and great benefits
good,"Sold snacks, drink, cigarettes, cigars, and lottery tickets to customers.  Store was located in food court of the mall.  The hardest part was watching to make sure that nothing was stolen."
good,The co-workers were great to work with. Very helpful and knowledgeable.
good,Work M-F 7a-4p
good,"This is a great place to learn new or hone current skill set, the training programs are top notch! This job can be financially rewarding if you are willing to work hard."
good,"The job is outside sales and it is what you make of it. You can manage work/life balance since some tasks can be done from home. The healthcare is AMAZING, they offer excellent 401K plans, and very good training."
good,Certain departments are better than others to work in.  If you land in a good department then there are good managers and things to work on.  If you are not fortunate enough to land in a good department then it can be a challenging work environment.
good,"I learned a lot of valuable skills in my current position.  We had weekly team training, in conjunction with an internal LMS that provided courses to improve our product knowledge."
good,"Daily life at Paychex included telemarketing, cold-calling, visits to banks or accounting firms. Culture was fine.  Low base salary. No re-occurring revenue. Get paid once for a sale."
good,"I loved working with my CA clients. My 5th year w/ Paychex I received A’s on all survey cards turned in. Then I got engaged and relocated to the ABQ call center. W/in 7mos had to go on FMLA and when I returned, my client list was taken from me and an all new group was assigned to me. I was not happy, but dealt with it. Within a few weeks of my new list I found many problems that the clients on this list were having. Instead of dealing with the clients problems, ABQ management decided that I was the problem and let me go. I enjoyed my job with Paychex and I thought I was doing well for the company, but I was not seen that way when I transferred. 😢 wish I still worked there, but for the Orange County branch!"
good,"If you like a mixture of sales and payroll, this is the perfect place to work. You learn a ton of information regarding federal payroll regulations and you work with a great group of people."
good,"Paychex training is top notch and continuing. There is a true culture of Customer Service and being the best that you can be. While the schedules are not flexible, the benefits are good."
good,"I talk with the sales reps bout what is in their pipeline, I reach out to clients and work with various departments to make sure everything is completed as far as setting up new groups, I work with the GA's form quoting and underwriting requirements. I am sometimes in the field and also can work from home so the days really depends on what the reps need."
good,"A great training experience. When hired you are sent to their corporate location in Rochester, NY and given some excellent training.  However, the local office has let alot of talented employees go, due to lack of leadership."
good,"The mail room was a great place to work at the corporate office. Everyone was friendly, and helped out even if they didn't need to ."
good,"Good company with excellent employee benefits and friendly staff. Acts as receptionist/admin assistant.   Interact with clients and develop client relationships.  Job duties included logging and signing out payroll, direct deposit audit, preparing subpeonas, maintaining branch calendars for conference and training rooms."
good,typical day is getting in and addressing client related issues. You will answer phones and provide excellent customer service in order to retain client and keep communication lines open.
good,"Was thrown into a somewhat newly created role, with a job title for something else (an experiment? I don't know), with minimal training, and training unrelated to my role.  Over time, more and more responsibilities were added to daily tasks, was expected to just know how to deal with different situations, was offered little to no help, yet others, even direct management, had unreal expectation that little or no training should translate into quality work."
good,"Paychex offers a very generous benefits package and a challenging work environment.  There are many opportunities to advance your career if you are willing to relocate.  However, compensation is not competitive and the high stress environment is difficult to manage."
good,"Paychex was a temporary job for me, it was an internship.  I didn’t receive much training I just learned as I go.  The culture was pretty relaxed and the work load was fair."
good,Paychex is a place you can work at for years with upward mobility and a comfortable lifestyle.  Perhaps more importantly Paychex will open many doors for future sales jobs.
good,"Hours are flexible, I was taught excel and their internal payroll program. Management was nice, but sometimes unorganized. It was a laid back work environment. I enjoyed having the option of not interacting with customers"
good,"Good company, great ethics, work life balance was good as well.  Base could be higher, quota can be unrealistic depending on territory.  Good training, they are still figuring some things out."
good,"It is a productive work place but at the same time fun, we all work as a team to get the job done.My favorite time of the day is having coffee before the start of the shift with a few friends. Everyday is a learning experience with changes in procedures and constantly changing schedules."
good,Great workplace culture and generous employee benefits. Nice facility. 8-5 desk job. Well trained. Lots of room for development and growth. Have had some amazing managers and coworkers.
good,"The company overall is a decent place to work.  Like most companies, there are a few that can ruin the experience.  I had medical issues and kept the company informed of the difficulties I was having obtaining the necessary documentation to cover my absences.  The last role I had did not have any sympathy and did not think twice to fire me after only 1 warning.  Overall my experiences were good any made many life long friends."
good,"I have been with Paychex for a short time due to the transition"
good,"great opportunity for 10+ years, awesome co-workers, very autonomous.  I spent the first half of my sales career with Paychex, I was treated very well and enjoyed the culture and people here."
good,I liked how Paychex compensated me but didn't like that I covered multiple territories and had to manage the client relationship for several months after the initial sale while prospecting and selling new business. It was exhausting.
good,Paychex is a great company to work for and you're placed on great teams with great people.  The resources in PDIT are stretched so thin that it results in burn out fast. The compensation is lower than competitors but the benefits seem to be comparable.
good,Day to day workload varies.  There's always something you can be working on.  My branch is like a family.I believe my favorite part of the job is my co-workers
good,Great opportunity for advancement within.  Pay is very good.  You get rewarded for hard work.  Great Team environment.  Great technology so you can work remotely if needed.
good,"Great company to work for just pay scale is not good. "
good,"There are many tasks to complete as a payroll specialist. Once you learn all the processes, the job can be rewarding. I've been here for 8 months and I still have a lot to learn but the good thing is there are so many people to help you."
good,I learned a lot about the Payroll Inducstry and 401K and S125 and it was a great place and the training available was grea.
good,It was a very easy and boring job. All I did was sit down all day and put paperwork in envelopes. Sometimes I would work on the computers to help print out certain paperwork and confidential information.
good,"I came in as a top producer and proved myself immediately.  I can accept constructive criticism but cannot rationalize texts like ""are you alive"" when I am a top producer.  Learn how to develop not insult your top performers"
good,"Paychex not only offers great health insurance, 401(k) match, and generous vacation time, but I am able to flex my schedule and work from home often."
good,"The project that I have worked on at Paychex involves  assisting clients with access to online Information about annual enrollments, pending online Qualifying Events, to Report any Web Issues and generate Client-specific Web Reports."
good,"Good place to work but extremely high press job.  Supervisors were great to work with and very helpful.  Clients were good to work with also.  This is a good company to work for, however, you must be able to handle constant high stress and can not be handicapped or work part-time."
good,"great training and work environment"
good,Worked for Paychex fo 11 years nothing bad at all to say about the company i would reccommend a job here for anyone. I handle technical support for all clients external clients as well as internal support
good,"I was happy to work at Paychex, and all the people, I learned a lot and got a lot of experience in different areas.  That is why I stay there for so long."
good,I liked working there.  The work place has a professional atmosphere. The company gives you an opportunity to use your expertise while leaning and growing from other top notch people.
good,"·	Maintain base of payroll clients on products for assigned clients in order to meet client payroll, Human Resource, and employee benefit service needs."
good,"I opened the office, got payrolls ready for clients to pick up, answered the phones, did faxes and the direct deposit audit daily.  Also separated mail and gave out to office.  I learned the direct deposit audit a few years ago while also doing telephones, faxes etc.  I enjoyed seeing my regular clients everyday and listening to them."
good,Nice place to work.My position is nice and quiet.it gives good way to advance your career.learnt many trades with payroll clocks. very friendly co-workers and management.
good,I received great training and product knowledge from Paychex.  I was right out of college and this was a great start to my business to business career.
good,"It was a very pleasant and professional place to work.  The job experience I gained there is invaluable and the hours were great for balancing work and home life.  I would gladly work for this company in the future."
good,"Paychex has one of the greatest training cultures I've ever experienced. I think this sets them apart in the job market as I believe that the more knowledge you invest in your employees, the better service they will be able to provide to the customers."
good,I have learned about payroll taxes and calendar to manage every quarter. The most enjoyable part of job is very good co-workers.
good,"Focused mainly on customer service.  Multitasking, self-teaching, high client communication, data entry, payroll processing, high level of problem solving, some implementation."
good,"Paychex is a great company that leads the payroll, human resources industry. Fast paced, rewarding, but market has become commodity."
good,A very conservative company that offers many opportunities to train and allows for all level of employees to give feedback.
good,"time management"
good,Days can be long and tough but the entire company works as a team to meet enterprise level goals.  The company is constantly working to make every employee feel vested and engaged in their business.
good,"I worked as a temp, and I loved it. I tried to get a full time position doing what I was doing, but there were no openings available"
good,"Typical day is cold calling, telemarketing, and setting up appointments"
good,"This was my first job coming out of college and it was a great company to learn responsibility and structure of a job.  However, management left something to be desired in terms of ethics and the way employees are treated."
good,right out of college good experience good opportunity to gain skills
good,"Each work day is different. Due to the extensive training, all employees are capable of addressing most issues that arise. Managers are there to help. Most co-workers have years of experience and will be there to assist. The hardest part of the job is not having a positive environment. The most enjoyable part of my job was the interaction with my clients."
good,The management team is extremely supportive and professional at all times. The team members are professional and close- knit. Wonderful place to work!
good,Good place to learn and grow. Started entry level and worked way up to management.  Overall very good work environment and good benefits.
good,"A typical day includes managing emails and voicemails from clients, who need assistance with payroll software. I learned how to calculate state and federal taxes, garnishments and payroll pricing."
good,"A typical work day consists of forecasting, stat analysis, employee management and customer service."
good,"Good company- Interacted with clients, payroll specialst and management on daily basis, processing payroll and researching, auditing, testing, and resolving issures."
good,Great Sales Opportunity for a recent college graduate. A company car is not provided even though there is a ton of travel involved.  Managers care for the employees.
good,This office has really grown from years past. I really enjoyed all that I have learned and gained from my experience there.
good,Everyday is different but inconsistent. What makes Paychex is the people. Great co-workers
good,"Corporate leaders and management are very approachable. Co-workers are helpful and considerate. Busy environment, with excellent training and development opportunities."
good,"Present to 7 new prospects a week. Visit 40 referall sources in a week. telemarket. Visit current client. resolve current client issues. The most enjoyable part of my job is the relationship building. i have great relationships with my referral sources (banks, cpas, current clients) as well as, a great relationship with my Paychex partners."
good,"ok place to work, good benefits, basically stable, good training, friendly people, office locations are good"
good,"hard working and play just as hard! A lot of deadlines and change was the norm. Also, very strict work schedules but fun environment."
good,"We work in a call center environment, help clients with payroll via phone, email or online."
good,Worked with this company for about 12 years. Received much of my knowledge about payroll and human resources from my time at Paychex. Management was available to assist you in any way and always willing to help you further your career.
good,"Compensation is good, however, Management has ""favorites"" and most good positions are already ""filed"" before they are posted. Coworkers were excellent to work with."
good,"Paychex is a great company to work especially if you are looking to grow. Within sales, expect strict performance measurements through daily production and monthly revenue outcomes. The culture is motivating. The best part of the job is being able to build relationships not only with your internal partners but your specific field partners to celebrate successes and share referrals."
good,"Strong company that isn't going anywhere and has almost no chance of being bought or taken over. However, it's also a very deep management hierarchy (up to 9 levels). The result is that no one wants to make an executive decision: everyone wants to seek approval from the next level of management for every material decision. As a result, it can take weeks or even months before approval is given for even the most inconsequential things. This causes tremendous stagnation, leading to Paychex not being on the cutting edge of anything anymore. It's almost become like a government entity, where everyone is clinging to their jobs for dear life so they can ""ride the gravy train"" until retirement. Some of those in management positions have no business being there. That is, they would not even get an interview if they had to apply for the position because they are not qualified (e.g. accounting managers without a college degree). They are only there because of attrition. Which is shocking, since Paychex will pay for you to get a college education! What does it say about Paychex and its culture when they will promote someone without a college degree into a management position when that employee is not even motivated enough to take advantage of free tuition assistance? It sure doesn't look good, and the employees know it."
good,"Paychex was a great place to work, I enjoyed the time I spent there. I made a ton of friends and had tons of new learning opportunities with the company. However after years of being there that only way to make better money was to leave and go back."
good,"required weekly meetings no real reason, there would training for new programs, sales recap on  weekly sales, there are weekly one on ones to help you map out your week , month, and year for sales quota."
good,Paychex has extensive training. I was unable to capitalize on all of it. I was hired at the management level and was given an office that had gone through 12 management changes in 8 years. It was very challenging.
good,"-A typical day usually busy filing Individual returns."
good,"Working at Paychex was a great learning experience, the people are very nice, however, it is a very busy place from the time you walk in until you go home. The pay could have been a little better.  I would recommend college age or high school graduates to work there."
good,Paychex is a very corporate company with a huge sales staff. The demand and expectations of the employees was hard to live around. There was always advancement opportunities and the benefits were amazing.
good,Great company for a person starting their sales career. Industry is very demanding and saturated. Salary is uncompetitive but compensation plan is better than most.
good,"•	Implementation, support and inventory control of applications/Training clients on the latest software upgrades"
good,It has been a good company to work for.  I have great coworkers.  They offer a great benefits package.   They offer great training to get you prepared for your role as a payroll specialist.
good,I was in the same position as 10 others on a team where some of us were making less than half of what others were. It just makes you feel horrible about working there.
good,"good benefits offered to direct hires. I was a temp employee. Before leaving for school, a new supervisor was appointed to my department. One that knew nothing about the department. The department was fairly new when I arrived, it had only been up and running for 1 year so it was a little disorganized. Not a lot of accountability enforced by management to those at the lower level. The company overall is a great company. Any cons are reference to the location in Henrietta and it's management in the department I was in."
good,"Paychex is a great company to hire in at entry level and advance.  They have excellent education reimbursement opportunities and many opportunities to learn and advance within the company.  The over culture is positive and encouraging, however the client load can be stressful."
good,"Typically I started my day priortizing my work by checking emails and finding what needed to be done that day in what order. I was able to attend seminars internally and off site to keep my skills up to date. Management was very fair and kept everyone appraised of upcoming updates, changes, etc. The hardest part was when changes were made to my position to support more than one Area Manager and 9 or 10 more HR Generalists. This made it very stressful to keep supplies, packages shipping and reports completed for 2 teams. The most enjoyable part of the job was the team atmosphere. If someone needed help, someone from my team or another team was willing to assist. I miss all of the people I worked with."
good,Paychex was a Great Company to work for. A typical Day included working with various Clients and be able to teach and learn new ideas each day. Management was very supportive.
good,I learned how to communicate with a customer over the phone and give quality customer service as well as being more knowledgeable with computers and the systems.
good,This is a place where I started my career after my internship.  I learned much about IT Corporate life occurs.  Their training is excellent as well.  I still maintain relationships with coworkers from there.
good,"Must be able to self manage."
good,"Starts out reading your inbox, and sorting through the project management screens in BeneTrac, and to plan your daily tasks. "
good,"Hunting role"
good,"While it is a good company, they pay significantly lower than competitors.  They have good work/life balance programs."
good,"Successful company that offers great advancement opportunities. Excellent training and development offered, as well as promotion of employee recognition programs."
good,Paychex is a good company.  They always put their employees ahead of everything.  The hardest part of the job was at year end when all taxes needed to be done.
good,"Great company, bad fit for me."
good,"Managed account base of 50 clients + (2010), which is an increase of 14 accounts over 6 months."
good,"Friendly management, do your work and leave. Management does not butt in without reasons."
good,"Overall Paychex is a good place to work."
good,I filled out unemployment claims for employers. I would call the employer to get the reason why the claimant was no longer working for their company. After I received why the claimant was no longer working at the employers work place I would then fill out the state form exactly how the employer had asked me to. I made a range from 65-90 outbound calls a day.
good,Very customer service oriented! Good salary and benefits but a very hectic workplace.
good,"Great place to work, great training and I wished I had stayed longer.  Territory wasn't the best for sales but made the most of what I had.  Great work life balance."
good,"Company has a strong sense of culture and values.  Main complaint amongst most employees is the low pay, especially compared to other similar jobs.  Year after year the company tries to promote the many benefits they provide rather than increasing overall basic pay for positions."
good,Paychex a good place to start your sales career. The culture allows you to make a handful of friends that you might stay close with. You will only make good money in sales if you are 125%+ of quota
good,"I enjoy working for Paychex.  The work life balance was hard but management got better about having everyone out.  The pay is not great, but making senior will help that out.  The work can be very stressful."
good,Overall a good company to work for.  Going through internal changes the past several years.  Nothing is wrong with change but appears to be challenged to find the right type of changes.
good,Culture seems to change a lot. Lots of advancement opportunities if you are a sales rep or manager. Not many advancement opportunities if you are in an administrative role.
good,All people are very friendly. very supportive. But they pay very less and no allowance. its a nice company and provides work home as well. overall experience was satisfactory.
good,I like working with my manager because she is laid back and lets you work without a lot of supervision.  If you need help she is ready to assist you.  The company has a good culture and gives you coffee and popcorn.
good,"Called on existing payroll clients to seek them our HR Services.  Lots of telemarketing to get appointments and many other departments call on the same clients.  Great training and most managers where good.  Mine wasn’t, but he got fired."
good,"Learned a lot about all that goes into being a business owner and products along with legalities regarding payroll, overtime, 401k rules and regulations, workers compensation and other state and federal requirements.  There were no typical days at work as the work was based on the calls coming in from clients."
good,"Administrative Assistance 	Submit expense reports to corporate senior leaders who request support,"
good,Industry leader with emphasis on employee engagement and positive culture.  Known for its training programs and ethics with creative ways to collaboratively drive business strategy.
good,Day starts at 830 I get in before at 8 or before We have at least 60 calls daily and some days well over  120 You have to be organized to get everything done I do not take lunch and most days get up one time during the day. Management is well aware of the work load issue. We stay until  everything is done. sometime until 7 or later. this is the hardest part of the job no balance between work and home. I enjoy my co workers they all care about each other
good,Paychex has allowed me to grow and advance my career.  My co-workers are awesome!!  I started at an entry level position and there was plenty of room to advance.
good,"Taught me everything I know about payroll, taxes, and year end.  Multiple trainings on reports, to tax returns, to management.  Every Friday we had training on new topics or refreshment topics."
good,The Paychex Insurance Agency is a great place to work.  Its a fast paced quota environment.  The training and development is top notch and helps excel your product knowledge.
good,"I would recommend any person that would like to get a start in their career in sales at Paychex. The company will reward hard work and many different ways. "
good,"Highly professional,  quick passed customer service department focused on the numbers and goals of both the department and company while meeting there needs of the client."
good,"Handling outgoing and incoming calls from a variety of clients and entering their information in the various databases and also sending email to clients, thanking them for doing business with Paychex using Outlook."
good,Fun place to work great benefits and really good paid time off. The environment is a little stressful because they over whelm there employees with to many clients.
good,"Very strict workplace, no job security, people who have been with the company for years ended up loosing their job, I guess reconstruction of the workplace"
good,I was content but that is not always good nor is it a way to make more moneyblife gets boring and so did the job I also needed to make more money so I left
good,The company on a large scale was great but when you received your territory and local manager it went completely down hill. I would have stayed if there was better management.
good,It was a nice job. There were no real problems with the exception of training. Sometimes management can be a little sketchy however the overall experience was good
good,fast pace and quota driven.  great place to work.  everyone is helpful.  highly stressful when it comes to a month to month quota.  this position has afforded me many chances to meet great people and create great partnerships with banks and cpa's.
good,It was always about sales (which is why I was there).  Once one month was done the next quota cycle started.  Competitive and fun environment.  Great people to work with.
good,big established company. great benefits. room to advance in the company. you accrue paid time off pretty frequently. very independent working culture.  plenty of other positions available in the company once you get your foot in the door.
good,Financially based product service company that gives its importance to the clients bringing a service to ease the accounting headaches dealing with taxes can have informing them of new rules and regulations while also assisting in their payroll needs.
good,"***Achieved Sales Conference 2013***"
good,Overall great place to work. Benefits and compensation are worth mentioning. The possibility for advancement however is lacking. Leadership is strong but communication from the top down isn't always there.
good,Paychex is a strong stable company.  They place a value on the sales organization and sales organization only.  Operations are generally thought of as replaceable.  Culture was increasingly becoming unstable.
good,Good place to work. Culture is good for people who are single or have a family. There are opportunities to grow and develop and possibly get promoted. The company does their best to be the best.
good,Good company but job security isn't there. You can have your job one day and then not the next. Lost my job because of medical reasons and I find that to be completely wrong and against their Paychex values.
good,Paychex has some of the best training and development in the industry. The work week is very flexible! One of the few roles you can obtain straight out of college and begin closing business. Your direct manager is very pendent on your success and whether you will enjoy working here. Be sure to ask their management and leadership style before taking the job.
good,"I really enjoy working for Paychex, they have provided me with excellent skills that I will take with me wherever I go. I love my managers as well as my coworkers, and everyone treats one another like one big family. I began this job as a temporary employee, and about a month after, I was offered a full time, permanent position. I was very thankful for the offer and was excited to begin my career at Paychex. The most rewarding part of my job, is knowing I am able to make somebodies day, and that I am able to help people no matter what the circumstance may be. "
good,Paychex is a great company to work for. Good pay and great benefits. The training was invaluable and well worth it. Got to spend 3 weeks in rochester for training.
good,I have enjoyed my work at my office immensely. I started working there upon graduation from University and basically grew up there. I have learned a great deal from them and they helped mold me into the productive man I am today. I enjoy the social aspect of the office environment and thrive on having a smile in every moment of my day.
good,It was an enjoyable place to work.  We always got our job's done and the day went by very fast. I've made some life long friends. Year end is a challenge & stressful.  But we get thru it.
good,"A typical day for an outside sales rep. is to give two presentations, set two new presentations, pick up 15-20 new business cards, visit one current client and see five CPA's a day  "
good,"Paychex was a great place to work with great people and a team atmosphere. Wanted to stay at Paychex but at the time, they did not have an office where I was looking to relocate to. Managers were on the ball and were very knowledgeable and supported a working relationship with our payroll counterparts."
good,"Flexibility and freedom on most days. Professional and consultative sales. Product knowledge is a long learning curve and there is little help from management. Kind of sink or swim environment, but the company has clear expectations and a nice culture overall with lots of opportunity for growth."
good,"The pay is lower, however the benefits are fair.  The training was very good as was the attitude toward training.  Overall, it was a good company to work for and would recommend."
good,great place to work. dec and jan are very stressful. co workers are great. manangment can be micro managers.
good,"Although I feel that essentially Paychex is an extremely ethical and morally upright company to work for, each location and sales team  is managed independently.  I have now become the senior member of my team, and feel that perhaps my earning potential has finally reached its limit.  I am seeking a new challenge with longer duration and greater earning potential."
good,"Paychex is a great company to work for.  If you have no clue about Payroll and HR not to worry, Paychex puts you through an extensive training program which teaches all you need to know!  The day to day operations is pretty straight forward.  The belief is if you follow the plan to a T you cannot fail!   You have to be willing to take control of your own path, meaning you need to be self motivated to do the activity and be successful.  There is not always the guidance from Management to get you on the right path, you have to find your own way at times. If you can get past that you can have a long and successful career at Paychex."
good,"Great management, very flexible, productive, sales meeting every Monday, great co-workers, learned great territory management, most enjoyable part of the job was assisting businesses that desperately needed payroll and hr solutions"
good,"A typical day is having 2-3 new presentations. Meeting 3 current clients, setting 2 new appointments and working with CPA's and bank partners to grow business. I have learned a lot as far as payroll taxes go and working with partners in other divisions of the company to offer a more intergrated solution to small businesses. The management team is very energetic and helpful and great sales professionals. My co workers are very competitive and great people all around. I have long lasting friendships. The hardest part of the job is overcoming former customers objestion to paychex errors in the past. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping small businesses impact their bottom line."
good,"I was part of a new sales division for a major large-cap corporation specializing in payroll and human resource services. My typical day was spent on the road prospecting for new clients. I traveled the country from New York to California setting up new offices and selling to C level management. My typical sales revenue per deal was $500,000 with a commission of 6%. Each signed deal was typically a three call close ending with a final sales presentation to key leaders of small to mid-sized corporations. I learned too many things to list as a leader of a new division. I really enjoyed the sales success I experienced and the management at Paychex Inc."
good,"A great company to work for that really values their employees. There is a lot of opportunities for advancement, but could use a better work/life balance."
good,"Fast Pace Payroll Company provide all training for information needed to assist all clients.   Will be assigned a minimum of 350 clients to maintain and assist.   Volume of calls and work load is much heavier during the end of the year and at the end of every quarter.     Co workers are a joy to work with but time is limited to build team work.  Bui9ness has changed over the last 10 years leaning more towards self serve platform for clients."
good,"Vision in the company was up and down. Lots of freedom but very little coaching, training, or developing. They have a lots of rewarding events so it's fun but doesn't give a very serious working vibe."
good,"Pros: Benefits offered from Day 1, including PTO hours. Professional and collaborative enviroment. Strong focus on self improvement. Annual bonuses based on performance."
good,I have worked at Paychex since I graduated from college and it has given me many opportunities to be in touch with my personal and professional growth.
good,"People say they are Paychex Proud for a reason.  It is a large company with a small company atmosphere.  I was fortunate to work from one of the corporate offices, so I really was able to see the company differently than others out side of the Rochester, NY area."
good,"Good company , cares about their employees. Could work on compensation plans/ better career advancement training or mentorship. Give help when they need to/ are asked for it."
good,"Excellent company with great leadership, innovative thinking, and great technology.  The organization allows for creative thinking, autonomy, and ability to maximize earning potential."
good,"Great Training and loved Paychex University. "
good,"I loved working at Paychex until they recently transitioned to a call center like setting. Management was super cool and understood you and actually listened. Going form processing 300-400 client payrolls to taking on additional clients and issues, was a bit overwhelming and stressful."
good,there are a lot of politics in some of the management groups. At times it is possible to move up in the company however sometimes the politics get in the way.
good,"Good benefits, advancement available."
good,Can be stressful. You are processing a lot of payrolls daily. I worked with great employees. Benefits were also great. I was able to go to school while working there. So that was a plus.
good,Paychex is a good place to work.  The culture is positive.   They have excellent training.  Management is supportive.  The hardest part of the job as with many companies is obtaining resources from other departments to accomplish goals.
good,"A recruiter contacted me about working for Paychex, I knew they had a good reputation so I interviewed. I was told if I started in a new Inside Sales department they were launching I could move to Outside Sales in a year. I worked very hard in this new department calling small businesses in rural America. The call metrics were 160 calls per day which I and my entire team found to be very challenging. I did a good job for over a year but no local Outside Sales positions ever became available and I had an opportunity to move to Outside Sales for Doritex so I left."
good,"Rochester's finest, a great place to work with an excellent culture. Mid management needs some improvement and career development is poor. Product set is solid."
good,"Inside sales work culture was very straight forward, 8-5 held accountable for every minute. great for a young out of college graduate but difficult for a seasoned employee. Tend to favor young people who need to have strict guidelines."
good,"i loved the culture and the position but do not plan on advancing for at least 5 years or more and they do not ever tell you that."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is to learn something new everyday. "
good,"This was when Paychex was still growing by leaps and bounds.  Therefore working in the purchasing department meant you were always busy.  Everyone that I worked with were nice, fun people that were also hard, good workers."
good,"I started out in the call center, which was a little confining. I switched to another department and my day became very relaxed. I was still at my desk most of the day, but had leniency of leaving it when I wanted. The day was relatively structured, but the work load was not tiring."
good,"Review and process payroll for clients"
good,Culture good. Lots of fun. Lots of cold calling. Relationship building with CPA and bank channel as well as Insurance agents from time to time. Overall it is okay
good,Balance is key and this company is currently learning how to help its employees do just that. Challenging projects and wonderful people are here. Advancement is something that you have to learn how to navigate through.
good,Overall great company. If you do well they treat you well. Great sales training. Being in the field and training helps you prepare for any other job in the future.
good,"Very busy day with processing payroll and account audits. Daily clerical duties. I have learned the true meaning of a Administrative"
good,"Good place to be to get your foot in the door of the payroll industry. It's a decent paying office job, but once you know what you're doing, you'll probably be able to find another payroll company who will pay you more for doing the same thing."
good,My manger was a laid back manager that cared about the overall security posture and allowed me to tackle security problems as I saw fit.
good,Great environment that feels like family.  Management is very understanding about conflicts that may arise and willing to work with you.  Many different work hour options to fit individual schedule.
good,"I had a good time working here, there is a great a great opportunity for internal promotions within the organization. If your looking for a job that provides work/life balance this is probably not the one for you."
good,"Paychex is not competitive on salary but the benefits and internal resources are fantastic."
good,"Paychex provides excellent training and I left training knowing I could do my job well.  Enjoyed the atmosphere, and my team."
good,"Co-workers great, Well run organization, pay is not the greatest,  very lax work facilities, dynamite benefits and just a really great employer.  Nothing else to add."
good,It is a very good and fun company to work for in many ways. There are many hard working individual employee at this company.
good,"Paychex is a great company. Flexible Schedule, lots of travel, high-activity based work and results oriented. Great management in the New Orleans area."
good,"Very homely place to work at"
good,was disappointed with how territories were broken for each of the sales reps.
good,Company has been fantastic to work for!  They have wonderful training programs and great benefits.
good,"Spent days in the field cold calling and developing relationship with CPA's within my Territory."
good,"The hardest part of the job is to keepup with the time schedules."
good,"Paychex is a great place to work if you are focused on having a stable job with good benefits and not on compensation. There is little movement with salaries as you move up or for doing new jobs in the company. The people who are in the trenches are not the ones who are in control of giving access to things like overtime and raises, so raises are small and infrequent. However, the benefits like onsite health screenings, active health and other company wide functions, along with team food days and jeans days once in a while are things that you do look forward to having instead. Overall, it is a stable job and once you get into Paychex you can move through out the company but don't expect a lot of $ in any position."
good,"Prepared team for morning meetings."
good,AMAZING company to work for; great benefits and amazing comp structure.
good,"Paychex is a structured environment with specific procedures and schedules to be followed."
good,* Fun work environement
good,Telemarket and qualify candidates to present to. Generate leads through client list and cold calling. Present to potential employees
good,Good training methods at their headquarter's office.
good,"I've been with Paychex, INC for almost 3 years. I have grown my technical skills and toned my customer service skills. On a typical day i take 20 to 40 calls on busy days. I support a product that is technical because it is a software based product and i also utilizes networks. I have experienced many situations with clients from billing issues to PC related issues to wrong phone numbers. My current team of co-workers is one of the best parts of my job. I am very team driven and our team is very strong. I have no fears that i will lost my job because of lack of work. Paychex is a very established and continues to grow. My biggest compliant is how certain issues get handled once reached to high management."
good,I have learend a lot at Paychex. Management/Leadership training is taken very seriously.
good,Paychex has a lot of opportunities for growth. With many departments and product lines it is very easy for someone with ambition to make a name for themselves.
good,Need better training. The trainer wanted to talk more about herself than our jobs. Teach us how to help online customers. Have IT people. Don’t expect Rapid Response to do it. Lost Customers over that
good,Nice place to work - you goals are very clearly laid out in front of you as this can be a pretty aggressive sales culture.  Most people i worked with are good people
good,"Paychex is a great place to work. The training, the team environment, and the product/service is second to none. Lots of opportunities for growth, and lots of resources to further your career."
good,"Great place to work, fast pace and great people to be around."
good,Often times the loads that were given from the sales reps were incomplete with missing employee information. The sales reps did not always know what was required in a full load.  More training should have been offered to the sales team as to what was expected in the loads and how the first call experience was to occur.
good,Paychex had an excellent sales training program.  They invested to send me through the training which helped me perform my job well.  I was able to network while working to obtain business which ultimately led me to the opportunity of my dreams.
good,"I spent more than a year at Paychex as a student temp. Therefore I did not receive benefits and PTO as the rest of the FT employees. I also did not receive raises or promotion opportunities. Much of the typical Paychex experience is not my experience. The company does offer amazing benefits and generous PTO, just not to student temps. "
good,"Paychex teaches you what you need to know to go farther in this career path. They are not par in many areas which leads to employees looking elsewhere. They are more focused on cutting costs, therefore forcing employees to work with products that don't work or frequently fail. Upsetting the clients and setting the employees up for failure."
good,"Great place to work, people are friendly and helpful, flexible work schedule.  management is very helpful.  I only work twice a week.  I'm looking for full time work."
good,Paychex it's a really nice place to work if you have a degree in which position  your apply for. I was just thank God  for  allowing me to  work there because  they were  looking for a Data Entry person and few months  later it was an opening. I became  permanent trained as a payroll Specialist  work was slow.. didn't  need me anymore so they let me go.
good,"Lots of enthusiastic team members.  In most cases, I think that we have management support in making difficult decisions, although that might not be the case in all areas of IT."
good,Lots of calls and prospecting. Tons of conference calls. Lots of meetings. The sales process is a challenge but is doable. The issue is you constantly have to put out fires because operations drops the ball once sales are completed.
good,"I've had a good experience in my workplace.  My place of employment was acquired by Paychex.  The position provides adequate challenge and support by management.  A typical day requires a lot of email review, and consistent communication with your supervisor on clients. You must know how to communicate well with others and work as a team.The hardest part about the job is meeting deadlines, and providing coverage for co-workers who take personal time.  Most enjoyable part of the job is the enthusiasm of HR department."
good,"A typical day at Paychex is fast-paced with lots of different types of tasks that are challenging and rewarding. There is a collaborative environment and coworkers are supportive and hard-working. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the volume of work. With the continuous growth of the company, it can be challenging to maintain the pace and meet all deadlines."
good,"Great company to work for, would recommend to someone looking to start their career in outside sales. Must have the ability to be a self-started and independent worker."
good,"People are good to work with.  Can be stressful during year end processing.  The pay and benefits  is satisfactory.  Equipment and software need to be updated, which can cause stress during busy times.  Management is easy to deal with and helpful."
good,"Very high paced, could be very stressful and overwhelming at year and quarter end. Lots of opportunity to advance excellent training program. Nice office building with a café on site."
good,Enjoyed working for Paychex but was laid off due to work availability in Mail Room. Would go back and work for them if they called me back. Clean environment and co-workers were friendly.
good,Good place to work. Management was great and insurance is interesting and being able to help people is great as well. Overall a very good place to work.
good,this was a fun experience got to travel to the corporate location in Rochester NY. Met some amazing peopled learn a lot about a businesses owner responsibilities with payroll and making sure all the state and federal taxes and deposited correctly.
good,Paychex is a great company but the recent changes are holding us back from giving the best customer service. Too many clients for one person to handle.
good,fine with working a paychex.Happy environment. love to coordinate people and helping managers and team leads. worth learning more subject and always have zeal at work.
good,Will it was a fun and challenging environment the training didn't prepare you for the full job responsibility. Difficult to get help with unfamiliar payroll issues. A typical day consists of emailing/calling clients to prepare for daily payroll entry.
good,emal and phone relationships with clients all day procesing payroll making payroll corrections editing client information granting them opnline access and training as needed
good,"Great benefits. Good management. Can be very stressful when the division is not doing well. As an admin, sometimes it feels like your job is at risk if the division is not doing well. You do learn a lot. Company pays for your licensing class."
good,"Great company, but the pressure on pipelines and forecast is incredible day to day.  Salesforce and your calendar run you life and the management team is good, but it's very much a ""clap club""."
good,"Daily tasks are within reasonable limits. Some management should take some refresher courses on how to communicate in a positive but, effective manner. Overall, great place to work."
good,"Great place to work, excellent training, employees and management are like friends and family. Great experience I would recommend this place to any one looking for a great career and opportunity"
good,Great place to work. Management needed great improvement upon my departure but the company as a whole took very good care of it's employees. Excellent training and the pay was amazing.
good,This job can be very frustrating at times but the environment and people are very positive and progress-oriented.  It's a simple Monday-Friday 8 am to 5 pm and that is worth it to me because I get to spend time with my family.
good,"If you want to get into leadership and move up the corporate ladder, Paychex is a great place to start.  The pay is not the best, but the benefits are very good and the people are passionate about what they do.  They have a strong reputation and their CEO is driven.  Their training programs are geared to help you succeed.  There are times of the year when you will need to work longer hours, but for the most part your work/life balance is good.  If you live in Rochester, NY then there are many departments throughout the company you can get into and grow."
good,"Typical day at Paychex is very fast pace filled with multi tasking. Start by reviewing your payroll schedule for the day, then constantly checking emails, faxes, logging sales force cases. Payroll specialist also enter their own data for payroll changes and scan their own documents. The payroll phone queue is also part of daily responsibilities. You are expected to stay logged in when at your desk. Garnishments are also entered by the payroll specialist"
good,"Paychex has the right mentality of truly listening to the clients and what their needs are.  Especially if you are a small to mid sized business, Paychex's products and services are not only affordable but extremely valuable for the growth and stability of most companies."
good,"A typical day at Paychex consists of customer service, maintaining a strong professional manner, setting daily goals, meeting or exceeding quota, checking daily emails, communicating to prospects over the phone, booking appointments, generating/following up on leads, drawing interest for company, running my own operations, building partnerships and working with partners. "
good,"As an Agile Coach no day was typical. Supported 12 Teams over a Six month Period"
good,"Paychex is a unique sales environment due to the many different divisions that all work with clients.  They can supply everything that a company would need to function such as Payroll, HR services and Employee Benefits."
good,"Was person you see when you first enter our facility, directed calls to the appropriate person. made sure mail and faxes were delivered to correct person as well. Placed order for supplies and  made sure paper was stocked."
good,People oriented company with a good work life balance. Promotes high standards of values and reward hard work. Paychex provides a wide variety of career path which makes it very difficult to leave the company. But you have to have some flexibility with relocation. The positions are very challenging and keep you engaged at all times. No two days are the same almost.
good,"Many different aspects of the front line position, resources available to succeed and opportunities available to transfer to different aspects of payroll and human resource services. Training program is excellent and offers material to extend far beyond the payroll and human resource aspect."
good,"I came to work for this company part time and after a year I went full time. It  is 20 years later and I am still here loving it. I  Provide administrative/secretarial support for various departments such as answering telephones, assisting visitors and resolving a range of administrative issues and inquiries.  Operate desktop computer, scanner, copier, printer, Rightfax, postage machine and other miscellaneous office equipment on a daily basis.  Handle calls and promptly forward to appropriate person among 100 + employees .What I love most about my job is everyone that works here is like family we all get along very well."
good,"Paychex is a great place to work in terms of job security, acceptable pay with good benefits, and good management. However, it's a standard office job with not much to offer if you're looking for a high paced, growth, change the world sort of job."
good,"Paychex is great company to work for if you're looking for a fast paced, highly competitive industry. Their products are top notch and provide many solutions for small to medium sized companies struggling with payroll management."
good,"Excellent place to get your feet wet in payroll.  My office had great peer and management support.  The job is stressful and much is expected from each rep.  All the same, I liked the environment and having a dedicated client list."
good,"Enjoyed my short time there, great people to work with.  Hard to sell the product, outsourced payroll system.  Goal is to reach small business owners who are struggling/fed up with their own payroll system.  Often times, Quickbooks is cheap and easy.   Some business owners use ADP.  "
good,I have learned to analyze problems with the processing machines and operate them very efficiently. I have fostered team work and boosted productivity in doing so.
good,"I  am currently a Senior Online Payroll Support Specialist at Paychex, Inc. where I am responsible for over 300 clients. In this role, I assist these clients in troubleshooting the online payroll platform, processing new hire paperwork, promotions and terminations, and ensuring clients are in compliance with federal, state, and local tax agencies. I am also responsible for preparing and amending Federal and State tax returns when needed. In addition to these tasks, I provide WebEx trainings to onboard new clients onto the online payroll platform, while still maintaining my current client base. I am also involved in organizing and presenting in-house trainings for all clients migrating to the new online platform. I am able to multitask with ease and take on each day with a bright and positive attitude. Another passion of mine is training and mentoring. I continue to be active in mentoring co-workers and aid in any group/branch trainings that I am able to. I am always looking for opportunities to enhance my knowledge, skills, and career."
good,"Great Training"
good,I wish the pay was a little more rewarding for the amount of work we are expected to do. However great benefits with mostly flexible management.
good,"Supported District Sales Manager (DSM) and Sales Team to achieve monthly/yearly goals.  This included duties such as expense reporting and tracking, scheduling, travel, event planning, etc."
good,Good people.  Great benefits. Expansive product line.  Top notch sales team.
good,"A typical day at work consists of prospecting businesses in the morning and strategizing with internal partners. I will then run all of my sales call in the afternoon. I will either do all of my follow ups in the evening or fisrt thing the next morning before my prospecting begins."
good,"A typical work day involved calling 80 customers to get their employee payroll hours. Taking about 30 customer call-ins for various reasons: missed payroll call; need to correct payroll; state or federal tax notices; etc."
good,The starting pay is extremely low for the stress level of the job. If you are diligent and actually study your level work. The training in NY is not hard. The job can be very demanding to its payroll specialists.
good,I deal with clients and their issues all day long. After a while it becomes routine and you just go about your day. Management for the most part is good though there are a few that should be replaced. Coworkers are great - it's a fun environment whenever possible though year-end and quarter-end can be unbearable.
good,This is an awesome company other than the cliques for advancement.
good,"The VPs get millions of dollars in stock ""gifts"" that they sell the same day. Yet the employees (who are the company and you should put your money into what makes the company) make less money than the people at Jiffy Lube and have to wait for 5 years for the 100 shares of stock options at a high purchase cost to become vested. If you don't supervise someone, you barely make a living regardless of skill, experience or work performed."
good,"Paychex was wonderful, loved my Manager and Team, but taking care of 67 clients was a little too much for an 8-hour day.  "
good,I enjoyed having clients exclusive to the specialist. It gives you a chance to get used to working with the clients and get their payroll in as quickly and as efficiently as possible. Having clients you bond with motivates you to work harder to get the job done.
good,"It has been a pleasure working within paychex, yet I am looking to advance my career and get back into what I love doing which is project coordination."
good,Great place to work enjoyed the atmosphere and the senior staff and the guidance that they provide. I only wish there were more opportunities such as this one in the Rochester area.
good,"Paychex holds it's core values in the highest regard, having it influence every aspect of their business operations. Amazing employee satisfaction!! Was an absolute pleasure to work for them."
good,The only reason i left paychex was my punctuality it was over the bridge and alot of traffic sometimes hours in traffic. They had me train New employees and then fired me smh besides that i loved my job and environment their seems to be favoritism
good,"-baptism by fire style of training. "
good,I enjoyed to work at Paychex.  It is very easy job for me.  The job only hard when at the end the quarter that I had long and differernt schedule to work.  Paychex has good benefit package.  I love Paychex.  I won't leave if I did not run into the problem with my newborn who keep me up and never enough sleep for driving to work
good,"Entered garnishments, dealt with employees question, concerns and issues.  I acquired new skills and learned a lot about the laws concerning Garnishments.  Management was excellent.  We worked hard but had a lot of fun.  The hardest part of my job was dealing with understandably irate people who had garnishments while keeping as calm as possible.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with.  They were like family."
good,I like the flexibility that i have at paychex as an outside sales rep. Paychex is a good brand to work for in the PR & HR arena. Management is very hands on and i've learned a lot from them.
good,"I really don't have any complaints about working at Paychex. Unfortunately I was a contractor so a lot of the benefits of being a full time employee didn't apply to me. "
good,Paychex is very thorough with their initial and ongoing training and development of their employees as well as their concern for employees level of comfort.
good,It’s a great company to work for with friendly and helpful colleagues. I would definitely recommend this company to someone looking for a professional career.
good,"Paychex has an exceptional Training program. The benefits are great, including 401k, great heath insurance and bonus pay.  Team work atmosphere and promote within the company."
good,"Company closing its Norwalk, CT location otherwise I would definitely retire from here. Great place to work and employee become real close to one another."
good,I worked in the call center. It was not the greatest position to be in. The direct management staff did what they could but the manager over the whole center changed too often and so did the rules of the position. Had I been able to stay longer I probably would have ended up in a position.
good,"Strong culture"
good,"Although PayChex is a large corporation, they treat their employees with the utmost respect and provide and generously comfortable work environment for employees."
good,"Everything is great! It's a very nice place to work. work environment, co-workers, managements and facilities every-things are excellent here. It is one of the most growing up Payroll running company in USA. if any one get chance to work with this company, it will great opportunity to improve his/her career and future."
good,"The training was exceptional. They rolled out the red carpet with training for two week in Rochester, New York. It was an experience I will never forget. I meet amazing people and learned so much"
good,"I have learned a tremendous amount about selling cloud based solutions here through a comprehensive channel/partner approach.  The culture here is extremely supportive.  I am provided consistent coaching and support from my manager.  "
good,Our branch in Riverside had a great group of selling individuals. They made it fun to learn and come to work. The training was the best I have had since Cintas and I would definitely recommend this company to a friend.
good,"Paychex is always looking for individuals who want to work for a company that allows for growth and development. With your desire to succeed and our training and resources, opportunities at Paychex are more than just jobs. We provide an atmosphere that fosters a healthy work life balance, and our comprehensive benefits package provides health care, retirement planning, education assistance, and much more."
good,I thoroughly enjoy working for Paychex and hope to continue. My longer plan is to relocate to the Ft Myers area and work with both the local office there as well as apply my bicycle skills at a shop.
good,Paychex is a good company that treats its employees well but also stays focused on work productivity. It is very supportive of growth and allows for the employees to do their job but not ask to much of them.
good,"Great place to work for a sales job if you motivated and driven to run your own business, bring on new clients and network.  They offered great benefits to employees and had wonderful training and a good culture."
good,Paychex is an excellent company to start a career. A lot of room for growth. Great benefits and also a great team to work with. 401k match kicks in after a year of service
good,"Great benefits, great support from upper management. "
good,Competitive Environment.  The environment for Paychex is helpful but usually requires moving to different divisions for career advancement and salary increase.
good,"First job out of collage."
good,Although people work on different teams ... they work together very cohesively to completed tasks to ensure that the clients are satisfied.  We may work in different departments but collaboration is key to a successful client onboarding.
good,Very busy and stressful at times.  Great people to work with.  Most stressful part is during tax time of the year for w'2s.  You are on a time crunch to get all inputted in..formation for each week
good,"Interned at Paychex in Morrisville over the summer in 2016. Best learning experience I could have had as an intern. Employees always willing to provide tips and tricks into how they get the job done, as well as supportive management."
good,This is a great place to work. I would recommend this job for anyone looking for a job in payroll and accounting. The company is great to work for. I am thankful for the opportunity.
good,"I interned at PayChex for 4 months as a software engineer intern in 2016. My team consists of 8 people, and my daily duties include developing test suites into the existing QA framework and some debugging cases from Jira."
good,"I work in the corporate headquarters in Rochester, NY. There are no truly ""typical"" days. Each day brings new challenges and rewards. Employee recognition is huge and really boosts team building."
good,"Great Company , middle management needs work as they are hiring people who are not qualified and can make the entire division look bad. More thought needs to be put in this process."
good,"A typical day at work usually starts with an Agile scrum meeting to go through the assigned work tasks / stories and then prioritize the work for the day. There will be other team meetings like Sprint Planning and retrospective meetings also every other week there will be release meetings to show case what are the issues fixed and what features are getting released for our in house testing tool / Tool Agnostic Framework."
good,"its busy, more busy on certain days, but its a nice atmosphere , not much room to grow, unless they really like you, other than that it was ok, the people who do work there have been there forvever"
good,I worked at the front working with people when they came in to pick up payroll. Loved it. The people that worked there was a great bunch of people to work with.
good,"I like working at Paychex, but could not find a position to accommodate my acquired degree. I want to stay with the company but no opening are happening, so it is time to look outside the company."
good,My time at Paychex has provided me much valuable learning. My boss was direct and challenging but also fair and kind.  The overall work environment was accepting and fun.
good,"I enjoyed working for Paychex,  Your work day was very detailed oriented and fast paced. I always felt as if I accomplished something everyday.  I also had a chance to meet and greet out clients which was nice to have that face to face relationship also."
good,"a bit stressful when you are first starting off as a payroll specialist, year end is STRESSFUL management is god benefits is great, but over all stressful job"
good,"Low pressure fun atmosphere to work in, management is there to help and co-workers are for the most part there to help as well. Toughest part of the job is scheduling meetings with business owners but if you're confident in yourself and you don't give up you will succeed and will reach your goals."
good,Paychex is a very productive business. as a mail distribution clerk you learn what it takes to package so many packages and mailed out within a certain time. everyone was enjoyable to work with and always kept busy.
good,"Paychex has many areas for promotion, great professional growth and training.  People here are wonderful and most management is also great and committed to professional growth."
good,"I enjoyed working for Paychex, I just didn't like my position. I worked for the health and benefits team for companies less than 50 employees. Before working for Paychex, I did not know that health benefits were not mandatory for companies under 50 people."
good,Good employer for the right fit employee. If you work hard and stay on task you will be rewarded. Employee moral is high as energy is certainly there as the workplace is fun.
good,The pay is on the lower end of competitive but increases if you're a quick learner or an over achiever. Company does offer work from home which is a huge bonus.
good,"Company focus is profit "
good,"Great company to work for and the training is awesome but the compensation is not as competitive as other companies. "
good,"good culture"
good,Paychex is the perfect place to begin your career. I make 150 dials per day and am expected to set 4 appointments per day. Management tends to micromanage and not give a lot of freedom to make your own calls. Co workers are all great! The hardest part of the job is making 150 dials each day. The most enjoyable part is the atmosphere at work
good,"Paychex is a very good company to work for. Good benefits, a health & wellness program & work from home option for some employees."
good,"Paychex is making a VERY solid investment in advancing software technology.  Like any large software organization, there are many opportunities for improvement.  But I really believe the company is committed to becoming more Agile in practice, adopting newer technologies, and continually improving their products."
good,"Pros-"
good,Great company to work for.  Their benefits package they offer employees are amazing.  Compensation is quite low for the work load though.

good,Great company with excellent training and opportunities for advancement.  Good compensation and benefits.  Self-driven job with fun coworkers.  Challenging sales goals.  Good management and support.
good,My experience so far with Paychex is great. My first day the people who have been working there years before me are so nice and welcming to a new person on the team. Everyone is so polite and concerned that if I have any questions to not hesitate and ask away. Great group of people!
good,"As Temp and Temp to Perm - was greeted warmly and welcomed to both opportunities."
good,"I would recommend Paychex as a it is a great place to work. I started working there right out of college, and have been there for almost 13 years. I have been in sales my entire time there."

good,"Worked in the Unemployment area of Paychex, Everything and time deadlines that had to be kept. Faxing and mailing these claims had to made before 3:00 pm every day."
good,"Working with Paychex was a great experience, however; I strongly disliked the fact that I was secluded to my desk throughout the day. If I didn't have to use the restroom, take a lunch break, or go to a meeting, I didn't have to leave my desk.That was a task that grew difficult to handle."

good,"This is a great ""job"". It's not necessarily a great ""career"". The hours are predictable (except for year-end) and the environment is professional. It is a highly ethical company and the benefits are solid. The pay is not really competitive. "
good,District sales manager for 20 sales representatives. Commissioned based environment.  Good sales and management training.
good,Everyone is nice and accommodating.  Always willing to help if you have any questions.
good,I serve as a help desk specialist that assist a client base of 400 client codes.  I am also responsible for teaching and servicing internal clients as well as management on technical concerns surrounding the Paychex payroll platform.  The most enjoyable part of my day is assisting  my clients - getting them positive resolutions to their concerns.  My co-workers operate in a well organized team environment and are very dedicated to the success of the business.
good,"Good environment with good opportunities if you actually try. Compensation isn't where it should be and they stick to percentage increases, so if you come in low it's difficult to get to what you should be making. Some people dislike management, but those are generally not the people putting in the effort. Reasonable expectations. Management recognizes accomplishments. Interesting work. Crazy year-end hours during December and January with blacked out time off. It really is what you make of it."
good,"A typical day at work started at 8:00 am and went till 5:00 pm. It involved researching new audits, analyzing samples, tracking and monitoring data."
good,Had a great supervisor and a well experienced team.  A typical day involved a large variety of different tasks related to the variety of products offered to our clients.  I improved my interpersonal skills as a team lead.   New products required new instructions and training within the team. I learned an extensive amount about inventory and inventory control.   The hardest part of the job was a a resistance by the team to new methods or change.   Most enjoyable part of the job was the  camaraderie on the team most days.
good,"A typical day at Paychex was processing payroll for you clients.  AAssisting clients from in bound calls with payroll, payroll issues, changes, and best practices."
good,"sort different stacks of payrolls and sort them according to client. Then take checks that needed to be folded and put into envelopes would be brought to the machine. Then packed away in a confidential package/folder. Packages then would be sorted, scanned, and sent according to FEDEX, UPS, USPS, or carrier filing."
good,Developed an undeveloped territory serving small businesses with payroll services.
good,Great place to work.  People are very nice and fun to work with
good,A great position for anyone looking to take their sales skills to the next level.
good,"Team work is Paychecks, Everyone helping each other meet company goals in providing service to customers."
good,-Great work life balance
good,Your days at work are very busy but very structured so they go by quickly. Training and development programs are second to none to get you on board and comfortable with taking payroll. Management is very rigid but its expected in a company this large. Co-workers are a mix bag but most are pretty fun to work with. Hardest part of the job is the tax stuff and all the training required. The best part of the job is getting to network and work with so many different companies.
good,"I learned all that I know about payroll here. The job offered so many different benefits, and the management was pretty knowledgeable."
good,typical day at work are always busy but i learned as i move on.Co workers are very helpfull.Job is not as hard as i thought in the beginning.
good,Always feel good about coming to work.
good,"A typical day work for me in my position would everyday billing and invoice payments as well as applying discounts, credits and charges to clients. My coworkers are a big part of my daily task as they provide me with clients who need assistance. The hardest part of my job would be having to explain an invoice to a client about unwanted charges or services they have to pay that they were not aware of. The most enjoyable part of my job are the people I work with and the different personalities that keep this company growing."
good,"Paychex is by far the best sales company I have ever worked for.  They treat the salespeople as more than just a number.  There is ample growth to allow for movement, both geographic and career, anywhere in the U.S."
good,They truly encourage growth and teach you the skills to take your career to the next level. You are pushed daily to succeed and it can be tough. If takes time and you can not compare yourself to another rep because everyone’s experience can be totally different. You have to plan on at least a 5 month ramp up.
good,I've held two different positions within Paychex.  Both of them were extremely stressful and the pay wasn't worth all the stress coming in to work everyday.
good,"Paychex is a great place to work but over the past few years, Paychex very much taxed the band width of Management. It ultimately became an issue of work / life balance."
good,"B2B sales producer with a flexible schedule prospecting on new businesse. One of the top companies to sell for and provides top notch on-going training. Management is in sync and after a common goal. The culture of the company is team effort. The hardest part of the job is scheduling meetings with prospects that don't use your solution today. The most enjoyable part of the job is the company, team, and manager that I work for as well as the support they provide."
good,"Paychex is always looking for ways to help their employees thrive. There are many advancement opportunities. The benefits are great, and the culture is enjoyable as well. I left Paychex because I wanted a career change. I did not want to work in sales anymore. A downside is having to use your own vehicle. I Have high mileage in my vehicle. I would have preferred a company car over an expense allowance. My manager was always great to me as well. He was very supportive and always gave helpful advice when I was stuck."
good,"I've enjoyed working at Paychex the management is great and generally very supportive of what you're looking to do.  Additionally the work life balance is fantastic as they are very flexible with your needs for appointments or time off.   Lastly the benefit package is very good, although I do wish the pay was just a little higher"
good,"- Can be long, short, fast paced, slow paced, hard, easy."
good,"People are friendly, if you're a good, reliable worker, they try to keep you in the company whether it's a new department or higher position."
good,Paychex is a good company to work for. Great benefits and a good leadership team that wants to see its employees succeed. Stress and work-life balance are challenging at times. Great opportunity since it is such a large company.
good,"Great opportunity for advancement and continued training. Competitive hourly wages. Management very helpful and understanding, Benefits are great (medical, dental, vision, life). Paid time off, sick time, and float vacation time. Typical office hours,"
good,I do not feel the need to give an opinion on my work day at my current place of work. I would rather not go into detail about that. What I will say is that
good,Unfortunately I had to step down from my position due to a sick  child and I am looking to get back in the workforce. Paychex does not have a position that I am overqualified for currently. The hardest part of the job was working more than my scheduled 40 hours as I was in management and on salary. I do not mind doing it but it does take a toll on my kids and wife. I just know I need to provide for them so I will do whatever it takes.
good,"High pace stressfull,  you have to like being on the phone ALLday. Generally good benefits with PTO. Work on 2-3 computer monitors ,client load is a bit too much to much."
good,"If you enjoy customer service, this could be perfect, however, this is not a slow paced position. While you are given a lot of freedom (at least, here at the Indianapolis branch), and compensation is fair and benefits are awesome, you will be stressed, you will sometimes feel underwater, and depending on your supervisor (CSS), support will either be great or non-existent."
good,"The training at Paychex is fantastic and the product offerings are competitive and reasonable.  For a benefits company, sales reps typically do not have access to an HR department."
good,"Paychex provided me a foundation of great sales training and experience that elevated my career to where it is now. "
good,"great if you want to get into B2B sales and want a company that will train you to succeed.  Benefits overall are pretty good, with 401k match of 4 % after a year, health vision and dental"
good,I learned so much in 10 years. I started off as a temp and worked my way up several positions. There are many core values the company applies to your day to day job. My Manager was also my mentor from the first day of work. I appreciate all the learning and job experiences  taught throughout the years.
good,"The initial training was great, but after completing that it was not sufficient.  The mentoring program was a good idea, but I had 5 separate mentors in about 14 months.  This was not conducive to training."
good,"Great pay, benefits, and hours. My separation is not due to the company. Highly recommend if you are looking a sales company. Sales is where you will find the money."
good,"A great place to work. They supplied excellent training, the management was great and they recognized and rewarded hard work. I loved to build relationships with my clients and over the years thay actually became very good friends even though I did not meet 90% of them in person. It was hard to leave on vacation for an extended period as I was given very complex accounts and my substitutes would sometimes mess them up. This strained the excellent relationships that I had cultivated with my clients."
good,"Paychex was a good place to work and was very good to me.  "
good,"Overall great company to work for. Like any other company some days were busier than others. Constantly learning new things. Majority of the clients that you work with are great. Honestly I would have stayed with the company if they offered more work from home options. I was with the company for almost 5 years, however I relocated to a small out in a different state and the closest branch was about 2 hours ways, so I wasn't able to stay with Paychex."
good,"Admin supervisor, enjoyed working with co-workers  Upper mgmt. forgets about the real workers that get the job done. Learned Patience is the key and teamwork is a must."
good,"Amazing work environment, very understanding that LIFE comes first.  Frequent free lunches and ""fun"" days. They take care of their employees.  Not so easy to advance if you are in a smaller branch due to a very low turnover."
good,"We were 5 Interns in the company and it was an amazing experience at Paychex. The flexibility provided by our manager and space given to us to explore, learn and do things our way made me grow. I enjoyed what I did. Investigating the performance of the application and make it better, analyzing future issues gave me a command over my Job."
good,Our days were very busy. Our department took on many assignments from other depts. In my years at Paychex I learned a variety  of computer programs. My co-workers were more like family. We all got a long and worked as a team to get the job done. Management was always open to new ideas that would aid in getting a job done.
good,"•	Partners with Operations and Sales to assist with trainings based on team needs"
good,"Paychex is a great company to work for. They have great training, advancement opportunity, and are a very big player in their business services industries. "
good,I really enjoyed the people I worked with which made my job enjoyable.  I started out packing payrolls and in about 6 months moved to an Admin position where I took over the billing for the larger clients.  They do their best to work with their employees as well as offering a lot of good benefits.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with the angry clients when their payroll was not done correctly.
good,"My time at Paychex has been an experience that I cannot be thankful enough to have had.  I have learned a great deal, my Area Manager and peers are awesome to work with and the professional development opportunities have been immeasureable.  Paychex Blue = Awesomeness"
good,"Very nice environment, awesome benefits, room for growth and excellent training options."
good,"A normal day of work consists of me answering emails and phone calls from clients. I've learned multiple tax regulations for benefits such as 401(K) and health insurance related deductions.  My self-sufficiency skills were sharpen by learning how to govern ""supervisor"" calls.  I now handle all of my own escalated calls by using the best judgement skills always resulting in a satisfied client. Management gives to encouragement to employees to apply for open positions. Management also seems to be unaware of their employees' skill set and they only recognize the specialist who's client sent in an honorable mention for them. The hardest part of my job is the constant ringing of my direct line. Though my job is not a call center environment, my direct line implies differently.  The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that I answered all of the clients questions efficiently. I'm never afraid to admit when I'm wrong, but I like being correct when asked what I am knowledgeable about.  My co-workers also make it the most enjoyable part of my job.  My co-workers are one big team no matter what department we are located. "
good,"Its a good place to work,  Its not a place you will be at forever though.   "
good,I like working for this company. It is a very professional environment in which I enjoy.
good,"Work hard, get paid well. If you want to become a professional sales person, starting at Paychex is ideal. Great training and management."
good,"My days at Paychex were spent on the phones cold calling/prospecting for new business. This organization taught me a lot about organization, relationship building, and developing/maintaining goals."
good,"Work hard and play hard.  Paychex has a lot of perks - ice cream socials, food events (Christmas dinner), manager made breakfast - very fun and energetic Employee yearly meetings. If you consider all the perks, it's a nice place to work."
good,"There is always something to do. I've learned a lot about payroll, taxes, and how small business operates. Management generally cares about you as an individual. The culture is great with a sense of belonging. The hardest part of the job was hitting metrics and numbers for sales. The camaraderie and culture of the workplace."
good,"I liked this company, you worked with wonderful people that had great personalities and was a environment that was welcoming but i could not afford to work here honestly only down fall about rhis company was the pay."
good,A great place to start a career. If you are focused and keep your goals in mind you can go far here. You can learn a lot about Human Capital Management from this industry leader.
good,"Paychex has so far been incredible to work for.  You 100% get what you put into it.  If you are interested in working a stable job, that presents many career opportunities in the future, than this is the place to go."
good,"Great company to work for. Great benefits all around, if I were to move to the north i;d go back in a heart beat. Great training programs, management helps you advance your career with them."
good,"I owe so much to Paychex for helping me get started in the right career path. The work environment, culture, people, and benefits are something I'm not so sure I could ever find again. Unfortunately their pay is just too low for my own personal bills that I have to pay right now. For someone who has a combined income with someone else it may be alright, financially."
good,"They are responsible for of the advancement of made in my career.  They provide top notch training which did not help me grow within the company, but provided me the foundation to grow when I went other places."
good,"- Love the company mission"
good,"Paychex, excels at training their employees and providing the tools you need to get where need to be and plan where you want to go. Amazing benefits and opportunities to earn incentives on top of your regular pay."
good,"Working with Paychex was nice. Nice people, they care for you, they make you feel like your part of a family. You can always ask for help and not feel bad."
good,Great place to work with great people.  Plenty of opportunity to move around the company and find a great fit.  Great benefits and increased PTO the longer you've been there.
good,"A typical day would be going to your cubical looking your client list. You have a list of clients you have to reach out daily as well as respond to emails. This is a desk job, not much interaction with the people around you. I would say the hardest part of all is just trying to find answers to clients questions as well as trying to multi-task calls, emails. You definitely need to be proficient in outlook, and have knowledge in billing, tax laws. If you do not then this job will be very stressful for you."
good,Paychex is a great company to work for. The opportunities they provide is great. They always feed us. The biggest thing is insuring you meet your 40 hours. They accommodate because they want you to get your work done. My department rather you work an hour extra for 4 days then to take off an entire day. They need the work to be completed. If you have to leave early they ask for communication. We get two paid breaks a day and they require at least a 30 minute lunch.
good,Opportunities to advance your career if you are willing to put your time in. There is a culture of support and encouragement to try other career opportunities.
good,"Paychex is a great company, with many wonderful employees and management. There are a lot of company incentives, and bonuses. It is a fast paced position, with opportunity to grow."
good,I enjoyed my time at the company as a part-time employee. My co-workers were very friendly and professional as well my supervisors. The culture at Paychex is also very professional.
good,"Over all, I'm very happy with my time at Paychex Insurance Agency Inc. I've spent almost 6 years here and am walking away with some great friends and work experiences that will help me in the future. It's still a fairly ""young"" company so they do make mistakes but they adjust to the mistakes and move on. I feel for the most part upper management listens to their employees in order to keep us happy."
good,"This was a fun work place where I was rewarded for the hard work. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with CPA's, networking groups, and getting to know small business owners in the community. The management was fantastic. A typical day at work consisted of cold calls, sales presentations, networking with CPA's, and setting up payroll systems."
good,"Learned the ins and outs of how payrolls are processed by an outside resource.  Enjoyed dealing directly with clients.  Excellent co-workers.  Ongoing training, usually on a weekly basis."

good,Great introductory position for recruiting as well as corporate culture.

good,"Paychex genuinely seems to care about it's employees and has a strong culture. I've never experienced a workplace so focused on teamwork, growth and innovation."
good,Great place to learn sales and the financial aspects of running a business.  Early morning meetings and late night networking are essential to be successful here.
good,"Paychex is a very large company with lots of career options.  Althought there are many available positioins, employees are un able to advance or get promoted unless they have been in their current role for one year."
good,"The NSS position is a very slow paced boring position, sitting at a desk for 8 hours a day cold calling is not exhilerating. This is a great entry level position into sales and anyone who can commit to this can have endless promotion opportunities."
good,Paychex is an amazing company and I love working for them. They really care about their employees and their clients. They are always looking to improve to be better than they already are. I have great things to say about this company no matter who asks. The only downfall is the pay for what we do. We are the front line for the clients and in this day and age we need to make more money to keep up. The benefits are great as well which is a big help and I do love this job but all in all everyone wants to make more money.
good,"I loved learning all the software and procedures that went into filing Unemployment claims. The position I was in you could learn something new and implement it everyday, The mangers were great with working with you and providing anything you needed. Hardest part of the job was making sure everyone stayed on to of their own work load. I loved the fact that the job was team oriented but also gave you a lot of time working by yourself."
good,"Manage a client list for payroll needs, tax returns and W-2, research tax agency notices and resolution. Build relationships with clients. Many clients from CA and so hours worked are 9-6."
good,On a typical day you have a schedule of appointments to call in order to review and update client accounts. Each client is trained to access and review payroll information with you as you are required to update and calculate hours worked bonus pay outs and other payroll related tasks.
good,We started a new development process and it has been rocky. But plenty of opportunities to learn new things from many intelligent developers.
good,"Good sales training and leads.  The product delivered was not exactly aligned with the product I was trained to sell."
good,great management and training. Paychex's makes sure to give you the most training they can to make sure you are one of the best sales reps around. That's why Paychex's is recognized as top 10 in the country for employee training programs.
good,This company was good at recognizing when their employees did certain tasks correctly and effectively and understood when employees deserved more hours or more responsibilites.
good,Plenty of room for advancement. Its a team environment. Encourage individuals to lean. Benefits are fantastic. Pay could be a little bit better but raises do come quickly within the first year.
good,"I loved my Admin Assistant job at Paychex.  My managers were absolutely wonderful and let me excel in all areas that I worked.  When it came to statistical information, when I brought them my ideas of different ways to analyze and possible opportunities in the data to overcome, the management team not only listened but allowed me to work out my ideas to enhance the process."
good,"answering phone calls, assisting customers with issues"
good,"If you are great at sales, and want to work for a HR solution company, Paychex is the place. Different incentives and bonuses through out the year."
good,Paychex is an ideal work environment for someone eager to learn.  I worked in both benefit enrollment and Employer Shared responsibility and enjoyed the atmosphere.
good,"Working for this company has its ups and downs. My co-workers are nothing short of amazing and very knowledgeable. The morale between coworkers is good and you can also reach out for help. The workload is extremely heavy and work life balance is not east to maintain. Employees quit very often so you end up doing the work of 10 people in one day and management does nothing to help.The company has made some very big mistakes with implementing software that is counter productive and the recent hiring of new supervisors has had a negative impact on employee growth. "
good,Great place to work but can have its challenges with career advancements if it will be detrimental to your current department. You only have 3 attempts to pass state license
good,"I honestly have nothing negative to say about the company; but my feelings differ about the department and position I am in.  This is a very new product and department.  I am a case manager for over 120 clients whom 72% are escalated before I become their case manager.  This department lacks tracking systems and processes and therefore makes it extremely difficult to service clients on a day to day basis.  In addition, my direct supervisor is extremely helpful and is always willing to help, but management above him goes without the same great qualities."
good,"working off a dialer pitching senior citizens who has very little or no life insurance at all, asking customer various medical questions and sending customer to licensed insurance agent"
good,"Sales is increasingly shifting from ""farming"" to hunting focus. Be prepared to focus on Demand Gen and be able to run a flawless sales process. High degree of product knowledge needed. Tons of room to advance and make money if you are willing to work for it."
good,"My role was multi-faceted . I had responsibility for revenue growth, client retention, staff training, P&L, sales support, client satisfaction.  I led the nation (500,000 clients) in: Client satisfaction, employee retention, client retention and gross profit for the last 2 years of my employment."

good,Paychex provided me the necessary tools to grow as a sales representative. There are plenty of resources for employees to be successful and the staff was enjoyable to be around.

good,"It is a productive work place but at the same time fun, we all work as a team to get the job done.My favorite time of the day is having coffee before the start of the shift with a few friends. Everyday is a learning experience with changes in procedures and constantly changing schedules."
good,An incredibly successful corporate sales model of calls to sales.  An incredible opportunity to learn the typical sales cycle and customer retention model.
good,Great business to build your experience and get hands on training. Always keeping busy with all the work load that is provided on the daily bases.
good,Stellar work experience all the way around. Professional staff. Promoted professional growth. Excellent work conditions.

Really takes time to ensure the success of each team member, trains and has a democratic leadership style."
good,"This was an internship. I was in the Risk Management department.  This internship gave me the knowledge to know what more i needed to learn, and concentrate on to be able to become a part of the company. Co-workers were pleasent and easy to go to for questions. The hardest part was not staying longer to learn more about the department."
good,"Fortune 500 company, with excellent leadership.  Honestly, I only left to pursue my dream of becoming a physical therapist.  Although it was a difficult decision in leaving my team, it was the right choice long-term."

good,The training I received was excellent and I was promoted.  The atmosphere was professional and I enjoyed it.
good,"Paychex is a Fortune 500 Company. My employment with them was 17 years. Paychex is a great company to work for. The wage is more than fair, promotions from within the company are always first considerations for all exployees. The HR department is always current and sharing with government regulatiions. Training of employees is the foundation of Paychex. Employees are given the tools needed fullfill the company expectations and hlep all employees reach their goals. Health and well being is another area Paychex excels.I've enjoyed my career with Paychex. My reasoning of leaving Paychex is that I relocated out of New York State."

A very manageable territory with small to medium sized business with the ability to grow to enterprise sized.
good,Paychex is a fantastic company to get you sales feet wet. Skills required to achieve goals are ones that I will take with me in my next venture. I recommend for any first venture in NY sales.
good,"The job offers many benefits and my team was amazing. I only left because payroll is not the field I want to build my career in. Super energetic sales atmosphere, co-workers are supportive, management keeps changing, but other than that Paychex is awesome!"

good,"During my two years employed with Paychex, there has been continued demonstrations of Paychex values, including partnership and respect from supervisors and peers, creating an ideal work environment."
good,Between the benefits and the managers willingness to work around you this is an excellent company to work for. The only reason I am looking for other work is because I am a student and the hours I am currently working are really draining.
good,Overall good work environment. People are friendly and supportive in the office environment. Company offers good benefits and potential for career opportunities available.
good,"Some days are can be crazy and some quiet.  I don't think that there should be two full time people at the front, really it's kind of a waste. One lady sits and reads all day while the other one works.  Doesn't make any sense to me.  Maybe this should be two part time jobs."
good,"Flexible company with many WFH jobs, need more upper mgmt roles available in other areas than corp office.  Would strongly suggest this company has a great job for low to mid level jobs."
good,"Paychex provided me with a great experience to expand my customer service, communication and time management skills. A typical day is 8-5, with a client contact expectation of 40-65 (on average). The company had a training course with detailed instruction about the standard payroll tax forms, and the regulations/laws that impact them. Management was always very engaged and willing to provide assistance, guidance and leadership for both long term and day to day endeavors. Co-workers were very nice, and extremely competent and hard working. The hardest part of the job was leaving work at work, and also keeping active to avoid any desk job extra weight."

good,Interning at Paychex was astoundingly beneficial. I was able to learn how a Sales representative becomes successful and get a taste of the professional meetings and personas that are reflected throughout the staff. I learned lots of values the company represents and I learned a lot about the product that Paychex offered. I would recommend an internship at Paychex to many people.

good,"Lots of pressure to preform, but made friends with my clients who are still my friends 6 years later.  Learned valuable knowledge of payroll, taxes, and tax forms."
good,Great Company to work for 8-5 most days.  As an outside sales job sometimes started before 8 and ended after 5.  Worked autonomously and met with small businesses across upstate new york selling 401K plans.  Management was always fluctuating in my department and there was no stability there.  Seemed like becoming the manager of my division was a dead end.  Most enjoyable part of my job was helping people start a retirement plan while the hardest part of the job was territory management as it was a lot of driving.
good,"lead generation as well as virtual sales is a part of a daily agenda I learned a lot about payroll, taxes, 401 k and largely how company's work. co workers were great I loved the people I worked with. Hardest part of the job was not having any control of the leads you generate its completely dependent on the sales representative selling the lead. Sometimes it would be a laidback environment which made it relaxing and easier to do the job duties."
good,"Take inbound calls from clients about questions or issues pertaining to their 401k. "

good,"A typical work day includes cold-calling, emailing and telemarketing in your territory to conduct sales with new and current clients. I learned the importance of organization and being assertive. The hardest part is organizing your days and competing with other companies."
good,"Fun atmosphere. Young environment. Drink the Kool-Aid. Put in work, get results. Not always the case but should be unless you get dealt a bad hand. Stepping stone. Cold calling."
good,my typical day at work i sit at my cubical desk and gather and analyze payroll reports by the client number with the checks and prepare it for outbound mail by the hubs and also assist other departments when supervisor is not available.

good,"As the first job I've ever gotten in America, I was thankful for the welcoming co-workers and rigorous training. My supervisors were fair and nice. At my department, speed and accuracy is everything so it's nice that the work environment lets me use headphones to concentrate."
good,"Paychex is a great place to work if you like dealing with numbers & clients. Management is okay, can be helpful at times. Hard part about working here is being able to assist clients correctly and efficiently on a daily basis."
good,"I left Paychex to pursue sales in another industry, now realizing that I would ultimately like to work in more of an account management role rather than a sales role."
good,Had to learn about all different types of companies and how they process their payroll for their employees. Also dealing with their corporate tax returns on a quarterly and yearly basis.
good,Good company with great benefits fun environment with good people.  the new service model has everyone working for remote supervisors and such.  I'm not a huge fan because there is disconnect.
good,Paychex has many great opportunities that have allowed me to showcase my various abilities.  I've been very happy here but my contract term is coming to an end.
good,Paychex is a great place for anyone starting out in the payroll world or any HR positions.. The pay is low but the experience is very valuable. The benefits were awesome.
good,"Each client service rep is assigned a list of clients to service. Most clients input and transmit the payroll electronically, however, the clients call or email for assistance with garnishments, tax questions, amended return requests and how to correctly pay fringe benefits."
good,great company and culture but very low salary compared to competitors..  product was falling behind competitors and never caught up.  companies focus was on other divisions

good,"I would not change anything about the company I would say more work from home opportunity, the atmosphere is great everyone gets a long and are willing to help."
good,"As a single parent working in the HR Consulting arm of Paychex, I feel the hours are flexible enough to do what you need to for the Company, without compromising family life.  Its a great place to work!"
good,This is a Temp to hire position that i worked really hard to try to get on but when it was over they said that they didn't have a position and that i would need to apply in a different state.
good,Lots of opportunity to make money. Leadership in my office was outstanding and truly cares about their employees. Great benefits and work/life balance.
good,"Great managers: best I've ever experienced. Great co-workers: they only hire the most outgoing and friendly people in the area. Everyone is intelligent, knowledgeable and fun to work with. The compensation is not great. For a national HR/Payroll company and the work performed the compensation is not enough and the benefits are mediocre at best."
good,Paychex is a terrific company with growth potential if you are willing to relocate.  Superior benefits that are second to none.
good,"Fun work place with good Management."

good,enjoyed working together with my team to provide excellent customer service.
good,"Everyday is a new experience."
good,"Day to day activities at Paychex involved selling payroll services to small business owners and building relationships with Bankers, CPA’s, and Accountants. The relationship building focus of the job is the primary separator between Paychex and other payroll sales companies. 30%-40% of my personal small business payroll service sales came by professional referral."
good,Paychex is a fortune 100 company and with that comes with a lot of great things and some not so great. I have much more positive things than negative to say. The management structure can be very confusing and who you report to for what.
good,"Paychex has great Job security, but for the education they require people to have the pay is kind of low. But that is the enviorment they try to build on because they want all their employees to work hard to move up withiin the company. There is a lot of opportunity to move up, you just have to be willing to work at it. In my current position I have great work/life balance, but I don't know if it's like that in all departments. Management is great to work with, and have a great open door policy."
good,The location I was at was great for good eats and shops.
good,"Probably one of the best experience I had working for a company was that from day one I could direct my future with the company.  I wanted to get into leadership/training and the goals, resources, and relative opportunities were laid out for me, supported, and encouraged by the entire management team across the spectrum."
good,Paychex encourages actively training their employees to become more adept at their jobs and encourages movement in positions. I truly enjoyed working there for 6 years and moving up through the ranks to where I had my position.
good,"Paychex is a fantastic company."
good,"As an administrative assistant, I answered all incoming calls to the sales department, did work for 13 sales people, i.e. letters and reports to clients and CPA's. I don't recall anything hard about the job, and the most enjoyable part was that we all worked as a team."
good,"Payches believes that a happy employee works harder.  We had a fun committee, who were in charge of creating fun things to do throughout the work day."

good,Work staff is friendly and always willing to help out when needed. Benefits make up a good portion of compensation but fair. Estimated promotion time is around a year
good,"Although the job can be stressful, and the workload at times seems more than you can handle, I was surrounded with good people who work as a team.  every day you will work 9 hours of your 8 hour day.... then yearend comes and it gets busy."

good,Processed payroll and tax information for companies that hired Paychex. The company started out training but as they got busier they lacked the ability to fully train people. Also they really need to learn how to work with people with disabilities.
good,When I worked at this company it offered great benefits and opportunities for advancement.  They were a bit male heavy at the top which left a ceiling on how far women were advanced.
good,Culture and training are phenomenal. Paychex truly invests in their new reps to ensure their success.  Only down side is there is not much upward mobility in sales.
good,"Paychex was a great place to work,and grow."
good,This company was a great place to work and grow in your career. I grew both personally and professionally. The culture has changed over the years and they are moving in a needed direction to remain competitive in the new marketplace.
good,"I will always miss Paychex and the family that I had there. Granted, we were a subculture as Computer Operators and Fulfillment Specialists that were often derisively treated by other employees outside our department, but we enjoyed working with each other and ""poking the bear"" that was our Department Supervisor, the QPS. "
good,"Great Company"
good,Paychex is an excellent company to be a part of. They encourage you to share your ideas. They work with you to help you accomplish your goals. They allow you to pursue and lead projects.

good,"Good company, excellent training, the management team is committed to your overall success, if you are looking for career growth, opportunities are endless."

good,"Paychex has an incredible training program that starts with a 2.5 week trip to Rochester, NY, where the corporate office is located. They place emphasis on giving you all the tools and resources that you could possibly need to do your job, and do it well. Even though it is a huge company, it never felt like I worked for a huge company where I was ""just a number."" For the most part, the supervisors and management team made me feel like they truly cared about me as an individual-- especially the supervisors (as opposed to senior management)."
good,Great culture! Management is supportive and willing to help. The company is willing to train the not experienced. Most enjoyable part of work is the flexibility of schedules.

If you're willing to put your boots on the ground and drum up business, you can do extremely well. The staff and company support is top notch, as is the training. The work life balance is tremendous, as well."

No long-term debt, and visionary leadership with an eye toward technology.  "
good,"When I started at PayChex I was an Appointment Setter. In this roll I called new B2B businesses to talk to them about payroll services provided by PayChex. To give them enough information to peak their interest to commit to an appointment. If the Field Rep is able to sign them up, I would share in the commission."

good,This really is a great place to work! The ability to succeed is precluded by all of the training they provide. Nice people and great culture. Takes a bit to get going but well worth it.

The director and all supervisors were very fun to be around they made all employees happy to come to work and enjoy what they do. All the employees had a wonderful personality as well as sense of humor. The most challenging portion of the job was to complete an assignment in a timely manner but when all was completed the staff was layed back and had fun activities for all co workers."

good,"Reach out to current clients daily to schedule appointments with business owners to discuss retirement and section 125 plans that can be integrated with their current payroll. I Learned much about how small businesses work and prioritize expenses before making the decision to offer benefits to their employees. My colleagues were more like teammates, everyone helps out where they can to help win the deal.The biggest challenge with my position is justifying the cost, since many small business are struggling financially. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I am conducting enrollment meetings, and helping people set up retirement benefits for themselves."

Endless opportunities within the company and great benefits.

good,"Typical work day involves many phone calls and emails all day to get payroll information entered. Co-workers and teams are full of amazing people and the company has a great culture built around it. All supervisors are very attentive and engaging in helping you with issues and growth. I was able to learn the finer details of what goes into the paycheck you usually don't give much attention and everything behind the scenes that normally is not considered by many employee's. The schedules can get quite hectic with many days requiring you to stay late for same day deadlines, as well as quarter and year end timing being extra busy leading to very late nights. The teammates and management is the best part, they make the rough days a little easier, the people are by far the best part of the job."
good,"Paychex is a high level, very busy place to work.  But you are always treated fairly and respected.  Taking time off is welcomed and never held against anyone."
good,"Great place to work. The supervisors are phenomenal. This is a Monday-Friday job 8-5, so its great to be able to get off at a decent time, and spend time with your family. There is always room to grow with this company. The training they provide is excellent. They ensure you are ready to go before they set you loose. Your team is always willing to answer questions, and to help if you feel like you are behind. The cons... very stressful. You can get a high client count, and get very fare behind if you miss a day, some clients can get very out of line, and its a constant changing environment. You have to be prepared to change the way you do things, very quickly.... and sometimes multiple times."
good,Paychex was a great place to work.  The office atmosphere was professional.  The chance for advancement was limitless.  I enjoyed working here and would highly recommend it.

good,"I loved my job here as a Front Desk Receptionist. Everyone that worked there was friendly and helpful. They provide excellent benefits, even to part time workers, and even include a Wellness program to help you lose weight or quit smoking. I utilized both programs. The hardest part of the job was sometimes the customers could be rude or hard to deal with, but you get that with any company. I also made some good friends there in my co-workers. I was sad to go, but I moved out of state. Even after leaving the company, they all still managed to send me a signed condolences card when my father passed away. That was so special to me. I still today wish I could have stayed working there. "
