rating,review
bad,No rewiew to share: they sold the retail business years ago and only operate as an energy company now. I have no idea how corporate ConocoPhillips operates since I was retail
bad,This was a super hard job. The management was terrible and you were treated like you were nothing. There is really nothing to do besides worry about if your about to lose your job
bad,"Great, interior is Red and white, it keeps your motivated!.  Nice people and lots of cleaning staff.  Secure Building, a great place, lots of long hallways to navigate, be prepared to walk alot."
bad,"I know this place is closed, but I absolutely hated working there. The manager was always late, hours were confidential (WEIRD!), continuously making excuses on why they would be late to pay the people bringing in food/supplies for the store, and the people that would come in there was sketchy. I had to call the cops multiple times because I felt like I was in danger or somebody would try to pump and run."
bad,ConocoPhillips is a great employer to work for and provides a good environment to work. The employees are knowledgeable and have a great work ethic to provide a safe work culture.
bad,I was a utility helper. I work with welders and pipefifters as a helper for 2yrs. I also went to a plant/refinery school for 8 months to get the job.
bad,bad benefits bad management bad advancement. Very high turnover rate.
bad,"ConocoPhillips hired me as land advisor to help mold the siloed company into a lean independent drilling machine. What a joke! Very few men in management wanted to change anything!!! I was relieved when I was laid off!  Good luck COP you will continue to operate like the old dinosaur you’ve always been!"
bad,"It's okay to pay Minimum Wage; What is NOT OKAY, is when the owner is as greedy as trump and turns your LOW Salary into below minimum wage by paying on the 5th and the 20th.  These kinds of Pay Periods were normally reserved for people who got a  paycheck Once a Month and also, those monthly salaries were Always way higher than minimum wage, so splitting up the paycheck is easier on the employee.  Any business owner that pays twice a month to make more money and bilk his employees out of said monies,  is the worst kind of human and never deserves what he/she has or will get.   This is WELL PAST greed; It's wrong on soooo many levels and shows true heart and empathy, which is non-existent amongst ALL OWNERS THAT PAY Twice a month.  Look at it this way, 52 weeks , that is 26 paychecks a year with what I term ""Fair Pay"", even for Min. Wage.  Now, on the twice a month or the cheap way, 5th and 20th, that's TWO and ONLY TWO Paychecks a month; there are 12 months in a year, that is 24 paychecks a year.  Plus, you have to do 88 hours before overtime kicks in.  Game Over!!!"
bad,"From fairest creatures we desire increase,"
bad,"Decision are made at the top and push down thorough many layers of managers and team leads that are not really adding value to overall success of the organization. "
bad,Management would ask to do 2-3 people's work. Had to be available all the time to login and troubleshoot. Inexperienced IT team management that won't care.
bad,"Managers dont care about employees anymore. it was a struggle for everyone cutting throats for their jobs. Used to be a great place to work. since the oil price dropped, thats all in the past."
bad,Work there for 19 years and really have nothing good to say about the company other than meeting some really good people. I lost my job to some low life that never came to work and spent the last 11 months doing his job out in the field.
bad,this company violates law when it suits them and terminates employees for following orders.
bad,Get hurt at work and you see what this company is like. i got hurt and now i cant work and the benefits lets just say you pay for it but try to get it and see if you do i have not in over 18 months LTD what a joke. this is the job i was hopeing to do for 20 years i loved my job and was very good at it but agin i was hurt and was told i was no longer needed.
bad,If you have any experience in oil and gas you will not be happy working here other than the benefits and compensation.  Top heavy management and they are all afraid to make a decision.
bad,ConocoPhillips is a great employer to work for who has provided excellent opportunities. I have splendid colleagues. I had the opportunity of taking up a global assignment in Malaysia for a period of about six years which I really enjoyed.
bad,Upper level management and executives have tunnel vision and only care about investors they don't care about employees
bad,"Challenging, nice mangement. good cooperation of co-workers, nice teamwork"
bad,"COP is stuck in 80’s culture - maybe when the old white guys retire the company may move into 21st century."
bad,"Production was second on the list of their goals, hiring anyone with a pulse was the main goal. You cannot substitute anything for common sense in a quick paced work place."
bad,I worked in a field office and while it was a small building we still serviced over 500+ users. The workplace was friendly and I fulfilling my role was a very simple task. I was encouraged to socialize more but that would have put a hindrance on my work performance.
bad,"Workload was far too much. Work-Life balance was heavy on the work. My manager was out of touch regarding my responsibilities and the time required to complete tasks. She would often add to my already heavy workload in an effort to please other leaders in the organization. I was promised an employee to assist with my workload, but that promise was never kept."
bad,"Could be a great place to work, but continuous changes in management causes lots of undue stress. No clear direction.  No opportunities for growth or development."
bad,"For older workers, COP is not a place to feel secure.  A company should make employees feel that they make a difference.  This company does not."
bad,"Hardest part of the job is working with someone who doesn't understand PSM/RMP and compliance regulations, the PSM Coordinator."
bad,"Where I worked with CPC was in a very stressful area with poor management. The management did not help, assist, promote, or benefit my daily work routine in the slightest. I always felt like I was on edge, or walking on thin ice. I never felt confident in being secure at my job with CPC either. The pay was good at the time but things began to disappear after time. Would work there again for sure under a different management team."
bad,"Well established culture of preferential treatment of employees not based on performance but rather on associations to higher positions within the company. Management at every level was ineffective at establishing and executing a clear vision for the direction of the company and individual business units or assets."
bad,"Good work life balance because of the 14 on 14 off and they fly you almost anywhere in Canada,"
bad,"this was my first job learn to run register, watch gas pump; keep store clean, fill cooler, keep take of cash draw, learn about how not to sell alcohol to miner and on Sunday's you couldn't sell alcohol until 12:00 noon ."
bad,I got this job while I was in school because it was compatible with my schedule. A typical day at work is unfulfilling and simple. I feel that I am better suited doing something in the fields I studied. The hardest part of my job was cleaning a gas spill which required time and physical labor. The most enjoyable part of my job is the comfortable  environment and the customers i have came to know and love!
bad,"No hope to move up or be taken seriously unless you are a supervisor favorite and join all the extra curricular activities.  Management will lie to fire you, and HR is not your friend. Conoco is not in the 21st Century and does not believe in work from home.  Most people commute, and this can lead to work/life balance problems."
bad,"Co-workers are great, nice environment. Many people on the management and HR teams don't value their long term employees."
bad,"Thinking the wealth of this company would change my life, I found myself among a few others who were in the new generation of workers, which included pay that is far below industry standard, a rush of arbitrary and irrational micromanagement, and inferior training standards that only set you up for failure."
bad,"Very much a culture of fear based leadership.  "
bad,"It's been a while since I have worked there but I would say after being trained it was a relaxed workplace. We had many regulars with accounts from the car dealerships so u got to know your customers pretty well. I like that. We also got an eclectic number of visitors from all over the world, since we were on a major highway. Loved that!!!       Started work at around 5 am with the car dealerships, then the regulars would come in. We had hot food so that and coffee was the hardest to keep up with. We did it. "
bad,I couldn't recommend anybody to work at ConocoPhillips and maintain a clear conscious in all honesty. Worst Management I've ever encountered. The company may be different now but was severely top heavy as far as the people who actually do the work vs. others who don't produce anything useful.
bad,"Not recommended to work there unless you have to have a job.  Forget creativity, quick decisions and enjoy the lethargic, mind numbing atmosphere. Advice to new hires is to stay no more than three years and then get to a real exploration company."
bad,"ConocoPhillips provides means to pay the bills.  It's not overly stressful, but more discouraging that management is not overly receptive to improving/changing the culture.."
bad,"As a young engineer, this is not a great company. There is no future here, and all my colleagues who have a long career ahead agree with this. The work is mundane and boring, In 7 years I have only picked up few skills and none are exciting or can be applied to other industries. Jobs pay well compared to other industries, but thats about it, no other upside really. Work ethic is not great, in some teams there is clear favouritism and Managers/team leads do not take any feedback from employees."
bad,"I accepted the offer at ConocoPhillips with the idea that this is one of the best of the best companies in Houston to work for. I quickly learned COP was nothing what I envisioned. After several rounds of layoffs, the environment and culture is at its all time low. Tension and fear is in the air of the office day in and day out. I would not recommend this company until management (starting at the ELT level) is changed out and a true company reorganization takes place. Aside from the negative notes, the pay and bonuses at COP are great and work life balance with a flexible work schedule is a plus!"
bad,"The job is great the company as a whole is way above average, local management is lacking in professionalism.  There are some great employees still left in that field and they were a joy to work with and I can only hope that changes are made that benefit those employees."
bad,"Micromanaged - overworked - looked after 87 plus wells per day. Lots of paper work that is not needed. Co workers are taught to be like their manager or they are forced to quit or fired. Hardest part of the job is getting everything done they require. You have to make a decision on what not to do and when you don't do it they will fire you if you do not back stab your co workers. "
bad,"Work on SAP - create Purchase Requisition and Purchase Orders....process invoices for payment and send to Project Manager and Project Engineer for approvals. Being a contractor was good, but not always in communication for information...There was Team work."
bad,"This is a cyclical industry.  The recent CEO did not plan for downtimes, and it seems the shift in oil prices caught him unaware.  He was less than forthcoming when he announced to staff that upcoming layoffs would be performance based.  They were not.  They let go people with high salary grades and long histories of strong performance to save money and usher in a younger, less paid, less qualified  generation of employees."
bad,"I do not like the request to provide this review.  I feel it is personal and inappropriate to make this review required."
bad,The people I work with are for the most part intelligent and professional people. The management seems to be in constant change. A typical day at work starts with a tool box safety meeting and then report to operating units to check in for work and then do our paperwork. This generally takes anywhere from an hour to two hours.
bad,There were far too many people in my group and too few opportunities for success. We had a supervisor with over two dozen direct reports whose guidance came at the 11th hour. His manager would give feedback that was muddy at best. Unfortunately any money budgeted for my assets was re-distributed to others but I was still responsible for the production targets making failure inevitable.
bad,Show up to work and work mostly on computer and attend a lot of meetings. Working in new Delaware Basin. Brought in a new boss and wants to run operations business as a completionns group. trouble keeping employees with this manager.
bad,"Great job."
bad,"every day was different "
bad,Work environment felt like a high school environment where if you wasnt sitting at the right table you wasnt cool. They did away with the 9/80 schedule which was a big contributor to me taking the position.
bad,I've worked for better oil & gas companies that truly cared about the people.  This company only cares about share holders.  There are good people at this company that get ruined by the political nightmare.
bad,Very stressful work environment given the downturn in the oil and gas industry. Extreme competition between coworkers given the continued threat of potential layoffs. Would not recommend to a friend.
bad,"Good overall compensation, great technical work environment, high standards in terms of safety and the environment. Poor medical insurance benefits, bad benefits handlers, conservative atmosphere, growth based on who you know, layoffs not based on merit."
bad,"Management is so bad I would have given 0 stars if possible. Its too bad this old group of pals wont ever realize, that they have only scratched the surface of operational excellence. The management here is a joke, but not a funny one. Starting with the good ol' fashion country bumpkins from heritage Conoco and Heritage Phillips. There's just a few of those boys left, the power in the San Juan has been hijacked by a crummy pack of biggots from Burlington Resources. News flash Conoco: Heritage Burlington Employees resent the fact that you bought them out. They also cannot stand working for you and would rather it still be Burlington Resources. Only ironic these very hags have hijacked power from the very company which purchased them."
bad,Poor management with little knowledge to identify opportunity. Politics is prudent in the company. Training program is missed for young career engineers.
bad,"At the beginning my position was very satisfying although you could feel the level effect - in other words, the manager I supported became wishy washy with direction and it became where I had to challenge what was stated through my notes as if to back myself up with what had been requested.  Example; I was asked to research on the cost of ipods and to order 500 when we go the invoice and had to gain approval, this landed in my lap as if I pulled the number out of a hat when I was instructed to order that amount.  I'll never forget that and I'll never work for that woman again!"
bad,"I enjoyed the challenge at this site office.  I learnt a lot. When I started I didn't even know what a LSD was (Legal Land Description)"
bad,"They treat their own employees great, as far as contractors...not so great, you are disposable to them. I did learn a lot of new skills, which will help a lot for other employment. I met some real good people, and made good money."
bad,"It was pretty apparent that management thought little of their employees as we were reminded daily of how replaceable we were. The work itself wasn't too bad but the management didn't treat their employees very well and made quite a few promises with no intention of keeping them. Granted, management did change a little after I left so things could be better now."
bad,"Great geologists, however poorly managed as shown by their rating compared to peers. In the past the training was great, as of lately it is non-existent."
bad,It was a challange to work in a convience store enviroment. I thought it was interesting to work with drunks and unsasisfied customers
bad,Tight deadlines with no replacements of employees leaving is causing a work family balance issue.  I love the culture and the people are wonderful.  Management is starting to be less than desired.
bad,"I worked for ConocoPhillips Canada which was a combination of 4 different companies hence it was difficult for COP global to enforce a single work culture."
bad,I enjoy working for the company that I am at (Not the agency). I don't have any benefits and didn't find out until after I was hired that I won't be eligible for benefits for 11 months. That's crazy
bad,"Great company, good benefits.  Career development is only for the selected few not everyone.  Great co-workers and work life balance"
good,"Worst group management lacks skills. Does nothing to promote employees ."
good,"Minus the fact that you are managed by someone in Houston TX that barely comes up more than twice a year and no paid vacation/sick days, it wasn't too bad."
good,First year was great. After new management came the environment quickly changed.  It was not possible to make them happy.  It was a blessing to be told my service was no longer needed at the time.
good,My experience at ConocoPhillips was much like it is here at my current employer. There is way to much nepotism going on there. So much that it makes working there so stressful. I never felt I had any chance for advancement.
good,They really prefer to employ from another countries.  They never renewal my extension even tough I moved my family from NJ. My wife had  to resign her 15 years job.
good,Worked in pilot bay and labs with a variety of chemical processes.
good,Great place to work when market conditions are good.  Poor leadership and workforce politics become very apparent when market conditions go south.  Layoffs are still a threat to middle management and aging workforce.
good,"ConocoPhillips has outstanding technical employees that do very high level work and compete strongly in the marketplace based on these people.  Far too often, the company promotes the best technical employees to supervisory roles, without evaluating their ability to supervise others.  More management figures than not at COP do not have the personality or attitude to put others first and to truly develop their subordinates and team members, putting a great deal of stress on the already high-performing staff."
good,ConocoPhillips is company for people seeking for paycheck not for career. You will most likely be misdirected and wast you time on trying to build a career.
good,"No comment, as this particular position was far too challenging in soft people skills than need be. The lack of culture and innovation would take you to a place and time of the distant past."
good,Company showed lack of commitment to development of its assets in Canada. Company did not evaluate or reward employees fairly. Very unprofessional & prejudicial treatment of employees.
good,"Very much a culture of fear based leadership."
good,ConocoPhillips embraced diversity among employees and encouraged their core values.  The company expressed integrity and environmental responsibility.
good,"Work/life balance was very poor, expected to work far more than is healthy. Advancement based on connections not on merit. Benefits and compensation were very competitive and generous."
good,"low oil revenue, be careful, you have to be in the in crowd and no SAP pretty good and they can let you go at any time, the oil industry is fierce in alaska"
good,"I stayed at this particular Conoco for as long as I did because I loved my customers, however, everything else was almost always a disaster and I was treated very poorly by my boss which is why I ultimately left."
good,"Since the split, Conocophillips as a stand alone E&P has gone from a 21billion per year capital budget to a 6billion a year capital budget.  So, the job security has been awful.  Carreer advancement has been on a hold, and there has been the biggest ""brain drain""  losing talented employees and being stuck with people who want to be here because they are afraid to venture out of there comfort zones. This was not on accident, the company wanted a huge natural attrition, it was literally stated as a company goal."
good,"a typical work day involved a great many interactions with several people which may it great.  The challenge was the constant flux with job loss.  The commodity sector has been abused since 2014 and ConocoPhillips is not immune.  However, when you constantly reduce staff every 6 months, remove programs that made it fun to work there and then sell the asset for 50% of it's marketed value, it makes you wonder why.  The culture was typical for San Juan Basin, if you haven't worked in it you don't know.  I enjoyed working with the people that were field based as they are the best down to earth folks you will ever meet.  Office managers and staff are missing the point of what it takes to make the company run, good field people."
good,"People are your best assets.  You should value your best assets."
good,Great work when it actually exists.  When the market was hot it was an awesome company.  These days it is just lay off after layoff.
good,as long as i have a choice i will never work for this company again. you are treated like a number and not a person. you have people that have no clue what there doing in the wrong spots and the company doesnt seem to care
good,"8 to 5 normal job very predictable."
good,A typical day in this position was working to ensure that all the files were moved to a specific place on the ConocoPhillips website.  The co-workers I had in this position were great.  They were very accommodating and readily willing to assist with any questions I had.   The most enjoyable part of the job was learning about the different areas of Sustainable Development and what ConocoPhillips was doing to ensure the company was doing their part.
good,"For every compliment management would offer, there always had to be a negative. One manager criticized a co-worker about her Texas accent and told her she would never advance unless she took speech classes."
good,ConocoPhillips offered excellent Benefits and salary to employees. Job security in this industry causes a stressful environment with people always concerned about lay offs
good,"If I needed work I would go back to this company, there was not much in the way for support from the top in a few critical aspects of the company. Expectations were very high to fill in when needed on your days off and the work life balance was tilted heavily to the work side of things."
good,They are about teaching and if that is what you want than this is the company for you. Advancement with in the company kind of works like the Military. If you are a field hand with no or only a 2 year degree the highest you can hope for is maybe being a specialist over the area that you are in. They are big on having a 4 year degree for you to advance into any management roles or tech roles.
good,"I enjoyed working here. Good work life balance and no one works after 4pm. At 4pm everyone rushes out of the office."
good,This is a nice place to work. You will meet a lot of great folks that will add value to your career and life.
good,Though I didn't see my supervisor but twice to three times a year it was still very productive.
good,"The team I manage I a great, well defined team. It's very busy all the time not much time for training or career development"
good,"In CONOCOPHILLIPS INDONESIA (COPI), the system of work day and day off is 2 weeks for work and 2 weeks for day off. The day at work is typicaly normal as a Oil & Gas Industri. At COPI i have learn about the culture of works, the people and the system of gas & oil processing. I don't have a enough knowledge about the management 'cause I have work at site. But for averagely is Good. I have enjoyable, funny and at the same time support each others co-workers. The hardest part is if someone or some people has doubted about our (Lab) ability in the job, but we have enjoy cause that's the part of the chalenge and I have a solid team and support each others."
good,"I had 7 different supervisors during my 8 years with the company. Supervisors were typically rotated during year end reviews. Year end reviews were based on favoritism, not actual metrics."
good,"Consultant - not applicable as employees and contractors had a different level of access and interaction. "
good,"This last period  was due to merger.  Was made to feel unwelcome, no one wanted to talk about job functions.  Seemed that they all felt like their jobs were tenuous.  Prior to that, was another merger, with a lot of job loss.  Prior to that we had a good culture that descended to a bad culture because of management that had no interest in the people, only to their own agendas."
good,"Depends on your department and position on how well you will like it here. Lots of mixed opinions. Overall personal experience was great work/life balance, good group of people, quiet culture. Definitely a corporate vibe. Do not expect much compensation here though. Even the bonuses are extremely below the industry standard. Pay is not competitive and they do not care about retaining talent, and that wasn't just personal experience but it is the same in every department. You are just a number at the end of the day."
good,"As an admin grade, by the hour, contractor then life was always tenuous!"
good,I grew up in the company and was sad the economy took such as turn for the company to have to take drastic measures and loose their best resources to cut overhead.
good,"From fairest creatures we desire increase,"
good,"Its been a tough time for the industry.  I am not sure that management has set the right strategy.  We are targeting investments in unconventional shale, but have yet to have made any profit in that space.  The opportunities for advancement for project people are very limited at this time, and HR is selectively reaching into the organization and cutting compensation packages.  It's the worst group of HR people I have ever encountered in the industry, and I do not trust them - and it is scary to think that they operate with management sanction."
good,"The 2 week on/off shift was great and the work duties were easy and stress free."
good,Company is well-known throughout the world and the environment is different whether you work in a business unit or in the corporate workplace.  The price of oil and stress of job cuts has not been handled well and management seems to be misguided and indignant to the company's direction and care for employee's welfare. The most enjoyable part of the job was supporting my clients and learning about technology and what it looks like to work with a large company.
good,Too focused on overpaying new hires to come to Bartlesville. Did not utilize highly experienced employees. Commute not worth the money.
good,"OK to work for"
good,This company while having good intentions put it's bottom line ahead of the welfare of its employees.  Department changes are fine but often did not make sense and were handled bad enough to leave employees in difficult situations with inadequate training.
good,"a typical day at work would require a sharp mind and ability to problem solve quickly. everyday was unpredictable . the station would have an array of customers walk in, all  with different personality types. working at the gas station has challenged and empowered my people skills and my patience."
good,"To keep the rig drilling, each rig has good people,and bad people on them,get along with them well,they most good people, to keep the well under control, after 14 days go home"
good,Semoga kedepan lebih di utamankan putra daerah....
good,"I mostly enjoyed working for ConocoPhillips, the typical work day consist of reviewing reports, meeting with different department heads to get a grasp of what is needed to help develop their department. The workplace culture I didn't care for, it is based on who you know instead of what your knowledge is on certain projects. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the IH&T department. I really enjoyed working with this group."
good,"Typical push unqualified management into a leadership role they have no business leading.  Because they were frustrated in a role they didn't belong in, they lashed out."
good,"When I started working there, it was a great place to work and I was excited to get the job there. It quickly turned into a job where all I did was take on more responsibilities that were never acknowledged. There was a lot of political maneuvering that would have been needed to be able to advance from where I was."
good,"I loved the part of my job that required challenges in reviewing Oil and Gas Contracts and Leases and inputting that information in the system."
good,"Politically charged environment. Favoritism. No real chance for high school graduate to move forward. Discouraged to try and move forward. Kind of a ""no hope"" environment."
good,"I worked for ConocoPhillips for 20 years in various financial positions & when it was an integrated company there were many opportunities; however, the split of the refining operations and subsequent drop in oil prices has caused much stress regarding layoffs as assets are sold."
good,"A typical day at ConocoPhillips consisted of analyzing cost data and reporting to multiple groups and the field staff to identify anomalies, be sure we were compliant with JV agreements and keeping lifting costs and capital spending within budget."
good,"There are a lot of great people to work with here but the bureaucracy makes it difficult to push big projects to completion and have a big impact."
good,"As a college student they market their ""Engineering Academy"" as a great training program, however it's just virtual training classes and computer based learning. It is helpful, but definitely not what I would call a great training program. Also, the company needs to make up its mind if it is going to be an independent or a major."
good,Provided employees with challenging positions and desirable benefits; work can be quite tedious for periods of time; computer systems were antiquated for some departments; management team could employ micro-management style at times;
good,"Major material contribution to company's growth is from individual contributions. Team work, supervisors' contribution, role of managers become progressively poor."
good,"Good company with excellent salary package and benefits."
good,Great to work with dedicated people that really care about their jobs.  Management wasn't very good at planning ahead (workforce requirements) for low oil prices.
good,Little support for accomplished managers. Short staffed and horrible pay for any level employee. Needs more advancement opportunities.
good,"Great work environment, Management has some set back but all in all a good place to work. Great people"
good,You can move up from cashier to management if you put in the time and effort to do so. There is not much advancement once that is reached.
good,This is a good company... The management could be better. The room for advancement for EVERYONE could be better also
good,i really do not want to fill this out..  but this is forcing me to fill it out.  so now i have to get 50 more characters in there so this will leave me alone
good,"I was an intern for ConocoPhillips and they provided a great experience. From traveling to headquarters and presenting in front of management, I feel like I gained a lot of experience in a short amount of time."
good,"Due to working in a high regulated environment the hours were long as short staffed. "
good,"Some great staff and project personnel, but oil and gas culture, mixed with republican/conservative American culture. Difficult working environment, ridiculously good pay with benefits, swag/perks, and much room for growth, advancement, education, etc. Can be great if you don’t mind working for devil, in hellish conditions (industry related, not necessarily company specific)."
good,Had an offer to move on to a better job so I did. It was with another company. I had another chance I would go back to the P-66 Lake Charles facility.
good,"started out back in the 80's, Phillips was a great place to work, when the merger with Conoco took place, it was a more  ""business like"" place to work, you were a number and not a person."
good,Can be a stressful job when things are down at the refinery.  Can put in many hours weekly due to demands of the job.  Great pay and benefits.  Advancement opportunities.
good,the company was good but the lack of communication with their workers was an ongoing problem. Management was poor and too top heavy and no clear direction was ever given
good,Was a great company to work for.  Oil/gas price tumble resulted in massive changes - including asset sales and layoffs.  Management changes and the rapid company contraction has resulted in challenges for employees.  May exit Canada if commodity prices remain low.  Too bad.
good,"I have learned a lot in the beginning. The goals were more manageable and just making sense. When New CEO replaced the previous, many meaningless changes were made."
good,A fantastic place to learn the oil and gas industry. COP has a company culture that is strongly implemented and you can sense it throughout your experience. My time there was as an intern but very impactful to my career.
good,"As with all jobs, it depended on management. I had a few managers there which were great. They helped you to learn, advance, were open and honest. They wanted you to succeed. They didn't worry about the small stuff. They showed gratitude and appreciation. Then there were those that should not have been placed in any managerial position.  The company went thru a lot of transitions, being bought and sold 4 times while I was there."
good,"Burlington Resources corporate culture was fun and inviting for the employees.  COP corporate culture was not so much focused on the people, but rather processes."
good,I was worked in the offshore facilities during the job i was worked for 12 hours in a day. sometimes  I was worked in day time and night time until 28 days.
good,"Overall good place to work, but when oil prices dropped there was no two-way communication and little opportunity for employees to provide input to management.  Reorganizations were run by a few people."
good,"Traffic control - Logging in/out scale traffic - Inspect of all cars/trucks."
good,"Like any major in the O&G space, they are working hard to manage the downturn in the industry.  Given the right job in the right management team, COP is a good place to work."
good,"Little to no Contact with employees, unless something is needed on their behalf. Great benefits. No Paid holidays, and only a few PTO days provided."
good,"The people you work with are great, friendly, helpful. However, this is a typical corporate work environment. Due to management being mostly older gentlemen, the environment isn't the most progressive. But again, most people you work with are awesome."
good,"Why is there not a way to opt out of this? The UI implies that there is a way to opt out of providing feedback. I have former colleagues in the O&G industry who have been desperately trying to locate work for over 1 year since their layoffs. I know that they would not want to put anything of substance in this field, and I never provide any feedback that is valid about my former employers in these fields."
good,The company used to be a good company with many opportunities. With the downturn the workload has decreased dramatically. Management is cliquish.
good,Current economic conditions and lack of technical strategy make this a difficult place to recommend.  Large turnover and lack of appreciation for technical expertise has resulted in low morale and limited focus on career development.
good,"Company I was employed by was a temp agency. We had great shifts, competitive pay, awesome benefits. But because we were temps we were treated like the black sheep of the family for group activities such as holiday parties."
good,"A typical day at work starts with reviewing my sub-contractors safety tailgate meeting."
good,"Placed into the new grad program, which placed individuals into a position for a year at a time to get an overview of the organization. Great opportunity to work in the marketing group. Fast paced and long hours at settlement, but great exposure. SAP financial system."
good,"COP is a good company with great benefits - free gym, onsite medical and dental, generous 401k match, money towards HSA, etc."
good,"ConocoPhillips is the world’s largest independent exploration and production company, based on proved reserves and production of liquids and natural gas. ConocoPhillips explores for, develops and produces crude oil and natural gas globally.  With this comes the pressure to maximize your returns...thus ConocoPhillips tends to favor more spending on Drilling versus keeping its IT technology State-of-the-Art.  Co-workers are good."
good,"Overall a good Company to work for.  The possibility for advancement is not available at this time, or I would stay here.  They have been good to me.  Hard times have changed the atmosphere."
good,"At Conoco, I learned advanced features in Excel in order to create a spreadsheet that is user friendly and easier to navigate in and out of different worksheets. "
good,"COP can be a great company to work for depending on who is your manager/director. There have been various employees who either were laid off or voluntary terminated their employment due to office politics. There are certain managers who pick & choose ""favorites"" amongst staff members."
good,A typical day at work involved working from a permit and generally mech prep of pipework or blasting pipework and then painting with two pac paint using a 4 coat system.
good,ConocoPhillips is a fast paced growing international oil and gas company
good,Instructions and directions were very clear. It was a great team work. All the issues were discussed and resolved in weekly meeting. Personal contacts with supervisor & co-workers in sorting out the issues saved lots of time to deliver documents & drawing within the schedule time.Learned to resolve calmly under stressful situation.
good,Excellent company to have worked for.  Challenging and rewarding environment.
good,"cashiering with the public very busy, I learned a lot here hand held devises and updated tills, I loved working with my coworkers very positive and team work"
good,-A lot of adminstrative systems go through in order to get work done.
good,Being contracted to ConocoPhillips through Swift is a great way to get experience in the oil refining industry.
good,The shutdown was run on time and on budget with no injuries . It was a pleasure to be part of such a good shutdown and I was very pleased with my team of guys
good,"The jobs available are mostly interesting and stimulating work, in a variety of interest areas.  There is a push to move folks about, and allow employees to get different experiences."
good,Management makes decisions that may not reflect the communications that are passed down thru middle management.  Limited personnel development unless one comes in as an intern.
good,"This is a good company to work for.  However, due to oil prices and layoffs, lack of security. Advancement was very limited. The hardest part of the job was being accepted in the new office I was transferred to."
good,"Aunque es una de las compañías de energía más grandes, les faltaba nivel profesional a sus empleados, la gerencia local para el momento no era comunicativa y no actuaba en pro de beneficios del negocio, muy poca comunicación y ambiente rudo."
good,"During my time with Conoco, I witnessed their global IT strategy become ever more restrictive to the point where my original role of solutions analyst responsible for scope and developing business-facing solutions was reduced to essentially desktop support analyst. Some of my co-workers had no issue with this, I require more of a challenge."
good,"The work was good, direct supervisors for the most part were excellent and gave good feedback. My coworkers and peers were an excellent group willing to share knowledge and find solutions to problems as opposed to complaining."
good,People are so collaborative and helpful. The culture is balanced - the activity level depends on what area you are working. Great benefits. There are opportunities to develop.
good,Right now is a poor time for the Petrochem industry and COP is taking the brunt of it.  The company seems to be positioning itself for sale at the moment.
good,"They are one of the safest companies I have worked for. I always had family time. However, communication, organization & compensation are poor at best"
good,"ConocoPhillips is a progressive Oil and Gas company that is adjusting to survive in the tight commodity market that exists today."
good,Used to be a great company to work for but things changed a lot since the start of the downturn. No opportunity to pursue personal development and growth. Morale has been down for more than 2 years and there is no consistency of strategy and actual action.
good,Worked for 3 years then laid off due to oil and gas fall. Just be sure you know what the intentions of your coworkers are and this was a place that was the text book example of its not what you know its who you know.
good,"great morale,safety oriented,learned that there is no job that can,be accomplished  with team work. they were like working with a huge family,time off with for personel or family issues with short notice."
good,Not a great place to work at. Pay and benefits were high for my age and experience. Management varied greatly from role to role and greatly affected job quality. Not always a great place to work as a young engineer as sometimes not enough work and the managing of the young engineers program at the company was terrible. Rotating people into roles they did not want or forcing them to leave roles they enjoyed was quite common. Groups did not have well laid out plans which caused a lot of sitting around doing nothing.
good,ConocoPhillips gave me the opportunity to expand my experience as a Cost Control Specialist. I had the opportunity to travel and work with people from different countries and cultures and was able to support them gaining the recognized expertise in multicultural relations.
good,"I enjoyed my tenure at ConocoPhillips. The folks I work for and with were largely top-notch individuals with solid skill sets. My Business Unit was unique in that it seemed to always attract quality team players who enjoyed the basin we worked and the results we achieved. It is unfortunate that market volitility had such a deleterious affect on the industry as a whole. In the end, the bonus outcome is that many of us get an opportunity to re-invent ourselves (in my case, again)."
good,Upper management must pay attention to changes being made in the organization. Not in touch with how HR runs a muck within the organization.
good,"A mix of what you know and who you know."
good,"Good place to work but challenged by low oil process, Many good people with good intentions, but some times lacking in business acumen."
good,It is hard to find management that you enjoy and have no problems supporting.  I would work for my immediate supervisor anywhere any time.
good,This place offers you lots of training and you actually learn a lot of views of the oil field.  You get to interact with their volunteer work and you get great recognition for job well done.
good,"Management is definitely at the top of the ladder, valued over employees. They boast a transparent sharing of knowledge, but never actually fulfil that promise. During the recent layoffs, shareholders and new hire offers were given higher priority than current employees. Advancement opportunities are limited with low transfer potential between business units or specialty areas. This was not the company I thought it was when I hired on. In good economic times you will think that the job is perfect but when push comes to shove, you will learn that you are just a number. I am terribly disappointed in management, in the opportunity for advancement, in the training (unless a recent grad) and in the company transparency. The schedule is flexible and the pay is excellent. The benefits are great."
good,The company relocated me to Houston and the oil prices dropped forcing ConocoPhillips to reduce people and now I find myself looking for a job along with 659 other people. I think they are a good company and provide a awesome place to work but if you get into oil and gas brace yourself for times like this. This layoff is hitting people with less than 3 years with the company or over 50 years old. I met both. I'm schedule to be laid off on Oct-13-15.
good,The job served it's purpose. I worked my way through the ranks to Assistant Manager. I enjoyed meeting lots of cool customers and having my regulars who came. Co-workers were all good for the most part. Always had good management.
good,good place   enjoying meeting everyone.  it was ok   routine job nothing else to say really   but thanks  nothing  else to say but  that's it  would go back it asked
good,Manager doesn't know alot. Can't make out a schedule. And doesn't know how to train proper. I loves the job. Loves the customers. I thrived on wanting to learn it all. I just don't know if they really wanted a 3rd person working.
good,"Work day usually began with a pre-job safety meeting, Included job site orientations Entering BBS cards into computer system, Focused audits on Life safety rules and E-reports on Good catches, Incidents, and Near misses."
good,"The company as a whole treated me well over the years.  Corporate, unfortunately, has a high level of respect for engineers and above.  Us with boots on the ground, are more disposable.  No opportunity toove up as a technician, since new engineers were lived into technical supervisor roles.  After nearly a decade as a top tier performer, I had enough and decided to leave the company.  HR couldn't care less and didn't even attempt to retain me.  "
good,Good company for comp and benefits just hard to work for a company with so much political influence and focused on shareholder returns at any cost. When oil prices dropped they still paid a dividend every quarter while laying off employees.
good,"Great team "
good,"No reviews to give here. It was a contract but i was also made to believe that the standard procedure was for me to come in as a contractor and i would be integrated as a full time staff, but after building out the servers they let me go"
good,Poor leadership has lead to the company not knowing if they will continue to operate in Canada.  The culture in the Canadian BU is one of sitting back and letting things happen as opposed to being pro active.
good,"COP has had more than five layoffs in the last  8 years.  Training and pay are good, but they seem to use layoffs as an answer to every budget issue that arises."
good,Overall COP is a good place to work but over the last several years it has changed quite a bit since I started 10 years ago not all of it has been good.
good,The best thing about that company was the pay. The demands increased as the market declined and everyone was doing two or three peoples work. Also the managers were not always connected to what was actually happening in the trenches.
good,"I miss working at this company but I dont miss working with a few of the people. The job itself was great and I loved it. I was always decorating and making chances to entertain the customers. I enjoyed working with my coworkers, and the store manager was easy to work with. But at the same time the hardest part was working for the store manager because we knew each other outside of work as well. It was also difficult because I was the youngest person working for the company which is way I was laid off first."
good,"On a typical day at Conoco job completion is the goal.  Manpower and materials are verified, the necessary material orders are submitted, and project status is monitored.  While in this position I have learned a great deal about the need to maintain a clear vision of what the most important goals for the day are and stick to them.  There are too many tasks a day to get everything completed safely.  Time management is key in this role."
good,"ConocoPhillips is a solid company to work for and when the market is up the international opportunities are plentiful.  Top of the line benefits, strong compensation packages and in general a good working culture."
good,"Great learning environment, however there is a lot of politics."
good,working the CORE project was a great experience but very short only 3 years for a 6 year project
good,Conoco Phillips as a company is a wonderful place to work. The stresses endured with fluctuations in the market can become a bit overbearing at times.
good,"The work/family life balance was great at ConocoPhillips - they allowed for great flexibility. The most difficult part of working at ConocoPhillips was going through several rounds of layoffs. Another challenge was, within a short amount of time, I had three different managers."
good,"This company is totally exposed to the price of oil.  High oil prices mean high profit and low oil prices mean hard times.  With the exception of a few large assets, the company is heavy into domestic oil shale."
good,"Excellent Benefits and work life balance."
good,Lots of nepotism. Deserving people get no chance for advancement while less than bright people get many opportunities because they happen to kiss the right butts or because they have relatives working at the company.
good,A workplace with talented people to learn from. Compensation and benefits package competitive with industry. Lacking in opportunity for mobility.
good,My daily job and tasks as a Logistics Specialist at ConocoPhillips consist of... Communicating with my 24/7 operators coming off night shift to see if there's anything needing addressed. Then I would follow up with our Fluid management team to see if our Fluid haulers are track and taking care of our Production guys.
good,The hardest part on the job was making sure that others were doing their jobs.  It was a tough place to work after the downturn because everyone wasn't sure who was staying and who was going...
good,"Enjoyed working for this company, just wished the relocation program applied to all employees instead of the select few. Driving 1 1/2 hours each day to and from work took its toll"
good,"Great place to work would for sure apply for another position if I had the opportunity to! "
good,Decent company to work for.  Hours fit a family schedule and the people are awesome.  Difficulties with corporate scale and management can cause issues.
good,"It was good challenging work and I accomplished many things, however I felt unappreciated in the long run.  I December 2009 the company laid me off."
good,"Overall, I enjoyed my time at ConocoPhillips. They were respectful and personable. There are a few bad apples that can put a wrench in your day but the rest of the staff make up for it."
good,"ConocoPhillips was the nicest place I have ever worked.  They  have a company gym on 2 nearby campuses, making it convenient to work out."
good,ConocoPhillips is a great company for compensation but suffers from cyclical commodities fluctuation thus affecting capital.
good,Conoco Phillips is a great company to work for If the oilfield is where you’d like to stake your career. Great benefits and an excellent management team!
good,management was great and employes which I worked around were highly skilled in there trades. days were cold but heated areas were provided to warm up in.
good,"Four (4) rounds of layoffs in 2.5 years turns the work environment into a very stressful one."
good,"If you run into a good manager, you will enjoy working for this company. The most interesting thing about COP is the culture. You have to deeply understand the culture to work there."
good,"Long hours/dangerous work in the Oil Field/not for everyone/work outdoors in extreme heat and or cold. Not much family time/can be called on to work weekends as well/pays reasonably well"
good,"work with contractors to ensure quality of work and compliance of policies"
good,A great company to work for if  you did not mind having the threat of layoffs over your head on a continuous basis . Good work life balance and good pay/benefits.
good,"I was let go with out any notice and no reason why was never giving."
good,Very fast pace. I had a very strong team to work with. I work 50+ hours a week. Being a store manager I never had days off. The atmosphere was a little stressful
good,"very political, not very collaborative, don't develop management. If you are straight out of college, it might be a good place to start a career, if you are an experienced professional of a certain age, good luck to you."
good,"Being able to arrive to work daily and learning new skills, strategies and techniques. This company gave me the opportunity to better understand the oil and gas fields."
good,"Excellent but there isn't enough hours to dispense. Learned many aspect of time management, workplace structure, meeting deadlines, and meeting new faces."
good,CoP is a great place to do work. I worked for many managers and many places while at CoP. I enjoyed the work very much.
good,"I have been involved with a safety culture that allowed me to grow and accept the safety culture as a way of working in the construction field. I firmly believe in the ""Plan your work and work your plan"" to alleviate injuries and workplace accidents and injuries."
good,"It is a decent workplace with people from different cultures, backgrounds, age groups. Company has good health benefits, retirement benefits and fun activities."
good,Be prepared to work all shifts
good,Department was new and the overall aspect was a new concept for the company - I do not know if it is still functioning or not at the capacity it was when I worked there.
good,The company culture at Conoco Phillips was great!  I liked the team that I worked with and the managers.  I enjoyed my trips to the field.  Things got difficult as the company began to downsize.
good,"To be, or not to be, that is the question:"
good,It was what you made of it. Management wasn't the best and brightest but didn't get in the way too much. They had a individual development plan that you could create and follow to steer your career.
good,"I enjoyed my experience at ConocoPhillips and have made a number of life-long relationships. ConocoPhillips doesn't always make the right decisions, an example would be divesting its downstream assets right before the downturn in oil prices, but it wasn't a bad decision give the environment at that time. They do a great job of developing their employees and giving them opportunities to learn different aspects of the business. Can be too bureaucratical at times."
good,"I enjoyed my time with ConocoPhiilips Canada.  They disposed of a large portion of their western Canadian operations, and the function I performed was no longer required."
good,"When I worked there as the global reservoir engineering advisor, I was able to see and work many different projects: onshore to deep water, conventional to unconventional, fluvial to deepwater marine deposit, heavy oil to dry gas, operator to jv partner."
good,"Being able to have take home equipment was one of the perks to this job but the stress level and constant exposer to the chemicals was not so fun. When I first started the job I loved the fact I was outdoors all the time. Then it became mostly meetings and rush, rush, rush for everything else."
good,"- Typical data entry"
good,"•	Key member on core, large scale program and project teams focusing on the people side of change. Partnered with senior leadership to integrate business change management activities into project plans."
good,"Typical day:  6:00 AM to 4:00 PM"
good,A good company in which to be an employee. Offers an environment of interesting meaningful jobs when available. Safety culture is industry leading. Is  subject to the ups and downs of the oil industry as is all oil and gas companies.
good,"Relief graveyard worker. Brew coffe every two hours, dust down, internal inventory, assist manager in store orders and inventory. Check for expired merchandise. I liked the environment and the customers were pretty nice and friendly, except for the few unfriendly out-of-Townes that stop in every now and then. Hardest part of the job was dealing with the irate occasional people Andy the complainers."
good,"PAC was a good company to work for.  I had to maintain 60+ wells.  Anywhere from tank gauging to calling in a work order.  I love working out in the forest and am trusted to do my job correctly, with minimal supervision."
good,Good strategic views.  Hard working team work environment.  Collaborative environment.  Compensation and benefits were very good.  Really enjoyed working here.
good,"Very good Eastern European Company. I had a very good time with the staff, they were very nice, cooperative and listens very carefully."
good,"Great co-workers. Great benefits. The company is pretty large for an independent, so I would expect more layoffs in the near future until the company is more in line with the size of peer companies."
good,The management team is great and they are doing their best to keep open communication as the industry is in its downturn.  The co-workers bring this pace to life and are a joy to be around.
good,"Great company if you want to develop yourself professionally as a new hire, but unfortunately the company has not been managed well since the spin-off from PSX in 2012. The company mismanaged their costs and their capital discipline during the lead up to the crash in prices in 2015, which has resulted in massive layoffs and earning losses. The company retains a few good assets that are competitive and will enable them to keep their doors open for a long time. The company touts itself as an independent (nimble) E&P company, but it's unfortunately held back by the top-down management and gridlock bureaucracy."
good,Enjoyed the activity on my desk.  There was always things to do.  Monthly reporting for internal and external companies and government agencies.  Prepared reports for partners. created spreadsheets to link files to eliminate duplicate data entry.  hardest part was when the system went down on a day that deadlines were due. System was not very user friendly.
good,"Good working environment, benefits, vacation and salary. Employees are offered developement opportunities. Nice perks, such as, a no cost fitness centre."
good,"Fulfilling experience helping in the delivery of Eldfisk II - accommodation, wellhead and processing facility from detailed design through commissioning and hand over to Operations."
good,I was there for few years and enjoyed working. Good team and very friendly environment. I learned a lot during my tenure there.
good,Great place to work when the price of oil is high.  People management is generally focused on the wrong things.  There are a lot of really good people working there.
good,"It was a challenging, rewarding workplace that I was always happy to be a part of. I enjoyed my role, and found my coworkers very kind and knowledgeable."
good,Typical workday depends on the time of the month. Finance jobs have closing responsibilities. Management is not always honest. It id important to find a mentor and someone to help you navigate the process. Having great people are one of the best qualities of the company.
good,"Good place to start your career. Balanced work life style. Performance reviews done twice a year. Benefits package include health, dental, vision plans."
good,"COP is a company that can downsize quickly to accommodate for the industry situation. Also, they upsize just as quickly."
good,"Maintains and controls all master documents within the document control center."
good,"Overall, the experience at ConocoPhillips and the oil & gas industry is quite good. The compensation is generally quite competitive, and the retirement benefits are second to none."
good,Fun place to work in a medical clinical setting as well as provide ALS services when needed.
good,Stared off the day by getting on the computer and looking at the wells that needed to be taken care of that day to increase production.
good,"Enjoyed my time with COP until relocation opportunities became limited. Company seems to have wisened-up to making international placements available to junior technical staff in order to avoid losing them, since I left. Would go back."
good,Great environment of close knit personal with a wide variety of experience.  Camp environment with very little to do in off time.  Great opportunity for well managed networks.
good,"Enjoyable company, would recommend. Two shifts starting a 7 and 3, both 8 hour shifts."
good,"Venezuela Extra Heavy Oil Project (VEHOP). The purpose of this project was the construction of all the upstream facilities to extract 120.000 BD of  bitumen. The bitumen is blended down hole with naphtha to get 17 °API diluted extra heavy oil, separate the gas and water and transport the blend from San Diego de Cabrutica, 210 Km away to the upgrader plant at Jose. In this project I was the leader of the mechanical engineering discipline, for all the production facilities (upstream) of the project. "
good,"8-10 hours."
good,"my experience at Conoco Phillips as an intern was a life experience that was well learnt and I highly recommend any students who would like to take part in such job search. i have obtained the knowledge of handling employees schedules,practice good customer service and balance and manage employees/customers records. Moreover, my co-workers were excellent interms of showing me around heloing me to adapt and learn the process of the company and they had really helped me to feel apart of such organization. In addition, my hardest part of the job was to adapt quickly since a time period was giving and i had to work and learn as fast which i was able to manage. Therefore, the easiest part was managing employees files and perform good customer service."
good,"great employees, fun enviroment. Great vision. Everyone is friendly and easy to get along with. Someone is always there to help you out."
good,"During my time at Team Industrail Services I was part of the inspection team that conducted quality assurance testing on repair work at the ConocoPhillips refinery. I worked with trained professionals in conducting tests on all mechanical structures that were being serviced during the trun-around. My duties included writing reports, documentation, and finding to management. Assisting the technication in completing the job safely in a dangerous enviroment. I also had the responsiably of following OSHA rules and regulations inside and around mechanical vessels for gas releases and confined entry requirements. I also gained knowledge in process control methodologies."
good,"Perform Substation PM's, Test run generators, perform UPS PM's, Coordinate with outside contractors to perform PM's on batteries, UPS's and UPS batteries. Perform circuit ID, and labeling. Perform all electrical switching, 480 to 34.5 kv. maintained all test equipment & rubber PPE for offsite calibration and testing."
good,"ok days at work. training only if they see fit! Can advance if in ""click"". management, is for management, dont get on the wrong side,your gone! Good people if not involved with management. Knowing the wrong doing, and cant do anything to change things. Pay check!"
good,"ConocoPhillips is a great company and very competitive, always put the communications also team work to achieve the success of a project."
good,"Day to day operations of the Condensate/Alky light ends fractionation units. I aquired extensive experience in DCS, PI, Outlook, safe work permitting, gas testing and turnaround execution leadership. The hardest part of the job was rotating shift work, adjusting from night to day every week."
good,"I enjoyed the work and was mostly able to dictate my own designs.  I was able to take ownership of most of my work.  The company pays well and the benefits were good.  Management plays favorites so moving upwards is difficult, no matter how hard you work and how much you accomplish the recognition doesn’t change from the same old crowd.  I would go back if I didn’t have to work for the same manager"
good,Being part of a team and team building activities were enjoyable. Ongoing learning with databases and computer programs. Some micromanagement with several of the supervisors was experienced but tolerated until layoff.
good,"12 hour rotating work schedule. 7 days working, 7 days off. Plant supervisor is a good manager. Job is relaxed most of the time. Everyone works as equals and is a good environment."
good,"Nice place to work, but very clicky, Management showed favorites a little more leaniency, I felt like an outsider for much of the time there.But I did enjoy it"
good,"Pay and Benefits are decent, not bad advancement  opportunities. Safety is important to this company. American company, downside is the sale of most of the Canadian assets."
good,"Good work environment, close to the community and willing to contribute to the society. Company culture is multinational, and good trainings for multicultural background. Management effiency is relatively low."
good,"Conoco and Phillips cultured were different. If you worked for a Conoco manager, it was great. if you worked for a phillips manager, good luck.  I am sure that it has improved since my time."
good,The company itself overall was great.  There wasn't much job security at first because they hire contract workers for first year.  Benefit/Compensation is inadequate for this area for this same reason of being a contract worker.
good,"Working in gCMS, SAP, Excel. "
good,Reviewed 50 Master Agreements and worked with SME Team to reduce overall drilling costs by more than 35% in global Business Units worldwide.  Manage agreements for drilling and completions to ensure Demand Plan is fulfilled at the best possible budget.
good,"My time with this company was heavily based on hitting a set number of dials each day and was overseen by a outstandingly difficult manager who is no longer with the company, but was the catalyst for myself and many others to seek employment elsewhere."
good,"Oil and gas prices required continued workforce reductions."
good,"It was an experience like nothing else, enjoyed working at the refinery, got exposure and experience in the culture and work duties."
good,Good learning experience. Friendly people. Good managers. You may be stuck in same position though.
good,"Administered company Accounting /Financial records including daily sales reports, detailed auditing reports and payroll. In addition, I performed the daily bank reconciliation reports, general journal entries and tracked sales reports. I also interacted with employees in maintaining an exemplary level of service."
good,"Wonderful place to work, the trainer refinery, the one that closed now I'M LAID OFF, thanks Conoco. I think they gave up to early should have tried to keep open."
good,I learned a lot about managing at this location and greatly appreciate of my time there.  Learned good customer service and people skills .  As well as excel and word
good,"The focus of the development group was to provide applications that enhanced the operations of the business."
good,"Really enjoyed my time at CPC, great long career. Appreciates their staff and co-workers. Hopefully once the economy improves there can be more development."
good,It was very enjoyable to work for COP.  Very much safety driven.  I enjoyed working with diversified group of employees.  Career was cut short when the economy had a down-turn.
good,I loved working there I’ve made apt of life long friends the work environment is relaxed. They don’t have much advancement options because they are a truck stop. More of a part time job.
good,Great people. Learned lots about team work. Gained lots of technical and problem solving experience. Not much available for advancement opportunities. Management was heavily layered.
good,"The pay and work are fantastic. Our projects are truly challenging and results are top of class in the industry. However, the SPIRIT Culture is not spread across the entire Company. Perception is often more important than results, and destructive competition is more commonplace than collaboration."
good,Great industry that has a boom and bust mentality. Great in good times. Stressful in a tough economic market. ConocoPhillips paid a competitive salary and treated to their employees to a lot of extras.
good,ConocoPhillips pays very well especially for this part of the country.  There is a lot of work to be done and some great people to work with and for.  Unfortunately there is a lot of very bad management as well.  They are very obsolete in their thinking as well as there is a lot of infighting over who controls what.  Management do not seem to work in harmony very well and seem to be always competing with each other.  Unfortunately non-managers get pulled into this as well.
good,"However, managers and supervisors are changing the whole picture of what this great company used to be in the recent past. People is not a core value anymore.  ""My way or the highhway"" looks to be the motto now."
good,"Good Place to work  - Middle Mgmt not as good as they could be."
good,"although I was a contractor and I left because of a direct hire position, I am regretting that I did. If I had stayed, which I thought was a perfect position for me 7 years would have passed and the benefits of staying would have paid 10 fold than the direct hire position I left for. darn!"
good,"Great Place to build Experience.  I worked here for 11 years, I appreciated the relationships that I had build.  This was my home away from home, and I miss seeing my colleagues."
good,"Typical Day at Work - Read and respond to emails, attend 1-3 hours of meetings, field miscellaneous questions from internal and external stakeholders, draft, edit, and review various contractual agreements, research internal records, review state regulatory commission docket."
good,Excellent compensation packages and work environment as long as you can keep your job.  They tend to go through massive layoffs and the intermediate management is not effective in terms of managing what they need to manage - people and the work.
good,"Very large site with a lot of off-site support locations. Unique setting for office space, mainly in a School from the town that the plant bought. One of the main industries of the town."
good,Was a good company but corporate culture changed after the spin off of the refining and marketing portion to a separate company and the downturn in commodity prices
good,"Utfordrende, interessante arbeidsoppgaver, kjempe gøy å jobbe der. Trivdes veldig godt og involvert i utrolig mange interessante prosjekter. Muligheter for selvutvikling, dog tok arbeidsoppgavene for mye tid og ble lite tid til kursing bortsett fra pålagte kurs. Var veldig fri i jobben ifm å utvikle og definere stillingen. Fleksibel arbeidstid, men jeg var sjelden mindre enn 10 timer på jobb, heller 10-12 t/dag. Litt selv valgt, men kun fordi jeg likte jobben så godt. Hadde fastlønn, så fikk ingen overtid i min stillings kategori, men igjen var det selv valgt å jobbe så mye. Gode ferieordninger og gode muligheter for ansatte å bli med i sport og fritidsklubber. Mange ansatte goder og gode pensjons ordninger"
good,This is a great place to work except for it being a commodity driven business. Times are great when prices are great and times are bad when prices are bad.
good,"The position that I served in had limited mobility and no room for growth.   Took to long to rotate to staff position from contract position."
good,There is good and bad things about this company but for the most part I enjoyed my time out there.  Very safety minded company. Great work life balance as the shift was 2 weeks in and 2 weeks out.
good,"The energy downturn has been difficult on every E&P company COP was probably affected the most by it, as it has sold off much of it's Assets and has not had much in turn to expand its current portfolio."
good,Very challenging work environment. Provides training and hardware to accomplish the tasks at hand. Provides teambuilding environment and character development.
good,"A good company, but not very friendly as in family attitude, company attitude is strictly for company profit. Safety rules are extreme and centered for everybody's safety."
good,ConocoPhillips is a good place to work if the price of Oil is high. They have a difficult time forecasting and managing the business If the oil price is low.
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed the work.  COP would ask if I new how to manage an aspect of marine construction and would offer the role/responsibility to me."
good,"Excellent place to work. Great co-workers. Regular amount of red tape and politics, typical of a large company. Great benefits package including flex days and 1 day off per month if you work 8.5 hours / day."
good,"Depending on the department, there isn't a lot of micromanaging.  Focus is on results.  I hated to leave but got caught in the oil downturn."
good,"ConocoPhillips has an excellent culture for employees, safety, benefits and work environment.  Where they fall down is not training their supervisors in modern techniques of managing people.  Some supervisors use an adolescent, knee jerk style of using comments from obscure people and band their subordinates accordingly."
good,"I received my job assignment, and proceeded to implement the tasks.  My main responsibilities included horizontal drilling and production, and procuring the highest level of safety.  Managers excelled in interpersonal relationships, communication, and overall well-being of employees.  Co-workers were knowledgeable and most were willing to share that knowledge with others.  The paperwork was somewhat redundant and time-consuming, though necessary.  Every aspect of the job was interesting and forming friendships with co-workers was great."
good,"It was a pleasure to work with talented and dedicated associates.  Even when some parts of the work was difficult, there was always an atmosphere of ""can do""."
good,Excellent management but unwise decision to repurchase company stock in 2014.  2015 layoffs.  There is some nepotism in hiring from other industries.
good,"I give it 4 stars. The people were nice, the environment was refreshing"
good,the job is closing out and the work is done well done team
good,Great benefits and wonderful people to work with. Large accounts and heavy volume.
good,"I was entered into contract November 2011 with no notice of when the contract would end. My contract was ended suddenly in June 2012, leaving me to the mercy of the current economy and job market. It was a very corporate place to work with flex hours but little leeway otherwise."
good,"over all a great company to work for. Great benefits, good, informative  trainings to keep up with equipment changes. Company did a lot for the community,"
good,"Management was great, pay was really good for the area, the work was enjoyable, I learned a great deal.  The only issue I had was that Conoco would hire through contract companies so the benefits were horrible.  No paid vacation, no sick leave, and health insurance through the contract company was ridiculously high.  If I were to have been hired straight on with Conoco I would have never left.    "
good,"ConocoPhillips was a great place to work when times were good in Alberta. The decline in the economy brought job insecurity and a decrease in perks. "
good,"excellent place to work -- just seem to have some challenging upper upper management -- they preach inclusion, but do not practice it, in ""my"" opinion, only (the inclusion thing towards 'contract' labor)"
good,I was an intern here for a year and was compensated well and taught everything I needed to know. It was a great experience and I would highly recommend it to anyone I know.
good,"Enjoyed co-workers, facilities, programs and activities. It was a good, family-oriented environment to work in. However, sometimes it felt like management favored the younger employees over the older ones."
good,"Depending where you are based your work/life balance varies. In Houston the culture is to live to work. Very little work life balance, little room for promotion."
good,Company which has high standards for accountability and doing the job right the first time. High emphasis on health and safety and strong analytics demand.
good,I was a qualified in multiple process units. There really was not chance for advancement or to bid to another work department like maintenance. Very steady work and a lot of turnarounds.
good,"In the Deep Basin area, very well run, great guys, good work life. Was layed off due to Cenovus Energy buying all of Conoco Phillips assets. Still great guys running this area."
good,"Overall good company to work for because they hire good people. The work environment at the CoP facility is a plus for work place comfort. But, there is too much walking from parking garage to office."
good,Very fun and productive place to work. Lots of learning opportunity is you have a willingness and eager attitude. Jobs security always seems to be an issue.
good,Conocophillips had a great portfolio that was a great opportunity for workers to progress and grow. I had very good mentors and leaders at Conocophillips
good,"A typical day consist of reviewing and approving contracts/leases, making payments and researching pipeline leases for ROW Agents. I enjoyed my time there and loved that I stayed busy whether it was my desk that was loaded or I helped out a co-worker.   Everyone was more than willing to step up and help each other when needed; I loved that. Direct management was always available and helpful, however I thought upper management could have been more personable. The most difficult part was the stress of the lay-offs.  Very stressful."
good,"Good place to work but constant fear of layoffs due to being in a cyclical industry. Also, if you are not a university recruit, you tend to be viewed as a second class employee"
good,Good place to work. Due to oil and gas price fluctuation less job security and less opportunities for growth. Otherwise it is good place to work with good benefits and pay.
good,"Conoco was a place with great culture.  Overall, all the personnel were friendly and inviting and had a family culture.  The compensation was amazing.  Management needed some massaging however."
good,"Each Project is a new adventure.  We are allowed to apply new ideas and they support ""out of the box"" thinking.  Culture is great, everyone seems to work well together.  Very enjoyable"
good,"I've been lucky to have good jobs and generally good employers but Conoco was the best! I remember several years when my bosses, colleagues and pretty much everything were absolutely first class. The Team worked hard, played hard and had some outstanding results!"
good,"Conco has great work life balance with a pretty honest leadership team, however with the downturn in the oil industry in Alberta, advancement and job security are huge negatives."
good,ConocoPhillips assembled an excellent team of employees to build the Surmont 2 facility. They and Bantrel built the facility with a TRR of zero - an unbelievable achievement.
good,"Good company, great rotation. The Surmont operation is one of the very best in the oil sands. The camp is the biggest and best camp i have ever stayed/lived in."
good,Its a great place to work because it is a challenging environment with good people to work with. Advancement was great during the boom periods but as the industry tanked there were no opportunities. Enjoyed the culture and people but the company needs to right size itself to operate as an small independant E&P company.
good,"CPC promotes work life balance and has a great compensation package. Management, however, is top down but direction from management is clear."
good,I learned a lot working for ConocoPhillips from checking all data on oil run tickets to working as part of a team to solve or improve issues. My co-workers were very friendly and helpful.  I learned about the oil and gas process and found it very interesting.
good,"I had a fantastic ConocoPhillips work experience. I elected for the severance and everything was nicely timed. "
good,"Past tense..it was a good company. Senior management will not run it like a large independent oil and gas corporation, that it is. Its not Exxon...don't try to run it like it is, quit comparing the company to Exxon, Chevron, BP & shell..."
good,"Professional environment with adequate opportunity for knowledge share, good support for employee entertainment, good support to maintain professional certifications, work life balance mostly."
good,Overall people are nice and pay is good but going through a down cycle due to low energy commodity prices.... maybe a good time to join if you are a contrarian.
good,"Work days were long and active. Something new was learned almost everyday-mostly about yourself. Overall, management had to be persuaded to change systems, processes, or procedures. The hardest part of any job is to balance the requirements of the position company versus individual need. The most enjoyable part is always seeing the fruits of your labor-the completion of a project or seeing the change in an employee who was on the wrong path."
good,Enjoyed coming up with oil & natural gas prospects and getting them drilled if capital was available.  Good co-workers with too many layers of management.
good,"Excellent emphasis on safety."
good,"ConocoPhillips provide a good solid working environment, and they are a very professional company. They have good and thorough working procedures and practices to ensure you can perform your work to a set of guidelines and sdtandards"
good,"Typical day at work involved 20% formal meetings, 20% informal meetings and 60% technical work.  ConocoPhillips emphasizes networking and collaborative work, so squirreling away in the office to work on a project for days is not encouraged.  Senior management is sound, but middle management are conflicted about whether to manage for the near term or the longer term, typically defaulting to whatever suits their needs (not necessarily the needs of employees or the company). Most enjoyable part of the job is the people, least enjoyable is the rapidly-changing directives in terms of focus.  In fairness, the time period during which I worked for COP was one of difficult transition for the industry.  COP is making (some of) the right steps to adjust to this industry downturn."
good,Was a great place to work as there was always something allowed you to grow and develop new skills. the most enjoyable part of the job was working with people from all areas of the organization transferring knowledge  between each other.
good,I gained a memorable network from this company as well as excellent training.  I was able to gain valuable field experience as well as understanding of corporate structure.
good,"By all objective measures, ConocoPhillips is a great place to work.  Consistently ranked highest among its peers in compensation/ benefits categories.  Responsive to employees' demands for a more flexible schedule.  Spared no expense on training and outside work activities & memberships.  Excessive management and relentless obsession with adding new processes and procedures to the company rule book can prove irksome for employees.  Consistently lay off large numbers of their workforce when oil prices fall."
good,COP is great if what you value is monotony.  The people are older and stuck in their ways.  Your challenges to change things up may be severely rejected or ignored.
good,"I like COP.  It has provided me with many growth opportunities and challenges.  Management style is biggest hurdle.  That combined with inevitable commodity price volatility, has required me to move on."
good,"Great distributor to work for.  Many miles traveled, and I gained a wealth of knowledge in the animal health industry.  Market trends forced me out."
good,"Great place to work. Somewhat hard to advance as a developer, but I enjoy the people I work with. Management is great for the most part."
good,"As a contractor, I was able to join a team of talented techs and access n extensive knowledge base to facilitate repairs on line or via remote access."
good,"My experience at COP was fairly decent, I didn't have a bad experience until the market collapsed and there were waves of cuts"
good,Pick up parts from warehouse for scheduled maintenances and unscheduled corrective repairs. Enjoyed working with the MSO's in the field.
good,"Make sure that KPI's is on 100% accomplishment for sampling and analysis of all products as well as all utilities requirements."
good,"Loved the work week.  9-80 schedule (off every other Friday)"
good,"Typical work day consists; Upon clocking in, I would check the back office log book from previous day to see what products have been selling more than others and which need to be pushed harder. Walk around the store internally/externally documenting issues needing immediate attention. Cashiering, receiving and stocking orders coming in, delegating work assignments to fellow associates, studying MSDS for any updated safety rules/guideline we needed to be well versed in. Management was very helpful with instructing and answering any questions in order to better ourselves and the operations of the convenient store/gas station. Co-workers were nice and very energetic to work with and for. Hardest part of the job was being in the back freezer for extended periods of time in order to stock beer, sodas, etc... Most enjoyable part of the job was all the interesting and lively customers we got to interact with every day."
good,"Really th time of evening"
good,"A typical day at works consists of a hand in the mix of everything. From co-worker inquiries to outside company inquiries. I have learned all about title work and how you always need a supporting document to go with any changes you ever make. Management is ok, but there is not a lot of aknowledgement/advancement. Co-workers are usually great to work with, just have to keep them busy on their own tasks. The hardest part of the job is coordinating multiple projects with new hires while juggling daily tasks that have to be completed. The most enjoyable part of the job is the complexity of the work and the requirements of mental knowledge it takes to complete tasks."
good,"Was a great place to work, with plenty of opportunity for advancement and training. Benefits were good, and salary was better than average - a good-paying job. Planned to retire from the company as my father and grandfather had done before me, but the plant was sold and we were laid off. Now I am looking for another job in the refining industry and hoping the site is bought and reopens under a new company. i would go back to work there again."
good,"This job involved working with oil pipes and heavy equipment. A typical day would have us show up around 0700 and we would get our instructions and briefs for the day, and then head out to our working site."
good,I don't think I would want to stay at the company long term but has been great for me.  It seems too cliquish once you pass a certain threshold.  The company culture seems unevenly adhered to.
good,"The management structure is very top heavy.  They laid off a lot of asset staff, but retained most of their management, regardless of the amount of staff under them.  There is also an unnecessary amount of approvals needed to get projects approved.  Often, each supervisor would require a whole new study before they would approve their part.  There are a lot of opportunities to work in all kinds of assets and expand your experience base.  They work in onshore conventional, shale, heavy oil, offshore, and international.  You can also easily switch between disciplines if you want to become well rounded.  The pay and benefits are fantastic; offering all health care benefit opportunities, as well as stock options and retirement."
good,Great to work for and lots of opportunity to develop. Great life  and friendly work environment interesting company  and great leadership. Unfortunately less opportunity as the oil and gas industry slow down in the past couple of years. Hoping industry will change and more growth opportunities in Canada . Very strong diversity culture and opportunities to expand in the diversity area
good,"The work place is great and the people are professional, got my desired position in conocophillips, the remunition is quite poor compare to some of top peer. the benefit in health is awsome but benefit in housing loan is not eligible for all employee "
good,"Big  Oil and Gas company, very priffessional, good to lean and move to different possitions.  Training provided for all departments, seminars and updated meeting on companys procuction."
good,The trading floor is well put together and the members of the floor are treated equally whether a trader or a lower level employee.  There was mutual respect between all.
good,"I liked working for COP.  The pay was excellent and I enjoyed my job. I worked in Engineering the whole time I was with the company and enjoyed working with the Engineering, Projects, and Operations groups.  It was a good crew overall with good intentions.  Apparently, in the end, the stockholders were more important than the individuals that kept track of safety, quality control and engineering controls. From what I have heard profits are up substantially since the previous disciplines were dumped in favor of a new operator who put profits over safety. I was sorry to leave the company but enjoyed my time with them."
good,"Working as a revenue analyst gave me the chance to see how the whole system of oil gathering is done. I had the chance to understand how the start with a site and then put the drill down to production to pricing. "
good,N/A was i good organization to work for since they are one of the biggest player in the oil industry with access all over the world.This company has an impressive work culture.
good,ConocoPhillips is a good company to work for even if it is currently struggling as an Oil & Gas Company. I loved Bartlesville as a great small town to raise a family. ConocoPhillips has a very strong presence in the community and schools.
good,I enjoyed my time and the opportunities I was given.  Some great people.  Tough times during the downturn meant many of the perks went away.  And many good people lost their jobs.
good,"ConocoPhillips is a great place to work, they really care about work life balance. They are also supportive with growth and continued education opportunities."
good,I learned quite a bit.  Management was okay.  Workplace culture was good prior to the layoff announcements.   They support taking courses while working which is beneficial to be able to learn more for your job.
good,"Provides you with knowledge, experience, and the tools to carry forward in your career. Preferred to work in a field environment(much more relaxed) rather than a corporate environment"
good,Good workplace culture with great colleagues to work with.  Looking forward to com into work every morning.  Love the flexible time that the company offered.
good,"Experienced, qualified, high functioning work force driven by business goals and SPIRIT values.  Senior management, only shared limited info with Operations & Maintenance folks, kinda military like, seemed like did not walk the culture talk at higher levels."
good,"Great people to work with!  Interesting work, challenging and rewarding.  I worked in the field at Surmont, and it was the best place I have ever worked in my entire career.  Regrettably, many people have been laid off during the downturn in O&G prices."
good,"Received daily assignments, drove to well site, held safety meeting with crew, discussed job, reviewed possible hazards, and corrections, proceeded with job, learned to lock out tag out,"
good,"Enjoyed working there.  The people were great to work with.  The management was descent, but didn't allow much growth opportunities unless you were on their track."
good,"Pros: Great benefits, great work-life balance"
good,"The Company was a great place to work. But the local management was hit and miss, it was a training office for superintendents and we had some great ones and some that I feel shouldn't have made the cut. The local employees were great to work with and so were the contract companies."
good,"I have my own office in which I can safely interact with site owners & assigned contacts of the web sites/pages I edit.  My immediate supervisor  (the HR manager) is very easy to get along & work with & there is no micro-managing."
good,ConocoPhillips is a good employer and a sound company.  It's having financial difficulties now due to the low price of oil.
good,"The employers and employees are good and fun. Teach you a lot about interacting with children and learning ways to entertain them with different activities. "
good,"Interacted with co-workers and customers, attended numerous meetings, and worked out at gym."
good,My job experience at the ConocoPhillips refinery was very good I learned many things like how to read the air sockets. How to deal with spills. How chemicals are very dangerous and how we have to be aware not to touch anything without reading the SDS
good,Good place to work with opportunities for advancement.  Management and coworkers were easy to get along with and work with.
good,I liked that I helped build part of an organization that was the leader within the company.  I enjoyed the fast pace and quick responses needed to work in oil and gas.
good,"As with any company its all about your group and supervisor. The company overall is great. Great pay, best benefits in the industry, and honestly a lot of great people. Unfortunately its a cyclical industry and when times get rough people get cut."
good,Very good and some of the best benefits anywhere.  Frustrated by how Management  is chosen by favoritism and not performance.
good,"Solid company focused on delivering on promises/value to share-holders. Currently focused on operational cost reduction per the state of the energy industry/market."
good,"Coworkers were very nice and very professional"
good,"Well structured, high performing organization with sound market strategy and corporate structure.  Opportunities for advancement and management support of personal career ownership."
good,"1)	Prepare detail design，operation support for one appraisal Deep Water drilling campaign (3 wells), cost estimate and materials."
good,"Working in the Eagle Ford for ConocoPhillips was a great experience, always learning new things. Conoco is very safety oriented which makes daily operations go much smoother, there is a great group of people to work with at Conoco the best part about Conoco is that they make the service companies as well as the Conoco employees feel like one big team."
good,ConocoPhillips is a good place to work and they  hire good people.
good,Everyday was always a wonderfully challenging experience.
good,Working at Conoco Phillips was a huge learning experience and I was able to apply my previous experiences and education to the job at hand.
good,"A typical day at work for me is fast-paced and engaging. Gaining commitments from stakeholders, developing strategies to drive continuous improvement, and developing products and services that deliver exceptional business value. "
good,"ConocoPhillips not only talks the talk, they walk the walk when it comes to safety. The employees are empowered and trained to work with safety foremost in their minds. Caring about their employees are a staple of the work culture ConocoPhilips expresses to their employees."
good,enjoyed every part of my job and the people i worked with.  i learned alot about the oil and gas industry through this job that i wouldn't have learned any where else.
good,I was exposed to great Project Managment processes and a great team.
good,"Enabling management to make informed business decisions by providing timely and high quality production forecasts."
good,"Good company, no longer the LNG participant they once were."
good,"Highly recommend working for ConocoPhillips or Phillips66. Good pay, good benefits. Holidays/vacation very good."
good,My work experiences at ConocoPhillips Canada certainly enhanced me to gain insight oil and gas business practices. I have an overall understanding of capital control as a function within an Oil and Gas company and the process of capital reporting and its impact on financial results.
good,A pretty good company to work for.
good,"A new personal challenge, a different task than I have been given in the past."
good,"Management was great. Small area, but plenty of customer flow. Manageable schedule.  Supportive team members willing to help out. All around good place to work."
good,It was an excellent company to work for.  I worked in many different areas of the company.  Decided to Retire after 28 years of employment and I am now ready to reenter the Work Force.
good,"Somewhat stressful place to work, but the benefits were the bomb. I miss the pay and 3 day weekends. Advancement is not easy and the demand to keep your wells productive can be challenging. Had 5 different supervisors in eight years, so it was a bit hectic and some were better than others. Overall a good place to work."
good,"I started at Conoco as a Receptionist, was advanced to Admin Assistant and then advanced to the Health and Safety Department where my oil and gas experience as an Emergency Response Planner started and sky rocketed."
good,They have a good company culture and really care about their employees.  They provide a lot of opportunity to move between positions and learn new skills.  The structure can be very siloed which can slow down projects.  They are also not the most up to date on new technologies
good,Good place to work. managers change every few years so don't get to know them well. Co workers fit together well and other department contribute to projects.
good,"Great culture with open door policy. Strong leadership, guidance and growth opportunities. I enjoyed working there and I learned a lot. I would recommend"
good,Great with valued added positions to enhance the safety culture of the company.  Wouldn't take anything for my journey there.  Special Managers take out time to give unlimited support to their team.
good,"Great team to work with.  Opportunities to develop your skill set.  Throughout my tenure I had the ability to lead program reviews, provide input regarding continuous improvement, and learn from senior leaders on a regular basis as they were always available to chat."
good,In general a good company to work for especially if you are young. Policies apply to retention of the young employees. There are lots of opportunities offered for moving around the company and learning new areas of the company.
good,"A typical work day at ConocoPhillip starts from 8am. It's usually very slow in the morning with few movement of materials to loading dock needed to be shipped out  and more to do at noon till closing hour at 5pm. Job schedule includes processing of shipment with different classification code to pass custom, movement of materials needed at offshore to loading dock for shipment and services to expatriate to ensure all items needed for work on site are well packaged and shipped in a timely manner."
good,I was representing Clough AMEC and liaising with Conoco management both offshore and onshore. It was one of the more challenging positions I have had but very rewarding.
good,"Good company with international opportunities"
good,Safety meetings are very important but 30 minutes on changing out elevators during a trip is a little excessive. I think the hands get complacent with so many safety meetings I think a pre trip safety meeting covering all job task for the trip would be time better spent. Then with on coming crew at safety meeting
good,Conoco Phillips is a great company to work for. Team work and individual performance are greatly used. Work days were busy and taught me a great deal. I learned the management side of oil production as well as how to maximize oil production better. They have some of the best experienced mentors in the business. I enjoyed the camaraderie and friendships made there.
good,A typical day at work was trying to anticipate the actions of others. Looking a trends and reports to see if there was something more that could be done to keep people safe. Manage was great and supported the safety culture. The hardest part of the job was when an incident actually happen and there was nothing you could do to help the individual with there pain. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people that you worked with day in and day out.
good,"ConocoPhillips has a great work environment.  The company truly cares about the health and safety of its employees.  I very appreciated the projects I was given, my co-workers, and dealing with users."
good,ConocoPhillips It was a wild ride through the up & downs of the oil & gas industry. Through it all ConocoPhillips is poised to be an industry leader!
good,Fast paced with strong work ethic.Productive days. Team participation from employees. Willingness to learn multiple job duties allowed me to expand my duties. Lots of overtime.
good,It was a good place to work until it was bought out. I'd be willing to work there again if the opportunity presented itself. It was a shame when the company sold.
good,Enjoyed the time I spent working at ConocoPhilliips.  Learned so much from so many talented people.  Would return in a heartbeat.  Work/Life balance was important to the company as a whole.  Employee wellness was at the top of the list too.
good,Productive workplace. Walk the Talk. Great safety program. Excelent wages . Vantastic camp facilities. Transportation well organized. Wish i was still there(temporary position).
good,"Work and family balance with good salary and other benefits."
good,It's was so much fun working for conoco. I love working with customers and the work team. The job was very comfortable a little fast paste but it's was very relaxing.
good,A fun place to work and very interesting. It was the foundation of my experince as a dba and i would recommend anyone with a team spirit to work here.
good,Conoco Phillips helped me become a more rounded employee.  I really learned alot while I was contracting with them.  I met some outstanding people there that I am still in contact with to this day.
good,World class company with established system and willing to improve human capital capabilities. Copi also has huge asset in Indonesia and nice place to work with.
good,"I enjoyed my time there, I learned a lot and grew as a person and an employee. We had great staff, communication and an environment that allowed staff to grow and feel like  part of a company that wanted you to be a part it."
good,"The job in Dubai Petroleum was always challenging and demanding."
good,Good company to work for.  Had good programs and held events for team building. Departments worked well together and accomplished a lot of things that needed to be done.
good,"Great benefits, life and work balance, challenges, good peers and management to work with in general.  Oil and energy business is questionable for future and long career."
good,"I loved my job with Conoco, and believed I would retire from there.  I was given the opportunity to travel and see other refineries in larger cities. I loved the fact I was given so much trust and had the training this company gave me.  I have all of me SAP knowledge, and all of my college background thanks to Conoco. When the plant I was working was sold, I lost my job.  After moving to Consol, which was another part of the same company, I was treated just as good."
good,"the experienced gained at conoco was a good learning curve, i worked in many different areas with many different people and enjoyed my time there thoroughly."
good,ConocoPhillips is a great place to work.  The people are great and the workplace is nice.  Just seems to have too many layoffs lately due to low oil prices.
good,Good People working there.  Management is still trying to redefine the company after the split with Philips 66 in 2012. Oils Prices has hurt the company as well.
good,"Rate this company*required"
good,Never a dull moment and always plenty of work to do. Great bosses always there for you and willing to advise you and give you a hand if you needed it.
good,I love working with Conoco Phillips Canada at Surmont. Facilities are perfect specially the camp facilities. The camp is complete with amenities for relaxation after work. It is just like home without the family.The safety culture is exceptional. And the people are all very nice to work with.
good,COP is a company that is holding on to old major operator values from before the split while trying to move forward as an independent oil company. The company has some talented people and a good work environment. I'm not sure if management will ever be able to pick the pieces back up
good,"Very large professional company. Highly competitive in salary and benefits."
good,"Lots of travel to locations and meetings. Helped put Coaching program in place, Found the coach program was well respected by all crew members / Contractors. The hardest part of the job was to convince personnel to slow down at times and importance of taking the time to document JSA/HazardId's, Near misses ect ... The rewards of the job was seeing outstanding progress after a few visits and finding very little hazards on my walkarounds and attitude to documentation was improved."
good,The managers have an open door policy and are willing to listen and assist if possible. The people are also great! I came in with a learning curve having been in Higher Education and the help I received was great!
good,Great support from coworkers.  I learned a lot about the economics in the oil and gas industry.  Management seemed to take a great interest in employees.
good,"Fast paced, very open friendly environment, staff is very respectful and helpful. no staff conflict. Reliable management."
good,i learned so much in this company since it is the first company that i work with after i graduate from my bachelor degree. Really comfortable environment with good work etiquette as well
good,"When the price of oil is above $60/barrel, this is a great place to work. Unfortunately, that's not always the case. Upper management seems very disconnected from lower management. Work schedules are very flexible. The perks were nice (gym/pool, 401k contributions)."
good,ConocoPhillips is a company with a very strong safety culture from management all the way down to the first line workers.

good,well this was my first production operating job. was very exciting and had lots of knowledgeable guys to learn from. there was a lot to take in and learn in a short period of time. was surrounded by amazing landscapes with an abundance of streams and wildlife. the most difficult part i had in this career was having to work directly with a person no one else wanted to work with. in which i had to learn to work past to achieve my goals.
good,Great place to learn about the oil & gas business as well as a place for more seasoned individuals to grow as well.  A culture of safety first is extremely prevalent here as well as recognition to the individual for personal achievement that affect the group as a whole.

I would check the change machine in the car wash three times a week. I would stock the cold drinks walk in. I would do paperwork at the end of my shift.
good,"I was the Oil and Gas Production Assistant.  It is basically an administrative assistant position that was responsible for producing daily and weekly production reports.  I also logged and tracked lost production.  I reviewed and approved invoices.  I scheduled meetings, teleconferences and special events.  I was in charge of making sure that all employees complied with our records management program.  I acted as the Fleet Coordinator for over 40 vehicles.

good,"In a typical work day, I focus on completing on-going projects. If technical issues arise, I communicate with team members and supervisor to decide a path forward in solving technical problems. Since our team members work well with each other, it is most enjoyable to learn from each other with constructive suggestions. When our team reaches a milestone of the project, the team lead or supervisor always gives positive feedback, telling us that we are doing a good job. The least enjoyable part is  to complete the required paper work occasionally."
good,i would say its a good place to work. we have a good growth here. i really enjoy to working here. Its like working with learning.

good,This was one of the few places in the oilfield that management actually looked out for us on the rig. They did not just call us last minute and inform us they were not going to be doing anymore work and they actually cared about the staff. We were not just another position to fill with them.

good,"I had an entry-level, night-shift job, so it's difficult to comment."
good,"When the industry is running strong, there are opportunities for advancement and efforts are made by management to make employees feel valued.  Contractors on site frequently commented on preference for working on ConocoPhillips sites because they knew they would never be asked to do something unsafe or otherwise cut corners.  However, when the price of oil crashed, the workforce downsizing appeared to be a strictly numbers game without regard to relative experience between locations or job performance or how much of which skill-sets were actually required for steady-state site operations."
good,"a typical day was take care of all batteries and test facilities check all wells make sure there is no leaking equipment and keep a good clean and safe workplace, A very safe place to work."

good,"Incredible benefits, best I have ever had in my career.  401K matching was ranked #1 in U.S. by Bloomberg magazine.  Unfortunately when oil prices are good, times are good, when they drop, things get very tight.  This is true of all Oil and Gas companies."
good,Fantastic team setting environment. Fast paced and generally pleasant to work at. Possibilities for advancement are generally hard to come by.
good,"I was a contractor/temp worker here, but loved working there for the part time stint I was there.  Everybody was kind, helpful & very professional.  Because I was only a ""contractor"", I did not have any benefits, sadly.  Still, I was sad when they shut the entire facility down."

good,"Excellent Company to work for in terms of Compensation, Facilities and amenities."
good,"Great experience to the oil & gas industry as a recent graduate. Upper management was very supportive of its recent grads with training and responsibilities. Would have kept working at COP if it wasn't for the downturn in the industry, it was good while it lasted."
good,"My time at COP was short due to the down turn.  I had started 6 months before oil had taken a nose dive and when they announced the workforce reductions, I left my position for a long term vacation."

good,"Our day would start with a safety meeting in the morning, we would have coffee at the round table and have a safety meeting before the workers went out to the field.  I was in charge of running the maintenance work orders to hand out in the mornings to the employees so that they knew what they were doing for the day.

good,"I enjoyed no office environment, very self motivated  so foremen left me to my own devices, the company is now depending more on standards Vs. individuality which helped get the company to get where it is and diminishing the possibility of new innovations. It does take care of it's employees exceptionally well with very good benefits that are disappearing in this modern job world to reduce cost, which in my opinion COP shows it wants to take care/appreciation of it's employees.Had a bad year a while back, had emergency back surgery (not related to work) and was out for a few weeks, sprained foot on a dirt bike (out for 3 days), then was in a horrific car accident (not work related either) that i should have not lived through, and 85% that i'll never walk again, and a TBI so severe my people were informed that I may not have the capacity to work at Mc'D's or be a greeter at wamart! The Short Term Disability kept me from losing everything even though it dropped to 60%, I had my job back after a super quick astounding healing time of 6 months (originally proposed 2+ years), and it was just coming back from vacation plus lots of paperwork. Only a very few companies do similar duties, usually let go w/w out a severance of some sort especially it happening not on company time, so it was awesomely appreciated, so I felt the urge to go above and beyond what was in the job responsibilities."

good,"I really enjoyed this job, it was challenging, I made great contributions. I received the highest rating 3 years in a row. I always made excellent use of my time to ensure the organization meet it's goals.  I quickly identified gaps that existed after we lost two contractors and I volunteered to take on additional work so that the secondary cost log would continue to be a valuable tool with credible data and that a vendor reconciliation did not lose momentum.  This resulted in assuming 50-65% of the work done previously by a full-time employee while maintaining all of my previous responsibility.  This was not an easy task but I approached the additional workload by developing a more organized and systematic approach.  As a result I had gained additional skills in using Microsoft Excel.  I also successfully completed a significant vendor reconciliation project with one of our Inspectors, I assisted the vendor in identifying where cash had consistently been applied incorrectly and brought the payment status with the vendor to current."
