rating,review
bad,"Corruption,unsafe practices , cover-ups .cut corners inside the plant ,a lot of OSHA violations, unfair emploment for people that want to fallow the rules the old people that work for long time united to make people quit or get fired"
bad,Queen City Fluor/Stork. This was one of the most hostile environments I ever worked. Site Manager would curse employees and managers out. Threatening jobs. A very unhappy place to work. And dont go to HR he would say. I'll find a way to fire you. Plus the HR lady also had several other titles other than HR. Very surprised no one has sued them over this Coward.
bad,"I didn't enjoy work for this company, as it didn't show fairness to newcomers. Everything very biased on the basis who you know, and often good talents were lost because of it."
bad,"Some people are very well protected by managers and get by with anything, they will always have a job there. Others will not — stressful everyday due to budgets."
bad,"Stop you from coming from vocation so they can keep your vocation money"
bad,"I worked for Fluor in Afghanistan, they are just a warmed over KBR. More concerned with the creature comforts afforded to the tier one drones, a bunch of whining people who don't care about the ""mission""."
bad,Dependability and hard work mean nothing at fluor. The supervisor gives advances based on personal feelings. They hire anybody regardless of experience or quality just to have bodies on the floor. Then they flew quality employees they have are expected to do their own jobs and fix all the mistakes. Working at fluor is a temporary pay check at best.
bad,The management was terrible. They had a lot of family members that didn't know the industry making it very hard for the journal men . Would not recommend anyone to this company
bad,"The company was very poor. They closed the office. Working there was the worst experience I ever had. If  you didn't work with the others at a previous job, you were an outcast"
bad,Watch out this company had me fooled. They promised me a lot of benefits and i have yet to see an of them! They lowered m pay when they won our current contract and changed our schedules. They obviously bid the contract wrong. Get everything in writing.
bad,Worked in a refinery as electrician with Fluor and found it the worst company. Top management is stupid and racist.  Think twice before before joining.
bad,"The most depressing place to work in this area, everybody is job scared from the cut throat mentality and the poor management is  pathetic. If you want to be screwed over everyday at work this is the place for you. Full of liars and backstabbers (all in the front office of course)"
bad,"Unless you're desperate for work I would not recommend this company, it is a good old boy type of company, if your not in the click forget about it, managers are more concerned about their advancement, and keep your ideas to yourself, unless they thought of it they don't want to hear anything you have to say."
bad,They treated us like dogs. Over worked and under pay. It was horrible but it feed my family. They missed treated us. They didn't want us taking breaks if we felt over heated.
bad,To summarize...I would never work for them again! They do not care about their employees. They care more about money then anything else. It was sad working for them!
bad,fluortek is the worst place I have ever worked they mandate overtime on the weekends but wont tell you about it until Wednesday or Thursday before. they also expect you to work the weekend no matter what even if you have plans or a prior obligation that you told them about ahead of time. they do not care about theire workforce in the least
bad,"If you like a company thats top heavy with management and kindergarden politics all day this is the place for you,you feel harrassed and bullied all day long if your an equipment operator."
bad,"Employees are required to work long hours in poorly lit and dirty environments.  When safety issues are raised, the person raising the issues is chastised for speaking out about the unsafe conditions.  Good ole boy network and labor union environment.  Management is only concerned about pleasing DOE and getting their completion bonuses, hence the reason for working their employees 12 hour per day, 5 days per week and most weekends."
bad,I hate this company..They don't like black people..They will hire you but don't respect the black employees..Be aware black people..
bad,"I have worked with this company for 11 years and changed positions to be able to get a raise, there is no support for employees.  They do not promote within the company."
bad,"Worked temporarily on a shut down job and worked with good co-workers, management was great to work for and that made the job more enjoyable. The hardest part of the job is the heat but it can be tolerated."
bad,"Professional and thorough work."
bad,"I was penalized for taking off when my Father became ill and DIED from cancer. I was later ""blacklisted"" so to speak."
bad,"I enjoyed working for Fluor overseas type of work. Traveling was a fun experience and meeting new friends from all over the world."
bad,"bad experience from the start, no real management with lack of  company structure"
bad,"Good ole' network all away around.  Worse benefits ever, sick and vacation was horrible and no help from HR"
bad,"Responsible for logistical support for war zone contractors"
bad,"Treat you terrible, pay is low and you are overworked.  They talk down to you, and you end up doing there job for them.  Supervisior is lazy and 2 faced to everyone. "
bad,Work: 2D/3D Piping Drafting/Design
bad,"While Fluor appears to be a diverse company, it is nothing more than a good old boys club with very few women in leadership roles. There is a lot of inequity amongst employees based on gender. Working for Fluor is a risk. In addition, you may end up with a great manager or with one that derails your career. Be cautious!"
bad,"I worked for Flour for a little over a year. I was offered a very lucrative salary to start. They gave me a small raise on my second paycheck. They paid very well, I got to travel a bit. I completed significant project work over the first six months."
bad,"I worked for this company through TRS and had one of the worse experiences ever. I was labeled anonymously as being anti-white. I refused to train a white co-worker, I used my race to get ahead in the world and I only talked to two white people per day. This is what the director of HR from Houston came down to tell me and ask me those questions. I guess the last laugh was on them since yes I am black but my entire family is white. I am assuming they never heard of adoptions. I would never work for this company or especially TRS again. They also lied to the unemployment office and told them I quit for personal reasons when they made the situation of me working there unbearable. But I won that too."
bad,"Shady supervisors, uneducated management, workplace politics, leads don’t lead by example, basically thrown to the dogs without any training. Work every holiday"
bad,"Fluor's motto, ""Why do it right when you can do it a second (or third, or fourth, etc.) time."" Lots of long time employees that have grown very complacent and expect you to do their along with yours. The value of it's stock proves how management has repeatedly failed time and time again."
bad,Needs a complete over haul of management and people building their empires. The culure is that of compliance with not being able to think out of the box and to have excessive billing to clients because of so many levels of managment and refusing to be innovative
bad,Fluor has a harsh organizational culture. A work/life balance does not exist and the compensation and benefits are insulting for direct-hires. Fluor treats most all of its employees as just a number and has no conscience to the effects of its managerial and organizational decisions have on the people in its workforce. The company strives for maximum profits and this is evident in how the employees are treated.
bad,"I rate Fluor in the top 25% of all International  Engineering firms."
bad,"Executive management is completely uncaring about work/life balance.  Very strict on some; super easy on others - depends on who you work for so the 'rules' are completely unfair and biased."
bad,"IF you are willing to sacrifice family, lifestyle and everything else but the company, and put in long hours just for the sake of putting in long hours, have I got a company for you. "
bad,"Not a positive environment to work in.  Not much communication from management.  No training, no real skills learned. There were not parts of the job that were enjoyable. The culture was negative and often times people upset about working there.  Underpaid compared to most Government Contractors."
bad,"I wouldn't go back or recommend anyone to work there. I worked the night shift and if there wasn't any work, we would build scaffolds just so we could tear them down. I don't know who was paying for that. LOL."
bad,"Fluor will lay you off in a heart beat, so don't plan on working here long.  They give more benefits and treat the overseas employees way better than employees in America! Fluor is Outsourcing Engineering to manila and destroying American jobs just for more profit."
bad,"No leadership, employees in top craft positions are not knowledgeable in their craft.  Fluor does beautiful re-work and management takes no leader ship in controlling re-work."
bad,"If you are relative of some big employee then its good for you. Company will give you good knowledge but all other things are not at all worth. People are not fair,Company Politics involved. Company has Use and Throw policy !"
bad,Better companies out there.  Company has lifers employed in ranking positions.  Only know the fluor way....years behind competition especially in automation.
bad,"I worked for Fluor as a PM for one year.  I was handed a project that was well behind on production and over budget.  There was no way to bring the project in on time or under budget but I was told to get it done.  I was given no support from upper management or quality field crews to do the work.  For 9 mos. I struggled to get on top of the project and bring it to a close knowing that it was a huge loser and I probably would take the blame.  In September of last year I was let go.  "
bad,"Worst company I had ever worked for with worst management.  Rolled out Safety Policies incomplete, which did not comply with OSHA regulations, etc.  Policies would be rolled out without communication to HSE staff or field yet expectations of all to follow.  Fluor Management just moved directors and management from other job locations that projects had ended and stock piled them (as directors) into Safety Specialist roles.  When I arrived, the HSE Manager had extreme dementia/altzheimers and was incapable of running the department which set up individuals to run with however they wanted.  Extremely cut throat and cut throat.  Virtually no team environment except the good old boy network."
bad,"Showing no experience with best practices and continue doing what's ""always been done.""  Male and white? - You have great opportunity for advancement."
bad,"Working for Fluor was the best work experience of my entire career bar none.  The Fluor Management treated me like I was important and that I contributed.  There was plenty of advancement, and many learning opportunities with them.  I learned much from my experience working with them."
bad,Everyday working for them someone got hurt one caused the death of one they  employees. worked everyday no off  days for 2 months 10 hours minninum  took a toll on the body. Good money not safe though.
bad,"Dealing with government and takes for ever to get things completed. The Freeport TX location has a couple of OK people. But overall they are cry babies and worry to much about personal drama! Complete back stabbers and two face people, specially the management. Including the New Orleans office they are worse!!"
bad,"Our current project, Light Hydrocarbon 9 (DOW Chemical, Oyster Creek Plant, Freeport, Texas) is a new construction job. We are currently building a Polyethylene plant. Fluor has 2 other projects within the same plant site that are working around the clock. We are told that our site (LHC-9) is undermanned by 150 people and we are 2 months ahead of schedule, yet are being hit with reduction of hours, the threat of mass layoffs and to date have 4 Superintendents, 2 Safety Supervisors and a Senior Construction Manager leaving. I enjoy that my co-workers and my day to day tasks are not that bad, however we are constantly being threatened with layoffs, no matter how much our production reflects a ""go-ahead""."
bad,Expediting department horrendous place to work bullying culture holding you to ransom over hours treated people badly South African woman procurement manager shouldn’t be employed low life of human being cut throat many life due to her
bad,"Cellphone use is rampant and violates safety. Hard work is not rewarded, a best buddy network that ignores constructive criticism or complaints. Poor performance is acceptable if you are friends with management. Several employees have very poor work ethics."
bad,Diversity and Inclusion in the field falls short of what has to be signed off every year. You have to be in the slick of those who like to be micro managed. Language used is gross and complaining to HR is a joke.
bad,"Floundering company, do not understand how they stay in business."
bad,"Management is  always changing , they have almost lost there contract with kennecott due to poor management! "
bad,Je bent ingeleend en valt buiten het team wat een vast dienstverband heeft
bad,"The salary was great and the benefits were fair however; the staff at Fluor federal were not good. The place was in a state of disaary and the managment team was more involved in personal elationships than those of the studets. Many employees also had oersonal relationships with the students (awful)!"
bad,Management makes working here difficult. Due to managements focus on non essential tasks productivity suffers. High turnover rate due to management stykes
bad,"biggest problem with the site before it closed. the managment was more worried about the hands that have been working in the heat and freezing cold leaving a minute or 2 before the whistle blew. then we had to stand in line to wait on a bus in snow, rain, lightening,direct sunlight. our stop time was 430 we wouldn't make it to our vehicles till almost 5 so they had us stand there unpaid on there job site for 30 minutes"
bad,Fluor Daniels corporation is the third constructor to attempt to align this project with original projections. They are severely disorganized and thus behind schedule and over budget.
bad,just no. dont do it. good money. bad hours. bad management. bad work environment. paid lunch break 30 minutes. hard to move around. must have experience
bad,Leadership is always looking for someone to blame when things go wrong so they have someone to sacrifice to the client. However I had an enjoyable time here and met some really great people to work with
bad,"The culture is terrible, the managers/supervisors are not qualified. Everyone is out to get everyone because their job security is unknown. Besides the compensation, it's a depressing place to work."
bad,"A frightening place to work.  I do not care to work around nuclear radiation, and the overall tense and hostile work environment."
bad,Good starter job for inexperienced workers extremely low pay and you enter as a temp to hire.
bad,"NO holidays and NO berevment. they use a tool called TOWP (time off with pay). It is holidays, sick leave, personnal time, vacation, etc, all rolled up together which equals less that most companies time off."
bad,"fluor is so top heavy with salaried emplyees 15000 hourly support 60000 salaried ,hourly are told often that they can and will be fired for no reason and be thankful you have a job"
bad,"Nepotism rules. Knowledge is secondary. Doesn't help that it is project based, so massive layoffs when there are no projects. It is definitely an insiders club that caters to those who have connections"
bad,"Don't work there lots of chaos. Management did not inform any staff of what's going on. Did not address situation that they knew about and did not share. Leadership was awful do not care what happens to any employee. As a veteran, flour is not military friendly just a front for what's wrong with businesses today but Wish them well"
bad,Poor equipment and materials. People are very agree because of lack of respect to the employees. Forced overtime in some departments. Some departments overtime removes their holiday with no compensation.
bad,"This place although touted as a Fortune rated company has major issues inside their company and the Federal Division starting at the top.  They have NFC what they are doing for budgets and how to run processes, and their protocols are to try and use the same thing for different areas of the construction industry, and jam a square peg through a round hole.  From the Division President on down they have a habit of using old job acquaintance as influences on their current decisions even when they are the direct competition.  Out of step with what works and just a blame game inside their FFS."
bad,"Fluor is stuck in 1987.  Everything you do is so manual it hurts.  There's no technology, no plans to upgrade either.  My desk is in a hallway with 9 other people; this is progressive to Fluor.  My phone is literally the same phone I had during a college campus (1992-96) job.  I'm also suppose to do my work, while talk on the phone, without a head set...really?"
bad,"new company, came to NAS Jax, and changed the entire wy buisness was done... The company itself isn't bad.. The management they have sucks...."
bad,Lack of management and projects run poorly. Overall manager of the department plays favorites and there is not room for growth. I was laid off due to lack of work.
bad,"The company was terribly managed from the top. Total lack of organization led to many small ""kingdoms"" and a clique-filled atmosphere. That place was more about some managers protecting their turf than positively leading."
bad,Large company that has poor lower management. Double standards and lack of planning throughout company. I completed the same job tasks at a different construction site at Plant Vogtle Units 3 & 4 that was better managed and planned.
bad,Great company to work but  a bad management especially in maximo department kind frustrating at times....i'm ready for new challenges.
bad,"The middle management likes to toy with people's jobs, which makes it difficult to get any work done and creates an environment of insecurity. The benefits, on the other hand, are great. If departments had better management, this would be a decent place to work."
bad,"I loved the job. Was very easy and relaxing, but they expected you to be there 7 days a week and made every weekend mandatory overtime. The associates were all great people, but management was lousy."
bad,"I hated working for this company. The pay was great, but the management was utterly horrible. People would be punished by taking away their scheduled leave."
bad,Politics.....and more politics........and more politics. my parents always told me if you have nothing good to say about someone just be quiet.
bad,"I spent 2 years with Fluor Calgary feeling uncomfortable and mistreated. As an inexperienced junior I was led to believe I would become a designer, received the training for the software and was never allowed to use it. I was told not to bother the designers with my questions and year later after my training I was thrown into a busy project and was told I wasn't performing and was even questioned whether I ever attended school."
bad,"Recommend this company to every one looking for job opportunity."
bad,"Fluor Corporation was new into the property management game when I worked for them, that being said, they need to improve in many areas.  Was not a fan."
bad,"The experience was difficult.  Micromanagement, no consequences for very hostile management style in some departments, processes changed constantly, computer programs and processes antiquated, double work, and very little employee appreciation."
bad,"Receive service orders by military and civilian client, input in database, prioritize jobs by importance, organize crafts for work performance, input labour and cost expenses for all services throughout camp, implement projects requested by army, create Letter of Technical Directions (LOTD’s), job planning and estimating, run daily reports on project matrixes, LOTD tracker, daily Situational Report, Key Indicator and Work Compliance report for all departments in daily basis, organizing and monitoring work flow within the office"
bad,"enjoyed working at Fluor in Franklin, TX. "
bad,It was very nice working at Fluor Corporation. I have learned new things there. Co-workers were so helpful.
bad,This job site is poorly tooled-up. Co-workers are inept in overall maintenance capacity. management lacks leadership and planning.
bad,people tell them that they are the best in their resumes and make up lies and they pay them well. you tell the truth but demonstrate that you really know what you are doing and they don't care.
bad,Some of the most racist people I've ever met work there. HR doesn't seem to care though. Calling someone the N-word and praising the KKK will likely get you a promotion.
bad,Not a great place to work. No advancement opportunities unless you're related to someone higher up. If I were you I'd consider other companies that don't discriminate.
bad,"i start the day in 1 hour of traffic the start to work at 8 am and finish at 5pm. "
bad,work day is 10 hrs. learned from and assisted electricians. supervisors are very easy to talk too. my cooworkers were very helpful. the hardest part of my job was working in a thunderstorm. i loved my job but i found a better job.
bad,"In order to bring home any kind of decent income the need to work over 20 hrs. extra a week is necessary. To be considered for any type of income increase with you cant even have any blemishes not even 1 minute late's. The management favors certain people and groups. managers don't fight for the employees to get increases and incentives but wants the employees to go above and beyond the call of duty. ""Take one for the team"" Also flexibility is also only convenient when it is benefiting the company but when the role is reversed flexibility isn't an option."
bad,"Does not care about its employees, only about the bottom line.  Does not like or respect new employees at all.  Treats new employees like second class citizens."
bad,"I learned to work on the financial aspects of a pharmaceutical construction company. dealt with accounts payable, employee expense reports, manual checks and time sheets"
bad,My general foreman was very rude to employees who worked for him and other foreman on the job. He also played favoritism and treated them like gods. The laborers that worked for him he treated like dogs.
bad,Reserve comment.  I think it is unfair to expect me to post my feelings about my current employer on a platform that is not guaranteed to be 100% fool-proof.
bad,The management was not trained properly and did not know how to communicate with the staff.  Very little communication or direction was given to complete to daily tasks.
bad,I got great pay for a laborer but I never got days off. The company policies were constantly changing so it was difficult to keep up with. Management did not plan out what they were doing for the day so it led to many misunderstandings and delays on work such as work being scheduled in two areas at once so work couldn't be done.
bad,"Not a good company, they didn't have the right people on the right places so naturally the job suffered. They tried to stretch people to where the good employees would just get over worked and burned out."
bad,"Learned a lot about building a project from ground up."
bad,The Plant Vogtle Units 3 & 4 project is a very stressful work environment driven by long work hours and little to no chances for career advancement. In addition to that Vogtle 3 & 4 work environment has a chilling effect.
bad,No job security. Management acts if they invented what they do. Pay is below average. Consider this job as teTraingmporary.
bad,The company was not a bad place to work but the pay and benefits were not that good.  At the time period I worked there things could have been better with employees.
bad,lo único que rescato en el periodo en el cual estuve es la experiencia adquirida y la enseñanza que me quedo de mi jefe.
bad,"Use to be a great place to work but the last few years have included:"
bad,I enjoyed the compensation but overall work environment was negative. People didn't like working together and there was a lack of communication.
bad,"Met some great people while working here."
bad,"Poor benefits to workers, poor management,  weak team playing, too much time spent gossiping and not enough involvement with management.  Management needs to take more interest in what goes on in the work place and trying to encourage more team efforts within the team.  When there are problems with certain coworkers the managers should address that person "
bad,Absolutely no room for advancement. Management seems to be very jealous of the younger up and comers. No flexibility in work hours. Working remotely would be a pipe dream.
bad,"If you are a team player and know the right people you can do whatever you want whenever you want, if you actually try to accomplish anything, you are penalized."
bad,"Fluor used to be a great company to work for many years ago.  Hiring of inexperienced people, bad management of projects and an overall lack of professionalism has made this THE company to not work for if you can help it.  If you're not related to someone, in the ""clique"" or willing to dehumanize yourself to become what they want, you wont last long.  Taking pride in your work is a thing of the past.  Work faster, not better.  Horrifying."
bad,"Company that possess extraordinary talent and dedicated employees wanting to do quality work ethically yet invests none in them. Employees are not given a route to succeed or advance, no raises, poor communication with upper level management (executive management). It is a true shame that this company does not take advantage of lessons learned nor understand that people are their most valuable resource. Executive management is only concerned with profit. I would not work here again. Only focus is short term profit not long term growth and retention of employees. Does NOT understand power industry. Executives are prone to emotional knee-jerk reactions when projects are difficult. Also does not retain talent from one project to the next, Liquidates all their knowledge base when a project ends. Very sad."
bad,I honestly think if main head quarters actually came to the sites and talk to some of the actual workers like the journeyman and helpers so many changes would  be made.  There are some good supervisors but the bad ones outweigh them 5-1. So many factors take place in advancement from color of skin to gender or even who you know. Better to come to company already established  and foundation built for yourself.
bad,long days with only 2 breaks... supervision would not listen to the craft and it was a continuous break down in communication. the most enjoyable part was being apart of the SRT team...
bad,"Cut throat, stressful, poor management, buddy system, unfair pay, discrimination of age and gender, retaliation for complaints, questionable ethics and integrity.  Basically, they don't care about their employees"
bad,To many new faces. The quality of work was lacking. The new hands did not have training. The walk to the job was over a mile and the buses were always to ful
bad,The project has over run many times. management has been questionable with a major re-organisation imminent to add to the confusion and insecurity. My position has been ended as the joint venture partners have too many free staff members not being charged out.
bad,"It is construction and it is long hours, 5 - 10 hour days, which is tough to get used to.  Most of the people are travelers and have moved from Fluor job to Fluor job.  Sometimes not the best team players.  Very closed group, friendly at work but do not expect friendship outside work."
bad,"I worked for Fluor for 33+ years and i enjoyed all of them, great people. i held several positions while employed with Fluor. i was in management for most of my tenure with Fluor."
bad,"Fun workplace with supportive management, left to get on with the job with no interferance.  Great to be allowed to get on with the job."
bad,"unorganized "
bad,"Plans, oversees and reports on residential living operations during assigned tour of duty.Schedules work assignments, supervises residential advisors and evaluates their performance.

bad,"even though they were never late with payments, the salary was not great, the advancement opportunities are close to none. A big positive is however the insurance"
bad,"This work environment was toxic. Positions higher on the pole could belittle or disrespect anyone else. This company puts on a very good show about being a good employer but in the background, they are 100% focused on money. They will cut corners regardless of safety procedures being violated, people losing their jobs or someone else will be blamed. Most of their workforce is overseas. They do offer perks but only to those in respected positions, leftovers are distributed to the lower ranks. The culture is a very blinded hierarchal structure, who is really good at lying and great at convincing that their way is the right way and there is nothing wrong. Long hours, tight unrealistic deadlines, and disregarding work/life balance."
bad,Poor management drove the job into the ground government shutdown oh so you want details see what floor Corporation did was hire illegal aliens Mexicans that stole jobs from Americans come in and bother fixing things that are wrong with the project. So the government shut them down
bad,"lied to about hours, pay was correct per diem was fought but settled, hours were suppose to be 70 ended up being 50 then with rain barely worked so no good there."
bad,Overall I enjoyed my time at Fluor but the stress of the work hours and not knowing how long the job would last took it's tole. The team that was bought together to do this job was great.
bad,"I went through 3 foreman in less than 2 months, the last foreman was someone I couldn't work for. He couldn't assign tasks to be completed and wasn't competent at all for being a pipe foreman."
bad,"The work pace was slow, site processes were time consumming and tedious and constantly changing. Site was shut down due to schedule overruns, over budget and extremely poor management"
bad,poorly coordinated and  unorganized project that I didn't learn much on the management was based on the good old boy system with very unqualified managers
bad,insurance sucks along with management at the job in SC. management was not willing to help or let personnel move up and advanced him or her selve. was not happy with them
bad,"It's not what you know but who you know with this company.  Managers are not willing to listen to the people who do the work, only interested in keeping their positions."
bad,"I have worked there for almost 5 years"
bad,"A typical day starts off  with a redundant maze of paper work ,between the customer and company to put together small scale projects, such as office renovations or power upgrades, which may only add up to 5k. the same amount of  paper shuffling for a 500k project?? "
bad,"Cons"
bad,"Be careful with this type of EPC Company. I have worked here 15 years and due to personnel reduction, I have been laid off."
bad,"too many cliques, they expect you to do all the work and the leads talk to the girls and goof off. .not a very professional company. health insurance will not pay if the decide its pre existing.. I worked 3 times. never again"
bad,fluortek inc was a fine place to work at but they do not give raises for many many years. I learned how to work with medical tubing and run machine .
bad,When I first started with this company is was a great place to work and the management really cared for their employees. After 10 years at the comany the President and Vice President started to embezel money from the owner of the company.
bad,"Good company just did not work for me. Management is not Leaders in the company. The is a very large company, not big on advancement with a degree. People watch you and criticize you if you have not been with the company longer than 10 years."
bad,This job that I had was managed very poorly. They never really had a good schedule and hired anybody. This wasn’t a pleasent job to have. Would not recommend.
bad,The company is currently selling off several divisions and reducing its workforce. It is not a good company to work for right not. Maybe in a couple of years its position in the workforce will be better.
bad,"Skills and Attributes: "
bad,The company is working toward moving jobs to India and the Phillipines.  The only jobs that will be left in Greenville will probably be the government jobs.  Very stressful environment and not very caring for their American employees.
bad,"Glamorous buildings. Welcoming Rhetoric. But once the indoctrination is over, The truth becomes obvious.You're nothing more than a robot or worse, liability. This rule applies especially if you happen to be a female situated in a predominately male occupation, namely engineering. The glass ceiling doesn't hover overhead, rather gives you a hard sobering slap in the face soon after you settle in."
bad,"If your not in the click your out"
bad,"This company is your classic use and discard. It is also your classic ""good ol boy network"". It's who you know. There is no advancement, no career training. You are not one thing above a number. BUT, above all of that, the absolute worst thing that has happened to Fluor after all these years, is they will hire anyone and give them journeyman status and pay, with ZERO experience. Helpers are now making same pay as journeymen. Pay is NOT depending on experience AT ALL. There is no fluid connectivity between departments, formen, supervisors or corporate. One doesn't know what the other is doing."
bad,"risk adverse atmosphere, construction company first, upper management should work better at engaging employees opinions, however very respectful of family needs"
bad,"Cut throat, stay to self and stay out of trouble. Hard to get a raise.  Management don't know there job and make all the money. Don't stand behind the workers."
bad,"It was difficult to get good quality from the workers. The workers had a good enough or let's see if it passes attitude about their tasks. Instead of giving reprimands or releasing them for poor workmanship, the supervisors just moved them to another area and the results where still the same. Holding someone accountable was not a standard at this job site."
bad,"Actual Job and Co Workers were good to work with, But Management was very unpleasant, and impossible to work with. many employees chose to leave due to the particular manager."
bad,Management is both incompetent and oblivious to issues in the field. Management's unrealistic expectations from employees are rampant. Quite possibly the most dysfunctional operation I have ever seen.
bad,"way too strict. workers uncomfortable doing their job under watchful eye. it could have been a great place and company to work for but they under bit contract with the military so the workers had to pay,most of them with their jobs"
bad,"Lots of talk. Very little to follow it up. They no longer invest in their people. At all. "
bad,"-A typical day at work was stressful due to management changes.  "
bad,Honestly they went out of business because Tec Industrial bought them out and we basically just switched hard hats and got rid of some of the white hats that was bad.
bad,"A typical shift involves monotonous patrols checking the same static items and ensuring outdated classified material is secure."
bad,The pay is low and they work people really hard. You only get one break out of a 12 hour shift. You work as a craft possible. They expect you to do everything.
bad,I feel that the job was good but some people made the job harder than needed to be.
bad,"As Material Coordinator, I placed Purchase Orders, Payroll, CPC Reconciliation, Man Power, helped organize outages, monthly invoice reconciliation for 8+ locations at any given time.  I learned that I had to be one of the guys to get by.  That no matter how much money you make it isn't worth the time away from your family.  Management was very egotistical, I was one of the three females in the 8+ locations.  I learned when to role with the punches and when to tell them enough is enough.  The most enjoyable part about working at Fluor is exactly what I did and being able to go to lunch with my dad on some occasions.  The hardest part about my job was working 16-18 hour days sometimes 7 days a week."
bad,nice place to work at. good pay scale. lotsmof overtime when available
bad,With the good old boy mentallity of Fluor you will not make it with this company if you cannot play by the rules.
bad,This was a pretty decent company to work for but they have some management problems.
bad,"The workplace culture has evolved from ""people friendly"" to ""Wall Street"" driven decisions. Over time benefits have been reduced with no pay raises. Plenty of opportunities to take online courses."
bad,"If you do not find your own place on next project, you are out. Laid offf, fired, call it how you want. "
bad,Now this review doesn’t stand for all of Fluor  I hear that most of there sites are pretty good to work for ( info from other road hands) ours however is very cut throat and clickish. Your either part of the kissass click or you ain’t.
bad,"personal around me was good, forman were good some supervisers were good as well. but there wasn't much communication with people, a lot of material wasn't there on time or never delivered after requested. it was one of those quick paced jobs with the material not being there 60% of there time.   but who am i to say anything, i know its a different story in management."
bad,"job ended unexpectedly with no severance or job placement,not to mention no initial explanation ,basically ""get your things and go ! "" Craft knew of  layoff ,yet we  (Field Engineering) received NO explanation, NO e-mail, NO severance, and NO help with job placement. In fact, I still have TOWP I have not been paid !!"
bad,"If you're a woman or a young male apprentice, this isn't the place to work. They're pretty firm about not letting people move up and advance in their craft."
bad,"Get work order drive to location.  When You get to the location of work order have to talk to the customer and find where the problem is.  Fix problem, clean up area and leave to next job."
bad,"Manager doesn't follow the process. Because of that, we need to rework some of the proposals. Also, overtime is sometimes up to 7 hours. Not fair treatment between morning and night shift. Not balance workload given."
bad,La empresa se empeña en el desarrollo de sus empleados para diferentes áreas de planta de producción.
bad,"Excellent exposure to potential sources of learning.  Depends only on the individual to seek out and accept opportunities."
bad,the people become family but the management and promotion is horrible. Its hard to move up or change a different craft. Its hard to get on unless you know someone on the inside.
bad,"Disassociated management from site results in a lack of employment continuity and forward planning."
bad,"The lower level management and workers were great to be around, but the upper level management would never listen to the workers, resulting in doing the same task 3-4 times and supervisors never checking behind their workers to make sure the job was actually completed. Management would also fail to allow workers to complete an assigned task before moving them to another task. But, my immediate supervisors were usually very helpful and did what they were supposed to do."
bad,If you do not mind working in a war zone for 12 hours a day 7 days a week then this is not a bad job
bad,"I've worked for this company on and off for 10 years. Good luck if you get put on a ""leave of absence"" (their euphemism for ""laid off""): they do next to nothing to retain people, even people who have been with the firm for decades and/or people who are top performers. There's a never-ending supply of warm bodies in Greenville who want to work for them, so there's no incentive to rehire you. When they do lay you off, you CAN come back as a contractor, making substantially less, and prove yourself worthy of a permanent job all over again. "
bad,If you can find another job with someone else go with them. You would rather work for a company that will not lie to you.
bad,"You are just a body to them. They have contacts for lots of people, your just another apple in the barrel. Just finished a four year assignment, and they said go to our site and search for other jobs. They do not have holidays, sick leave, or bereavement. You just accrue time off and take it when necessary. I found their health insurance to be sub-par. I enjoyed the mid level managers. They seem to care."
bad,"I really enjoyed my job,but was disappointed by management and there following through with promises and job security.Always telling employees that there wasn,'t anything to worry about but you knew that your job was always on the line.Even if you followed policies."
bad,"Adversarial relationship between management and union craft employees (""they are not your friends"").  No professional development, no training of employees (even if free- Fluor would have to pay their hourly rate).  I was forced to take an hour of leave without pay for attending a professional luncheon.  There is micromanagement of salaried timesheets and no flexibility (""record to the tenth of an hour"" -and they are watching when you leave).  No feedback, just do your job. Adversarial relationship between management and the government- get every dime you can from them, do nothing for good will.  I've never worked in such a negative atmosphere before.  Dead-end job, ends on Dec 31.  Fluor corporate management says all the right things, but locally, it's bad.  Everyone is trying to leave."
bad,I worked at Flour my first job with them. First set of management was ok. Second set of management was horrible. Third set barley made it 2 months before getting run off. 4th set was the absolute worst upper management Pete Bradel laid off hundreds of people without even asking foreman of general foreman who's the best to keep and who to lay off. They just handed out a big list to the superintendents to pass down the line. Even laying of great general foremans that were only ones that knew where temp power lines were buried. After big lay offs so they can bring in their own guys. Lots of good people got laid off to be replaced by idiots that didn't know whats going on. Also over staffed upper management running up cost in turn they cut the JOURNEYMEN that actually make the job run!!! Whithout the bottomed guys the top fails. One day maybe they'll learn that. Until that time I switched to environmental work never been happier. Here your not just a tool once done you turn it in.
bad,"Fluor was a really good company, until these past few years, when a wave of younger engineers and managers started working. To us that know what we're doing, we've been having to double work everything because of this. No support from management has us giving up on trying to restore Fluors name. Personally, I am very disappointed with the company that Fluor has recently turned into."
bad,"I started working with the company some 12 years ago with HQ in Sunninghill, then move down to one of its branch offices in Durban, Fluor-Iogda a JV for national compliance, Due to the down turn in the national and Global economy, work load in drying up and job security is my concern. In time like these the ""ship"" need a good captain."
bad,"I work 12 hour days 5 days a week and then most Sat an 8 hr and also Sun every so often.  7 days a week is way too much.  I get doing overtime but this is crazy."
bad,"I have worked here for 8 years."
bad,"Managing accounting of major projects."
bad,"The company itself is a very good company but the people running the PDDM Management Team is all about politics. They will manage the department from home offices leaving the folks at different site areas on their own. Once you close a project for them, they will cut you lose and forget about all the hard work."
bad,"After 10 years it was easy to get stuck doing the same thing as They operate in a more functional way. IE if you work in contracts, its hard to get into construction or material management. There are many good training opportunities, but you have to beg to get into them. They need people with specific skills to go somewhere and do a job. There are many young hi potentials (typically out of chemical engineering) which will show up on your project and you will know it. If you want to do something new you have to leave."
bad,I've enjoyed my opportunity and explored lot of things but Fluor india management would not like to know what skills their employees have. They won't appreciate the people who actually work hard and smart. They feel that find out quality people and appreciate them is none of their business.
bad,Sometimes communication is not very good.Hard to get advancement unless you know someone higher up. you have to keep your opinions to yourself.strictly business work habits no horse play
bad,"Recently interviewed for a senior position, agreed upon all conditions with Technical Manager and HR. Agreed with the starting date and signed employment forms."
bad,"If you have ambition, it would die here.  Advancement is nearly non-existent.  Very little ever changes."
bad,"Worked there for about 5 months was lied to from the beginning was told that I was going to be directly hired over from there own internal temp agency in only 4 weeks a month that never happened. They lied to me about the work site location they said I was going to work for another company and then they lost the contract so they put me in another site. Once, there they had the facility supervisor handling all of the budgets for not just my site but all 9 sites. They said that I would grow and do more than just the mail room but that never happened instead was forced to work a full day with 5 hours of down time and when I mentioned I needed more work they said no that I don't have the process when I asked can I have access to learning the process I was told no not ready plus the facility supervisor handles all that and it is not necessary for me to learn it. They get contracts from big companies but they don't want to think about them when they are on site I was told to ignore them and not worry about them. After 5 months it came to an end for me just beware they will lie and not give you managerial support when you need it. Also the facility supervisor is in Englewood NJ never comes on site to see the work that is being done on other sites she is always too busy to discuss business and then she gets mad when you try to take on responsibility for your own site which they will tell you that they want you to run your own site but tie your hands when it comes to accounting and purchasing supplies which does not exist you have to send an email to the facility supervisor and she will"
bad,"Was hired through veteran service. All Vets were laid off 1 month later.  Was told I would be called back, that was 2 years ago.  Supervisors didn't do anything but talk to their buddies."
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job, culture diversity at different work locations. Lots of fun work. The company is very project focused and driven to get results."
bad,"You can learn a lot, but you can get laid off anytime. They hire in mass and lay off people in mass without mercy and humanity. They play with life of their employees. Lower managements are very good, but they have to follow instructions from their upper managements."
bad,"The cost of healthcare is too high. Hourly pay way more for family insurance than do salaried employees. "
bad,this was not a good work experience for me at that time morale on site was extremely low at all times and just when you thought it was starting to come up the company did something to lower it. It was a time when you did not enjoy or take pride in your work.
bad,"Continuing to hire new employees left and right, but cannot provide decent office conditions or even enough parking for the existing employees.  Think that the internet is an invaluable tool?  Still not available at every engineer's desk. Typical raises struggle to even keep up with inflation.  There are so many rules and prescribed processes that even the simplest of tasks take magnitudes longer than necessary.  The majority of my day is spent staring at a computer monitor, performing mindless administrative tasks. If you like to get things done and try new things, this is not the place.  At least there is great job security and work-life balance."
bad,"Worked for them at the Sasol Mega Project site and it was very stressful because of the demands of Sasol. As far as my boss, he was wonderful and anything that was needed he was able to take care of it with the home office approval."
bad,I didn't work for Flour for long. They took over a contract from the employer that hired me and within a short amount of time I was one of the workers laid off for budget cuts.
bad,"Fluor is a good company to work for,I have worked for them for 10 years now. They are very safety conscience, and pay rates are above most companies. I would reccommend them for a safe place to work."
bad,"This job was set up to be a great job with a 4-5 year contract. However due to poor management on multiple companies the contract was terminated and given to another company leaving 1,060 employees out of a job they had moved to GA for."
bad,this company is ran by idiots both top level and low level management. the pay is top of the line and that is about as good as your going to get with this company.
bad,"Average company to work for, definitely not one of the best that I have worked for over the years. Management takes over even though they don't know what is going on."
bad,I would work up patients for our doctors and put them in a room for the doctor to see.  I love helping others.
bad,"Very busy environment, currently experiencing some growing pains but have very capable management at the helm that will solve any issues that present themselves"
bad,I learned a lot but it was a challenge. Getting people to invest their hard earn money in spite of all the pros that benefits them.
bad,Adquieres experiencia en el desarrollo de proyectos mineros
bad,"Lo que mas me gusto es que pagaban en tiempo y forma a todo su personal. "
bad,"Has lots of opportunities to help others become very successful in learning different types of trades, but has a lot of downfalls for putting the most qualified people in the proper positions for which they were trained for. As far as meet and greet the staffing Dept. welcomes you very professionally. Also their Safety requirement 100"
bad,I found the business and staff very bland a boring. There was no motivation or team building exercises. And very quick to highlight the bad in personnels and disregard the appraisals.
good,not as job for people that have families. it is very demanding and there a lot of people that claim to be at a certain level an theyre not. this company almost lost thier job due to thier managment.
good,"I would not recommend anyone to work here, unless they were in desperate need of a job."
good,"we are just a number, no repect for the employer. Work as been taken to different countrys we just moniter them. the work come back is bad we have do it all over again. more pressure to finesh in time. Its just bad place to work."
good,If your not in with the click you have to worry bout losing your job daily. There is a buddy system where people who's in the click moves up very quick.
good,Difficult to work with the cultures that do not respect the sanctity of life.  It is hard to work when the others do not know how to utilize the English language and apply personal hygiene.
good,"From my experience the company was very lacking in managerial skills.  You had to go outrageously above and beyond and nearly work yourself to burnout in order to receive notice earn a raise, unless you knew someone who's brother knew someone if you know what I mean."
good,I work a shut down with them. It was stressful and exhausting. We worked 7/ 12s in the freezing cold. They did provide hot chocolate and hand warmers.
good,"Different aspects of Fluor produces a different outcome with each project. My first three projects from 2013 were AMAZING, with AMAZING people. The last project started out amazing, but turned into a horror show with management who only wanted to throw their weight around."
good,"During my time with FLUOR, there were to many managers on our project. One could have ran it appropriately, but it seemed the other's were assigned just to bill the client. As a seasoned professional, I  took pride in doing the job correctly, for the client, professionally and with hope to help the company succeed and be awarded more project contracts. However, my time there was anything but quality work, the management was more concerned about numbers to make bonus and it showed in the work they sent out. This has become an epidemic in a lot of engineering and designing companies where they are more interested in making a quick buck than having years of profitable work/contracts. This  doesn't allow for any job security for any professional and it takes the professional drive right out of anyone who worked/works there. A schedule was provided, but completely inaccurate for quality work for the client. I do not see FLUOR being awarded anymore contracts like the one I just worked due to poor quality and an absence of proper management. I really enjoyed the workers I worked with as they had to endure this much longer than I. As a professional Project Manger (BAS Degree and years in the military) I have worked 20 years in different engineering design disciplines and this contract was one of, if not the worst schedule design I have ever been on. I personally could have ran this schedule and milestones much cleaner, with quality to where the client would have been excited to move forward on any other project, as well as new clients wanting to sign. Most importantly, the company would"
good,"Management never cared about anything except the money the corporate, Big Dogs, were going to receive as a bonus.  Four years without a raise. Ethics is a joke, waste, fraud, and abuse was reported, the person reporting the illegal activity was punished!"
good,"Management is very mess. Too many political inside company. "
good,I have learned a lot from my various positions with the Company. I worked my way up from a Compensation Analyst to a Senior HR Specialist position responsible for a business market.
good,I like the money and that they have there stuff in order but they are a u have to know someone to get in type of atmosphere.. always felt like some was watching u and they had some poor leadership
good,"i have to write 150 character minimum about this place? i don't know. i was just going to write that it sucked to work there. consistantly dehydrated, no matter how much water i drink."
good,"A typical day as a Fluor employee consisted of handling mail, accepting packages and delivering packages to company personnel as well as shipping all outgoing packages and mail."
good,Working at Flour Daniels isn't to bad. As long as you can handle being on swing shift the only real downfall is that you're doing a job that pays the guy next to you over $20/hr and you're only making $11/hr
good,"The work through the day is fast paced and sometimes unsafe. The general foreman is a pipe fitter with no prior Heat treatment experience, and sometimes over reacts to the work plan."
good,Supervision couldn't plan anything. No one knew what other crews were doing. My immediate supervision didn't care about the job or well being of the company. The whole iron group was family which made it impossible to progress in the company.
good,ii do not wish to give a review of this company. i work for the union and do not work directally for fluor. i donot believe i  should have to review a company that i do not directally work for.
good,"It was a job, it could have been a good job if it had been organized."
good,I always felt used and abused by management while I worked with Fluor.  I hated going to work. I made excuses so I wouldn’t have to see those people. I eventually quit. I was underpaid and overlooked when the time for advancement came.  I would eventually have to train the “new guy” who would be marking more than me. I sucked it up for years.  I became tired of being the doormat
good,Fair company to work for per diem could have been better. Hired as a Millwright. But really was a boiler makers assignment. Only worked for 2 weeks. Pay was lower than expected.
good,"This is all overseas work in Afghanistan in a combat zone. "
good,"There was a time when a craftsman would proudly say, ""I work for fluor"". Unfortunately,  most field hands no longer feel this way."
good,"Fluor has the processes and procedures to execute any project anywhere in the world. Allow Fluor to manage projects completely, and you are likely to have a successful project on time and under budget without compromising safety or quality."
good,the company was ok. nothing really special. The hours were good especially getting off at 3:30 daily. The management was all over the place. The upper management would only do a mediocre job providing the workers the proper information needed to complete the job. Quality Control would take days to come inspect areas that were complete which would hold everything else up.
good,to many workers.  pore lower management. a disregard for policies and procedures. leading to the shutting down of the plant. management rewarded brown-nosing but not hard work.
good,Too many buddies hire there buddies in this company and there buddies get the job promotions so if your not in the clic you will not advance. Inexperienced supervision skipping chain of command and being promoted they rely on experienced trades to send in SOS cards to give them tips on manageing there safety there is too much office dead weight. Overall if you go to work and don't say anything you will keep your job with them if you make them look good.
good,"friendly and willing to help and answer and questions or concerns."
good,"Assist in the management and coordination of the billeting mission for over 4,000 troops, contractors and US government employees on Camp Marmal, one of the largest camps in Afghanistan"
good,"This is construction. It is not a long term project."
good,"I Learned alot from my formen Terrence Biggers and General formen Will Young. Alot of over excertion and lack of concern for employees. Worst job I ever had when it comes to caring about people. I remember when they fired 35 people for answering there phones in the lunch tent, which is the designated area for cellphones it did not make any scense. There many stories like that."
good,"This company has a great work ethic and long term employees seem to really love the travel that comes with the position. However, for minorities, and can be a difficult environment depending on the location and the team you are on. We even had incidents of people hanging nooses outside the trailers. The matters were taken very seriously but the tension was definitely thick."
good,"Review regular and personal work and inspection schedule."
good,Well controlled. Wealth of experience. Very limited opportunities to advance.
good,"My job was simple. Once I got to work. I could check the schedule and perform the tasks set before me. Most things were repetitive and easy to understand,that's a typical day @ work. As for management, I strongly feel they should be reviewed on a quarterly basis to make sure they are up to date. I'm easy going and I can get along with just about any one so I have no problems with my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was being away from home such a long period of time and being in a danger zone 100% of the time. The thing I loved the most was satisfying the soldier/customer. I loved to enter act with them and take care of them, to make sure they enjoyed the meal..."
good,Company looks out for itself does not care about people just wants job done. Management tells you what you want to hear and does not follow through. Expect any answers to take a while to get back.
good,My second turn at Fluor was not the same as my first one there. I was responsible for deliverables that were highly dependent on other disciplines and even my own team but never got the back up I needed from my chief to get the input from those other disciplines to have a life outside of the job. Everybody is busy and my chief had bigger priorities than helping me but when the initial phase of the project was completed didn’t hesitate to consider my efforts/results not worthy of a continued job there.  Sounds like sour grapes and honestly is a bit but never got the appreciation for the long days and effort (16 hour days at the end) put in to get my job done.
good,"No job secure. The company hire people and fire them. You will get job only if you know someone in the management. "
good,"Daily safety meeting and job assignments.  Attended meetings with the client, planning/scheduling preventative maintenance and walked jobs to ensure safety and quality of work performed.."
good,"Everything was measured on a money basis. If it costs money it didn't happen, if it could be done without costing money then it was done.The minimum for everything."
good,"Acceptable, Job is winding down. Afghanistan support of Military Operations. Somewhat dangerous. Stressful environment. Housing was poor. Used to pay $92000/year with longevity bonus"
good,"I worked long hours with good people."
good,"fluor is a good company .but the management on ground need to go "
good,"Project work under government contracting, compensation was the best in the market, work culture was abysmal. Incompetence was reflected on all levels of management."
good,"It's a stressful work environment but the fear of layoffs was present since my first year there. I suppose it was used as an incentive to work ""harder"" but all it did was establish a cut-throat work environment where even the leadership turn its back on its employees. "
good,"Fast pace environment, supervisors don't give you too much information. Your expected to have your area done and expect your to already know the ""Flour"" way if doing things"
good,"Fluor was a decent job, I worked for them for 5 years and never got vacation. I barely had medical insurance, it was expensive and at that time it was cheaper not to have insurance."
good,"The job required at the Smelter plant, was enjoyable and lots of knowledge was given about the plant/operations. The safety at the plant was top priority.  The issues with area is the management for the facility. Lack if communication, intimidation and threatening job loss constantly."
good,"Fluor opened an office in Manila, Philippines and mandated that 60% of all manhours to be done in that office. They are management and middle-management heavy. Too much emphasis on bean counters, and not enough on the Engineers and Designers."
good,"hurry up and get it done attitude resulted in massive rework. I learned that non-english speaking employees more valuable than US born despite the sub-standard quality they practice.. management mostly buddies,helping buddies, or nepotism. the hardest part of the job was performing as the pro I've been groomed to be in this culture of hurry up and get it done at all costs. the best part of the job was working with some fine individuals, though they are few and far between."
good,Flour at this project did not have the proper Administration support in place to effectively execute required work scope. They were 4th contractor to work at site and were not organized.
good,Flupr is a great company but the supervision sucks. They treat people like the don't have an opinion or a voice. I like the atmosphere and a good crew
good,"Once assigned to an overseas project you become a number not a name, very impersonal and little help or support form home office in Sugarland. Friendly management yet must be in control of your position, your accomplishments and your project goals to meet or exceed time lines and develop your relationships with clients and subcontractors to achieve goals."
good,Not a comfortable work environment due in part of job being behind schedule. Surveying department for almost seven years understaffed making it very difficult for field operations. One pro was the job being within a thirty mile radius of home.
good,"I was a receptionist, but I did the work of a staffing coordinator. The number of separations vs the number of hires is the same if not more. I wasn't there for long since the oil industry went down again and I was the last one hired in the office. Have a backup plan"
good,It's a good place to work as long as you get get along with management. Good pay benefits are decent. You can learn allot and move up quickly. Work allot of hours.
good,started with fluor in nuclear then went to new construction culture difference was unbelievable but both sides of the company were enjoyable doing different work from crane operator to dirt operator was a little bit of a challenge but nothing that couldn't be overcome supervision on the new construction side was pretty weak versus the nuclear side
good,"Typical contract maintenance work. Work seven 12s, get layed off, move to next site. Benefits have steadily eroded over the years to nothing."
good,"Government Contracting company, that company was new to this kind of working environment but I understand things are better. The Logcap project is now over so things are changing fast to come out of Afghanistan"
good,Great place to learn. I learned tons about construction. Great place to develop and grow. Most enjoyable part of the job was working with the craft and learning from my colleagues.
good,"We work 12 hours - 7 days a week, with a 2 weeks break every 3 months.  The most enjoyable part of my job is that I am helping our military.  The hardest part is being so far away from home and working so many hours.  Management is ok for here, would not last in the states in jobs that I have worked in the past."
good,had a chance to learn a lot about different peoples and cultures. As for work environment typical day consisted of preventive maintenance and paper work reports to describe tasks performed or needed.
good,Very fast paced environment.  Critical time management skills required to complete the daily tasks.  My co-workers were very pleasant and patient when asked for assistance.  The hardest part of the day was that it ended quickly which didn't allow you to complete some tasks.  The most enjoyable time of the day was when you looked at the clock and found it was time to go home (allowing you to take a deep breath).
good,"instalaciones incómodas, pequeñas"
good,"Moral is low because Fluor Government Group is being sold. "
good,The work/life balance is heavy on the work.  It is not uncommon to work 60 - 65 hours per week as a salaried employee.  Management seems to favor and promote certain types of people over other types.
good,"Experienced bad management after the 2008 recession. Good management resigned and joined a competitor. Due to poor management, I couldn't stay any longer. Eventually, I also resigned."
good,"It was a good place to work when they had work, but management of the office from corporate was poor and the office was closed in a very competitive environment"
good,"I only recommend this place because the compensation is fair. If you are in the position that no one is gunning for, and your advancing doesn’t make anyone afraid for their position, you’ll do fine. Do not voice your complaints to anybody you befriend there, anything beyond “I’m so privileged to work in this wonderful company” will ring the warning bells. Feel your way up very carefully, advancement is possible, but if it is perceived as a threat to someone up, you are going down. Do not step out of line, read and keep a printed copy of company’s corporate culture and dress code. If you are a woman, head to toe coverage is recommended. Tattoos and piercings have to be covered at all times, conservative hairstyle and color is strongly recommended. If you were told something by HR or your department leader, follow to the letter. Be prepared for 12 hours work days, but they do have a cafe on the campus. You can do it, just tread carefully."
good,"Engineering Work is excellent. When it comes to policies, it's not totally ethical and transparent company. This may be due to local (Indian) management. Need improvement else could repeat Nokia story in EPC world."
good,"management was out of touch, only two of twenty that I saw be concerned and productive. a shame that America is oonly about the paycheck today. not the same company that they bought out years ago."
good,"This was a good job for what it was, security.  Didn't have to do much other than answer phones, sign in guest and accept mail.  The facilities are nice but there is no benefits to the job other than a pay check."
good,Lots of flexibility and opportunity to learn a number of things. Supportive of continuous education. Project could have been managed better in a number of ways.
good,"Nice company, upper management is weak at times. I particularly like not being micro managed. We have the freedom to make decisions with and for clients."
good,"In an effot to win the customers contract bonuses, unreasonable job requirements were constantly added without increased hours. Unable to provide quality work in time allowed. No job satisfaction, no professional pride, very disappointing job."
good,There is no transparency between departments I put in a lot of my time with this company and when work was slow they just lay you off rather than try to put you out in the field to stay employed.
good,"the job isn't that bad, the job is not planned very well and always a lot of rework do to poor management.  you get 3 breaks a day. 9am 12pm and 3 pm."
good,"This job was a great job until they decided to close the place down. I was responsible for cleaning restrooms, offices,and classrooms. I also took out the trash. Everyone was friendly and worked together. The hardest part of my job was having to leave because of the closure. The hours were great."
good,"Safety first , then quality and the production.  Communication was well. Didn't approve of the walk to the job site while other contractors has bus transportation."
good,The work was somewhat difficult because of the different testing on each medical tube. And they put it online so the pace was fast and you couldn't take the time to make sure the product was good. Was not the best place to work.
good,"spent most of our time trying to find what we needed to do the job. work was steady. management was very poor, new hire ins would get top position and not know how to do their job, over someone who has 5+ years experience."
good,"Not enough people to cover the work load.  Paid well but no real job security, never did know where you could be from month to month or if you would still have a job."
good,used to working lot of hours and like overtime. management is terrible but not sure if that was fluor or the other 4 companies we worked for..........
good,"Along with Great benefits came great coworkers, other than that, horrid management aswell as unorganized job direction. payed well with an overall low morale"
good,"Work is typically not level loaded.  It has two speeds: full steam and stop.  Advancement is based on who you know, not what you know. Multiple layers of management."
good,The amount of travel was horrendous.  You never felt secure in you job.  Most of the managers were inflexible and looking over you shoulder continuously.
good,"In 10 years at Fluor, I worked with some great people on some amazing projects.  However, the culture has changed recently -- consistent with other companies in the industry.  If you are willing to travel and keep a bag packed, you can make some decent money.  When the project winds down, it is every man for himself finding another one. The days of advancing and retiring from the same company seem to have left. Office environment is comparable to most.  To get ahead there you have to be a complete ""yes man"" and be selected into a ""high potential"" group that is afforded mentors to guide your career path."
good,"I worked with this company for 1 year and noticed that a lot of the management were given opportunity and advancement due to nepotism some of whom were not qualified or fit for the position they were in. I have heard countless stories and have witnessed first hand that supervision is treated much greater than craft employees, keep in mind that this experience comes from the Cedar Bayou job for the client Chevron Phillips."
good,The crew that I worked with could not have been a better group of guys. All members of our crew were team players and they always came to work with positive attitudes.
good,I did not enjoy working for Fluor. Hours were long and unproductive. Most in management had weak people skills. Wrong people put in charge. Safety was one of the better issues they felt with.
good,Fluor is an ok company. I can not say much about them as I have only been under them for less tan a year. They took over the management of this site in jan 2016 and I came under thier employ in april 2016
good,"Great job with plenty opportunities to acquire training and certifications. Many opportunities for advancement. Enjoyed working with different people, different cultures.  Thanks for the experience, will definitely work for this company again."
good,"At Fluor, you are given the opportunity to advance your professional career. You will have the chance to lead a project with the support of the senior members. There are a number of Company activities that promotes teamwork and collaboration. A company that invest on Safety. The only thing that is not good is that there is no security of job tenure."
good,Fluor is a fine place to work at.  The hours are flextime and the PTO payout is rollover and great.  Management is fine and they keep you involved in how things work there.  It is hit hard when the economy goes down but if you are there for the upward progression it is well worth it.
good,I have multiple skills and ability to perform. This aims at increasing production reducing down time in the plant. sharing knowledge is always a good opportunity to learn from one another.
good,I only worked Shut downs for this Company. Always had the tools and help I needed. would work there again if Jobs became available. People I worked with were awesome!
good,"A lot of overtime that you really need to work, due to no annual raise or anything, people making same amount of money they did 5 years ago."
good,NO way to advace without knowing people it isnt what you know its who you know or how pretty you are if your a female. They make up dumb rules to fire people there over managed and undermaned and the management to me has no clue what they are doing half the time.
good,It was a good experience working with solar panels am new technology.The job was a high productivity job we would as a team install solar panels on a daily basis on a 300 acre field.
good,"Very busy, very long hours for management. Good management team in place, but the downside is difficulty with the customer and Union workforce."
good,"Same as always, how to back feed the root, didn't like management liked my coworkers was going to work was getting another job"
good,It is a good company to work with but job security is unreliable. Lot of projects got closed due to low oil price. I like the competition in the department. The Refinery team is excellent in the process team.
good,The people in the Maintenance  / CUP departments are hard workers and very pleasant. A typical day consist of SOP / PM / SOW with the maintenance crew. The Hardest part of the job is working with the IBM managers. The most enjoyable part of the job is working directly with the Maintenance and CUP crews.
good,have PDA w/work assignments so always busy.Received backflow prevention testing licsense through company.Get along well with management.They are easy to talk to.Great staff to work with.12 hr shifts get long sometimes which cuts out on family time.The end of the shift.
good,Managed multiple projects for multiple clients. Corporate culture is dry and people are considered numbers.  Job security lacking and a lot of stress.
good,"A decent place to work, My manager was awsome, cant say the same about others, if only they would stop taking resources away from employees. there is many hours per week and work life balance is not that great."
good,Good company. Has good benefits. Good insurance. Particular job had a lot of hassels.
good,The only positive thing I can say is it tought me how different materials react together and showed me how to use many engineering machines/processes.
good,"A typical day would start by being escorted to a military camp, since the company took over my previous company, didn't really learn anything new, the mgmt was OK, but really loved my co-workers, the hardest part of my job was seeing a friend getting hurt at work, but overall, I've always enjoyed my work."
good,"Designing and Developing a website application using asp.net,c#.net and sqlserver 2005"
good,"Fluor has tremendous growth opportunity. A day includes interacting with the client and plenty of problem solving.  I have got to graduate from being a Department Tech to a Buyer. Mangagement is average, and Coworkers can be great. Hardest part of my job is dealing with problems. Most enjoyable is finally solving them and bringing a smile to my Clients face. "
good,"Although Fluor is one of the leaders in their industry and ranked highly amongst their peers according to ENR, that does not automatically make them a great place to work. Like any EPC firm, when they have numerous projects...career growth and compensation is good. When the economy is down, those things virtually go away. Not very good at long term planning for sustainability. Very poor work life balance to the point that some would say they expect you to prioritize them over family. Career development and training is virtually non-existent as well as mentoring. Co-workers are great but management is average at best. That being said, you will learn a lot about the Engineering & Construction industry working for them...they are one of the best at doing what they do."
good,"Mobile worker initiative means most people work from home and. Hire/Fire based on business needs. Prestigious company to work for in Greenville, SC but otherwise a very anonymous experience as a young professional. Good pay."
good,"I started with the JV Fluor SKM in 2008 at the Hub in Newman,it was at the start of the mechanical works and i stayed there on the construction then finishing off on the commissioning so was one of the last to leave this site, i then spent about a year on the wharf and material handling at Finucane Island in Hedland this then started to come to an end i was terminated there then went to Orange at the expansion in NSW of the Cadia gold mine"
good,I learned a lot about dealing with difficult clients.  I enjoyed the diverse and inclusive work culture and the opportunity to work overseas on large projects.
good,"Other jobs I've worked with them on other than KY have not been very pleasant experiences due to upper management, favoritism and how much butt you kissed."
good,"Good place to work but is you looking for more money a raise is not good but everybody is friendly, the job is easy flexible hours maneger they are good but top boss they not"
good,"I was in charged of the testing area for the aviation fuel, teached the new employees on how to perform all the job with no incidents. My shift was from 6 pm to 6 am."
good,To many chiefs and not enough Indians. The job was good. Company pays fairly decent and usually gives more hours than you want. Would work for them again.
good,"Projects that Fluor wins are state of the art and in that sense, you get to work with people from all around the globe.  Construction technology is one of its kind."
good,"It was a temporary position for 3 months contract, that ended at the end of 18 days for lack of funding.  I was paid hourly and 1.5 for time over 8 hours per day.  The work was for 12 hours a day for everyday of the week.  I was hired as Administrative Assistant but basically did data entry.  The most enjoyable part of being there was the camaraderie of the people in our group of Quality Assurance."
good,"get in parking lot by 4:30 am or walk 1/2 mile to badge in shack."
good,"Parking space which is a problem for other companies but not with Fluor.  "
good,I was employed as electrician helper but learned so many more skills while employed there. Most enjoyable part of the job was meeting people and learning things in different ways from them. Hardest part of the job was the driving distance from my home.
good,I had multiple responsibilities at the site. I was able to learn a lot  at this site. Sometimes the job required long hours. I was able to manage the crews and prioritize their work.
good,direct supervision was very good. my personal foreman were intelligent and cooperative and gave you the information required to perform the tasks given.
good,"Good company and well organized. Wages typical for industry. Management are generally good, yet lack of benefits for contract workers. Good professional journeymen on projects."
good,"a tyipcal kind of day work over there and "
good,Depends on what job you work for this company. There is a time where I say it is the best company I ever work with. Then it's a time when I say I won't work with them again.
good,Great place will come across lots of opportunity if you manage to last long and have good connections or lucky.Lacks to bring more project and need to focus on more than one industry t survive.
good,"the environment was in a war zone, however it was safe and work environment was clean and pleasant to work in. Management was pleasant, advancement was difficult. Hardest part was being away from family. co workers and peers made it enjoyable."
good,poor management lack of materials. really nice camp . flights out of the actual airport were good but not for the people out of calgary who didnt get the parking deal that the people of edmonton got.
good,All depends on management. Some of them aready all about themselves. They want you to be safe but will push you every chance they get. Meeting deadlines is key
good,"I supported the General Manager on various projects worked in Saudi, Korea, Spain and Dubai. I was responsible for official correspondence all day long. I also Coordinated with discipline leads for input in the preparation of weekly and monthly reports which I enjoyed the most. The hardest part of the job was time coordination between different countries. Management was very understanding. Workplace was ethical."
good,Horrible budgeting... caused for lay off's of 100+ employee's  Could have tried to keep more employee's on and working. Merger with four rivers lost a lot of people their jobs. No work scope lined out... what is wont work..
good,"Although Fluor Daniel is a world leader in Engineering sector but their office in India is so big ( 5 offices in Gurugram with more than 3000 employees ) that you feel like a small fish in a big pond which is of no value. Not my type of a company."
good,"Good company and manage their people well. Salary wise, not bad considering the economy. Benefits and employment package are reasonable. Treats it's people well regardless of race, religion, language, eduacation."
good,"Good company but benefits are lowest level of any Gov't contractor that I know of or have worked for in the past 10-12 years.  They have great training and safety plans, but they are a bit shallow and over-advertised as the best there is."
good,"large company, room for advancement if you are willing to travel and relocate.  good benefits and paid time off policies.  managers is usually located in other offices."
good,"I liked my co-workers but management was terrible they could never decide on what they wanted to do, safety couldn't agree on rules, and I never got my raise even though my foreman was telling them to give me one"
good,The site closed down.. had 20 mins to vacate job and collect your items. Health insurance was cut that night at 12:00 that night. Smdh i cant believe that..ive got a family..
good,Working with Fluor was okay. I believe that upper management could have been better. I thought that it was a lot of favoritism shown within the company. When they come to new sites they did not value pervious employers.
good,Fluor was fine to work for until the beginning of 2017. After that there was a lot of uncertainty. I don't think I would work for them again unless I really had to.
good,full time worked its hard and accurate i learned many things from it it give me many experience in logistics and for management in work i was working in a dangerous places that was hard things in my last job i was enjoy during i worked.
good,Lacking management presence has created unprofessional behaviors resulting in a less then favorable working environment. Accountability does not exist in the current management structure.
good,"Was a re-hire.  "
good,"Day are very busy"
good,"Typical day was about meeting unattainable deadlines."
good,Management not so great at this job site.... overall you can make decent money here. But they flooded the job with white hats that don't know how to do the job
good,"I have worked at VC Summer site for 3 years and it has changed companies 3 times. Fluor is a good company. I have enjoyed working here. Day starts at 5 am - 4pm or later. My personal management is wonderful, I have been under some managers that weren't professional. The hours away from my family is the hardest and the most enjoyable part would be my co workers"
good,"The company is a pretty good place to work and you do get to work with some awesome people.  Dedicated, hard working, loyal, etc...   The downfalls are that you also have some that don't care and management does not have the courage to weed them out.  Some departments become a place for ""lifers"".  Senior management is also ... challenged."
good,good place to work however salary they pay here is less as compare to working hours and work pressure as a production company.
good,"Promise you one shift then move you to another after a couple weeks. "
good,"poor salaries and very slow progress. There is always a glass ceiling."
good,Job is not secure. Working culture is not good. They paying good salary only. But every time u need to think about your job secure or not.
good,"I was a department of one so responsible for every aspect of HR.  Very busy especially during benefits open enrollment time.  Overall, good place to work."
good,"good working place to have experience in all fields."
good,Worked in the auction side.  Had the pleasure of learning different people all the time.  Learning to read personalities as to help them better.   Enjoyed the people and the environment.
good,"Overall good, the company allowed some flexibility around working hours, it was a great location."
good,Several projects were cancelled. My PDS access rights were received only one day before layoff notice.  I was able to model  only 3 control set /meter run combinations due to the pipe spec's not being loaded into the project(1.5 hrs. of PDS) Therefore I spent the last 4 days back checking  PID's / Line List and Tie-In List.
good,"Management needs to set the example for behaviors they demand such as:  accountability, integrity, strong work ethic.     It's a ""not what you know"", but ""who you know"" culture."
good,"I supplied any equipment or tools that the military needed to complete the mission. I worked and learned working with SARSS. A computer software that the military uses for ordering/purchasing supplies and equipment. "
good,"Checking on disposition of materials, progress of construction in the field."
good,"It's a very good experience working in big scale companies. Also, you need to accommodate to the system as a productive team member. On the other hand, the job security is very low at Fluor and it does not give you full concentration on your job during the time that you're working over there."
good,"Working in Afghanistan is different to say the least. A standard day is 6:30 AM - 7:00 PM with a 30 minute lunch in the middle. We work Monday through Friday and since we are eligible to take R&Rs roughly every 90 days there are no holidays or weekends off. Work can vary from pretty much anything plumbing related to sometimes requiring you to go outside of your trade to get the job done. I have personally spent multiple times pouring concrete and doing carpentry so that our job could finish on time or so that I may do the plumbing and finish that on time. This job also forces you to think outside the box since supplies are not always abundant or even available. Our sole purpose here is to support the War Fighter, whether that be the USA Military or other NATO Forces. This job can be extremely rewarding when you see first hand how you are helping the soldiers. You also get to meet people from all around the world. You must be a team player and you must be able to co exist with other cultures and religions at all times. Patience is a virtue here since your living conditions can range from bunk style tents with 120+ people in them to individual shipping containers. All bathrooms and showers are shared so the you see the people you work with day in and day out. Major disagreements and animosity is not an option and one of the biggest reasons for being sent home. Overall I truly enjoy the job but after 2 years I am ready to come home to my family and friends."
good,"aprendi a ser mas simpatica , ,jerentes otimos , otima convivencia entre amigos , todos trabalhos sao dificil"
good,I made lots of money to feed my family. Daily i would suit up in safety gear and inspect all equipment and tools before meeting with the engineers for job assignment. I learn to work on the high voltages due to the power plant job location. The hard part of the job was waiting for the engineers to come up with critical decisions relating to completing assignment before schedule is affected. Learning was the most enjoyable part of this job; my older co-workers always had new tricks for new situations
good,"When I was Hired as part of the Company to work in Jeddah KSA, I expected to learn more from the company and expanded my knowledge and experiences especially that I was working with the most popular American company. I learned to deal with patience and understanding with different people coming from different environment and culture in a foreign land. I did stand with my own feet which is the hardest part of the job making and implementing firm decisions as the Company's representative to the contractors in order to make the project a success. I enjoyed the Quality Assurance and control ( Health and Safety,housekeeping and etc)in implementing the project worth 330 million Saudi riyal."
good,"People are cooperative and helpful. Stressful due to limited resources and very tight schedule. Due to management's cost cutting initiatives, personnel collaboration and engagement were limited."
good,"Good experience working there and had a few different roles and learned a lot there through their internal courses and opportunities. Being in the energy sector, they are dependant on the market and therefore the career can be limiting. Good company to work for and I would certainly go back if the opportunity arose."
good,Fluor is a good company to work for providing you don't want to have a life outside of work. The wages are very good and every cent is earned. There are some very good managers and some that are not so great. Every day is different and time goes by quickly. I learnt to watch my back as the culture is that of dog eat dog. At times managers can be micro managers. The most enjoyable part of the job is when pay day arrives.
good,"Fluor was not a bad company or a bad job, but culturally, things need to be different in my opinion. Coming from a company that prides itself in being a ""Forbes top 100 company to work for"", it's difficult to then work in an environment where it felt like that was not the case. I think there are tons of smart, talented and likable people at Fluor, but culture has to start from the top and be displayed down. If more great leaders were in on the project, then they would retain and attract more talent."
good,good work place. the general foreman's they choose could know more than the workers that would help. I wouldn't mind going back to work just not the clayton job.
good,"Our healthcare  sick you don't get as much for the large deductible  you pay. I'll like if  our healthcare "
good,"Management could do better at understanding procedures, work packages and our union contract. Employees and management should work better together for better morale."
good,Overall  management was terrible with dozens of people not getting paid in full or at all for extended periods of time with little sympathy for their situation. There was a lack of tools and material to do the job properly.
good,"Flip flop work schdule "
good,"Supervisor was very hard to work. Pay was horrible, not easy to advance if your good where you are. As a Supervisor it was really hard to keep employees because my Supervisor was very demeaning and would publicly humiliate someone."
good,"Pay is good, but job security is very difficult"
good,"When there is work, the work is good.  When there is no work, you get laid off.  They have taken away many of the benefits over the years.  There is no longer a pension."
good,Executed projects at a very high level of project out come surety by identifying key project success drivers early and establishing management plans to mitigate risk items.  Globally the market for EPC services has changed and management is working to address those changes.
good,"I have been here for over 5 years. I was hired in at a low level with promises of growth opportunities. I have done as much as I can on a personal level to gain knowledge and skills. I receive constant recognition, but not in the form of a raise or promotion. I have been told to be patient; however, after almost 6 years, my patience is gone."
good,"get in parking lot by 4:30 am or walk 1/2 mile to badge in shack."
good,Good company lots of good people to learn from. You can go real far they have lots of programs to help better their people and lots of good benefits too.
good,"The company during the current administration has lost its edge and focus to do what it was established to do.  Engineer and build projects.  Sales is not performing, seems to be a protected group even when they don't bring in work."
good,"Work atmosphere regimented. Too many ""bosses and not enough Indians"" Too many staff hire and when the expected work did not come to company the started lay off in waste numbers. OK company to work with international reputation. Lot depends you immediate boss. Over all good benefits but not much job security. Work atmosphere same professional."
good,Flour was my first job out of college. It was a great intro into corporate america but not someone where I saw myself growing. the people were nice...
good,Foreman’s throw you under the bus but overall good experience for young people I️t was good pay I️ had excellent Traning from my journeyman which was good learned a lot
good,"As pessoas são boas para trabalhar, tem flexibilidade de horário, o ambiente é bonito, limpo e agradável."
good,"Extremely challenging, fast pace, Multitask environment. Fulfillment helping peers solving situation. Atmosphere is favorable, excellent peers and upper level management. Meeting deadline and managing other sector for the organization to meet timeline is challenging, on the other hand self-gratifying when goal accomplished."
good,"Fluor is a well respected company that has a well deserved excellent reputation for executing mega projects and producing high quality facilities. This creates an environment of high competency and high expectations. Pressure to execute is ever present and the culture is set top ""get it done"" with the expectation of getting it done right. Training is important to Fluor but time is a constraint on effective training. Overall Fluor meets my expectation of work at an EPC company with the associated pressures and expectations."
good,Flour needs to respect their workers mores and get away from their buddy system when you have good peoples working for you give them the same respect you want   In construction you have many workers that could assist managers with a a solutions but can't get the chance
good,Fluor is a great outlet to break into industrial work in the refineries. Also you meet alot of people from different walks of life with all types of skills.
good,they didn't have a clear path or direction for completion. You always felt like they were in disarray.  they couldnt choose a plan and stick to it. It created an environment of chaos
good,"They don’t pay as much as people think they do. My salary is not even a fourth of the lowest salary of a labor employee in the US which is 23k USD. I have been here for a while now and gotten increases, but at this rate, it will take several years to reach the level of the lowest-paid job in their US offices, which is about the rate of a manager here. Good place to start but not really to stay. There is also a much apparent sense of entitlement with the day shift. Night shift gets more work than us."
good,I have been at plant voglte for 3 years and have had the pleasure of working for several companies. Overall it has been a very enjoyable place to work.
good,Company is a good company to work for.  Wages are fair.  Worked in safe manner. Co-workers and contractors were friendly. I was able to perform my duties in a safe manner .
good,The health insurance is terrible (united health care) but the TOWP (time off with pay) is nice. You can accrual up to one year of time off with pay over the course of working at Fluor.
good,"Everyone is in a hurry to get things done, but they are not in a hurry to do their part to make sure you get what you need to get it done.  Typically you are 3 levels removed from the customers you are actually doing the work for."
good,"Upper management did not do their jobs right. They passed everything down to lower management to scramble around and work harder than they should have too just to complete jobs.Eventually it caught up to them and Eastman booted them out the gate. They faked their safety record, the hours worked, and budget. They were charging for stuff that they never even did, or it actually took half the time to do. I hope some of their upper management lost their jobs over these things."
good,"Fluor is not a fun place to work, to much political, micro manage, favoritism. I guess it is everywhere now, there is no such place that when you have the job, that you think you will retire with that company"
good,"I disagree with Union vs Non Union."
good,"sacar documentos  como chorizos, bajo nivel en gral de conocimiento."
good,Attending as safety meeting upon beginning the work for the day. I learned about different trades by assisting other crafts complete their job. Management always seemed to change. W were assigned to a crew and we had to learn how to get along and work together as a team. Language barriers was difficult to overcome but not impossible. Always something different in each days tasks.
good,"Communication and organization was terrible throughout the entire job site. As a result, the number of incidents, injuries, and recordables steadily increased."
good,"a big normal work place, nothing too much fun, if you really want to enjoy a passionate fun work place, avoid this one."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was working beside the military."
good,"I've got to say I enjoyed working for Flour I learned alot and advanced quickly due primarily to my foreman, awesome man, however my dedication, strong attendance, obedience of rules, and willingness to work went unrecognized by upper management, their priorities fell on keeping friends and family employed and not the skilled tradesmen."
good,"You are exposed to of the best engineers in the world, but they all ""belongs"" to a niche group and if you do not ""belong"" to a home-office you will not find a follow-up assignment. The size of the organization is very lump and you'll find a Project Director on site may only be a Project Engineer at the home-office."
good,"Deadlines, pressure, etc. mostly generated by client(s)."
good,"loved the pay but the work load was a lot,go to school full time now so am currently looking for a lighter work load.worked almost 80 hours a week love the hands on nature of the job acquired all my tools while working there learned a lot from my foreman about how to fabricate and place process pipe on coordinated with isometric drawings"
good,"Work day were long and repetitive, averaging 10 to 12 hours a day."
good,"A typical day at work is to hand out all badges to new hires. Then take care of anyone who is late with a late arrival pass. Be sure to put in order by crew number. Obtain all early out slips from anyone leaving early. Be sure everyone is able to badge in or out. Be sure all passes are collected to enter time correctly for payroll. My coworker and I work as team getting everyone in and out the plant. As well as days needing to be off due to doctor appts, etc. The most enjoyable part of the day is collecting passes and staying busy by inputting correct information for payroll."
good,"12 hour days 7 days a week makes an 84 hour work week. What I learned that working in all conditions of weather in RC North, Afghanistan is very difficult. Many of the local nationals are very respectful and would love to have what we have here in the United States. The hardest part of the job is the heat and the cold and overwhelming number of generators needing to be repaired or serviced. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to knowing  many of the the local nationals of Afghanistan and knowing their culture. They will work harder than anyone for 7 dollars a day and never complain. The management and co workers can use some work but overall all is well."
good,"Leukste baan ooit met veel leuke collega's, onderscheiding na 5 dienstjaren en een tweede na 10 jaar dienst en ook kerstbonussen en diners en vervolgens nieuwjaars recepties."
good,"Average 10 hours a day, Fluor coworkers were great people and were good hands at what they did. Working for the Client was a test every day."
good,"Fluor is  overall a decent place to work. The people are great, the work is interesting, always something to learn, competitive pay, and there are lots of opportunities to work abroad (or so it seemed). Your experience may vary on the projects you work on, and your manager. Overall a good experience. "
good,Did not enjoy working here.  Training and support provided for new software they have moved on to is inadequate unlike it was years ago.
good,FLUOR Government Group (FGG) has provided a wonderful opportunity to provide basic life support and retrograde support to US military members throughout Afghanistan.
good,"You start out good line the crew out get up other foreman in craft and see what they have planned and need help on, some of the upper management are down to earth other are not so down to earth, some general foreman are in the wrong place and the hardest part of the Job was putting up a general foreman that really didnt know anything or have common sense he nervous at all times, the co-worker were cool easy to get along with which was a good thing, the most part was the end of the day."
good,Very challenging work in a hard environment.  Contracted to Rio Tinto to maintain the rail network.
good,I think there were fair with R&R but could have explained in more detail that your flight would have to come out of your own pocket which made your total yearly salary be less than what they offered
good,"- Sit in a grey box 9-11 hours a day.  Like movie 'Office Space'"
good,"Es buena empresa en términos globales."
good,"A typical day at work stated from 8 AM to 5:45 PM."
good,"Great place to learn and enhance knowledge"
good,"The Dublin office focuses on EPCM for Metals and Mining projects. The team members are passionate in their positions and work well together. Because of the industry, though, the metals and mining office is not guaranteed to have steady, long-term work."
good,"Aprendi hacer montaje de estructura q no fue tan facil, pero con esfuerzo lo logre.. Aparte ya soy operador de plataforma telescopica que no es poca cosa.."
good,"it was fun water clean up smoke clean upmeeting people,helping them these are homes that go up in smoke"
good,middle management sucked
good,Working conditions were fair sometimes great. Worked with some great knowledgable guys. Layoffs were quick and random so keep your hood down and production up.
good,"Pay was great, long hours, worked in the eliments all the time, alot of walking, the job was temp.  To much upper management that was getting highly paid to walk around ."
good,"Fluor's client base has become risk-averse and requiring commercial terms in their contracts that places this company in a high risk model execution.  Fluor does not have the applicable experience execution high risk projects which has made the work very difficult for them to manage.  As a result, the performance on large high risk projects have kept the company from achieving their quarterly profit forecasts and producing negative earnings in specific project sectors.  This kind of activity has made it difficult for this company to maintain a work force that is productive, thus causing the reduction of staff that has been trained to execute projects securely for the future.  This has also caused its resources to work in environments that are not happy with working for this company as it was once known for providing.  People are working scared, and need better mentoring to continue producing profitable outcomes."
good,Good company with benefits good hours good pay always have work we need it has the answers when you ask questions good rate and locations are always good
good,"i know all the people, how they work, what they expect I like the campus, the hours and the equipment. Nice job stations good communications, I enjoyed the versitility"
good,"The best part about this employer has been the hours flexibility.  If I need time off, I just ask, and my supervisors make it happen.  In exchange, there is not much in the way of paid time off, and and no paid sick time is offered.  The healthcare benefit is affordable if you have a family.  There are no bonuses or regular raises."
good,"Fluor,"
good,"Positive experience with Fluor senior management and their efforts to help provide employees with necessary resources to address client needs. Although Fluor achieved high customer satisfaction with client, they were not successful low bidder in revised bid."
good,Working for Fluor is very challenging it's very hot very demanding very stressful. The pay is good. You must stay very well hydrated and keep cool at all times over the outside element will affect you
good,"a lot of work outside craft, fast pace, a lot of rigging, have to be willing to help in all areas as needed, good working environment, a lot of climbing"
good,"Overall, most people were easy to get along with, however a few long-term employees may have been threatened by new people or ideas.  Great working location."
good,"There is tons of work when there is a large project that involves Engineering, Procurement, Fabrication and Construction. Good company to learn from and advance your career but the work is all dependant on the economic health of the energy market."
good,"This company is project work which means your job security is dependent on the project. It is extremely difficult to advance within your department, requiring departmental moves to grow. Yearly pay increases are not guaranteed and when given they may be 3% or less. Nepotism is a large issue here. The coworkers are ther bright spot, they are awsesome! Despite problems, still an ok job."
good,"Fluor offers various opportunities for those who are willing to get out of their comfort zones. However, it's all about who, not what, you know.  If you don't know the right people, getting those opportunities can be tough."
good,Alot of good people to work with from all over the US on one site. Learned about the processes of industrial construction. Job was never the same from day to day.
good,"The job was fast paced but also fun."
good,worked with these people on numerous occasions pretty much the sams old same old I would not recommend it for the sensitive type person as they pretty much talk to you any old -until you put your foot down
good,"Job paid well and gave good hours, but was overcrowded and sometimes felt micromanaged. Dealt with safety issues over the course of the job that were ultimately resolved as well."
good,Management is political. Welcome to corporate america. It can pay well - if you're related to someone above you. Layoffs are common. It's all about the money for both employees and management.
good,The people are good to work with and everyone gets along well. With many different contractors onsite it can get busy but there is good communication between the groups.
good,"I really enjoyed working with the guys that I worked with. It was a very diverse group of guys. I learned alot from the guys that I worked with,while at the same time I feel that I also taught them some."
good,The job was ok but the work environment was a bit tense due to manning issues and a mass job reduction. The job was very beneficial to the career field i just left from the military
good,"It was a good job and the work load was a little over the prescribed work load for the job title/description.  Work culture is ok, nothing real challenging there.  All offices are cubes smaller and shorter than normal."
good,I would definately work for them again. Very good competitive pay rates for all of the skilled craft workers. Very organized and professional environment to work. I wohld definitely work for this company again.
good,"Upper management at my location needs work. Says a lot about making changes to improve the employee's quality of life through appreciation, benefits, etc. Fails to follow through consistently."
good,"Management do not give value to new joinee even if after 5 years, there is nepotism presents in Fluor New Delhi office. Fluor New Delhi office work on work share from other lead offices and it degrades one's self confidences and looses on technical knowledges."
good,I worked on a construction job site in the warehouse and the job was completed while I worked there.  I had a good supervisor and the working conditions were good.
good,Good place and people to work with. Very safety minded which was good and looked after their employees. Hardest part of the job was having to deal with all the OSHA requirements.
good,plan work of the day. management was ok but not the best there was not good communication with craft. for me the hardest was that we had to walk a mile in and mile out every day to the parking area.
good,"Resourceful for learning career experience"
good,"Fluor eliminated most training opportunities many years ago. As with most companies, you can do online self-paced courses. I never saw any amount of online, self-paced training do anything to help an employee advance in the company."
good,"Had management not felt the need to come out and interfere with work ever 4 hours, it would have been better. Nothing like being bird dogged by white hats."
good,"Fast pace environment, Need to improve a way to advance to another position long hours, short breaks. Long walks to your work areas and the best part of the is working safety."
good,"Don't know anything about Fluor at the present moment but when I did work for them it was a good atmosphere, good management, good people and if I needed a job in Construction I wouldn't be afraid to apply."
good,"Not easy but not impossible to progress within the company."
good,This company main priority is safety which is great. The hardest part is the night shift because I am not used to working nights. The pay is decent as well.
good,"The first few years were exciting because the business was booming, the last few years were terrible because of the layoffs. During my time at Fluor I was a core group supervisor for  29 indexers/abstractors on over 30 projects. This entailed insuring staffing on the project and the quality of the indexing. The second half of my time at Fluor was devoted to consolidating three different libraries into a single functioning corporate wide operation. Then I had to layoff everyone."
good,"Big company. Mixed reviews. Provided an honest living for my family for years with fluor.,.bad food good food mood set wreck met dog fleas cat pees winter wonder land wonder woman wonder bread bed spread cheese bread yada yada yada yada"
good,"as a welder for the company, the time at work is very free willing and very easy, however, the money aspect is very low. I would recommend this job to the inexperienced."
good,Benefits were not as good as with CB&I.  Worked same hours as CB&I. Supervision was not as qualified and didn't agree with some of the procedures we instituted
good,Fluor Offshore went from over 6000 employees in Houston to around 1200 when i was laid off in 1985.  They then went down to around 300.  They were once a major offshore engineering company and are now insigbificant.
good,"While my direct manager is great, supportive, provides me flexibility to do my job, and values and respects my input and efforts, it is easy to be buried in the political nature of the company. The annual review process is not effective and leaves one feeling lost in the thought that there is no clear direction for advancement."
good,Safe place to work great safety meeting every day just b safety sheets and much more safety things tie off at 4ft or higher good place to work for them
good,I worked for sub contractor in Idaho at the INL.  The INL culture doesn't fair well to supervisors its difficult to main a professional atmosphere when  you dont feel safe talking with your own boss that it wont be used against you. a 4x10 schedule is great paid weekly is awesome and the helathcare benefits are amazing but your mental health at work may suffer
good,"we installed pipe in live areas, even though it was hot and sometimes dirty it was enjoyable. A lot of good people to work with. We worked in a safe environment and look out for one another."
good,"Working at Fluor proved to be quite productive. The work environment fostered excellent work/life balance, fair compensation/ benefits, and pretty decent job security."
good,"Typical day at work, what I have learned, management, workplace culture, the hardest part of the job, the most enjoyable part of the job, reorganization,"
good,"It is a great company to work for, you can advance. The company will guide you in the right direction for success. They love great leaders and positive attiude."
good,"1.  Fast paced, results oriented"
good,"Hit the road running most work days."
good,Good company with a great many dedicated people  It was a relaxed and open working environment. Company had a number of benefits that were probably ahead of their time.
good,Fluor was the first powerhouse EPC that went heavy on the worksharing.  They send as much work overseas as possible and keep only  few core persons.  This is a heavy loaded company with management.  Fluor chases the big projects and will hire thousands when oil is booming.  In turn they will lay off thousands when it's going. Fluor has the sharpest spike in hiring and laying off.   The employee is clearly not their greatest asset.
good,Upper management could be better . Job was fast paced . Moral was low at times . Did learn new things . Almost all jobs nowadays will be like this because of lack of experienced people on the job site .
good,I left due to a warn letter that was received informing us that there was going to be a lay off of half the workforce and I was on the lower end of the seniority pole.
good,-Fluor its a good place to start up
good,"Keeping time and files current"
good,Working with the company has given me incredible opportunities to grow through exposure to differing processes and operations. They have also placed me with mentors and managers over the years that provided a favorable environment for growth and learning as well as the nurture the desire to learn.
good,Well organized bunch of management I knew exactly what we had to do and every morning give us a meeting telling us what to do there's no question management was good
good,"Great pay, great benefit packages. Paid vacation, cares abkut the workers. No complaints with this company. Always remained flexible. Due to work location"
good,LHC-9 was very unorganized at times with a lot of upper management movement. Lack of stability at the top will only help to increase employee turnover.
good,typically i love welding for every company but unfortunately the quality control reps and management was mess with the blueprints. the pay was top pay.
good,it is what it is. I do not agree with these as everyone will have their own experiences and reasons they has the experience that they had. Some will be great and some will not
good,Fluor has many different disciplines within the company and offers employees lots of areas to improve and grow their skills. The company provides training and challenges their employees to continue to learn and seek interest in the companies business strategies as one team and one Fluor.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was learning and helping someone new. The environment was the very Hazardous, with high heat humidity. The hardest was getting adjusted to the climate."
good,"I hired in as a pipe welder. I worked there over 8 months and was never given the chance to weld pipe. Many welders hired in after me were given pipe welding assignments. I was given an assignment of  what they deferred to as ""construction aid"" welds that the QC would  never examined.The pay was excellent! But the management was pitiful. Not all Fluor jobs were like this, only this location. Most Fluor  jobs are strict with management try to get the work done in a fair manner."
good,"Fine good ok not bad normal.  Decent place to work.  Decent work environment, but small cubicles.  Starbucks on site.  Sometimes there are food trucks."
good,Great people with a lot of knowledge. I learned a lot in my time spent on the job. The job had a average safety record. Somethings management could’ve done better with
good,Working at Fluor is challenging due to the company being mostly contract/project type of work.  This type of work generally secures employment for 1 to 2 years.
good,The project assignments were of a duration that allowed employees to become familiar and efficient in their roles and responsibilities. The lends itself to personal job satisfaction.
good,"great place to work In a friendly environment. "
good,"mab building nice place to work, good environment to work, safety is first, people with knowledge about the job, good supervisor and foreman and good welders"
good,"Typical Day at Work- Early morning start, Interaction with team members, performing activities as per WORK PLAN."
good,"I believe that Fluor is a great company to work for. However, Plant Vogtle has not been the best first experience. I don't believe it is Fluor's fault."
good,New Contractor trying to implement new policies to quickly.  Existing client had previous contractor that complied with clients policies accordingly. Was relieved from duty.
good,"Each day always had an ever changing job assignments.  "
good,it can be messy at times but mostly i enjoyed working there until they just let everyone go without any type of notice i didnt even see it coming no time soon
good,"Lots of walking"
good,"I met a lot of nice people there, fun environment, they have a nearby restaurants to go eat and free parking and very casual dress environment. The work schedule were flexible."
good,Okay job not to bad at all needs more safety at the job but over all managers are okay. I was laid off due to regular lay offs. I don't think I would go back though.
good,Good Company worked 12 hours daily no time off good team most of the time . The pay could have been better for the job that was being done action time was good
good,I was hired on this job only for a short period to help complete the job. I helped solve some of the problems. It was completed according to Specs. 100% satisfied.
good,"safe work areas, good benefits, if you are a foreman and were put back on your tools, your pay did not change. great 401 k. no paid vacation or holidays."
good,"The work is interesting and challenging.  The pay is very good, and regular.  Travel to new places and seeing new things is a plus.  Very long hours, and longer than what was conveyed.  Multiple sites stated it would 50 hour work weeks, but reality was often 60 to 80 hour per week.  Very little time off, and bad planning can lead to 40 to 60 days with no time off, no holidays off."
good,"ambiente relajado, compañerismo, positivismo... excelente trato."
good,"It is feast on famine at Fluor, when business is good - you are good, when projects dry up time to hit the door and everyone around you knows it.  Awesome opportunities along the way"
good,"I have heard good things from employees who have been with the company for longer than myself.  My experience is probably situational, but my experience has only been mediocre.  Not-so-good choices of insurance,  treated like contract employee but without the pay and no per diem offered to me."
good,"I can't believe I have to fill this ""your review"" out.  What a waste of time.  Soon this company won't be in Rochester so you won't have to worry about it."
good,"Support the mailroom"
good,Terriable company. Didny pay pepple what yhey are worth. I was responsible for telling fitters if they were equipped to be a journeyman but I got paid less than one.
good,Not a bad place to work. Money's good and pays well but management needs to be improved and they know this but they seems to not want to fix the issues
good,"Work place culture is fun and challenging .Managements not look out for employees benefits but just ."
good,"Fluor is a job that has a variety of people working there, i would see new faces everyday. you would work 10 hours a day and they are strict about tardies and getting days off so if your going to miss you won't last long. they pay is really good and for the most part people are okay. some people that work there act like they are over you when they are just another worker."
good,didn't like being in confined spaces but its a good paying job it was something to experience wasn't really out there long cause it was a turnaround
good,"good job, good pay, good hours, everything about it is pretty good."
good,"Fluor office is conveniently close to my home, a great place to work.  It is not a technology licensor, the projects involved mostly of off site and utilities.  For Process Engineering, skill development is mostly limited to fluid hydraulics, PFDs and P&IDs. I find that you can gain much more process experience in terms of separation, mass and heat transfer, basic engineering process tworking in a technology based company."
good,The upper management of the plant did a great job. I was able to learn a good deal from how to work the programs how to work with vendors how to organize the shipment of the supplies etc.  I really enjoyed the job.  I was able to learn a good deal about welding.  We had a small crew who worked well together.  The General Manager taught me alot.
good,"Culture that I like most in Fluor are flexible time & work life balance. "
good,Fluor Corp. was a professional company that gave all resources needed to fulfill the work as assigned. The management was attentive to details and directly participated in the job as needed.
good,But overall a good company to work for. Learned a lot at this company. Would like to work with them again. Good pay wages. Hard to hire on with for some reason  just like every other companies.
good,A typical day at work would be working from home or in the office. A flexible role at adjusted as I needed it to. I learned about the engineering environment and its peaks and troughs. And I gained specialist skills in my area as I had close relationships with my external providers. Management was there if I needed a question answered. My co-workers were brilliant however due to the declining environment of the sector one by one were made redundant. The hardest part of my job was dealing with time differences all around the world. And the most enjoyable part was running my own HR function and reporting to Management on my successes.
good,Fluor's current most talked about job site here in Jenkinsville is a must work for those seeking to do their job and get compensated extremely well for doing their job; until someone in upper management who has no rhyme of reason being in that position tells you that's not how it works.
good,"Chicago Bridge & Iron, Westinghouse and Fluor are all okay company to work for. Really big project lost of thing going on lots of things to learn good experience."
good,The job is not hard it is just another labor job. If u do what they ask and work hard and show up on time and when scheduled to work u will move up quick and be rewarded.
good,"Used to love working out at sea shame the job finished and was signed over to sse election, "
good,"Lots of oportunity if your willing to try new things in different places.  Job security is based on price of oil per barrel in my opinion.  Fluor is in the process of diversifying, but is sending intellectual property based jobs to other countries to same money."
good,"Did all on site training and orientation, lead all safety meetings and stand downs. Implement safety standards as per company and owners requirements, reported and investigated all incidents on site."
good,"The environment was good you will learn to become independent. A bit stressful since we have deadline that needs to meet ( like any other jobs). But there is no Job security since this is project based."
good,Fun and challenging job everyday. Great when I can help employees to learn about the business and the products we make on a day to day basis.
good,"I enjoyed my internship at Fluor.  My co-workers were very knowledgeable and helpful.  I learned a lot in my short 3 months with that company.  In the end, I just decided it was not the field that I wanted to go into with my degree."
good,"Non-stop work days, always have something to keep myself busy with or have new things to learn. Deadlines are a huge factor in any payroll sort of department, as well as accuracy of the payroll."
good,This company has helped me grow in my field by providing me with piping leads and co-workers that are easy to work with and enjoyable to be around.
good,mechanical knowledge and pm processes. great co workers. very indecisive management. strong desire to complete project.
good,Generalmente los ambientes por los que transito en su mayoria son de cordialidad y camaraderia
good,Not necessary at this point. Ask me if you are interested in my skills and experience. Thank You Come Again Don't ask again
good,"Work/Life balance is good.  Flex time and 9/80 work schedule offers good flexibility.  Upper Management performance is less than acceptable, but that is common many places.  Work life makes up for that with some of the extremely bright and knowledgeable 'lower' level employees.  The company is in a deep transition phase right now as many of the employees have been in the business for years and years and are retiring out.  Overall I have benefited from my time at the company.  I have learned quite a lot about overall project management and development."
good,This was a good opportunity to break into the QA position and was able to help me gain the basics of being a QA. The pay being low is the main draw back.
good,A typical day consists of working with big valves. I learned to assemble parts together. The hardest part of the job is to have a full understanding of the blueprints.
good,worked at fluor for a few months welding fitting cutting bag houses presipps etc the company finished up and moved to north carolina an i stayed in txs
good,"Unfortunately due to the project being almost complete, I was laid off. For the time I was there, I worked with a lot great people and was able to improve my skills and learn new skills."
good,There was a lot of tasks to new projects that were challenging and exciting. But this is expected of a big company. Supportive management.
good,This was a fun company to be a part of. There was always an interesting project going on and a team atmosphere. This was also a good place for someone in the accounting profession to make a start.
good,Most enjoyable part of my job is I am able to work on my own without supervision.  I know what my responsibilities are and I get them done.
good,"they do not like being part of a Union, they find some of the most stupid reasons to fire someone because they might be high up Union status"
good,I enjoyed my coworkers and foreman but the upper management didn't show that much concern for their employers. They didn't give out prizes or show the appreciation for the hard work people produced. I felt separation towards the end of my term there
good,"Learned better leadership skills"
good,"Its an FMCG company, I worked as a ERP executive in that company."
good,Fluor is a great place to spend some time at during your career.  You will work hard and have a lot asked of you and be paid well for it.
good,"Day begins with a change over meeting. To make you aware of the building status. Perform an equipment walk thru, and take readings. create work orders for any issues that need to be corrected. Look at work order load for the month and determine what needs to be done. monitor any vendors in the building making repairs. Document all repairs in the work order system. Respond to all alarms within 5 mins. even if it requires you to remove the vendors from the area. "
good,"would like to stay with company,dont take just anyone word ,always use your best judgement,always go to job location and communicate with craft personal"
good,the only way youll get a job here if youre related to someone. they play favorites. once I got in it was ok at first. never had the right material
good,"Good pay, weekly pay, great workers. Work day starts at 7am, strict lunch hours and end of day rush out the gates cutting into personal time, at least an hour."
good,"As a Pipe Foreman overseeing fitters, welders,& helpers we had to be ready to work on what ever Fluor needed us to build to help support their work on DOW'S PDH Oyster Creek Project in Freeport 'Texas . My crew constructed over 2400 Bernecker Modular supports . Built pipe spools from 2"" up to 24"" carbon and stainless pipe spools."
good,I work with Great people at the Big Cajun II Plant site.  I am looking for permanent job with great benefits long term. I enjoy my work and the people I work with.  I have learned a lot of new and exciting things my time here.  I have learned to implement and train other employees on new systems.
good,"I loved working there, great people, and great balance of work in office and in the field verifying information! Would love to go back, if it were not for the cutbacks at that refinery! Hopefully that will change!"
good,They have been around for a long time and are part of the oil industry boom and bust cycle.  They have a large work force that works on project work.
good,Rewarding knowing that I was able to continue serving my country by assisting soldiers on the battle field. Being able to relate in so many different ways to customers made the job easier.
good,I would come in every morning and start balancing timesheets to get them entered into our FETS system.  The FETS system then uploaded all the craft hours in to Maximo and Payroll.  The hardest part of the job was having to work a lot of hours in a day and not seeing my family as much as I would like.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the love I had working with my site superintendent and all the craft workers.  I really miss working with them.
good,"On a typical day was pretty easy for the most part. Pulled a lot of wire, worked in the tool room so I got a pretty good understanding of tools and materials that were needed for the job. I would have to say the hardest part of the job was the weather conditions. The job location was right on the river so during the winter it got pretty cold."
good,My work was very interesting. The co-workers were nice to work with most of the time. The work was delivered on time as per demand. The management was approachable when needed.
good,Fluor has good steady work...but management can be a little difficult to work with.  Had a complaint which I took to H/R and was told by the woman in H/R that she had worked other projects with the Supervisor I was having a problem with and that she had never heard of him acting like that. 5 employees verified my complaint and it never went anywhere.
good,"Typically, reporting is the first priority of the day and then move on to payroll. Reporting must be available at a specific time, payroll also must be done in a timely manner. I enjoy helping craft and salary find answers to questions on benefits, payroll questions, etc."
good,"Fluor is a company which provides services of construction, engineering, procurement worldwide."
good,cook prep food order food run store train wash dishes run cashregister
good,"a Typical workday is Completing Pm,s ,Trouble shooting .Replacing outside lights"
good,Good company to be apart of with decent pay.  Terrible bases throughout Afghanistan.
good,"The company was a good place to work, just was not any chance for me to move up in the company."
good,Fluor has really good work procedures and perfect network.
good,"day begins preplanned with the expectation of emergency situations because they always arise, and when that happens you must be able to recognize and set priorities accordingly."
good,"When you work for a company that has absolutely NO women or even men of color in the top tier of management, expect that if you are one of the above, you will be passed over as if you don't exist.  It's true that there are many excellent engineers who are ""white males"" also being passed over, but when someone with excellent credentials is not even considered to be trained to move up to replace the many over-70 white men working there, in favor of some youngster who is handsome, white, and a real yes-man, it's time to find a job somewhere else.  Nothing they give lip service to, like their  GROW program for women engineers, will make any difference."
good,Not a bad company if you know somebody. they have large projects that can keep you busy for long period of time.
good,"My day consists of hydro test package review for release before testing to ensure all documentation is correct, (NDE, specification and code requirements). Post review following reinstatement is also required."
good,"Fluor Australia has over the years suffered with a lack of work, resulting in the redundancies of valuable personnel"
good,"I usually work at power plants, chemical plants, etc. I have learned a lot about building solar fields out in AZ. Like how to run stringers from the solar panels to the combiner boxes. A typical work day started with an STA meeting(Safety Task Analysis) or safety meeting. We would talk about the hazards and how to prevent them. Everyone on the crew had to sign in at the beginning of every shift and sign out at the end of every shift. I believe management was lacking due to experience. The worst part about the job was the heat. But they found was to keep us from overheating. The company provided Swamp coolers (Fans) and unlimited amount of water. My co-workers were great to work with, they seem to make the day go by a lot faster with mainly humor."
good,a 8 or 12hr everyday. always learning somthing new everyday. they went threw big boss men alot.  all my co-workers wouldn't pull there  on weight. the hardest thing about the job was doing others job cause the boss wouldn't say anything to them. working by myself.
good,Fue un proyecto interesante en el cual se pudo aprender bastante pero lo aprendido no fue valorado
good,"Decent place to work and plenty of hours plus overtime pay. The shifts can be long and tiresome ,but that is typical for this type of work."
good,"Afghanistan, war time environment, providing supervision to electricians. Planning and scheduling work. "
good,A person can easily manage professional and personal life in this company..
good,"Typically, I receive document requests to write, revise, and process procedures, plans, policies, guides, specifications, and standards."
good,Progressive company which provides many opportunities for emerging Engineers
good,"Provide for planning, using the JCS work management system. Scheduling and measurement of work based on program plans, production forecasts, long and short range plans."

good,"Good Place To Work, good people to work with"
good,"OK. Fun, Clean, comfortable atmosphere. Learned on measuring plastic tubing used on medical devices by using different equipment and measuring devices."
good,Good company wants good employees. The company i Inc.s part of Fluor
good,I find the work is familiar and engaging. The distance to the work site is sometimes a challenge but they pay weekly which is always a plus.The opportunity for advancement is pretty non existent though.
good,"I worked as a design engineer in Fluor for 7 years. My day starts with checking and responding to emails  from other disciplines and clients. Most of the times, I am busy in reviewing design calculations. My work requires a lot of coordination with other disciplines. From discussing with them the required design requirements and ensuring with them that project's specifications are complied. It is a challenging work but it has led me to learn and develop my technical skills and knowledge."
good,"good place to work/fast pace and safe with good tools and equipment   my time there was great with experience workers all around with transportation to while you needed to go,learned different types of work skills.good employers ,but the weather conditions were hard."
good,It was a good stop for me and I got to travel quite a bit. My boss was excellent. But they have a thing of layoffs and I forget the title but essentially use you as a body without job security. If it was an office position I might have felt more secure.
good,"Fluor is/was a good company to work with, but as everyone knows it is famous as a easy hire and easy fire company."
good,Buena compañía pero mucho cambia cambia en los horarios y mucho protocolo para poder empezar a trabajar
good,Very long hours yet learned extensive experience working with other cultures with an international project. Management was somewhat complicated as required interaction with site management and foreign management. The workplace culture was interesting requiring training of local foreign staff to accomplish company and project goals. The software used was rather complicated for desired goals. Time off was fair and enjoyable allowing travel in other countries.
good,Productive and fun workplace with jolly co-workers. Tiring because of multi-tasking and long hours of duty accompanied by lots of customers and endorsements on the end of the shift.
good,Fluor was an acceptable place to work.  The engineers were easy to get along with and I had an awesome manager.  Fluor's employees work a 9/80 work week.  Getting every other Friday off is a bonus.
good,"Company has lots of opportunity in many different fields, if you are willing to relocate.  Benefits are good, management skills can vary - especially at the client site level."
good,I enjoyed working with this company. We were able to work overtime.Being safe was our#1 motto.My General foreman and foreman made sure we attended meetings and perform our tasks in a timely manner.
good,"Fluor was very safe, excessively so.  Personnel Protective Equipment was always to the extreme.  Up to the point of being excessive.  Personnel were required to wear respiratory protection (full face respirator) to glue a single PVC joint.  Amount of protective clothing required during summer months was to the extent that it caused potential heat stress issues.  We even had to wear respiratory protection to work within engineered designed gloveboxes that had built in negative ventilation.  If you want to be safe but not get much work done this is the place for you."
good,"Fluor is a great place to work at. They have people that are excellent and what they do and are always willing to teach what they know. The benefits are great. However, it is not a stable place to work out. Fluor has cycles of laid offs every 3 to 5 years which can be very demoralizing."
good,The part time assignments have been beneficial and allows the flexibility needed to care for my daughter. Able to apply knowledge learned and assist the company but closing out projects.
good,"My immediate supervisor was very knowledgeable and helpful, and coworkers were good to work together to get assignments completed."
good,"I  had some good time working there you know everywhere you work you have the good,bad and the ones just take things over board trying to prove themselves."
good,"It's actually a great company. They promote work-life balance by conducting sports competition amongst employees. You can also learn several skills. They also give weekly toolbox meetings. Sadly though, they only provide Project-based employment, making it hard for long-time employees to attain a regular status. Plus due to oil crisis and lack of projects, even if you're a regular employee, there still is no security of tenure. They oftentimes resort to terminating and ending of contracts regardless of the length of time you have been in the company. Plus the fact that politics play a big part in career advancement."
good,"Wotk is always stressful."
good,"It's hard to rate a company that is contracted at a nuclear site with other companies and all walks of life, good-bad-evil-vindictive-deceptive-miserable people. They can only do what is acceptable to the project and customer which makes very, very difficult to have a work/life balance, receive promotions or raises, high turnover rate with employees and management, and an UN trustworthy culture."
good,"Its a good company its the first one i ever worked with in industrial, after doing so much cable pull, I'm pretty good at it now. Id like to try something else. I have a lot to pay for in my personal life so a good paying job for me is a must, but would like to try new things of course."
good,"A lot of knowledgeable staff members, always willing to share their experiences to help guide you as long as you're willing to learn. Not always open to new ideas, however the environment is cohesive and well structured."
good,"The management has greatly improved at VC Summer with FLUOR taking over. However, the workplace culture has not been effetely turned around. There is still the good old boy club present at this site. The hardest part of the job is working 5 10 hour days and sometimes 6 days a week."
good,"The parent company culture is typical American and is worth mentioning. It is an equal opportunity employer and very free environment."
good,Typical day of work at Fluor is full of challenges. Everyday you get a construction issues and design issues which can be challenging to resolve. With these challenges comes great experiences and learnings. I learned here the value of communication and team work. The hardest part of the job was to balance work quality and at the same time meet the deadline. The most enjoyable part of the job is the learning experience and you get to meet people of diverse cuture.
good,"worked six days a week and sometimes on sunday. The pay was great, but working 70 hours plus was hectic. other than that it was a typical welding job. I would work for them again if I need to work there again."
good,"I enjoyed working for Fluor. Good leadership, good co-workers. Would consider working for them again in the near future."
good,"Working with this company in such a short period of time was I can say a great place to learn. I'm not just limited to do generator, we do some training on Hydraulics and Vehicles as well.  every day before we go to work we usually had this safety briefing that, what is most important than work is life.  you preserve life, you've become more productive.  safety is always the main concern. safety on your self and safety of others around you. management wise,I only see them every week  on overall safety meeting, encouraging us to work more safely and return home complete. I believe this company will always be looking after their employees to work more safely everyday. Co workers; i enjoy working with them, telling me stories of how their life become. from nothing to what they are now today. It gives me some boost of morale to strive more in life. the hardest part of the job here is when the summer strikes, its so hot outside and you are on a cold air conditioned vehicle and going out without acclimatized. but, as all we always work on safety and safely we make sure that before we do our job, we take breaks on a shaded areas to acclimatized. Work wise, its a fun place to be and a good learning platform."
good,"Salary- very good"
good,"lots of time to complete work, not much room for advancement unless you know someone in upper management. Disappointed with the stability of the company."
good,"I haven't been here for very long, but a project that was supposed to house a lot of engineers is in the process of falling through. Safe to say that many people will be looking for work."
good,Worked with what supplies you had.  Dealt with a multi-language culture.  Management was not aware of the hazardous work conditions.
good,2.5 yrs work as Talent Development (Trades Certification Supervisor) maintained all contractual documentation for the LOGCAP  IV project regarding compliance with Government standards.
good,"Very procedure and policy oriented. Long days, good management, good place to work at, reasonable benefits. Has cafeteria and gym and many projects"
good,"Very tight deadlines for presentation of Project financial Records"
good,Fluor Enterprises is a good environment for those who can take control of their careers and do not mind working in various locations on various projects domestically and internationally.
good,I started here as a Desktop Support person and left as a CAD Support. I have learned to see the business from the designing and construction side of things. Management was very supportive in my career path. The hardest part of the job was getting the proper training on the new CAD system to support it. I enjoyed the challenges of learning a role and taking some night courses to try to understand my clients.
good,"I enjoyed working with people from all over the world, including the local Afghan people.  We had to deal with extreme temperatures and minimal comforts."
good,"Rebuilding preheaters, boilers, economizers, steam drums, sofas and burners. Performed as an Operator, Rigger, Millwright and Boilermaker at several different Coal Powered steam stations."
good,"Empresa manejada por gerencia chilena por lo tanto la idiosincracia es chilena, buen nivel de remuneraciones, y ambiente laboral extremadamente competitivo."
good,"- I started from 7:45 to 5:45. Dealt with engineering and technical issues related to my packages. Participated to any arranged meeting due to my packages. Coordinating among discipline to resolve any matter which caused delay on packages' schedule and delivery time."
good,I have been exposed to different cultures & life styles. If I had not come over seas I would have not met the people in my life today. It is really enjoyable getting to know people outside of the US. Quite an experience!
good,Project was at an Owner Location / Site very little contact with home office. Everything done corporately on a website or by web-air.
good,"Long days, But very Productive"
good,I enjoyed working at Fluor. The compensation was good and the benefits were ok. The culture and values fit the company. Management had its ups and downs. High turnover.
good,"I really liked my job there. I worked in mantinies, building decks and steps on office buildings. Framing walls, hanging doors, sheet rock.I have worked for Fluor on many jobs sence 2000."
good,"Challenging work environment"
good,"My direct managers were outstanding individuals, however the upper management was very unsympathetic and condescending when I filed a harrassment claim against a coworker who had disciplinary issues and had been written up 3 times before the incident.  They found the first opportunity available after it as an excuse to end my employment there.  The individual who was the subject of my complaint is still employed there."
good,Was given instructions to work on simulations forbidden by the client.  This occurred on a regular basis.  It put me in the middle of a difficult situation.
good,"Good money but had little time to myself but all and all it was a good job, i wish i could go back it. Management was great, good friends, and i enjoyed flying."
good,"Enjoyed the fast pace work environment, great learning experience. However it is contract work for the Govt and there is no guarantee of longevity and the workload was substantial."
good,"There are many excellent engineers at Fluor.  The projects are fast-paced.  The working relationship with the clients is quite positive.  The client demands are normally pretty tight on budget and schedule impacting work-life balance in the short-term.  Most projects are less than 1 year, so you could get lucky and get a slower project once in a while."
good,"security abounds and works with the highest possible efficiency, thus giving a good treatment to the employee and motivating in the following steps, safety, quality and production"
good,"Poor management, there are a few core circles run by a few Caucasians, their close friends and family members are never losing their jobs. They hire you to do the job and lay you off regardless of your performance it is all based on connections."
good,"work hours 10 hours a day 6-7 days a week. Working conditions consist of snow, rain, heat. Able to lift 50 pounds or more.  The hardest part of my job was the long hours. I enjoyed working at the construction because I learned a lot about the business such as equipment and the people."
good,My years with FLUOR were very beneficial to my overall background in Estimating.  I learned much there.  Watched my career proceed to higher levels than I thought possible
good,"I would have liked to finish the project that I was hired to do. However when the customer cancelled the project that I was hired to do, the only job that I was offered was in the North East portion of the country and I decided to leave."
good,"Great company if you know the right people and are considered to have great potential.  If you're just an average Joe, you likely won't really get too far.  The company is still struggling to get work and has been laying off a lot of employees for the past 2 years.  It isn't about hard work so much as it is about how well you are liked, and they are trying to encourage older people to retire so the younger you are and the less salary you demand, the more likely you will stay.  Anyone related to upper management automatically gets away with more and you just have to deal with it.  Jobs are going to other, cheaper offices overseas."
good,"It is one of the few companies who can successfully execute large, complex projects in multiple locations around the world.   They are trying to innovate and stay world leaders.  They seem to have multiple independent systems and softwares which they are trying to integrate but are only in the process of achieving.  I believe they are industry competitive for salary and benefits.  Although technically superior to most if not all competitors, they tend to be the high cost alternative - which is impacting their ability to win work.  They are poor at executing lump sum work.   As far a loyalty to employees, they are loyal to the extent an employee is reimbursable  through a client - then when not, you might get a week.  The continuing reduction in employee work station work space is a highly negative factor amongst employees."
good,"HR and Employee Concerns was and is a joke on this site.  "
good,"Fluor provided challenging work at times, but Company's approach  to projects was to establish cookie cutter designs which enabled them to project cost and schedule with greater reliability."
good,"Roller coaster oil & gas, lots of cliques, no plan for bad times. It will be a very good learning experience, once you're done with learning look somewhere else."
good,"Always positive safety/nuclear culture. People cared and looked out for one another. Most other entities having to work around others schedules to be in place to get the project completed. Management level was somewhat good and poor at times. The diversity amongst personnel was at times not on the same page; while others cared for making the money and milking the clock that seemed to be all they cared about when there was no work to do and some being forced to do the same; it would be the other way around at times when work needed to be done but became a paced environment. All in all ...great place and companies, however seemed as the years went on the project regressed and spiraled downward. More great people than poor as far as work experience/professionalism was concerned."
good,"Fluor work environment could be stressful at times due to the nature of the business.  A contract atmosphere, meaning if the company could bill you then you had a job, if not then your employment could hang in the balance."
good,The work schedule was flexible and overtime was available. The compensation was above average. The difficult job requirement was adapting to the project procedures. The management team was good and worker safety was top notch. Employees were given routes to express concerns.
good,"A typical day will be going out to the field, writing the STA together as a team. Trying to identify the hazards that might occur. Discuss ways to prevent them ,due to the conditions that  currently confronts us at the time.  Next, we go over the job assignment that needs to be  tackled through out the day.   After completing the job assignments , gathering up the tools of the trade (survey equipment), returning them to there prospective locations."
good,"Fluor Driver is a positive employer as they have the proper backup for positions and ensure you have the tools to complete your tasks."
good,"World leader in Civil Projects.  Professionals must be willing to travel 100% of the time.  Technology base is dated, but working to catch-up with the industry."
good,The company is so huge and it is difficult to ensure that you have the next project secured after completion of the first one. There is no easy wat to network and move from project to project.
good,"In Fluor, we have an alternate Friday-off working days.  Mondays thru Thursdays we render 9 hours a day of work, and 8 hours during Friday on, for a total of 80 hours every 2 weeks."
good,"Good people, safe and positive atmosphere. Company has a very high turn over in upper management and administrative positions due to unrealistic work loads for far below industry pay."
good,"Global presence allows you to take on opportunities anywhere in the world, as long as you push for it."
good,"I worked part time (22 hrs per week) at Fluor. I managed, maintained, repaire and calibrate the electronic test requirements."
good,Fluor es una excelente empresa con buenos valores humanos y muy organizada.   El ambiente de las mineras y empresas de ingeniería ha decaído y por esta razón ha tenido que prescindir de excelentes profesionales.
good,"Being part of the management team was good involved in project studies doing manhour  estimates and project deliverables for the design office. Building up the office with good designers and introduced 3d modelling tools"
good,"I worked on a contract basis for over a year, and the group for which I worked decided that they were going to end my contract due to a lack of work. I spent an additional 2 to 3 weeks working with the staffing agency assisting them in doing some ""clean up"" type of work."
good,The workplace makes you feel intimidated cause people i see always do their work professionally. Fluor does really have their own system on everything. Salute!
good,"As with most project-based industries, workload depends on projects currently in process or just beginning. Fluor tends to reduce the work-force when there is not enough project work to justify the employee count, regardless of the knowledge drain this produces. Reinventing the wheel is the norm, when the people who had the most knowledge of ""X"" are no longer there."
good,"Nothing to complain, I was looking for an opportunity in a different area in which I was working and decided to leave the company for that reason. Good workplace culture."
good,"the day is well and fine with lots of new staff to get to learn with the good management in good place of work, the hardest part of the job is no off."
good,"I don't have much of a problem with Fluor. I left a lower-paying job to accept a 6-month contract position, but unfortunately, the project was cancelled on my second day. I feel like my managers did their best to find me a new position, but the recruiter from Fluor's in-house firm couldn't have cared less about what happened to me. After two weeks, it was all over, and I feel like no one made any effort on my behalf after that point."
good,Great company with well established procedures and practices. Fun place to work with all the freedom. Scope for developing skill sets and grow. Gets challenging projects and delivers them to the extent possible. Had a global presence.
good,The on-the-job experience covers a wide range of skill sets required to complete a job.  Current jobs are fast paced and require 40+ hour weeks from the get-go.
good,"Professional place to work.Wages weren't competitive for my field , but if you invested time with this company I believe they treat you better. Because my was on a contract job I wasn't able to take advantage of this loyalty."
good,"Management was good, some office employees were unaccepting of new employees."
good,"This company really have work, life and balance. They made sure that the employees don't just work but also enjoy. The have so many sports fest and competitions among employees and other companies. Amnbiance is good and time is not a big issue. Just make sure to deliver the deliverables on due time."
good,"Job training was very simple and well put together.  However, infrastructure and management is lacking any fortitude.  Advancement opportunities are non-existent."
good,"Government Client requested Lump Sum, Sole Source Proposal for Construction $2B Cyclone Uranium Enrichment Facility."
good,The hardest thing about the company is not hiring people that does there job correctly. You meet lots of people from all over the world with skills they can teach you. The pay is the best thing at fluor. Most days work is easy and enjoyable.
good,Fluor was a great place to work but going in you have to realize that this company tends to hire large and then lay off even larger. I suppose its because of the Oil & Gas industry and the amount of work they have.
good,Established company with potential for upward mobility and exposure to many different areas of the business.  A lot of overtime available for those who like to work and their benefits are reasonable.
good,"Fluor is an easy going company. I like my coworkers, and people here are easy to work with, generally.  Managers are generally very understanding about taking time off.  Fluor offers flex time and over time, which are both huge pluses to working here. Its easy to punch-in, punch-out.  That being said, I also don't know how easy it is to be noticed at such a large company, and moving up the ladder seems like it could be challenging, depending on what path you are seeking."
good,"Great global opportunities. Company is beginning to recognize the importance of work life balance, but is struggling to keep up with leaders in the industry.  Good benefits, but these are slowly disappearing. Company is in transition, but slow to make progress."
good,"Fluor was a great company to work for.  Management (some) genuinely cared about developing their staff and took a vested interest in people development. However, this was few and far between.  "
good,"get the chance to work with other disciplines. Be able to talk to the lead with regards to the projects we are doing."
good,"good company is the no 1 priority. It is one of the largest engineering, procurement, construction, manintenance companies in the world"
good,"As Client representative, providing expert supervision and management of EPC Contractor and Subcontractors. Closely monitor and ensure compliance with requirements of contract to any project-specific HSE related issues necessary in order to implement and maintain its high level of HSE management system."
good,"Comienzo de actividades con charla de seguridad, luego autorización de permisos de trabajos, control de documentación, recorridas de seguridad, investigación de incidentes, crono grama de actividades, realización de informes. "
good,"Fluor is a good company to work for But the company is changing and losing its focus. They also do not put themselves in a position of strength in joint ventures. As a result, we’ve been unable to protect the quality of our work product. They also need to work on employee retention during downturns.  I’m an 18 year highly knowledgeable employee that is out of work because there are no jobs to bill to.  Fluor will call me back to work but I don’t know when. too. I’ll be called back"
good,"Being in Fluor I had the chance to meet and work with people from other countries, which was a great value for my own job and skills.  As mining company, Fluor's policy is to integrate everybody's knowledge and share experiences in previous projects and evaluate the chance to implement them in the new ones following the procedures established by the company."
good,I have enjoyed working for fluor as a company.  The craft side sucks. You go to work everyday wondering when your gonna get stabbed in the back for nothing other than your boss doesn't like you.
good,"Reviewing and processing Invoices, Mailing checks after all information has been verified, handling any problem resolving with vendors and the project site."
good,Great Company. My likes were the daily interfacing with internal department managers and aligning work strategies attaining the most effective returns and profitability.
good,"Great people to work with. Many technical aspects of getting to know the job.  Training is brief and very ambiguous. some days are long & boring, others are fast paced & you wonder where the day went! Hardest part of the job is learning the materials, parts, companies supporting all the different needs."
good,"Learned lot apart from my core, instrumentation, DCS programing, Electrical etc."
good,I enjoy workingfor flour hope to continue to workmformth compny
good,"management was amazing, more like friends. pay was not the best but competitive with other contractors. shift was amazing, and overtime available. tools supplied by employer"
good,There are plenty of good opportunities at Fluor that u can learn crafts to be in a great position to succeed and build a future. It is a pleasure to now that u are progressing everyday..
good,Enjoyed working and great place to work at. Co-workers and employees were great individuals to worked with. Great benefits packages and advancements for all employees.
good,"My house is near on this office. And the work nature has a work life balance. Sometimes, I attended Factory acceptance testing on different countries."
good,It was a good place to work great money and the people where awesome to work with.  Some of the guys out there showed me so much I never knew and I learned so much being out there.
good,"HR recruiter fooled around and messed up my offer 3 times, and the offers kept getting smaller and smaller. great workplace environment but just still have a sour taste in my mouth about the recruiter."
good,Excelente empresa. comprometida con sus empleados y los beneficio
good,"Very diverse company, has its up and downs. Should do more background on the employees and supervision that is brought in to do certain jobs."
good,"Es un muy buen trabajo, con buena remuneracion, Buen trato con los compañeros y directivos"
good,"good work hours great co workers very nice work place, do something new every day"
good,"Had a job shutdown. Job has had a bankruptcy since March 2017, and finally had a shutdown now they are not trying to find workers another job. They closed it s unprofessionally."
good,"I have had a Great Career here at Flour with Good Pay, Very much a competitive work place. You have to put your time in here to have a shot at a promotion. Overall I would give it a 8 out of ten Places I would choose to work in the future."
good,"Creating and updating of piping design: Plans using AutoCAD 2006 and Bentley MicroStation Version 07.01.05.03."
good,"during outages, hours were long and stressful but fun.  it is n't for the faint of heart for sure.  Being on a job site is extremely high paced and one cannot take offense to things said."
good,i was in my first day or orientation when the project i was going to work at was abbaondoned and many people like myself were laid off...................
good,the hardest part of working there was being away from my family.  I was a good paying job but had to leave home in Atlanta to go to Augusta.  Worked many hours including over-time which was probably my downfall.
good,"I have learnt that if i have a problem i must discuss with my boss because he is there with me all the time and should not be a secret when going through tough time. "
good,"Many intelligent hard working people"
good,"There are a lot of risks involved with any kind of construction. Everyone must pay attention to their surroundings for safety, but sometimes it is not enough. Dropped objects can fall, bounce off a pips and fly vertically for 40 feet. Here dropped objects are a common occurrence."
good,It was a good safe work environment. Management or people we were working for was terrible. People we worked with were great and friendly and looked out for one another. And as a result of bad management morale was low  and there was no job security. They threatened our jobs daily.
good,Co-workers very knowledgeable in their disciplines.  Team environment practiced extensively.
good,The company's engineer are quite knowledgeable.  Many of them have many years experience and know the engineering procedures and most time they can finish the project by themselves without minimum management.
good,"all aspects of power plant maintenance from one end of the power plant to the other. This includes conveyors, boiler area, scrubber towers, fly ash and bottom ash areas."
good,"safety equipment and gear needed for daily work is easily obtainable, Safety standards are higher than most places and are easy to follow, regular safety meetings for crew and entire jobsite."
good,"I knew when I signed up for the QC position, that I would be working long days and weeks. I truly enjoyed working with craft and was always up for more training. As with any construction job there could have been improvements in the daily workings and a more cost effective way of doing things."
good,"Fluor is a good company to work for but they cant get rid of the buddy system. They have to many people in positions that don't know the job but are kept because they have a friend in a high position. aside from that, the pay is good and benefits are good"
good,Safety was the number one thing in the work site always be ready and watch out for others while working depending on safety is number one on saving lives
good,"I had the responsibility of receiving materials in an Access based internet supported program called Material Management. It was a relatively easy program to learn. It was my duty to file receiving records under the PO number to each pillar of the project."
good,"No experienced boring contractors and to little help, we had 24 drills working and 6 inspectors, these guys hit everything that was in the ground, then winter hit with snow,ice and frozen ground, one contractor flood a mc donald's not once but two times, another flooded a two story home backing out of the hole and hit sewer and water line. I left this project due to weather and did not return, a old friend we promoted and he still holds it against me"
good,"I worked for Fluor for 25+ years. In the early days, management was very knowledgeable and straight forward. You knew what your task was every day and you were expected to do your task or hit the highway. Todays' Fluor is all about running you off and ask questions later. Some of the poorest management in the industry."
good,I was supposed to work there only 2 months and it ended up being 7 months.  The work was ok and I wish I could of finished my career there.  At 64 it would of been a nice thing but the work was running out so they started the layoffs.
good,"Good company to work for. Hardest par ? The weather, if it’s too cold or too hot and or if it’s raining. Or just having to put up with people you’re not getting along with. Also traffic."
good,"Everything about the company and work is great, Except for the foremans and general foremans. Not all but most I've come across create double standards in the work environment which causes problems among workers."
good,Floor has a lot of jobs going all over the world. It's not the best place for a family man to work. Their needs are very demanding of your time which keeps you away from your family.
good,"10 hours shifts"
good,"We were all let go in an very unprofessional manner.Overall it was an okay place to work.There was not any paid time off,and too much weekend work.Mgt.seemed to worry most about people going to the gate early,than about job satisfaction."
good,The Job consist of a lot of lifting and pulling wire. I learned how to wire up panel boxes many different ways. The co workers and the job was a plus. The hardest part of the job was not having the rite material to finish the job.
good,"If you know your work well then you can make wonders here. Depends what project you are doing and what kind of team you have, generally people are helpful and understanding but I wish Management could have been better."
good,"It's a good place to work when they have work, but at the slow times only the connected people stay on. The management is too elitist."
good,I personally gained a lot of experience as a welder/machanic there as well as being a leader.
good,Great learning experience! company provides great opportunities for employee growth. Working on various projects with different client can be challenging.
good,"The work place was alright, for the different circumstances that the hurricanes and flooding. Overall it was professional and competitive. I would always consider fluor as family"
good,"I have nothing more to add to the ratings I provided earlier. When I separated from the company, I had a 2.5 hour exit interview and voiced all my grievances then."
good,Fluor is a great place to work seems Lito me that you have to be kin folk to really succeed . After working for them on and off since 1982 . I’m ready to move on and up  willing to work up from bottom to be successful
good,A normal day is relax work environment positive vibes. While being productive and safety awareness. Going over the STA before every shift gives you the confidence to perform the task at hand.
good,Enjoyably challenging and rewarding to see your projects accomplished.  Wide variety of clients and very diverse job roles.  Continuous interaction with colleagues and clients world-wide.
good,My first time working for Fluor. I overall like the company as with any company there are pros and cons of each one. The wages are fair. I moved up in the company within ninety days. Thumbs Up.
good,"Efficient fast paced work on projects with adequate resources. experience in working with various clients. Both home office (design) and field experience (construction). Full understanding of clients standards & specifications. Knowledge & experience gained in the design, procurement, contracts & construction of refineries. Hardest part of the job was producing low cost engineering drawings & documents. Enjoyable part was the successful construction completion and operation of a new refinery."
good,"I was caught up in the stopping of work at the construction of 2 new reactors at VC Summer in South Carolina.  "
good,"Make sure you bring your work pants with you.  This is not a joke.  Long hours and a mutli-faceted workforce make for constant change.  No day is typical, and when you think it was all figured out, they change the rules."
good,"Fluor wasn't a bad company, just put in a bad situation with the client. It is a bit hard to move up and raises were hard to come by, but all in all, just you average company."
good,"i learned so many things regarding process,my seniors are too much good,"
good,"Nice perks"
good,Working with Fluor Daniel gave me an opportunity to test how work in other companies were.  I got introduced to Project Costs and how it all affects the building of new parts of a refinery.  I worked closely with the Department of Procurement and it was a very great experience for me.
good,I got the tail end of this project and unfortunately re-worked and put integrity in the ISO's that were not followed for turn over to Dow Chemical. Scheduling conflicts were the problems for priorities of work and those who ordered material before me seem to be guessing on what was needed next to keep the workforce busy.
good,"Unless you know someone, have a relative, or become a manager's favorite employee you're probably not going to go very far. The government group is by far the most politically driven group there is. There are few managers in that group that truly care about your employment. It's really just a free for all to see who can get to the top the quickest."
good,"During my employment at Fluor we were requirred to read their ethics proceedure and show our loyality to the company, but in return they did not maintain their loyality to their employees. If I was a young engineer just starting I would recommend you research the other companies before I make a final choice."
good,big name with tons of stress and irreliable job security specially people working thru contractors. very low pay scale compare to other companies. no paid holly days for direct hires
good,"Buena evaluación, cumplí la mayoría de mis expectativas dentro de la empresa"
good,ive made more cash with these guys than anyone else in my 20 years of pipe welding. cant complain MUCH.
good,The R&R and pay are very good. The work is in a war zone and the living conditions are bad but that is why it pays so good.
good,This job was a temporary one but was a positive experience for me. The company presented with strict guidelines which created a pleasant environment. We were apprecited and shown so by the rewards presented to us. Lunch was provided for a long time on the job. The management for the most part was supportive. Some of the male management staff did not appear very professional and some even prejudice. I met many interesting co-workers and still keep in touch with some to this day. The hardest part of the job initially was becoming accustomed to working the long hours and six days a week. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help the people affected most by Hurricane Katrina.
good,"La evaluacion a nivel compañerismo es muy buena, hay buena gente en esas empresas."
good,This is a good place to work and the people are wonderful. We work 10 hour days and make for a long work day with a 30 minute lunch break. We work in a secure area which makes things more difficult to get around the site.
good,"though I got on.With what i knew.though when i was @cheveron.I saw folks that theys know way that they got hired.Unless they knew someone. I do believe some should be separated.when they take there craft test..With some supervision, knowing what's going on why given employees.There craft test.. I'm a boilermaker a real one with 20 years of experience.I learned the hard way"
good,"you can make as much money as you want but there is a lot of traveling and time away from home and love one also no benefits. no job security, lots of great people working there"
good,"Write pipe and supports installation work packages."
good,Only worked for them for one power plant outage.  Great group of people but laid off at the end of the job. No work offered at another location after job termination.
good,"The parking area for craft workers was poorly designed. It took 45 mins- 1hr just to exit the parking lot. The schedule and planning of the crew I worked with changed a lot. We would work 10 hours one day and 12 hours the next day. During the same week. And it was not optional, it was mandatory."
good,This was a fast paced job on a project that required a lot rework due to upper management poor planning.  Field management was easy to work for and with.  I would not have left but I had to relocate back to Texas.
good,hard satisfiying work..other trades constantly stealing materials overall good company.contacted management but absolutely did nothing to solve the problem.
good,"I enjoyed working for the company.  I felt that the work culture was excellent.  There was opportunity for promotion.  Ultimately, the joint venture was dissolved."
good,"client contract jobs..moved quickly and then you were somewhat uncertain if you would still be employed.   Oil and Gas standard"
good,"Big projects mean big opportunities to impact your community. However, a project-driven company means lay offs when projects finish up. Not much career advancement, above average nepotism."
good,"The job was for a outage where they shut down one of two reactors for three months for repair. The work is a true grind, stressful, tiring, physically demanding, and very unique. It is not fun work, but because of the total amount of hours work per week because of the three month window, the pay is extremely beneficial."
good,"Administrative and project related activities"
good,"Very hard labor job. Extremely dirty covered in coal and breathing it everyday. Not a bad place to work. Enjoyable work culture 95% of the time. Management team works well with laborers. Hardest job I have ever had."
good,"Very typical EPC company, when there are projects, they treat you well and expect you to work hard as a return. In the down market with fewer projects, don't expect them to keep you, as soon as your project finish, they will let you go without hesitation, which actually makes sense in this industry, just be prepared."
good,"When there was active Projects to work on, the work was fast paced, and could be stressful, owing to the business approach to distribute the production work to more ""less cost"" engineering centres (eg. India, Philippines). Lately there is more of a push to advance younger employees to advance than the older workers."
good,"Instead of giving you the opportunity to move with the company to another project, Fluor will show you the door. Great money while you're working!!!!!"
good,Global EPCM with projects in various Australian operations.  Innovative and flexible in terms of meeting client expectations.  Heavily systems oriented and oriented toward U.S. operations and standards.
good,Environment at my level was fun and educational as well as fast paced and ever changing. The hardest part of the job was not knowing if there was a job the next day. Other then that it was an experience I value and would love to have again.

good,"You can be fired any time, no job security, very short term contract extension, qualification does not matter just iso production company, less work pressure"
good,"I moved up quickly with fluor. It is a company I have worked for many times. The higher management is great. THe biggest problem is the lower management. to many people trying to be foreman not enough people trying to do the work. However, that is a problem that you will find at most construction jobs."
good,"If you're wanting a career in EPCM then Fluor is the place to go. Great company, open, honest management. Typical in many ways of an EPCM, if there is work you're on solid ground, if you're not billable then you time may be limited. Work/Life balance can be sometimes difficult to manage however, it can be achieved."
good,"The most of enjoyable part of the job is you know what you should do and how to meet project schedule."

good,"They get you in there doing skilled jobs for contracted Jobs, like the Kennicott smelter. I liked it but it all depends on the leads you work for.  Some are real jerks.  The managers really are very awful.  My lead was awesome but the manager was a complete stab you in the back jerk.  Depending on your involvement with management your job can be great."
good,Fluor philippines helps me a lot to enhance my knowledge and skills in the field of instrumentation. This company allows me to grow independently and help me to enhance with my communication skills with different types of people.

good,"the company as a whole worked well with the client, a lot of these people went on to Jacobs when the contract changed. the flour people were good to work with."
good,"Fluor is a good company to work for.  If you are flexible in your willingness to travel, opportunities for promotion and competitive salaries are definitely available to you. Being that Fluor is mainly a project-based company, there can be times of stress when there is not much available work."
good,"The market place is more competitive now. "
good,it was a hot place during summer 12 hours days. most the guys working there are good to get along with. I worked there for 9 years and it's ran around keeping the client happy which makes sense but may seem disorganised to some people.
good,Job is in warzone Iraq and Afghanistan.  You must be able to travel at least 3 months at a time away from home.  Vacation time...also known as R and R make it worth it
good,not always an easy day but at the end of the day you knew you did a good day worth of work. The folks you work with create a family away from home & with the right supervisor you had the ability to move up or to a craft quickly. hard work but rewarding
good,my review for the company is great I would always go back to Fluor they was the best company I worked for in the overseas contracting world. My co workers and environment was great
good,"long day very busy"
good,"LOGCAP is one of the most challenging assignments anyone can undertake. Auster living conditions, long work days, separation from family, hostile fire is just the beginning of the challenges to face in LOGCAP. If you can handle the challenge it can be one of the most rewarding jobs helping the U.S. Armed Forces and its Allies. Best of luck to those that try and to those who are there be safe. To the military there I can't thank you enough for your dedication and service."

good,Too many unqualified safety people and didn't ask employees for there thoughts on making it better and safe.not enough cool down stations.i noticed a lot of germans and general foreman's were moved up too fast but then again the job was too much for one company to handle.

good,Construction job traveling. Had no insurance available so the benefits were not very good I thought. Pay was decent though. Management was ok. Workplace culture not very good...lots of drug use and drinking. Most of the men were divorcees. Hardest part of the job was being away from home the whole time.

good,"Fluor has changed in the last ten years, becoming less of a cohesive unit and a much more difficult place to work.  Departments are fragmented, and it is difficult to advance.  If you are not one of the chosen few to be mentored from a very young age, you have no opportunity to reach past a certain level.  Sad to say, the company is not the giant it once was."

I learned a great amount as far as just about anything to do with facilities maintenance... ie plumbing, electrical, motor and pumps, ect.... The management is always on their toes and yours but that is to be expected when striving for total customer satisfaction. The other employees were very easy to get along with and they appreciated any help given to them  as well as offering help to anyone else that needed it. The hardest part of the job was not always knowing what to plan for in the work day. The most enjoyable part was the constant work pace, and the feeling of accomplishment when you complete a job that was challenging."

good,"you were expected to do a days work ,and give them your best days work do it safe and be productive."
good,"Every day started with safety meeting, then job line out. I learned how to maintain and repair smelter machinery. Management had some great people, but they were often influenced by the customer to do things they really thought better of. I got along well with all of my co-workers and could work with any of them. The hardest part of the job was wearing the full face respirator, especially in very hot areas. I did and still do enjoy the maintenance of machinery. I especially enjoyed installation of new piping, and fabricating for modifications."
good,Welded carbon and stainless steel for 10 hour days a minimum of four days a week. Learned daily to accomplish tasks placed before you within allotted time producing a quality product. Management kept job site on task. Most enjoyable part of job was completing tasks set before me.
good,Days start with safety and instructual meetings. Pre work and the days expectations. Job assignments. work is performed throughout the day. We have post-job briefing for work status and completions.
good,"I enjoyed the company as a whole,nice work enviorment everybody looked out for each other which is important when working long hours.I did alot of firewatching working along side the pipefitters."
good,"The work is okay, but the schedule is somewhat hard. 12 hour swing shift days and nights. Warehouse setting is laid back, and is self-managed."
good,"I have worked for Fluor for a total of nineteen years. I have held various positions at Fluor over the years. A typical day at work is very hectic, very busy and forever changing. It requires long hours, usually overtime into the evenings and weekends."
good,This is a temporary work but you will hop from one plant to the next. You work 7 days a week until job is complete.
good,"I currently am assigned to the position of Shop Manager here in Camp Eggers HVACR Shop O&M Division. I repair units, trouble shoot, assist in the field, handle shipping and receiving goods, daily paperwork, issue work orders, assist the management staff in supervision (25 Technicians)"
good,"Worked with several clients on process mechanical equipment in selection, cost, best fit, and working with different departments to ensure client what they needed to improve food production."
good,Good Staff with many resource materials to help assist with your job.
good,"I liked the managment they were very supportive and helping , I went through so much of difficulty during first few days but my senior was very much caring and helped me through out"
good,"Good experience at Fluor, work life balance is good, good colleagues, leadership team needs improvement in terms of employees benefit schemes, better in-house Training to be arranged"
good,"The administration;cse, csm,etc were well versed in all aspects of a smooth job site..Safety is always a top aspect. Great  wages were realistic as were conditions for the type of work generated."
good,Fluor is a good company but the work is not Perminant you will work and then you will be off a little while but when you are working you make good money.
good,"Fluor is great EPCM company. Very structured and thorough engineering and operational procedures. Great ability of executing large, complex and unique capital multi-billion-dollar projects."
good,Good worksite to be everyday made good money would definitely work for them again the management on that site wasn’t the best but the plant got built  lots of good people there
good,Fluor is an outstanding company to work for. Unfortunately there are not enough projects to employ everyone right now. Hopefully things will improve in the near future.
good,"Challenging place to work, always something new to learn. A lot of Management changes going on but  my department staying the same. Casual work environment."
good,was my first job after graduating high school. its a good look into the real world but little pay compared to some of the work that's required. your job is never concrete not a long time career
good,It was a good job. I was there for 21 months. The work planning was non-understandable at times but we made it work. I'll definitely be looking to work for Fluor again.
good,Overall a good group to work with workplace culture could use some improvement. Management carries a larger part on this change. Management needs to be seen more in the field allow the employees to know they understand the task they deal and obstacles they deal with on a daily bases.
good,"Large projects mean long timelines.  This is good and bad in that you get assigned to one project, sometimes for several years.  So you can build a familiarity, but it can take awhile before things materialize and you are actually in the field building things."
good,position was a sr. mechanical engineer mainly with piping discipline. typical day started in the am and for 8 hours. management was good and everybody is treated well & equally. good work was being compensated with bonus and atmosphere was very professional. it took sometime to get in their system. enjoyable part of engagement was knowing a completion of the project.
good,"I enjoyed working with this company my workers we all worked well together and communicated well, all worked really safe. Good company, good journeymen ,very qualified in field of work."
good,I would definitely work another Fluor job. I personally had a good experience working with the company. There was plenty of staff to handle any and all needs.
good,"As a young engineer, this workplace allowed me to experience job execution of project from the start up to end (AFD issuance of deliverables) where I perform all of process activities."
good,"Fluor was like most of the major contractors. Pay and perdiem was ok, 32/85. Management was iffy, very political and job stability not really consistent."
good,"Overall good place to work - people are the best thing about working at Fluor.  Interesting work, collaborative environment.  A good place to learn the engineering & construction business."
good,The days went fast and learned some new things. The 1 hour drive in my truck took up sometime and the traffic when you get into the town i also enjoyed the my comrades
good,Real productive! Work lots of hours and they do not care about giving you time off to enjoy life and time with family !!!Employees get tired and need time off but that seems not to matter ! Upper management can take off and get someone to cover for them ! Most of the time crane operators can’ t because it leaves a seat open !
good,Productive and fun work environment with a wonderful menu of food at theirLack og mana lobby restaurant. Flexible work hour schedule that allows for outside activities on their 15 acre campus.
good,Esta lleno de actividades  propias de un proyecto que esta en ejecucion y si se nota el timing que es un punto que lo hace atractivo al que esta acostumbrado a este ritmo.
good,"Management on projects, are not accepting of contractors, make life difficult for contractors as they wot be around for to long. Many long hours expected and overtime would get rejected. Very negative regarding the project they are managing"
good,"It’s a really good job , I’m off Friday-Sunday and am looking for weekend work. The people are great overall and the work is interesting. Can’t go into great detail because a lot of the work is classified."
good,I work for Fluor Marine Propulsion as a government contractor so we are basically just operating a Navy facility for the Navy.  The biggest downside to the job was the culture.  A lot of people see their job as drudgery.
good,"Fluor has some flaws in the treatment of employees but overall a good company to be associated with."
good,Management very helpful.  Very knowledgeable and has an open door policy.  The only problem is executive management; all they see is numbers and they could not care less about the employees.
good,"This job was as a contractor in Afghanistan.  The wok day is 12 hours long but the pace of work is slow so you don't get burned out.  You get 3 R&R's of 16 days each to go home, or anywhere else in the world you want to go."
good,"Work for fluor for 2 years, two separate projects. "
good,12 hours work days 7 days a week and living on a military base. We were allowed 4 vacations per year at 21 days each but reduced to 3 @ 16 days once I was separated from the project. The hardest part of the job is adapting to the lifestyle of a soldier in a wartime environment. The workplace culture is positive and friendly. The most enjoyable part of the job is the perks of traveling to and from work and being on the other side of the world and having multiple countries at your fingertips to travel to on vacation.
good,good company to work for long employment provided busing to come to work and bring me home gave me rain gear for when it was raining and water for when it was hot.
good,I worked for the Electrical Department in Baytown.  Like in any project environment that large you have some people that want to cause issues or start trouble.  They are just insecure.  I would say that all in all there were great people working there and that the job was good paying.  When Hurricane Harvey came through the communication stopped and everyone was laid off which was not really that fair but understandable.  I would love to work on another Fluor project but like in most construction companies now days you have to know someone to get on they do not just go by your past work experience or even your evaluation on one of their projects.  It is rather sad this happens in the industry as a whole.
good,Most management were approachable (incl. the Clients) & honest. We were given feedback on project / various areas etc. Majority of people (crew & management) associated off site - this gave a sense of crew not being 'just a number or name'.
good,"Working at the engineering / design level is pretty good because most people are good to work with."
good,"Great management. Safety was number one. As a woman working in a predominately male environment, I found that I was treated fairly and with respect. Hard work, but rewarding."
good,This was a union job which made things frustrating at times. Employees were easy going most of the time. Long days and even longer commute. Management was decent.
good,Good People.  A goal and a path to achieve that goal was decided quickly and efficiently.  Backing was given by management and successful closure was attained.
good,"I didn't work for Fluor for all that long. Like any oilfield job, people are hired and laid off all the time. Working up north pays well, but it comes at a price. Two weeks away from the family can be hard."
good,"Great place to work, respectful and good working environment. safety, was a positive experience, all you had to do was ask if you were stumped. always a greeting with a smile and an appreciation for your presence by my superintendent."
good,Good company to work for if you like to work hard and stay busy.fluor is a world wide leader in safety and engineering of multiple areas of construction
good,Flour is an extremely well organized company and has a well designed safety and health program that could be better supported by upper management and better monitored by executive authority.
good,A typical work day was very busy working and collaborating with a team. I learned a lot about the job I was performing.
good,"If your were not from LSC, you be cut sooner or later.  good coworkers, management was good then got bad with new one moving up the ladder.  Culture varies depending on the project and team. The aggressive newcomers wanting the management role was what mad life difficult due for personal gains."
good,"great company to work for wish i had permanent job with them."
good,"Fluor is a great company to work for if you already have experience in the position you are hired for. "
good,"Fluor as an EPCM has a lot of depth with strong engineering, home office support and a diverse and extensive manpower base to draw from.   Fluor's safety program and culture is also very well supported and the field level safety advisors are second to none.  The Cutbank ridge program was a challenge in that I got parachuted into a struggling project and a client with very high expectations and an accelerated schedule that no one felt was achievable.  Fluor's workplace culture I felt was a bit lacking as a progressive team culture.  The relationship with the works contractor was also very poor.  Turning the culture around, getting everyone to take ownership, look for and push solutions to the many issues and setbacks that come with major construction and still achieving the MC date was something that every single person on that site took away as a personal win and are better for it. "
good,Good company to work with but needs to make sure the workers have the experience they say they have before hiring them cause this can cause unsafe conditions on the job.
good,"It was a good place to work, and I would have stayed for the completion of the project, had the project ended.  The people I worked with were good people. The job environment would get stressful at times due to the nuclear requirements and demands. The job was behind when Fluor took it over. I would work for them again."
good,It was a tough job but they paid well and it was a learning experience. You had plenty of job security as long as the job was going. There was a lot going on and you had to be very aware of your surroundings. An example would be there was anywhere from 8 to 10 large cranes and many lifts and water trucks etc.
good,"If you are all about the competition & stress, then Fluor is the place to work. Your colleagues are only there for themselves. There is no team work. Too many chiefs and not enough indians to get a job done."
good,"Typical day at Fluortek, everyone works in a robotic mode, no motivation or encouragement. Rules do not applied to every single employee at Fluortek. some employees get treated unfair. There is a lot of room to improve and motivate employees, more recognition will help the company and better health insurance. Employees are paying too much money on health insurance and the deductible is too high."
good,"Fluor Daniel was a company that worked shut down at manufacturing plant throughout this country and several other countries and we traveled from job to job , this location was the DuPont plant located in Florence"
good,"Very Productive Work Enviroment .My department was very good, overall. There was always room for advancement with the entire site. They had a very good training staff that was available per which ever craft you had perferred."
good,"They support work life balance and pushes employees to grow and support their personal plans as well. Though the company, like other EPC, they are affected by oil price."
good,I loved the job that I performed at Fluor.  I do think that I should have been paid more that there was a lot of work to do in 10 hours.  I do think they was fair for the most part.
good,I loved my job and wouldn't had thought about leaving the plant closed.  The work life there for many was fair.  I enjoyed working in the various positions.
good,Very turbulent industry caused lay offs. There was a lot of good events for employees. I met plenty of nice people. Not a very big company but big enough for corporate culture .
good,Our safety is first in mind. Going home healthy the way we came in . Having to discipline someone for infractions and going home with Zero mishaps. Working a Fluor has been good to me through the years.
good,"It was an environment where if you worked hard and lobbied, they didn't mind promoting you. I went from Laborer to Project Controls Assistant and I learned a variety of Labor,Cost and Material task."
good,Fluor provides anyone willing to put in the hours a stable and generous source of income and is a company I am willing to work for again in the future.
good,I enjoyed working with recruiting and preparation for getting the guys to Afghanistan. Learned the onboarding process. Orientation. My co-workers were awesome group to work with
good,"As experience was nice working in Fluor, but it has less job security. Performance is not sole criteria for sacking, but management has mysterious reason to sack employee. Although facilities provided by company are ok, but lack of inspiration by senior engineer and management can lead one to demoralize. "
good,"dealing with multiple contractors and numerous site locations"
good,"In my situation, Fluor was caught between two worlds. One of their direct hires & one of who was there when they took over."
good,Fast paced job that requires a lot of focus and team work. Must be willing to work 50 plus hours a week and more. Learned more about electrical in the industrial field.
good,"Productive and exciting place to work with many opportunities to move up. Yes, the job was a bit stressful but any job worth having is going to have it's ups and downs."
good,"Field Engineer:"
good,Worked for over 28 years at one company and very devoted to my work. Working in over six different countries it allowed me to be understanding the way other nationalities complete work assignments.
good,The training was excellent. The workplace environment was very professional. I didn't experience having lunch and learn sessions when I was working with the company but was able to attend their town hall meetings where  management discussed the ongoing and future projects of the company.
good,learned alot about pipe fitting and some pump alignments.helped some in rigging. management was ok but kinda rude sometimes. lots of good people working there.
good,"The typical day began with starting up the computer to see who would be calling on you for a status of any number of documents you may be working on.  The next act would be to see how many phone messages you needed to respond to.  On this job I learned that engineers could work 20 hours a day and still be behind on reviewing inspection plan documents that are the tool used to direct construction activities.  Management was always wanting the thing you were working on yesterday.  The response was that Engineering has been reviewing the document for three days with no results.  That was, without doubt, the hardest part of the job.  You send out documents for review hoping that the engineer would carve out a small block of time to review the documents needed to conduct work.  Like any other job, knowing that Friday evening is coming soon!"
good,"there always a big mess when your working a shutdown."
good,Every other Friday off is a plus. The company has an open door policy which is helpful when somebody is new and needs some questions answered. There are opportunities for promotion.
good,A typical day working in Quality Inspection involved performing peer review with Inspection co-workers.  Reviewing design change documents to determine if Critical Characteristics for Acceptance Criteria were identified in design change documents.  Incorporate those changes as necessary to ensure safety related SSCs are installed correctly.
good,"Great emphasis is placed on engineering, cost , schedule and executing  projects. Engaging work atmosphere with a bountiful knowledge sharing opportunities on engineering concepts.Most enjoyable part is delivering application solutions to a multi disciplinary group. Most Challenging part was the amount of your own time spent learning and developing application system solutions."
good,"good company for acquiring knowledge. Working place is organized."
good,"One of the best company. People here with different ethnicity work together to provide the best and quality engineering service in Oil and Gas, Chemical and Power Industry."
good,"Fluor is een technisch bedrijf voor vooral HBO en WO afgestudeerden (technisch + management)."
good,"There are opportunities to work on various projects and travel to work in those respective locations the longer you're employed by the company.  Most of the senior members have enjoyed their years with Fluor. "
good,"A very safety orientated company. Consistency is the key with this company, safety, equal rights, and fairness.Pace yourself or you will burn out. Great co-workers to work with. The hardest part of my job was being away from my family."
good,"Always enjoyed working for Fluor. Interesting and challenging work environments. Leader in Oilsands construction, maintenance and Turnarounds. Skilled workforce and great project management group."
good,"Worked shutdowns. put in long hours, supervisors recognize talents and abilities. there are opportunities with Fluor."
good,I like working for Fluor.  I wish I had the opportunity to become a direct Fluor employee.  The company went out of it's way to keep me employed as a contractor.  They seem to value good employees.
good,It is a good company with perfect work life balance. Its more a work share office. And the work is more focused towards documentation part rather than a complete engineering.
good,"The organization has amazing co-workers that just light up your day even when its gloomy. Project managers were excellent to work with; learned a lot of leadership skills from them. Overall, good place to work but downturn in the oil and gas industry took us all by surprise."
good,"Work requires you to be away from home for long periods of time. Some of the assignments are at great locations. I was able to work in several different countries with them. Paid very well , assignments have per diem and travel allowance and car allowance."
good,I worked with awesome people . just seem too be a lack in management . lighting stand downs were the hardest part off the job . the most enjoyable part of the job was when we were headed too brass ally calling it a day .
good,"Higher Management are so friendly, stress free environment. Supportive HR Team and co workers are like family. Times runs fast everyday because you are having fun at work."
good,"The company is a very good one to work for."
good,"For the most part, safety, integrity, excellence and teamwork emphasized.  The last 4 months of employment turned into cost cutting and moving jobs to other countries.  After 35 years of an excellent employer, the tables turned quickly."
good,Lots of Travel. Exposure to Government and big corporate culture. Technical challenges were exciting. Good camaraderie and team work. Most enjoyable part of the job  is being able to help distressed communities and help them stand on their feet.
good,A typical day at work consisted of assisting pipe fitters and welders.  I helped them out with whatever they needed. On the job I learned a little more about how to fit pipe.  The management was great.  The coworkers always looked out for each other. I wasn't a fan of knowing weather or not i was going to get laid off that day.
good,"Management is good, Co-workers are friendly, You'll learn a lot in your everyday work, hardest part of the job is revising designs over and over again, enjoyable part of the job is working with top notch professionals."
good,"started the day with a safety tpic and plan of the day. learned about different work cultures.  The managemnt was fair. most of my co-workers were realy great to work with we all possesed a lot of knowledge of the trade. the hardest part of the job was the time away from the family, which was also the most enjoyable was the travel from place to place."
good,You have a fifty percent chance on having a good experience.  There compensation is good but there management may or may not be good.  It's a crapshoot.  Good luck with finding a good leader... it's few and far between.
good,"Working at Flour Daniel was a great experience, getting to learn new things, meeting new people with all different backgrounds and learning their craft ( what they specialize in )  The ability to actually see how a chemical plant is built has open my eyes greatly to the construction world."
good,the reason why I got out is because they think and treat as your nothing and don't apreicate the work you do
good,"Plans and executes material control, procurement, logistics, inspection activities associated with commodities or engineered equipment, systems, or materials in support of project operations for LNG systems in Qatar.  Procures engineered equipment and materials in accordance with the materials management plan.  Evaluates selects and routes material shipments in accordance with procedures. Provides general and directional supervision to material management specialist and technician-level employees. Works with project management in developing expediting status reports and coordinating activities with assigned group of expeditors."
good,"At the beginning follow up for the construction activity like work fronts for electrical activity, manpower checking, checking tools and materials etc."
good,"work days were routine, const.do your assigned project.get it done as fast and safest way  you could with what you had to work with.....i learned alot about ground up const.  gas turbine assem..having been on steam turbines for many yrs.  my co- workers were great guys hard working through. foreman was one of the best i had, in a long time.,worked right all side you, didn't get in the way, upper management made some bad decisions sometimes from deadline pressure i suppose.hardest part would be outside working conditions summer heat cold rainy days enjoyed  working with good people,and being outside"
good,Liaison with the management for requirements of any new IT services and its delivery.
good,"Looking after all electrical & Instrumentation issues"
good,Нет ничего плохого что бы я мог сказать. Все как и везде зависит от уровня развития людей работающих с тобой рядом.
good,"Ambiente agradable, con mucha competitividad, pero sana, capacitación  permanente, un día típico era levantarse muy temprano, estábamos en la alta montaña, a 4600 m, de altura, con temperaturas en invierno de 10 a 20 grados bajo cero desde abril a setiembre, la Dirección de Obra estaba a al altura de las circunstancias, no tuve problemas con ningún colega o profesionales de otras áreas, la parte más dificil era subir a la parte mas alta de los edificios a una altura de 4o m con fuertes vientos y bajas temperaturas, lo que más me gustó es el departamento de Calidad al que pertenecí y se trabajo con profesionalismo y responsabilidad."
good,Coming from the private sector and going to the government there is a lot of things to get used to. The management is great here and compensation is good but the culture could use some work. It always seems to be bland.
good,workload is so tough. You may learn a lot. work environment is good!
good,"A typical work day can go from quiet to extremely busy responding to electrical, pluming, HVAC, and controls. To see what I've learned, see resume. Management, no comment at this time. Work very well with co-workers and assist with work and controls when needed. There is no hard part of the job, i enjoy what i do. The enjoyable part of the job is seeing the job completed with satisfaction in a timely manner. "
good,"Very high stress work environment, difficult client, job security was always a worry."
good,"good company to work for, good work cuture and friendly co-workers."
good,Es una empresa que ofrece un muy buen salario y beneficios. Lo complicado o difícil es el horario de trabajo y la carga del mismo.
good,"I enjoyed the people and the challanges. The advancment was nice, the salary was nice."
good,"A vast knowledge of interesting areas. I had to move on to a closer situtation,that was a good move on my behalf>"
good,"Have to be dedicated, there was ALOT of overtime and we worked 7 twelves for over a year. Very rare that we got 40 hours or less"
good,"Job consisted of analyzing and designing industrial buildings, warehouses, pump houses, pipe racks and site structures."
good,Plenty of people willing to teach you new trades and help you to succeed.
good,benefits are okay but slow in advancement or promotion. no salary increase
good,"- Needs to be focus, productive, on schedule for each deliverables as per planned."
good,"Worked for them doing refinery construction and always made good cash, lots of hours, management is Freemason heavy so decent guys. You put in a good days work for a days pay and no issue. Any sense of trouble making and you’ll be let go instantly. Zero tolerance for drama queens, rats and bad attitudes."
good,"work outages and shutdowns in many locations good construction companies to work for fluor for bilfinger and systems gr... maintain Powerhouse ,,paper mills,, oil refineries I am mechanically inclined hard worker,, working construction over 5 years work bowler jobs seeking full time work  nccer trained   piefitter so if there jobs to be done"
good,I really enjoyed my time at Fluor. However it was very demanding with the senior leaders in the US needed to see results in what was a declining market at the time. I would say it was quite a political enviroment to work especially  between business units which was not healthy. Within our business unit however the team worked very well together
good,"Employee Friendly Company, Gives good exposure towards work."
good,I just love they ways of ways of work respectful please Days to Day always on time I wish others jobs was like this!On one day I was late I forgot my bag and they came thew for me I got a new one
good,"No real financial benefit due to downturn in market.  But great place to work.  Good learning experience. Management are down to earth and have an open door policy. Long hours and heavy work load, but great support from management"
good,Busy schedule hard to balance family and work but great pay with excellent management and great team players. Advancement was a bit stiff but helped me accelerate my skills in the field.
good,"Satisfying  work.  Company generally recognizes and rewards good work"
good,Fluor has a very safety oriented work environment. Strict adherence to safety procedures and a strong safety first culture. The remote site requires a very independent and self motivated employee. The ability to work alone and make critical decisions is paramount to success.
good,"Got to travel, deadlines were lenient and forgiving, great people to work for. Had the opportunity to build multiple power plants and small projects with them."
good,"Fluor provided an opportunity to within a disaster relief  agency. It was the most rewarding job in my life. The reason is because your supporting organizations that have been devastated by hurricanes, floods, fires. and any other disaster that severely hit an area or community. I really felt I giving back and assisting Americans to rebuild their businesses and communities."
good,They needed some experienced help with the material office in the field  so they offered me a temporary position... Until the next job available..I really enjoyed working with management there.
good,They need more time off and they need to stick with a schedule instead of changing it the workers would appreciate it more I think they would respect them more
good,Great management and employee interaction. Required tools provided. Planning was exceptional for new construction. Safety was a little overboard and some requirements unnecessary.
good,"Fluor was not perfect but it was one of the most relaxed and flexible working environments and the best health insurance I have ever had. The group of maintenance and electricians working there, were some of the nicest people I have ever worked with. I miss them dearly."
good,"Day would start out with a brief meeting to go over any existing issues, highlight areas that needed to be worked on, and opened up for contributions from the techs. The rest of the day, we worked on customer issues and our extra work assigned specifically to each tech."
good,"usually managemnet come up with stupid rules just to make employees life harder"
good,I enjoyed the job because I was always working on something different. It allowed me to advance my skills more than most jobs. On the down side there was very little job security.
good,This job paid one of the best salaries I have ever earned. Working on a Russian based project which I was headhunted for by the boss who i had worked in Russia for previously. He knew I could speak a little Russian and was familiar with Russian procedures and standards.
good,Fluor has a good work ethic and has good communication between management and its employees. They are very focused on safety and making sure you go home at the end of the day.
good,towards the end of May 2017 basic safety culture & concerns did not exist. I left to assist with a grand child that had a mental breakdown. i filed unemployment & was told they considered this job abandonment  due to it being a crisis involving a Grand Child & not a direct descendant. I applied for jobs again this year and was not hired for any. Safety on the job in Sc was at an all time low in May 2017. The project was officially Shut down 07/31/2017.
good,"Projects are structured - roles are clear - good working culture - opportunities to study on line - "
good,"There has been a noticeable decline in the culture at Fluor over the past number of years."
good,"Fluor has a great safety program and good people. I had a great opportunity in advancing my carrier. The benefits were excellent. The day to day workload was decent and sometimes very challenging. "
good,It's been too long ago to write a review for this job.  I remember this being a great company to work for.  Great bunch of guys back then and really helped.
good,Daily we would assist customers in their deployment and redeployment needs as far as preparing and storage of cargo for air transport via military or contract commercial aircraft. The workplace culture was very diverse and while this could cause barriers I enjoyed the challenge of working with others from different backgrounds. This opened possible new ways of taking on new projects and assisting the variety of customers we took on daily. The most enjoyable part of the job was the team work it required and being able to interact and assist the customers as needed.
good,"Working in Fluor has been an interesting experience. The office environment is good and everybody appears to be happy overall. The best benefit appears to be paid overtime, since it appears it is very common in this country not to be paid for that. Having said that, most people are constantly having to stay an average of an hour to two hours after each shift ends, and having to work on weekends quite often – at least when it comes to the Marketing Services department. There does not seem to be a good work-life balance especially when it comes to working in the night shift. Demand for work seems to be much higher in the Manila office compared to the other offices as it costs the company much less to have that office work more hours. It’s almost slavery. Other than the high demand for work, it is a good place to work overall. Just seems like you have to give up your social/family life to work in the Sales/Marketing Services department."
good,"Due to recession, no job security .However, work culture and employee benefits are good in fluor."
good,Interesting projects to work on and never gets boring. Everything is constantly new and changing from project to project. Appeals to people who are interested in moving around to different offices and field locations to gain experience and have new experiences.
good,Fluor is cool company to work for. Hopefully I will work for them again My forman was  not so cool! But Other than That It was cool. The hours were good And the money was great. Safety was a problem> It got much better!
good,"When on a project the days are full and fast paced."
good,Work in multicultural environment and international experience gained. Enjoying the work culture within Fluor daniel and it has given a good benefits to my work experience.
good,Management not to friendly. Very divercse group of people to work with. Very Safety conscious. not very open to suggestions on how to make the job easier.
good,"Overall Fluor was a good company to work for. They have great people, good structure and practices/procedures. The downside was long hours, stress and salary."
good,"Fluor is a good Company to work for overall. Great people, industry leader, respected name, etc. Most jobs would be considered high stress, especially project execution roles. The most frustrating aspect of working for Fluor was knowing that you could be making more money elsewhere with one of their competitors."
good,This is a good company but is having trouble with recent u.s. jobs. There are not enough jobs in the regions I would like to work and that is the main reason for me leaving.
good,The work environment and Houston location were great. The projects were interesting and challenging. The available resources were for the most part very capable.
good,I joined the company and was assigned to different projects throughout the year. My experience with Fluor has been good so far as I have been in a good working environment with management that has been very supportive. Great training tools and mentoring programs.
good,"Overall it is a decent place to work.  As always, the people you work with is what makes a job good.  They .pay was good.  I would have rather been a direct employee with benefits, but Fluor mostly hire contract through TRS"
good,"Arrive at 7 am and review scheduled deliveries. Check out the forklift truck and then check in with my manager. Walk through the warehouse to ensure everything is in order. Review paperwork and inspect equipment to be received before signing  for it,"
good,Workplace culture is very good. Have OneFluor mindset for everything we do. People are helpful is understanding your problems. The best thing which I like is the company's approach towards business is most Ethical.
good,Corporate management was good. Okay benefits and 401k.. competitive enough. Hard to negotiate a raise from what you are hired in at. Great safety culture and materials.
good,"Fluor is a good company to work for. Healthcare could be better, seeing as us inspectors often get in hazardous situations. Vision insurance offered is really not that great."
good,good money but didnt last long enough. We had a hard time getting enough experienced electricians and helpers. No continuity between dayshift and night shift
good,Was a learning experience for being on a Nuclear Plant for the first time. Learned how to make Labels. The work was at a slower pace than what I was use to. The hardest part of the job was getting use to working the night shift but really enjoyed it. The most enjoyable part of the job were the people.
good,"Good pay, safety oriented. Enjoyed my time with fluor. Alot of great employees. Management left something to be desired, but needed changes were made and things got alot better. Would definitely work with fluor again!!"
good,"Ze geven je verantwoordelijkheid om je job te doen."
good,Although the job was only a temporary it was a great way to learn about the oil and gas industry and make some great connections for possible future job oppourtunities. The pay was great and I learned a lot of great new skills.
good,"Good company to work with."
good,"A great company to work for when oil is booming, there are many opportunities to get involved in extra curriculars which grow your network and career. Unfortunately it was every man and women for themselves when times got tough."
good,If you did your job like you were suppose to then you were pretty much left alone. The atmosphere was laid back. There are so many people to learn from if you really wanted.
good,Not a bad company to work for. I was laid off due to lack of work but if i had o opportunity to stay with them i would. Management looked out for the workers and culture on sites was positive.
good,"Very productive and challenging.  Job role had a lot of responsibility, and even more accountability.  Very demanding of personal time and family sacrifice."
good,"La empresa es muy buena pero una vez acabado el proyecto despide a su personal, sin esperar siquiera un mes para ver si puede tener otro trabajo."
good,Nice place to make money not many days off. Management could probably have done better. But they are extremely concerned about safety. Was not enough experienced craftsmen.
good,A fast paced environment working on some of the largest and most complex projects in the world.Allowed to work with a minimum of supervision. A true sense of accomplishment in completing these projects.
good,"We celebrate all the festival ( Christmas, Thanks Giving, New Year, Holi.... so on etc. but the best part is the company celebrate the Womens Day . All the leadership people appriciate all the female staff and give Rose to us , even they give the Rose to the Pantry girl staff also and appreciate them for their work."
good,i worked with them and the VC Summer New nuclear construction site. they were a great company to work for but were put in a unwinnable situation. i would work for this company anytime in the future.
good,"Fluor wasn't bad to work for. The benefits are below average and they didn't use a standard for who got some monetary assistance working away from home, otherwise I'd recommend Fluor to others."
good,A lot of hours and not able to take a lot of time off but management was great to work for. the pay was great and the willingness to help from management was great.
good,"Workplace culture is very friendly and enjoyable. There are several groups that help new graduates make friends and develop relationships other new graduates and senior employees. "
good,Over all a good company to work for.  Benefits were overall good for the industry. Management in some groups showed favoritism and not interested in employee growth.
good,"Fluor is a Great company to work for. They are a very progressive company with strong values and a consistent structure that enables their employees to perform to the best of their ability giving them every opportunity to succeed. The most attractive value and the most important value Fluor has, is that they put their employee's and contractors safety ahead of everything else. I would recommend working for this company to anyone."
good,I had a good run at Fluor for 5 years and learned some valuable skills.  Was able to work autonomously and independent while still being part of the overall team.  Flexible work hours made work/life balance easy to achieve.
good,"Good experience, learned a lot about the site work. Worked with all departments. The craft were treated to lunches each quarter and to crew of the month to uplift the moral of the site. The site is like a city of its own."
good,I like fluor itself as a company but the job in Baytown texas was horrible. there was favoritism and they was very racist. but I like my foreman she was awesome but as a whole the job was terrible.
good,I have been with this company for over 5 years collectively. No company is perfect but the experience has been great for me. Working with different trades has been one of the most beneficial qualities of this job.
good,"The typical work day was from the beginning very pleasurable and the staff for the most part was knowledgeable and friendly. I worked as an instructor in the Gulfcoast Regional Training Center."
good,"Utilizes a strong matrix management system, emphasizing and providing strong guidance in meeting the company vision. Overall it is a good company to work for."
good,"Hard, long, hours. High expectations. Tight budgets and deadlines. Satisfying work experience, possibilities for career advancement, and scenic campus."
good,Flour was also a great company to work for.  Very fair.  Training was a great program.  People were great and educated.  Working 9 hours a day gave us the opportunity to take every other Friday off.
good,"One thing I've definitely noticed about working for Fluor is the number of people that have been with the company for a very long time. They're a very solid company that is continuously expanding across the globe."
good,I enjoyed my time with Fluor. I was treated fair and paid well. I would recommend this company to my friends. Quality work was produced by their projects.
good,"A typical work day in the office is busy. The management was good at times but other times it was unorganized and chaotic. The reason it was chaotic was because they changed their schedule every day. So it was hard to plan around the schedule."
good,"We always have weekly meetings with the project to discuss the work schedule,and if there are some problems to sit down and resolve immediately.There are  training offered for some lesson learned encountered on past project to avoid this to happen again"
good,"Gain alot of experience as a pipefitter, pipetester, instrument fitter and Foreman.General construction. Of Navy Ships, Corps of Engineers. Vessels, River an Ocean Tugs and Bluk an Tanker Ships."

good,"Good working environment with supportive colleagues and good company benefits, the company provide trainings and mentoring for your career advancement"
good,A decent company to work for. You can hire in as a hand and move up to foreman. It's a lot of who you know to get in initially. The upper management were all buddies so things could of been better. Decent safety record although someone did get killed on site while I was there.
good,"What I learned:  New processes. Preparation of P&IDs, equipment sizing. Interaction  with other disciplines."
good,"is a nice place to work, every one tries to help one another ,if not to busy with his own problems with his line,foreman and top operators very helpful while learning process,all nice people work their."
good,"It's been more than 100 years that FLUOR doing EPC business they already mastered in terms of management handling and how to execute their project. The management assure that their worker has enough knowledge by giving them concrete training technical or management.  The hardest part of the job is communication since FLUOR doing EPC business we deals with different nationality, we often communicate to our client, counter part & vendor around the world. for me communication is very important in these business. The most enjoyable part of the job is bonuses and incentives that you receive when you finish the project earlier."
good,"Mission, vision and values are clear and concise. Several large division make up Fluor and they mostly operate in line with the Corporate policies and procedures."
good,"Job Work/Life Balance -is what you make it."
good,work only Saturday night parttime job drove forklift 12 -13 hours night good job good people an supervisor seeing the b.m.w. going down the line
good,"We have a small department with friendly and hard working people. In general, big companies has more name recognition with more opportunities than most."
good,Too many family members work together & are given upper management jobs over people who are more skilled & have longer years of experience. But I need my job so I keep it to myself...
good,"It is a great place to work overall. With industry challenges it has become a concern for job security, however it seems to be addressing the risk."
good,"Good company, but behind the times. Needs updating to current time period. Not enough opportunity for advancement. Job dependent on what projects are available."
good,Existen posibilidades de desarrollo personal. Gerencia con visión clara de negocios.
good,Enjoyed working at Fluor. Met a lot of great people over the years. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning new things.
good,"Love working for Fluor Corp. The money is good, only thing is i wish i could get on the ground crew at the Texarkana Mill so i coud stay home for my kids."
good,Very busy - working coordination with Fluor's offices in India and Phillipines. Trained personnel on phone and emails.
good,"Great work-life balance, fun co-workers to be with, lots of learnings and opportunities but problem is how they really evaluate and assess the performance of the employees."
good,Everyone at Fluor really helped me in learning most aspects of my job as a boilermaker. The time that I have spent there is priceless.
good,"always with something to do and made the work week go by fast, administrative work was very detailed and knowledgeable and gave the insight of what the new area of the world trade center would become in the future"
good,"Am proud to be given a privilege to work for a well-known and prestigious company in the Engineering, Procurement, Construction, and Management portfolio."
good,"Working for Fluor has been a good experience. My co-workers are excellent people and have helped me learn and grow during my time with Fluor. My manager is a great person and has always been more than helpful in any area that I need. She also frequently took my group of co-workers out for group lunches and activities."
good,This was a good place to work. The people are very friendly. They are a little relaxed on standard processes but overall a good company to work for.
good,I have learned all the process engineering tools required in executing projects. Fluor senior employees help the juniors in knowing the process design concepts and procedures in executing the projects.
good,"i am to happy to start my career in fluor. knowledges are open, all are sharing minded."
good,"Básicamente el dia consistía en realizar las sesiones a quienes estaban en el programa de inglés; el primer año se hicieron tanto de manera grupal como también individual. También, parte del trabajo consistía en realizar reportes y gráficos de avance y asistencia y preparar material, el mismo que se diseñaba especialmente para cada alumno dependiendo de sus necesidades. Fue un muy buen aprendizaje, ya que hubo que crear y  adaptar no solo material, sino, pruebas de diagnóstico y métodos que nos ayudaran a marcar una diferencia en la manera de aprender en este caso  el  inglés. Siempre contamos con el apoyo de la empresa y los colegas, quienes cada vez más mostraron interés en ser incluidos en el programa. Lo mejor de un trabajo como este era la continuidad y la posibilidad de aprender todos los días, ya que cada dia era enfrentarse a temas distintos. La mayor dificultad fue con los cursos grupales al principio, ya que la empresa no tenía tantas salas y la preferencia era para las reuniones laborales y también fue difícil adaptarse a las cancelaciones por cargas de trabajo o reuniones de última hora, sin embargo poco a poco se logró normar esto de mejor manera."
good,"So far its good to be here with Fluor.."
good,"Se establecían los objetivos por tareas excavaciones, rellenos, ayuda de gremios, operativo invierno, etc y se asignaban los equipos necesarios con los consiguientes permisos de operación.  "
good,"everyday we would have a safety meeting for about an hour."
good,"un día tipico de trabajo en la montaña es con mucho frio, pero pasandola bien con los compañeros de trabajo,"
good,"- Work schedule is 9 hours Mon - Thu and 8 hours every other Friday. 80 hours per 2 weeks. 44 hours week one and 36 hours week two. "
good,"I have worked for Fluor for 4 years.  It is a very diverse and intense work force. Fluor has multiple contracts in multiple countries.  Speaking strictly as an emplyee in Afghanistan, our LOGCAP contract is 33% filled with Food Services alone.  We prepare food for a multi-cultural clientale, and thus prepare foods that we would have never otherwise be exposed to."
good,"Long hours, not much to do after working 12 hours daily. Company is very safety oriented."
good,I enjoy building new building and remolding them as well. Every job is different and equipment and tools are always changing. I love to run jobs and finish early. The hardest part of a job is the unknowns that get miss in take offs and time has not been allowed for it. The most enjoyable part is the finished product and a happy customer.
good,"Conducted water analysis, treatment, and control on boilers;HVAC"
good,"We work twelve hour days seven days a week.  The people we work with are wonderful."
good,"Great work environment."
good,"I was an engineering manager at a client facility.  Work was good, but slowed down in the end.  "
good,the foreman on site was easy going let us operators know what he wanted and the work got finish as ask.the other operators onsite were good.
good,"The daily interaction with various people within the project enhanced my experience because the Project team (Project Manager, Project Controls, Finance, Docuement Control and other desciplines) was placed in one office and improved delivery of the Project and mostly communication."
good,"Es war sehr interessant für mich in Afghanistan zu arbeiten, Ich habe nach 5 Jahre Erfragung viel mit mir mitgenommen."
good,"• As a member of the Engineering CAD group, participated in utility infrastructure and plant design"
good,"Fluor is a great place to work. However, as a contractor in these economic times job security is not very stable. When you have work, it is very busy and enjoyable. Great people to work with. Managers are great, coworkers are great. There are numerous opportunities to work in the community on projects. Fluor really gives to the community and wants its employees to get involved. I like that about the company."
good,Depende si es en Oficina o en Terreno.
good,They are not open anymore.
good,local job with management that cares about people. Self Motivation is a must.
good,Excellent career development potential with ample opportunity to learn new skills
good,Company was growing and looks to be still growing and has a good out look.
good,"Fluor has a #1 goal of safety for everyone. They try to provide every tool necessary for you to be successful. Management varies from each project, but overall is supportive."
good,Great team members to work with and also travel with to different jobs. Management tries to keep a core group of guys working together and that helps in many different ways.
good,Pleasant company to work for I've been with the company for over 15 years. Would stay if they could provide employment after this assignment. Opportunity for growth and development. Company has afforded me with life changing opportunities that I would not has received else where.
good,I worked overseas in Afghanistan for Fluor and enjoyed it all  I would definitely do it again  I have a better understanding of our great military personnel while working beside them
good,"I enjoyed working with Fluor due to the challenges and online training's they have provided. Workmates are so kind and easy to communicate with, friendly and professional."
good,"The workplace culture is one of the perks in working with Fluor especially in our department. We are all united, we help each other grow, and motivate each other. In my nine months in Fluor, i've learned so much about instrumentation and control systems. Our bosses are willing to share to us their experiences and knowledge."
good,Fluor is a very nice company with a lovely campus in Greenville SC. I was able to learn from coworkers and challenged with opportunities to make workflow improvements.
good,"Fluor has been good to me over the years.  They gave me the opportunity to change roles, travel/work around the world, and overall they pay well.  Unfortunately they haven't been performing well the last few years and that has affected the company outlook."
good,"I enjoyed my time there, fair pay , I would recommend the place to a friend. The pace is slow but they are very safety oriented...……………………………………………….."
good,Great place to work ! I went into it not knowing anything about construction and they sure fill you in! There main goal for everything is safety! Wish I could still.work there but got layed off!
good,It’s all in the Management/Superintendents that you work for and NOT the Actual Company FLUOR as a whole. FLUOR is a great organization to work for with great benefits also
good,"thanks for the great advice at the work place and the people around safe with a well kept ,clen environment where people can work safely around their coworkers"
good,Ambiente agradable pero deficiente en crecimiento laboral.
good,"Provided growth for individual learning and advancement. Department management provided full support and push for personal career path choices. Project managements lack knowledge, experience and direction to properly executed cost efficient projects."
good,Nice people through out the company. The benefits are really god and they have a quaint little gym. They have flex hours which is nice when  you have to commute in Houston.
good,"Fluor Corp. was a fast-paced environment.  It was a safety-focused company.  Overall, I liked working for Fluor Corp.  I liked the friendships that I made."
good,"Many have to leave the company and come back to advance thier career. I did receive good support in career development and was afforded opportunities to grow, but my salary never reflected my growth."
good,Benefits and salary were fine.  Site manager did not manage the site and was absent from the site 90% of the time.  Upper management did nothing to control then situation.
good,Loved my time with Fluor.  Great people and great opportunities.  Benefits are good and all the management teams I worked with were awesome. Work well with allowing time off in emergency situations.
good,"I was thrilled to work for this company, I was apart of an workforce that was supplying the local area a New State of the are Nuclear facility.  The sense of being apart of this dynamic team of people was one of the most exciting careers that I've been apart of."
good,"The company was a good start for me being a entry level personnel. I learned a lot from the people I worked with, and they were willing to teach you if you were willing to learn."
good,It was an overall good experience for someone my age. It was scrambled at times but overall we all got our jobs done at the end of the day. I’d work there again if I had to.
good,"The ethics of the company is poor but all in all I enjoyed working for this company."
good,It was power outages!! And at times it would be fast past!!! I learned how to weld different stuff!! Welding to me is art!!!  I also learned different ways to weld!! And that was really something to learn!!! And I got to work with some of the greatest welders there where!!! I learned a lot from different welders!! I don't mine learning from other's!!that's how we grow to be the best!!! From others!!!
good,"I was a part of a LOGCAP overseas contract with Fluor. Travel is frequent, pay is really good, supervisors/management were easy to get along with and took care of us. If you don't mind working in hostile locations and or inclement weather, this job is a good experience with very good pay."
good,95 percent of the people there were nice  75 percent of the white hats were  But you had to put up with them or lose your job  other than that it was a good place
good,"Recently transitioned from previous company. Management is fairly new, but offers great knowledge and potential growth opportunity. Starting wage offered in transition, is drastically less than most in this field."
good,"overall experience at the site was great. great compensation. hours were good, but upper management destroyed the site. family hiring family & do not have a clue what's going on"
good,"fluor was a great company to work for offered me a chance to advance and move forward within the company,and show what i could do as a leader and show my skills as an operator . towards the end it got a little more competitive with who they would keep to finish out the project. Being chosen to finish the project was another great opportunity to show Fluor that they made a great choice in getting the job done.. the most enjoyable job i have ever had and being able to guide others and being told i was one of the best General Foreman that they have ever worked for,and for me that meant alot .."
good,the main interest in my position is staying employed.  Management does their best to keep you as long as you perform up to standards.  Work environment is professional with little to no office drama you can witness at other places.    everyone is always willing to help each other.
good,"Typical day at work is quite cool, very professional environment."
good,"I love my job at FBP. I have learned so much about industrial hygiene, safety, and just my job ion general. Getting to work around the people I do makes it not seem like work."
good,The work place culture was very collaborative. The management was very thoughtful and considerate. The best part of the job were the people I worked with. I enjoyed working there.
good,High job stress due company losing maintenance contract for IBM US wide and inability to get parts due shut down of credit accounts with suppliers. Hardest part of job was age of equipment and it's poor condition.
good,"Very family oriented company"
good,Fluor's management is progressive. Workers' performance is reviewed annually. Annual raises are based on performance. Fluor's clients dictate the work pace and many times overtime is expected.
good,is a very good place to work they keep the people thats work hard and always are busy working and they give good recognition to -people ho deserved they got benefits health care dentist 41k ect...
good,"So I was in the Energy and Chemicals division. The projects were well structured, however each had its ups and downs based on the project management team. Compensation was great, and the Time Off With Pay system is awesome. Now, since Fluor is a contracted by its clients, if the contracts are not coming in, work dries up and reduction in force layoffs happen."
good,Takes care of their employees. Unfortunately our contract on the project I was working on had ended and I was unwilling to relocate for another position.
good,"I say it's a great place to work because I just enjoy what I do. That and I love the sense of accomplishment it gave me. "
good,"Great company, however the craft supervisors were very immature and focused more on implying rules rather than building a plant. I would go back to FLUOR but only at a different location."
good,Working in an EPCM Company is a fulfilling job. My role as a Vessel Designer/Drafter is to produce Pressure Vessel Drawings based on the Data Information from the Pressure Vessel Commodity Engineer. Most of the days are busy communicating with various project disciplines from the beginning to the end stage of the project. The management is always supportive throughout the project. The hardest part of the job is the last stage which is the detailing process.
good,Great place to work and create new industrial sites.most of these jobs you will be traveling.great people to work with.i plan on working with fluor again someday.
good,"a typical day is plan you work work you plan"
good,Employment at Fluor has been very rewarding. Opportunities are given to those that choose to accept them. The pay rate is comparable with other EPC companies in the Houston area.
good,"Exciting, fast-paced projects working with highly motivated team members and clients who truly appreciate your work.  Immediate management was very supportive and went the added mile to back up the team.  Uncertain on effectiveness of upper management, which at times seemed unreceptive to process improvements as well as the future of our business line."
good,"Just like any jobs good days and bad days, some days equipment & sometime personnel attitude. Personality and ability skills were hard to adjust.lots of winning.never met a CEO.lot of bickering .My hardest part on  the job every body carry your own weight.It when at end of day everyone is accounted  for on injury &  job is complete"
good,"I Have mainly good things to say about working with Fluor. Coming from a third generation electrician I would like to see more emphasis from management towards craftsmanship. The product installed and presented to the client is and should be a reflection of both the employee and the company .  Same goes for management controlling there projects progression and employee's actions. Overall as at any company if you seek advancement in your trade if you put forth the effort the opportunity to do so is there. I've met alot of great  co-workers, supervisor's, and management employee's that take pride in what they do. I'd recommend Fluor to anyone ."
good,"A target daily accomplishment should be done within the day for an 8 working hour. Time management is essential to smoothly perform all the task. The job is hard in some ways where pressure on deadlines, clients, superiors, managers comes in but that's the way it is. That's why we are there in the first place. Challenging I could say but eventually I enjoyed the job."
good,"Slow work days. Not the most social of atmosphere. Average employee aged 55. Being a government contract, not a lot of extra perks to working here, so don't expect a ping-pong table anytime soon."
good,"Usually normal day at work, sometimes hectic (not complaining about it)."
good,"Contract ended. Now CH2MHill lead contract (Four Rivers Nuclear Partnership). Worked 9-80's."
good,Great people. Teamwork atmosphere. Opportunity for growth as technical specialist or moving into the project - management side. Good work/life balance
good,"I was offered good benefits and earned a great hourly wage, including overtime pay. They offered plenty of working hours. Ten hour days at five days a week and Saturday's optional."
good,"Fluor is good firm, but is struggling to adapt to changing competitive pressures and the markets it serves, especially in the U.S. where it is seeing declining new awards and profitability."
good,They will take care of you well there. It's a face pased culture so if that is not for you you wont last. The project was a good one just was coming to the end and had to layoff
good,"Good pay, stressful situations on occasion, great managers, too many foreman not meeting requirements for providing timekeeping information, poor IT infrastructure, software not supported well"
good,Fluor has a great work culture and I would go back to work for then right now however the market the way it is they really don't have any projects to speak of. To bad because the last two company's I had had to work  should not be in the business.
good,"Fluor is a very large corporation so only go to work for them if you understand the inner workings of large companies.  It's a good place to work, overall, if you are conducive to this type of large corporate environment, otherwise, stay away."
good,"Good place to work overall, the poor upper management notwithstanding. I was working at the VC Summer debacle and the job was good overall. The managers treat the workers fairly and the pay is great if you work the hours you're supposed to. I'd work for em again."
good,"Fluor was a great place to work. With every job there are positives and negatives. Some of the positives were, good wages, good shift schedule, great coworkers. Some of the negatives were crammed office space, and long work days."
good,"I worked 12-15 hours a day.  It was a physical demanding job, not for the faint of heart.  If you couldn't carry 10-20 pounds on your back up a ladder or across the yard continually its not for you.  I left with the highest rating of our 20 man crew.  I broke my back for that company.  Nothing bad to say about my foreman or crew."
good,"good company to work for and good people to work with "
good,"Fluor is a good company to be with,  compensation is good and so are the benefits.  Some of the jobs I've been on with them management was not very good but other than that it's a good place to work and make a comfortable living."
good,I like working for Flour I think overall its a good company to work fr if it wasn't for the project I was on I would still be there I enjoyed working there
good,"Good company with good benefits. Job could be stressful at times. Job was fast paced and did require a lot of overtime, nights and weekends. Manager was not the best."
good,"Many challenging projects with the possibility of acquiring experience"
good,"Good Job,great guys to work with.Sometimes a bit crazy,too many things on the go,which one to start with,or we need more guys doing this,so intial job would suffer."
good,I'm a long time employee and Fluor has treated me well over those years.  Fluor is great at preparing you for the next role and providing opportunities for those who wish.
good,"Good place to work, i have learned so many things related to work and personal attitude. Company Culture is good. All supportive management, Working environment always helpful."
good,"Long Work Hours, No friends and family time always tire. People running jobs that don't have the expierence or education to do so. Poor management. not getting anything done"
good,"worked materials warehouse, tool room, US mailroom, truck and aircraft cargo hauling. afghanistan was different and yet rewarding in different opportunities to do different jobs."
good,Fluor is a great company to work for you get to use the latest technology and work on big projects its downfall however is that they do not invest in contractors and end up shutting down a large group of potential future leaders I have contracted for Fluor for 8.5 years now and have enjoyed every moment except for not being able to do any training
good,"I entered the company as a new graduate, and the ambiance of work there is pretty good. Friendly employees and they are welcome to teach you. They are not selfish when it comes to training and learning, and that is a big key factor for each individual's career advancement"
good,The nature of contracting is unstable. Job security doesn't really exist. My experience with the company has been pretty good over all. No real complaints.
good,This job was the better paying job. There were too many people trying to get in and out of this job with only one entrance. With around 4500 employees you spend way too much time waiting in lines to get any work done.
good,Great company to work for. Staff and project was great. Salary and flexibilty was good. Training and career advancement was a great aspect of this company.
good,They are a big construction firm and have lots of employees and projects.  The pay is great. The benefits are very good with the exception of the one year employment period required to receive 401k matching.
good,I love working there. It is laid back nobody bother you until its crunch time. Then you have to go get it. Everybody working together as a team. Now that's how you get a job done
good,thumbs up! very conducive workplace. very educational working with highly standard expert professionals. learn how to be very keen with details and collaborate with other disciplines/departments
good,"FIRST JOB"
good,"It is a highly diverse organization employing professionals from around the world. The work is very interesting, but sometimes work/life balance might suffer. Overall - a good place to work."
good,One of the most ethical companies I have worked for and a highly respected one. I had great opportunities and challenges working in large projects worldwide under highly respected management professionals.
good,"Charla de seguridad en temas relacionados al día"
good,"It was one of the hardest profiles I've ever had to deal with; I provided direct support to the U.S. Armed forces that operated out of a war zone.  "
good,I enjoyed the work. I got to work with some very talented people from around the world. I appreciated the attention to safety .
good,Gives more time for family and professional growth. Job security especially for contractual employees is not good. Compensation ia very good. But health benifits are poor.
good,Salary with per diem and overtime was great. Very little job security it client say layoffs no contact from management just hand in your badge and leave.
good,"Good multinational company. Compensation is good, however most of their employees are contractual which i think is one of the downside. Job security for employees is not stable."
good,"everyday is long and hot, but as a team we remain positive and safe. Learning new electrical fundamentals regularly is rewarding even after been an electrician for 18 years. Liaising and getting involved with management provides a positive and balanced work load. The most enjoyable part of the job would be team bonding and 1 weeks R&R with the family."
good,Fluor has a flexible work schedule and work/life balance.  Job advancement is somewhat difficult to achieve as they tend to bring in people from other locations instead of hiring within.

I expanded my knowledge of all areas in Contracting to include Compliance, Small Business Program, Contract Formation, and all phases of Contract Administration from award through closeout.  With very few exceptions, management was very supportive and stood behind their staff.  I really enjoyed working with all the co-workers and members of my staff. All were very professional.  The hardest part of the job was Project life in a war Country.  The most enjoyable part of the job was how the team pulled together."

good,"Hard but offer opportunity for safe work,with the lack of communication and training requirements. no opportunity for advancement or development."
good,"Fluor jobs are no more successful than the Site leaders allow.

A typical day for me would be grinding, pulling,climbing more than 6 feet and getting inside holes no bigger than basketball rim. My foremans were very respectful and professional. I worked by myself most of the time but when I did have someone with me we got along real good. The hardest part of the job was driving to Mount Pleasant every morning at 4:00 a.m. I made good money, real good money ,but it wasn't just about that I also learned alot and met different people."
good,Working with Fluor is absolutely of its high standard in terms of Project Management System giving a client's a due satisfaction on the performance of accuracy and professionalism.

good,"Solid company, going through reorganization process that in general will last several years.  Severe lay offs going on now.  People are great at the headquarters in Irving."
good,This company puts time and money into the safety of their people. In a line of work that has one of the highest death rates in the USA this is very important. A lot of companies out there talk about safety. But very few back it up with down time and money. Fluor Corp on the other hand would rather you not get any work done and return home safe.

Then they put me in an NCCER electrical class in order to better myself.. This is a very good company and wish they were still local.
good,"The company is made up of very intelligent, motivated individuals and managers that get the job done but has potential for growth in project management. It has a very distinct culture that has historically put technical excellence above everything else. The pay is decent and doesn't fluctuate much negatively (or positively) with market trends.

good,"I enjoyed working for Fluor very much, but if you ever go out with a sickness, they will find a way to let you know they don't have a spot for you to come back to and then you end up having to find another job. This has happened to several people I know including myself. "

Especially when work is slow you are just a number, doesn't matter your situation, just how much money they are willing to spend on you.  However the years I have worked here have been prosperous.  Good pay and benefits! But once they don't need you you are gone no matter what you did for them."

good,"Typically I would check the HVAC systems for proper operation and alarms then investigate or assign someone to investigate and attend to any issues that I found.  I learned that there is usually more than one solution to a problem.  The trick is to find the most effective and efficient solution for a problem.  I had great managers that supported me and used me as an example for my co-workers to follow.  I never met a challenge I couldn't face.  I enjoyed most of my co-workers and got along with them.  I believe they all had the knowledge to do the job, but a couple had the wrong attitude toward the job at hand and it effected they're work performance.  The hardest part of the job was leaving it with projects I was working on still undone.  The best part of the job was the sense of accomplishment I got from completing a task or project on time and under budget.  I also very much miss the people I was privileged to work with."

good,"Fluor is a mixed bag. It's a huge, multi billion dollar company with a lot going on. True, as with any engineering company, there is going to be an ebb and flow to the work load, but that's to be expected. There is always SOMETHING going on, and the management really encourages their employees to get involved and get out to the field. However, if you don't really push and prod and bother people, you aren't going to get very far with any endeavor. Fluor is very old school. I can't think of any other way to put it."
good,Great work place. Lively co-workers and management. Learn a lot.
good,"Work environment was harsh.....working in a Project in a country at war (Afghanistan). Living conditions could vary from very rough (living in a 200 man tent) or so-so (living in a metal container). Working hours are long, 12/7."
good,"Because of the smelter, it could be very dangerous. SAP program is not implemented well or the knowledge of the program."

good,"Various tasks to assist the Asset Management group "
good,Start my day with morning meeting then off to order all required material. Have separate meeting with my dept leads to talk about thier goals for the day. Assign jobs as as needed to stay in compliance with company policies.  All day long deal with military and the problems. Coordinate with with other dept to facilitate new work to be done. During rocket attacks my main responsibilities was to hold accountability for all personnel in shop. After that i was directed to go to seen and rebuild all destroyed building over night to include all aspects of work.  I had 130 guys under me in 5 different dept. Hardest part of our job was maintaining all 3800 buildings. The experience i received was the best part of the job.
good,"Inspect truck first thing in the am. Sprayed water on roadway for the sweeper.Meeting every am with management,management was very good and fair.

good,"A typical day gave me many opportunities to learn new procedures and set reachable goals in prioritizing my work load. I came through the front door as the receptionist and within the seven years I worked for Fluoresco I had managed the invoicing, payroll, and human resources for the local division. I feel this is has been the most educational job of my career. There was time to chat it up with co-workers while keeping the normal professional environment accustomed to the office. The hardest part of my job for Fluoresco was the mis management in the corporate division. One supervisor would make a new guideline to follow and another one would change it before the work day had ended which caused some confusion at the local level. The most enjoyable part of my job was going to work every day to a job I never felt was in jeopardy because I was a dedicated employee that gave attention to detail and set daily goals to accomplish even more than I was required."
good,Co-workers very friendly and easy to work with. Very informative and willing to help the new guy out.

good,"Each project has its own level of stress at work. Typical day could be a series of meetings if you are in the lead position. Concern in the company is mainly job security because you can be removed easily especially if you are contractual. But if you are looking for a good environment and work life balance, this should be the company you need to experience."
good,"as a contractor, your employment depends on management and sales' ability to win work, which means job security is low right now.  there are times of busyness and times of nothing. flexible work place with good vacation benefits."

good,"Fluor is one of the premier international E&C companies.  Their Project Management and Procurement/Supply Chain capabilities are second to none.  The same is still true about Process/Chemical Engineering.  However, the industry has changed and the engineering part has become a commodity, at least for detailed engineering.  Therefore, most of the work is done in low cost countries.  It is currently run by executives with sales/business backgrounds rather than people with technical backgrounds, so the former culture of technical excellence has been diminished somewhat."

good,"A typical day of work has me on the phone with vendors to order materials such as Gate valves and pressure piping components. New work orders are constantly flowing in which I receive and review with the site manager. Next i start a field binder that the foremen & crews can work off. This will include compiling a job specific Inspection & Test Plan after engineering, code and client specifications have been reviewed and agreed upon, drafting piping isometrics and outlining critical hold points for NDE, Testing before the next step of the job can begin. Periodically throughout my two week shift in Norman Wells NT, I will be involved in welding inspection, flange bolt up and torque reviewing and witness hydro pressure testing of fabricated piping. As this is a very old plant many jobs pose challenges that are exciting to work with. Some examples are sourcing 30 yr old valve s that do not exist with replacements from over seas countries such as Australia, the UK etc. S then having to get an approved coating vendor set up to internally coat the valves as per client specifications and ship up to site in a timely manner. Since this is a maintenance work on Canadas most northern oilfield the logistics of getting materials by Ice road, Barge or Flight to site in time to meet schedule requirements can be a bit daunting at times. Never the less we have been maintaining ESSOs plant and Oil Field since 2016 and the client is generally happy with my work and our company as a whole as everyday there is something new for us to learn on this site. There is never a dull moment at this job, i"

In general I have always been lucky enough to work with a good team of piping designers. When a project is in full swing the average working days go very quickly with reviewing the model for continuity, answering technical questions from junior designers and other disciplines, attending meetings and keeping key documents up to date. With every new project you are always learning something new. The 3rd Gen modularization concept was new to me but made sense when you consider the limited on-site construction window due to adverse weather conditions in Canada. I love working in the the piping department as it seems to attract engineers who are hard working but who also know how to let their hair down at social events.

good,"A typical day at work would be we would, first sign in and then we would get an STA, that would tell us what our tasks were for the day. i enjoyed traveling to work. We would rarely ever have just a day that we would do nothing, Fluor is not very exact on dates where they say they will hire back, they would just keep pushing the date further and further back. the hardest park of the job would have to be getting used to the super long shifts when we get pushed into rush mode."

Many other projects are on 9/80 system, which is still a very good, providing employees with off days every other Friday. It also helps reducing the load of traffic during rush hour.

good,"This was by far my favorite job I'v ever had. I easily had enough work to last all day which I believe is important. The second there is nothing to do at work, it becomes so much more difficult to get through the rest of the day. I enjoyed each task I had and when I did have everything done my construction adviser would take me on safety walks around the mine site. It was the best of both worlds, I got to learn new computer and blueprint tasks which I very much enjoyed once I got the hang of them, and I was able to get outside quite a bit. Sitting all day isn't my ideal situation. I enjoyed every boss I had there and all the contractors were very nice as well as all my co-workers. The only hard part of the job was the fact that it was an hour commute and 10 hour days but we car pooled and like I said, I was in good company so it was not all that bad."
