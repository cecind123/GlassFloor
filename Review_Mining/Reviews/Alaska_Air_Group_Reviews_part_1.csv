rating,review
bad,"I worked full time for Alaska as a flight attendant for almost 5 years and my income was around $20,000 which is no where near the cost of living in any of the cities we are required to be based in. Theoretically you can live somewhere else and fly in *if* you can get trips that start late and end early in the day to catch flights. Then you have to fly way more because these kind of trips don't pay as much and you end up spending all of your time in the air, either commuting or working. Alaska wanted us to get permission before getting any other jobs."
bad,"It’s a stressful environment when you’re teammates are encouraged to report on each other instead of fostering a coaching environment it’s an environment of mistrust, from teammates to management and teammates to teammates. The culture is ripe with lack of communication, people have no people skills when it comes to each other or better yet the customers."
bad,"Here is what I experienced while working there."
bad,"They want to know what is wrong with me. Why do they know my name? Why do they like my work? One tried to threaten to sodomize me right in the middle of the flight from Paris, France, to Seattle, Washington."
bad,"honestly if Alaska knew the dynamics, they'd certainly change the reps and contractor who run it.  at 10.50 an hour less any benefit, overtime changes tax and pay goes down. "
bad,"Puppy mill ; Alaska Air always recruiting ; so you are just a number or a  stat (they get better pay if stats are up) ; on who will finish their boot camp. I was told that , I wasn’t taking up any extra help; I was there almost a hour while before and was ignored. And when you brought up what you need help ; their would roll in back of their head and tell you to look it up, in the manual. "
bad,Very understaffed and rude people to work with. Communication is horrible and everyone thinks they are better then the next. No one takes the time to listen to their employees.
bad,"If you desire your career and your long term employment history in todays' tough job market then do not work here. They hire managers with no real world experience. Then they promote their inner circles through cronyism and nepotism. Not much room to move up and even if you do, do you really want to? HR is a real disaster at the company. Online networking used to be a good thing, however this place has taken it to a whole new level. Promotions are not merit based. The place is all about cost cutting and no culture. They treat their employees like trash. Expendable with poverty level wages."
bad,"Just terrible, don't ever choose to work there for any reason, ever, under any circumstances, just keep on scrolling past the application site and MOVE ALONG!"
bad,"They only need people during the summer, and fire over half of the new hires afterwards for any reason. I have not been fired from a job in my 15 years of work until them. I would not recommend working here if you value your track record."
bad,"I applied to Alaska thinking it was an amazing airlines to work for, but it is not. Half of the people that got hire already quit due to the stressful environment. "
bad,"Over the past couple years Alaska Airlines has shifted in brand strategy and leadership has completely lost touch with employees. It's sad to see that a beloved brand treats its long term and valued employees as replaceable. It's a great brand to love, but a horrible brand to work for now (wasn't always the case)."
bad,Horrible they pay you 12.65 per hour barely above minimum wage. Now deduct 70 per month for union fees. People there prefer to apply for Medicaid and get food stamps to afford to work there. Benefits are good it you can afford it. Most of the trainer train because it comes with a pay raise which you can get after 6 months. When a supervisor tells you don't be an over achiever because they promote by seniority.
bad,"Co workers are not helpful and cut throat always complaining and gossiping. Alot of favouritism! Worst is the schedule (you wont get time to travel or have a normal life) they mandatory overtime you on purpose on your days off, your basically being treated like a robot you do ALOT of different things and even when your on your lunch leads/supervisor will watch you & ask you when you your off lunch. Very unprofessional demanding and horrible schedules."
bad,Provide customer service to airline passengers for a timely flight.  Make sure all the passenger needs are completely meet.
bad,They are really picky about been on time and writing people up very high turn over management is great just just been little difficult about arriving on time they don’t care if there was and accidents on the road or death in the family is there way or no way the union sucks they don’t really die much for you but take your money useless
bad,The managers are bullies and treat you very poorly. New hires are often tortured verbally and emotionally. Management doesn’t care about you unless you make it to union status. Management plays favoritism with people of common race. Lots of people in my hire class went home in tears due to management. One of the managers literally tried to fight me.
bad,Look for somewhere else to work. If you want a company that is family oriented. Alaska is not the place for you let this place be that last place you ever chose to work.
bad,The best part of working for Alaska is their flight benefits. The pay is way below minimum wage. Folks are constantly Junior Assigned for overtime and on your day off which is ridiculous.
bad,"I met plenty of kind, hard working people while I worked at Alaska. "
bad,Over the past decade Alaska Airlines culture has changed from a home town feel to a strong Corporate feel. Where you used to feel like you were walking into the local store you now feel like you are not even connected with your management team. They care more about the outside image that they forget about the front line worker.
bad,They treat the employees like dirt (at least in Alaska) . You can never get a straight answer out of the manager. You do your best and still get nothing out of it
bad,Management doesnt care about its employees. Multiple times i asked for help on important projects and the management decided to make brownies or plan potlucks instead then decided to be upset when I wasn't able to perform the task I had asked for help on. No help and a careless environment
bad,"There is no way of progressing at job, computer system old fashioned visual basic programming from the 1998 era. best perks is flights."
bad,"A typical work day would be to book travel for clients, help with changing of client travel plans. Resolve issues, delive genuine and creative service solutions to customers problems. The work was stressful and there was mandatory overtime almost every night."
bad,"There were few bright spots during my tenure with Alaska Airlines as a Lounge Hospitality Host."
bad,The Alaska Lounge at LAX has the worse manager. She doesn’t know what she’s doing. She needs to give up her seat. I do not recommend anyone to apply for the his job. The manager is fake and she would treat you like a slave l.
bad,"Alaska has some of the best benefits of any company in the world, but even that is not enough to compensate for the environment. Management is based on internal politics, and unfairly governed. Hours are based on bids by seniority. Be prepared for graveyard shifts, plus mandatory overtime with a schedule change every two to three months. Probation means no sick days are allowed for first 6 months. 98% phone time required. Bathroom breaks included in that 98%. Do not work here."
bad,Current management is really damaging the morale of its employees and they either don’t care or are just totally clueless even after poor employee survey results
bad,Customer service agents receive poor training & suffer hostile & non-supportive management.  Forced union participation but support is a sham. Mandatory overtime with 2-hrs off between 8-hr shifts so they don’t have to pay overtime.  Work hours & climate + commute leaves employees dangerously fatigued & accident prone at work & commuting.   A law suit waiting to happen against this company.
bad,"ABSOLUTE worst place to work. I honestly would rate them at ""0"" stars. I thought I had been hired for a fantastic company. Then I went in and this team does not support each other at all... in fact some act like high schooler's. It was very disappointing. There is a longer story here... too much to get into though."
bad,"This airline is not east coast oriented and neither does it plan to become. While is it holds a few bases east and south of, they only have them for boasting purposes. They acquired a great airline (Virgin America) and turned them into eskimos. Original Virgin employees are mistreated. Advancement options are slim to none and biased. The cost of living in NY is high and the pay is low. This is no place to call a career. It's just the next airline to sink of bankruptcy and poor customer complaints based on how they treat the employees. Can't wait to see this company sink!"
bad,There is a lot of favoritism at this work place and if they don’t like you they will put you in a position that no one else wants. Management doesn’t help you if there is a situation of discrimination going on at work. I have seen people end up crying and quitting this job. Great airlines bad work environment.
bad,"Passengers can be the nicest or the worst people ever. It is nice chatting to several people from all over but that is about it. The Leads will smile in your face, act like they adore you and are teaching you something but then use every question you may have against you. There is more gossip than a high school lunch room, even the 40-50yr olds participate in the stories. Truth is they hate their lives and their job so they take it out on the newbies."
bad,"If you like to be babysat, work at Alaska.  you are not allowed to me 1 minute late or your written up"
bad,"Working from is a nice perk, but the company itself is difficult. Sick days are checks against you, vacation must be taken a whole week at a time, no leeway."
bad,"Not Recommended, this place is the worse.  They treat new hires poorly.  Favoritism is huge with the leadership there, if you dont fit there group atmosphere they will find a reason to fire you , good luck."
bad,"managers   in the maintence field,   "
bad,You never know which shift your going to get and forget about being sick   Part time is not really an option until after years and when you do something that perhaps your unsure of no one has answers but by that point your being reviewed for probation or termination.
bad,"Management were always in bad moods, very low pay, night shifts, written up if you clock in 1 min later and3 strikes your out.  The drive on the 405 San Diego freeway is always a nightmare and it changed from day to day.  There is no way to predict what the traffic was like from day to day.  I  spent more time getting to the airport and back home then I did on my part time shift."
bad,noone there gets paid nearly enough for the amount of work that needs to be done management does not care about their employees or any of their needs.
bad,Long hours. Great employees. Management needs a lot of work. Terrible with hiring a diverse work group in management. Your actual vacation time off is often delayed due to “unforeseen circumstances. Feels as though you have to beg for your vacation or just time off.
bad,"Very poor leadership and awful team dynamics, they"
bad,Alaska Airlines believes that they are above all in your life. You are not allowed to take any time off for sick ever. You must cover your days off or it is an occurrence and you could be terminated. There is no work life balance or culture.
bad,"The job itself is not so bad, on any given day you may find yourself performing a wide range of duties. Being in a logistics warehouse provides great opportunity to learn many skills that can be beneficial for personal career growth. Poor Management and lack of fair compensation seem to be the biggest concern when it comes to Alaska Airlines. Current wages for the work being performed are below what anyone should be paid for the type of physically demanding work that is being performed, and comparatively speaking it is at the bottom of the pack among the airline industry. Most enjoyable aspect of this job is the many positive relationships that are formed with the great people that make up the workforce of Alaska airlines."
bad,Highly stressful. Hire inexperience people to plan the work load. Unflexible management style. Lack of culture. There is a high turn over rate in every division. They plan to fail everyday. Its a good gig for a stepping stone and the pay is decent. However it is not where you would want to retire from.
bad,"Pros:"
bad,"It's a good job for people who have nothing to do but work, your shift changes often and if your low you get mandatory overtime 4 hours added into your shift. You can trade your shifts away but you have to pay people otherwise it's nearly impossible  to get a day off even while trying to trade hours. You normally pay people 10 to 7 dollars an hours to give away a shift its counter productive to having free flights. Its rare for someone to take a shift without you paying them. This is the Boise one do not know if other branches do this. Its unlike anyother shift trading."
bad,"Don’t dare make any mistakes your head will be on a platter ! During “probation” you are watched like 2yr old ! And talked about like it’s a high school. Lead agents treat passengers horribly and get away with it ( very disturbing), supervisors tend to harass  and try to intimidate you, not at all what they portray it to be during training, which btw you learn absolutely nothing! You are pushed to where you don’t even want to ask for help because you are scared of the outcome!"
bad,"It is a typical call center position, work from home is the only option due to no space in the office. Make sure you have an apartment with enough nodes otherwise computer can go down a lot. The airline has metrics with talk time now which if computer goes down a lot it is not a realistic metric to achieve. Long hours, mandatory overtime, and takes time to pay your dues for seniority."
bad,"Management is terrible in dallas. Decent company. Just don't work for them in Dallas Lovefield. They have poor communication, and do not know how to run a station properly."
bad,"I was initially attracted to work at Alaska due to its gleaming reputation compared to other major airlines. I will say that the airline does a stellar job of marketing itself and generally proving travelers with an excellent experience. However what goes on behind the scenes is quite concerning. Micromanagement, dysfunction, poor leadership, drama, lack of process improvement..."
bad,"High turn over rate at the Seattle Station. I worked there for 10 + Years. For the most part it’s a fun place to work, you work with some Great Mechanics."
bad,Seniority based scheduling for shifts is horrible. Not accommodating to lifestyle or family aspects. Very corporate behavior towards employees. Stressful job for low pay.
bad,"No flexibility with schedules, extremely high turnover.  Only employees that transferred in stays with their job in DCA because they have already invested their time with the company.  An absolute 3rd world country sweatshop like mentality to run the station of DCA, couldn't take it anymore and left the company which I once thought of retiring from."
bad,"As a company, Alaska is going through a lot of changes. They're not big enough to compete with bigger national/international carriers, but too big to be considered a regional carrier. That challenging landscape is powering a lot of the upheaval they've undergone. Turnover and employee churn has been high lately. Culture and morale can vary greatly by department and team. Somehow there are still a lot of folks who love the company and identify with the culture despite all the turmoil."
bad,"This company has no compassion for employees and their circumstances, however, they expect you to provide the highest level of that to guests.  I lived almost many miles away and was not late unless I had a good reason and they still called everything and occurrence.  Put many miles on my car during training.  Spent a lot for gas and was fired because I was late with a good reason.  If you are older, do not waste your time with this company, they expect you to be a 23-yr-old no matter what.  Good flight benefits if you can ever get time off to utilize them.  Overtime is mandatory which is not disclosed in the job offer."
bad,"The only good thing about having worked for Alaska Airlines for 16 years was that, thanks to the Machinist Union, I was well compensated, especially during the last 5 years or so. Corporate management left a lot to be desired.  Company did not respect either its employees or its customers and was only focused on profits at all costs."
bad,Acceptance of company culture will be critical to success.
bad,"Fast paced, time sensitive job.  Not enough help and little support from mid-management.  Good pay at top end of union contact (12 yrs).  Great benefits."
bad,"Too much work for so little pay. Working outside in 40+ below, lots of labor, and poor management with assigning people to work tasks. Too many skilled tasks without increase in pay, such as starting up the aircraft and moving it from locations on the airport. Very expensive and risky, paid very low compared to the risks if accident occured"
bad,"Good company , good people to work with , have to be very flexible. Have to be very alert with the passengers. Work habits have to be precise and very to the point."
bad,"I worked at Alaska for 8 years and I had a lot pride working for a local company, but there's nothing glamorous about working for an airline and that includes Alaska Airlines.  You'll work long hours (hours dictated by the operation), the rate of pay across the board is below industry standards and there's always the threat they'll decide to outsource your job....it doesn't matter if you're working at the corporate office or in the operation, we were always having to justify our value to the company."
bad,"While its true that Alaska Air is a fun, exciting place to work, you can not over look the toxic environment that it holds between the union employees and Management. With union workers (ramp employees) that complain and stuck in a victimized attitude, over inflated egos and entitlements they hold onto past grudges and drive moral down.. Management is often stuck trying to reason with these guys while pushing new policy from higher cooperate Leaders who are good at communicating expectations but seriously lacking any direction on how to achieve goals. The Alaska region of Alaska Airlines is lacking proper oversight and leadership. They lead and motivate by carrying quoting policy books and a big prodding stick, or simply wish things to get fixed on there own. The Manager I worked for was great at taking credit for achievements and hood at pointing fingers when something went wrong. I had 14 years with the company and enjoyed most of it, and then discovered how toxic it was in management."
bad,"No more than 5 hours a day, and depending  on flight schedule  hours could change during season 11am til 3 or 12 till 4 ,they gave u 5 days schedule  hours and could work ur off days for extra hours, which would give u 30hrs work week and Never any overtime"
bad,With the growth of all the new programs and online tools that are provided for employees are not taught to the senior employees. And little help or resources to teach them.
bad,Alaska Airlines invests a lot of time to hire humble and dedicated employees who care about the company.  The company provides some of the best customer care service in the industry which has lead to winning top awards.
good,"Day to day work was very productive, busy, enjoyed working with my coworkers."
good,It’s not necessary Alaska Airlines but the contract company G2 Secure Staff that has a lot of learning and growing to do. I loved the work itself but the environment I was in was very negative
good,Ramp work was ok. Management is not responsive. They can't provide a decent work schedule. Talk about their great flight Benifits then when time comes you want to use your Benifits they are no help.
good,Had fun in the job and with the employees --Made lots of friends. Learned about aviation and all that is involved in travel. Customers were not happy if there were cancelled flights due to weather related issues.
good,"Okay job nothing exciting"
good,They teach the job of a ramp agent well but management never backed up what they would tell you. The flight benefits were great and I made a lot of good friends.
good,"I'm actually divided in how I feel about working at Alaska Airlines. If you are working the call center, please know --- BEFORE you apply --- that it IS very competitive and VERY strict. Most don't make it past the 6 months probation. I enjoy the work, I LOVE my coworkers; I don't like the policies that impact so many of us. We are the lowest paid in the industry. Yes, you get flight benefits, but taking off work is almost impossible. You have to bid on your shift and it is assigned by seniority - so if you're new, expect to get a ""not so great shift"" after you're ""out on your own"". Vacations are bid on at the end of the year for the next year, otherwise you have to trade out days with co-workers to get time off. EVERYTHING is counted as an attendance occurrence - Sick? Occurrence - Kids sick? Occurrence - Flat tire? Occurrence. The background check they perform is for the last 10 years. "
good,"Alaska Airlines has a few members on its managment and supervisors team that not only disrespect their employees all the times but are unprofessional. The Virgin America managers do not treat their staff in such a manner,  they constantly show they appreciate each and every one of their employees reguardless of education, race or sexuality."
good,"The culture at Alaska Airlines was both warm and cold at the same time. I say this because the people that work for Alaska are very kind and great people. The management in the Call Center in Arizona was very kind and very involved with their workers, but the management at the ticket counter, and the trainers there lacked professionalism. They have worked at the company for so long that they are don't care or emphasize community. They speak about how they don't value the changes made to the company. They are unable to see that their views of the company and the way they speak about it to new employe's plays a major role in how those new employees see they company. The management at the ticket counter needs to hold their trainers accountable for the way they speak down to other employees and the way they speak out about the company. The pay in the call centers, doesn't equal the amount of work. You are to do mandatory overtime when the call center is busy, but they don't consider the life of their employees. You are forced to choose between your job and your family. Most of the time the job wins because you need your job and don't want to be written up.  The call center was a very strenuous they demand that you are always on the phones, unless on break or lunch, but don't consider that some calls take a toll on you and you need a minute or two to regroup. You are monitored so much that even 30 seconds off the phones is viewed as call avoidance. Alaska needs to really ask their employees about how they feel to advance their culture."
good,"good company with excellent health and travel benefits. not a good work to life balance. Overall, their are many good benefits and many drawbacks of the job."
good,Great company to work for and great flying benefit. It's really an amazing airline and there is so much for growth if you keep to your rule book and just pass your probation youlll be good.
good,"I loved doing wheelchair assist and helping those who could not help themselves.  Management was not friendly or caring.  I was told that I could get discount or zero cost flying tickets after I had been there for 3 months but in reality the pilots, flight attendants and Alaska employees had seniority where I did not."
good,"My experience was Alaska contracted through a staffing agency. Pleasant coworkers, time sensitive environment. Would recommend for entry level. Decided to pursue other opportunities."
good,"A typical day at work included working 10-12 flights a day, an inbound, marshaling in the aircraft, unloading the passengers and cargo, and outbound, loading passengers and cargo, doing careful mathematical calculations, and pushing out/wingwalking a plane, all are considered one flight. Everything is a certain process and policy that needs to be followed. Each flight or turn took approximately 45-50 minutes. Workplace culture was very diverse and open. Hardest part of the job was the physical aspect. Walking about 10 miles a day and lifting a total of around 35,000 a day, took some getting used to. The most enjoyable part of the job in my opinion was the free standby ticket travel privileges."
good,"A pretty typical large corporation, very bottom line oriented. Each employee is treated the same, as just a number in the system. While they encourage you to ""do the right thing"", they are also quick to question your actions if it affects the bottom line. There is no advancement options unless you move to a large city, and there is little recognition for those who work harder than others."
good,"I worked for Alaska Airlines for 14 years.  Started as a Reservations agent, then worked as a Customer Service Agent at the airport and finally as a Customer Care Agent.  The company is big and continues to grow, but unfortunately, is understaffed, which results in constant mandatory overtime.  I always felt treated like a ""number"" and became extremely unhappy in my last position.  Although they want associates to provide great customer service, they want it done under unrealistic expectations, such as within a certain amount of minutes.  Everything from clocking in and out for shifts and designated breaks to how much time each incoming call is answered and handled, is monitored and timed.  Seniority plays a huge role in what shift you get and shifts are bid for, every 2-3 months.  It can take many years to finally end up with a day shift and with any weekends off.  It's challenging to plan any personal events far in advance, because of the fact that shifts change so often.  The only enjoyable part of my job, was that I was allowed to work from home, provided I paid for my own dedicated landline and high speed internet.  Management did not treat me well.  I had a very close relationship with one of my aunts and when she was about to pass away, I asked for one day off to fly from Seattle to San Diego to see her.  They denied my request and my aunt passed away during my shift.  When I advised them, they showed zero sympathy and compassion.  I think Alaska Airlines is a solid company.  They offer excellent benefits, but unfortunately, my experience in the departments I worked for,"
good,"Alaska Airlines can be a great place to work if you dont have a life.  The overtime requirement is ridiculous.  This is mainly during the winter season.  You will be called even on your day off if they have overtime that needs to be filled.  The medical benefits are pretty good and they do match the 401k pretty quick.  The flight benefits were ok, as long as you were flying on Alaska to where they fly"
good,"Please note that the on-call position can be no hours at all. If you fall below 10 hours, you lose your flight benefits. You should also be aware that currently part-timers are receiving the minimum number of hours so your chances of getting hours from these folks is low. "
good,"Superación constante mediante el uso de la capacitación y oportunidades de crecimiento, sin embargo viví en varias ocasiones despidos por altibajos de la aerolínea, el primer recorte que realizan es en personal."
good,The benefits were great (both health insurance and the flight benefits). The job as a Ground Service Agent for Horizon Air was not fulfilling and management was not very good (constant manager turnover). Does not require more than a high school education.
good,Was supposed to be there 18 months. I was there everyday on time and was told going in a different direction 4 days before last day. Still deserved to be respected and giving some time before last day. Terrible way to treat anybody
good,Fast paced environment with a culture of 100% customer satisfaction. I learned more about customer service than any other employment. Competitive and seniority based
good,"Loved the people and the jobs, but management became hard to deal with and the expectations unreasonable. Just became too much of a hastle. And with a fixed schedule with no flexibility I had to make a choice to leave for my family."
good,i worked there for 3 years and i could not take it anymore. im the kind of person that cares and when the company dont care about your well-being it is very difficult.
good,"You aren't told when you're hired that you work for a vendor company on behalf of the airline, and that you'll be getting none of the airlines benefits. There is no vacation time, pto, 401k, no flight privileges, only a small 20 percent discount with Alaska flights, but even for that you have to have perfect attendance to qualify. You are required to work double shifts 5 and possibly late night in the event of a weather or delay. I don't recommend this to anyone that needs consistency or flexibility. You wont have a life here. Unless you like ghetto culture, don't work here. They love to hire hood rats and have an understandably high turnover rate. Amazing airline, but not at this airport."
good,"Alaska Airlines is a great environment, but I am looking for something more challenging in my career. The most difficult  aspects of working for Alaska AIrlines was their Life to Work ratio. It was more about work and less about life. Long hours that fluctuated on a weekly basis and no room for advancement. The best part of working for ALaska Airlines was the people you work with on a day to day basis and the fact that you can work at home was extremely beneficial."
good,"As customer service / lead supervisor the commerderie with co-workers is great; good team environment. Unfortunately corporate management which took over the company around 2004 made decisions which laid off a lot of knowledgeable employees; particularly in the technical field. Other decisions which were made by corporate made for an uncomfortable & sometimes dangerous environment in Airport Terminals causing employees to sometimes call police for assistance."
good,"Alaska prides themselves on small company feel and is not really felt by upper management, but you do feel this with co-workers or other employees.  Regular day would not having a manager or supervisor to support you due to them being in too many meetings in a day."
good,"The typical day is started by greeting of the coworkers, a mandatory morning meeting and checking inbound and outbound lists for both people and cargo."
good,Airlines was ok to work with. Demanded a lot from employees and pay didnt match the workload. Upper management not very friendly and didnt understand the struggles that faced day to day operation.
good,"Assisted customers with Reservations, Sales, Ticketing, Check-in and Baggage Handling. Controlled and managed the boarding and disembarking procedures of passenger aircraft. Maintaining passenger safety.  Accommodating disgruntled passengers from overbooked, delayed or cancelled flights with reasonable accommodations & compensation and resolving customer conflicts."
good,"Work anywhere from 40-50+hrs/per week depending on if they were  offering overtime. Trained to use Windows 7, outlook, Sabre, Rumba, and World Atlas. Trained to coach new hires and other employees. Had fun helping customers and co-workers. Unhappy customers were definitely a challenge at times. It was nice to turn the frown upside down."
good,"There are aspects of Alaska Airlines that are nice. The travel benefits for myself and my friends and family is nice. The ability to work overtime to have better control over my own financial security is nice. However simply working 40hrs a week at the median job will not pay for your average adults bills and responsibilities. I currently work 70+hrs per week to remain comfortable. They have no college tuition assistance, the department I am in has been significantly understaffed for years and the company has done little to try and remedy the situation through anything meaningful which ends up causing stress and higher turnover. Unless you work at the airport doing customer service or in the call centers the union doesnt fairly represnt the other workgroups and fails to truly understand the jobs outside of those two departments so they can vigourously advocate for better wages and working conditions for the smaller offices. The perception is with numerous internal hires that someone has already been preselected and they are only posting as a formailty and thus wasting peoples time."
good,"I would not recommend this job unless you like talking on the phone all day long and desperately need money.  Next to impossible to balance work and personal life because of constant need for mandatory overtime. Schedule changes often (like every 2 months) so you can't really plan ahead family events (birthdays, holidays, family reunions)."
good,"Working at the airport was enjoyable for a variety of reasons. Encountering different people from various cultures can be difficult but also a positive experience by knowing you are accommodating others when they need it most. I learned there is much more than meets the eye when it comes to operations as a CSR. Such as, FAA Rules & Regulations for adhering to throughout the entirety of a day. Having an awareness of actions is essential for this job as mistakes can be become costly for the airline. "
good,The work culture at Alaska Airlines has evolved to be more supportive of work/life balance and Alaska has always offered a lot of vacation PTO. The compensation is typically below-market and they out-source to a lot of third parties which reduces other opportunities internally.
good,I Love my job as a customer service agent. The hours were very tiring and very jumped all over the place. With it only having 2 flights a day.
good,"Worked on various departments and learned so many things. The only thing I can say that management is very hypocrite.  The environment is like ""dog eat dog"" where I could have stayed out of it but it was too late."
good,"I have found, through the years, that I have been satisfied with my work association’s. And that I will carry with me friendships that will last the rest of my life."
good,This job is great for a young person who is happy with a call-center atmosphere. You also must be ok with bidding for your schedule & to work holidays plus vacation.
good,"This is just another average job. Average pay, average benefits since you cannot get off to use free flights. Busy with OT during travel seasons and holidays."
good,"Got to learn about the airlines business and customer service, Operated heavy equipment. Got to travel and experience places I never been before with my family. A great benefit"
good,"I was given the opportunity to establish systems, tools and processes for Technology University courses, employees and students. Cyber Security Expo 2018 was a lot of fun to coordinate at the SeaTac headquarters building."
good,A typical work day can be fast paced or completely slow at the airport. The people I have meet here are some of the hardest workers I have ever met. And the best part about the job besides the bonuses are the flight benefits!
good,"Taking inbound calls from passengers, making new reservations, changing existing reservations, mileage award booking, seat changes, or irate passengers you could transfer to a lead."
good,"Ramp - working on luggage, loading and unloading aircraft. "
good,Great safety training that was on going monthly. The free flight benefits for employees is great the work schedule is very flexible and the trainers are very knowledgeable.
good,Alaska Airlines is a good place to work if you would if you are not looking to advance in your career. It is fast paced with many technical aspects. There is a wide variety of support provided by the helpdesk whether it's hardware or software. There is a comfortable team environment that makes you feel like part of the team.
good,"Interesting environment. Every day is different and some days are good while some days are tough. Overall cool job. However, the schedule can change at any given moment so social life is out."
good,"Awesome place to work if you and your family/friends want to travel! A lot of perks, able to work extra hours, stock purchase advantage, benefits start after only after 30days!"
good,Great benefits package unless you have to go on maternity leave or medical leave. Pretty flexible schedules except for around holidays. Not a good job for someone who likes to be home.
good,"It's an okay company. No complaints really. Enjoyed coworkers, station manager had no clue what was doing. Wasn't full time which sucked"
good,"Over all Alaska Airlines as a company is great.  Its all the abusive people checking in I hated.  The drunk ones where the worst!!!!  I just didn't enjoy being blamed for a flight because the weather was bad.  Nothing like being screamed at for an ""act of God"".  Direct verbiage from the company."
good,"Supportive management, nice work atmosphere.  They will have additional opportunities in the fall of 2015.  Possible to gain aviation industry experience."
good,"Encourages learning ad employee training, lateral movement between departments."
good,Reservations agent in training - 6 weeks of classroom training.
good,I was working as a mechanic on their planes and learned a lot. I was working while I was getting my license to fly and that is why I left as to continue my career as a pilot.
good,hardest part of job is unloading all bags within the 20 min allotted time.20 min guarantee all bags up carousel or passengers get a $50 voucher for Alaska air
good,"Working for Alaska airlines was fun. I had great experiences. I had the opportunity to work in various positions and explore widely what it has to offer. Great team and management to work for. However, I reached a peak where no longer was challenging nor a place for growth."
good,"The customers are great, and management welcomes your input. This is a union workforce and comes with the plus of job security, but the minus of working through seniority. The company runs a promote to failure model, so be prepared to commit to the the airline for a long period if you plan on moving up with this company."
good,"It is an productive,  physical and fast paced job. As long as you are trained and understanding of in/out flights and respectful to others you will succeed"
good,"Very busy and always changing environment.  Fast paced work and people are friendly and helpful, never a dull moment,  Work load is heavy but rewarding."
good,Equal opportunity for employment. There are many caring and loving peers that you will work with. there are days were functions get a little repetitive and less interesting. Overall cool job.
good,This was my first job after i got out of the active army. I wasn't really sure what I wanted to do but I always liked airplanes and I always wanted to work with them. I didn't stay too long because i wanted to fuel planes rather than pack them.
good,Loved the airline and the free travel but the pay did not compensate well enough to utilize the benefits enough. Very senority prioritized so it was difficult to manage your life.
good,It was a ok company to work for things could of been better because there was not alot of order tbh but it had ok benefits and things like that hours could be a little better and also get more cameras so people dont get there stuff stolen
good,"there are multiple positions in this company, so I could only comment on the two that I have worked that.  very fast paced environment with a lot of flexibility in the schedules.  In both positions I learned to deal with customers in the most stressful environment, for example a flight being canceled on Christmas due to a snow storm or airline issue, and having to deal with those guests screaming at you, video taping you, and saying its your fault as well as them crying. Any issue you could imagine including medical and violent issues I dealt with.  Both of my manager are like family to me, you respect them, they respect you.  The hardest part of the job at first was due to my schedule was waking up at 2am or 1am for work, but after about 3 months I got used to it.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the people you worked with, most of the time they were did for you when you needed them, and you could always find someone to laugh with about anything."
good,great company great benefits great overall I just couldn't go forward with the scheduling bids and the changes but overall its great for individuals who don't have little ones
good,"The job can sometimes require getting up to work a shift at 2am, with around 15 hours a week. The retention rate is low, which gave me an opportunity to move up in the company quickly."
good,This is an exciting job if you’re single and are okay with being away from family for 3+ days at a time. Benefits are great and you will have to relocate.
good,Alaska Airlines as a company is amazing.  Working in a call center at a desk job was not challenging or fun enough for me.  Management was supportive and very helpful and coworkers were fun to work with. Very routine work because you answer telephones for 8+ hours a day constantly.
good,This is a terrible place to work especially at MCI. I do not recommend this place at all. Management is terrible and favoritism is horrible! I will never recommend this place to anyone
good,"I love working with people, there is always something different to see, the hardest part of the job is dealing with delays and having to deal with irate customers and still maintaining a professional demeanor"
good,my coworkers made my day and job enjoyable. it was a typical day at work. management is not that great but still enjoyed being there
good,"Working for Alaska Air Group under Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air, we are one big family. The culture on the boots on the ground employees are what keeps this company going. They hire like minded people who care deeply about others."
good,"Over all the job is very fun and exciting great people to work with, but not enough hours, being new to the state the contract they have is so small there is no way to survive and take care of a family working with the company. But a great company to work for."
good,nice team to work with however very low pay and minimal raises. Job gave me a joy and satisfaction. Good experience with my managers.
good,The job with Alaska Airlines might have been a great start into the industry.  I was hired by G2 Secure Staff which is simply a recruiting company.  I was offered the position and told I would go to Seattle for training.  I gave notice at my current place of employment and I did go to Seattle where I found out that employment was contingent on passing two tests.  I passed the first but failed the second test by one question.  I was sent home to Salt Lake and am now unemployed.  Alaskan Airlines is probably a good employer but using G2 Secure Staff to handle employee recruiting casts them in a negative light.  I was one of several who had this happen to me.  G2 Secure Staff has not contacted me since I returned and I have not been paid for the week I trained as I was promised I would be.
good,A CSR at the airport for Alaska is a great company to work for if you don’t have children or need a work life balance. If you’re scheduled for 8 hours a day you’ll likely be there more like 10 without commute.
good,"When you get hired on they talk about family being the first and foremost. It’s not if you need time off to take care of your family or yourself you get an occurance, they tell you to trade off your shifts which is almost impossible without paying out of pocket money you don’t have. They track everything and when you make a choice to help a pax out whether it be a change fee waived or discounted or sending a voucher you get questioned because all those come out of company money and employee benifits so then it makes you scared to even want to help. The pay is so low that you don’t even qualify for a 1 bedroom appt these days, family life gets jeopardize because of it and once you start asking questions management starts treating you differently and hasseling you more."
good,"Fast pasted work environment on a daily basis, I have learned all the ends and outs of the airlines that I never knew took place. "
good,"a day at work for a commuting f/a is very hectic , getting to work then starting work takes a lot out of you .you learn how to manage time very wisely,and multi task,working with fun professional co workers ,best part of the job is having your customers happy and feeling they had the best experience when they disembark the aircraft."
good,"The job can be stressful when air travel is impacted by weather or other circumstances involving flight cancellations, etc. It is a work from home position which is very beneficial. Great benefits."
good,"If you like shift work, this is the place for you! Very fun atmosphere. Although it is a professional work place, everyone always seems to make it fun!"
good,Everyone helps everyone. Its a very high demanding and fast paced environment. Coworkers are easy to get along with and supervisors are easy to level and speak with as well.
good,Working at the airport can is face paced and can be stressful.  Great teamwork and with peers.  Company empowers employees to solve issues to take care of customers.
good,"Working on behalf of Alaska airlines is a fast paced and demanding task. The client (AAG) is very much focused on their own interests and intolerant to feedback, if it is negative toward internal staff or direct hired vendors. However, blame was quickly shifted and pointed toward our team and justification of feedback was constantly demanded. "
good,"If you are prepared to be gone quite often this is a great job. The first 6 months/1 year are pretty rough when you are on call but once you have a set schedule everything starts to fall into place. If you do not like dealing with people, this is not the job for you."
good,"Customer service agents are a revolving door. Because the pay is so little and they often transfer to different departments. Mandatory overtime is a thing, especially in the winter.  Health and flight benefits are the reason most people stay. Made some awesome friends and no day at work is ever the same so thats a definite plus!"
good,"The best part of the job is working in a team atmosphere. Unfortunately, upper management has been cutting middle management down due to budget cuts. It's causing a lot of hardship for those behind the scenes. Since stocks are falling, they are worried about making ends meet; regardless of being the number one airline. I learned how to work in a professional setting with different teams. But the fact that people were cut and teams were whittled down has made things stressful."
good,We have a great corporate culture that allows the everyday front line employee to be empowered to do what's best for the customer. At times you are working under a strict time line but safety is always first. To work in an environment where your coworkers are your friends and family is a great satisfaction in itself. There is always something new to learn.  Pay is difficult at first however every year there is a pay increase until you top out after 12 steps. There is plenty of room to grow for those with high ambition and for those without it there is plenty of travel that can be had.
good,"Amazing Company to work for, a lot of opportunity for job advancement, flexible schedules & quarterly bonuses, fast paced and fast growing environment."
good,If you like working with the public this is the place for you.  However the business travelers might give you some issues
good,helped passenger\s with their ticktes and baggages for Alaska Airlies.
good,working at the airport was a good job for me because I was in a positive environment and dressed at business level. Everyone I worked with was great. the hardest part of this job was dealing with unhappy passengers and remaining calm and answering all of their questions making sure they leave our airline on a good note.
good,"Working at the airport was a great place to improve your customer service skills. You can be talking to someone that is going on vacation and very happy to be leaving shortly. Than the next customer just missed their flight and are very upset about everything. "
good,Fast paced with room for advancement.  Opportunity to learn and grow in multiple areas and divisions. Helps to know someone in the organization. Previous airline experience a plus.
good,"good job.  fast paced but last manager was an extreme micro-manager which led to a stressful environment.   "
good,"This job is great for those who like to travel because it offers free flight benefits. Great coworkers and on the job support as well. However, the pay is very low especially for what is required in this position."
good,"Alaska Airlines is a good airline to work for.  The airline industry, in general, is no longer the industry it was with a glory such as it may have been the case in the 60's and 70's decades.  The industry today struggles quite a bit and is cutting back more services in certain sectors."
good,As long as you stayed hungry and changed with the times a person will do well.  Make sure it is clear in your contract if you start to work hours outside of work hours.
good,"Alaska Airlines is a fantastic company, ideal for single people with little to no obligations in the lower 48.  You'll most likely be ""encouraged"" to move to Alaska!  Sounds exciting at first, until you realize, you live in Alaska!"
good,"Answer incoming calls"
good,"Is a great company in their values and policies, the people you work with is exceptional, but the management, specially in Mexican Stations, is not the best at all, the promotions are based in preferences, and Gossip, not based on performance, you're not unionized, so, you can get fired if your manager doesn't like you."
good,If you enjoy talking all day and listening to complaints this job is for you! I needed to stay more active so it isn't the best fit. But you can transfer to gate agent if you stay with the job and pass probation.
good,"This is overall a good company to work for, but do not expect a lot of upward mobility however."
good,"\"
good,"Great co-workers, benefits, and travel opportunities. ""The Alaska Spirit"" is a real thing amongst employees, but it is still a corporation so folks shouldn't expect a fantasy world. Most people enjoy their jobs and it makes for a positive workplace."
good,"(Wichita Station)"
good,Alaska Airlines has been a great company if your starting out and not sure what career path you would like to take is a great start company I have enjoyed working there.
good,"Enjoyed the environment overall. The team itself had operating issues, however, the individuals that I would work with made the environment enjoyable."
good,Loved working there. Had the opportunity to travel see the world. Met some amazing people whom I still keep in contact with today. It was a wonderful experience.
good,"My idea job. Some friendly coworkers, but some also show favoritism. Good hours. Pays well. Very knowledgeable job. Safety is a must however, working at a timely pace is also important. Management is unorganized at times and the turnover rate is high."
good,"AAG has an excellent home / work life balance."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Alaska Airlines. There is never a typical work day. You constantly work with and meet new people. Alaska's management were not always great, but I wouldn't expect that of any company. One thing I can say is although there were a few bad apples, most of the people Alaska hires are genuine quality people. My co-workers were some of the best I ever worked with. The hardest part of the job is being on call and dealing with Crew Scheduling. "
good,"I really enjoyed this job. There a quite a few hoops you need to jump through before you can really get a good understanding of the job, but once you get there it's great."
good,If only I get a full time here and not ust an On Call I would love to stay at Alaska. They show respect to passengers even if it’s not a global airline we get recognize because if our costumer service. I am so proud to be part of  Alaska Airlines. I just wish I was hired full time or would be given a chance to be full time.
good,"Benefits are great, co-workers are fun, but you are just a number to management. Any hiccup great or small comes with 3-5 forms of reporting and discussion and or reprimanding."
good,Alaska Airlines is a great company to work for. The benefits and friends I have made throughout the years have been awesome.  Thank you Alaska Airlines!
good,"Overall a great culture and environment.  As most large companies do, Alaska went through  some big changes and cultural shifts which influence my decision to leave.  All in all - great place with great people."
good,"It's a very fast pace environment, just be able to multi task, have great customer service skills, and computer skills. It is a quick learn, and patient reaction type of career."
good,"Must be able to stand your entire shift, lift 50+ lbs consistently, and must be able to be flexible working any shift. Includes working holidays and mandatory overtime. Management at the local level was very difficult at times."
good,Good place to work. Alaska employees have a true team spirit. Will be great if this remains in place given recent buyout of Virgin America and expansion.
good,"I would love to work there again in the marketing department. If you work in reservations, the job is great and the flight benefits are wonderful, they offer medical, FSA, etc. Managers are wonderful as well, I had Lacey and she was very busy, but also a very helpful boss with a big heart! Co-workers were incredible! Be prepared to work a lot! Reservations has mandatory overtime, and shifts are awarded on a bid thats based on seniority."
good,"Alaska Airlines taught me nearly everything I know about customer service. Helping Passengers to their flight on a day to day basis. I rated management at 2-stars specifically because of the way my situation was handled. But overall, I wouldn't mind going back to work with them."
good,"Working with a different group of people daily, meeting people from all over world, traveling to places you never would have gone to.  This is the job for you."
good,"Thanks to a great English/German teacher in high school, I quickly became lead writer for the Director of Inflight. This was fun and allowed me to meet many of the flight attendants and work at the airport."
good,Alaska Airlines
good,"It's not Olive Garden, but you do grow very close to your co-workers and you feel like a tight knit well functioning team.  There are plenty of opportunities for entry level and early career advancement.  There is training and development for all employees and employee surveys are taken seriously.  As you advance there could be more work done to develop/mentor leaders.  It's a great place to work and the benefits are pretty good."
good,"Good company to work for as a full-time employee, just ok as a contractor. Full time employees get free flight perks, but not the contractors...………..."
good,"Fun workplace with great travel benefits. When flights cancel, it can be a challenge to help the passengers find a different route to get where they want, since the flights are usually pretty full."
good,It's a great environment to be able to have fun at work well paced out work. You are able to trade your own shifts off and/or work somebody else shift.
good,"I enjoyed working with the community, having the opportunity to travel and see new places, I had room for advancement, I did not like the salary, it was not comparable to the community I lived in."
good,"Very good place to work, learned a lot over my years there.Management was average they had a high turnover at the level I was involved with. My co-workers were great, pressure to get the aircraft out on time but safety and compliance has to come first. working on aircraft and systems not everybody gets to do that."
good,"Though it was a long commute, this was one of the best companies I have worked for. We were responsible for all repairs on the aircraft as well as all detailing when aircraft was going outbound. Very decent pay with good benefits which included travel benefits. Would still be there had the facility not closed down."
good,"The airline travel industry is ever changing, and being a customer service agent is like being the first soldier into battle."
good,I enjoy working in the airline industry. I love the travel benefits. There are many opportunities to grow in the company and relocate throughout the U.S.
good,"i really liked this job, but the only reason i stopped working there is because i did not work well in the snow. but overall this job was great.  i was always doing something and what made it fun was that i was working with great people"
good,"Need to be really good on patient, and you really need to like people to help them on they’re day or when passengers need help with wheelchair, also help them with tickets"
good,Management really doesn’t care about the employees. Treat you like you don’t know anything. They just don’t care at all. Never be at work if you do need any help.
good,I like working at Alaska Airlines and the flexibility it gives me with my schedule to be a care giver for my Mother and to travel. Everyday is something different and keeps the job interesting.
good,fun place to work/ advancement opportunities/ great benefits/ work life balance in the beginning is hard but after a while it becomes better/ has to be customer oriented and like to talk
good,"I worked for Alaska Airlines a long time ago. It was a great place to work, and for the most part the atmosphere was positive. The rate of pay back then was below the industry standard."
good,Alaska Airlines was a fun job. It was fast paced and the hours went quickly. I learned a lot about how to deal with angry people. I also learned about computer work.
good,I was there when it was just booming and climbing to the top.  It's always going to be rocky as inflight crew since it is so unpredictable.  Other than the typical irregular ops issues that causes major delays it was a great place.
good,"I love my job I love dealing with customer on my everyday basis , I do ticket counter making sure I get all the passengers aboard i write tickets also change their destination and check bags and id's for every passenger also given them the right direction around the airport"
good,Alaska Airline has a lot opportunity to learn and progress your career. The people there are great and very helpful. A lovely company to work for and the people actually care for the employees and the community around them.
good,"The work environment is very much like Boeing. Many of the employees have a military background. For the most part, everyone is very focused on their jobs and getting the work done as best they can. I enjoyed working there and would recommend Alaska Airlines as a great place to work."
good,"Call center"
good,Alaska is a great company to work for. Great benefits. Typical day is 8 to 10 hrs with either 2 or 3 days off. Opportunity for overtime and to trade days off. most enjoyable part of the job was the flexibility.
good,"As an Alaska Airlines Customer Service Agent, I greeted the customers, checked them and their baggage in for the flights and helped with any questions or problems they may have.  I was always busy, doing multiple tasks and never bored or repititious.  I worked long, 10-hour days with short breaks, but loved being in the busy travel industry."
good,Great company that has strived to stay one of the best airlines in the country.  Management does well working with union and non-union employees.  They are in the know and available when needed.  Employees are happy - many great jobs available.  The hardest part of the industry is trying to find an answer the customer will be happy with. Not too hard!
good,Team Work Environment. Management is excellent in providing employees with timely information.
good,"Love the culture, flight benefits and support of management. Only downside for me personally was balancing work (bidding for shifts minimum of 3 times a year) with raising young children."
good,"There is a department for everyone. Ticketing, Gating, Baggage service, Operations. There is room to move and grow within the company. Management was difficult due to the merger with Virgin America (lots of temper tantrums from the red side) but overall would recommend if you are flexible."
good,"Alaska Airlines is a great company to work for if you are a person that likes being on the phones all day long and talking, it can be a great job for you. I'm not the over the phone type person I am more of in person type so if you are like me you may want to work at the airport. I wanted to work from home so I did the over the phones and while that was great and fun if I had to do over again I would go to the airport."
good,Positive environment where employees are generally friendly and helpful with a working together attitude.  Engineering staff stressed over recent pay increases for mechanics (16%) while no wage improvements foreseen for them.
good,great job!! I work as a vendor and our benefits are not as good as direct hires however its still good that we get some. Company is very customer service oriented!
good,Every day required flexibility and adaptability to a changing environment. I learned that we have to deal with things that are out of our control with poise and grace.
good,"A day at work, was very interesting and very informative. Since I never worked in front of customers with an airline. Learning procedures all over again. I enjoyed every moment of my job. I never flew on Alaska Airlines and my first impression about Alaska was very rewarding. I had the chance to train in Seattle for a week. They put us up in hotel rooms at (Double Tree) and my experience with Alaska, I got a sense of family acceptance, furthermore they expect greatness from each employee that they hire in Hawaii... I had a blast. My fellow co-workers were from Aloha Airlines so I felt like I belong. Aloha Airlines went out of business in 2007. We all ohana (family) and wanted the same thing from each other greatness and success of a company. Hardest part of my job. My jitters of being in front of customer with an airlines again. I had cobb webs that need to be clean out. After the first day being back at the airport it was duck soup. Everyday was enjoyable. I love seeing the smiles of the passengers and the responses of the passengers that they wanted to stay in Hawaii."
good,"Overall Alaska is a good company to work for. Call center work is tough -  a steep learning curve to learn the program and policy and procedure.  It's a union job so your first 3 months are on probation don't plan on getting sick or family sick or stuck in traffic the first three months or you'll get released. "
good,I really enjoyed my time when I was with Alaska. Although I had to leave due to my husband being active duty Army was the reason I had to leave. It would've been nice if they had a transfer program to where I had to relocate.
good,"Flexible job, could be paid more, usually great coworkers, hard hours."
good,"Everyday at this job is a new day! Different co-workers, new events, different customers with different stories. Every co-worker has their own responsibilities to manage during the course of a workday. This allows each employee to be their own supervisor as well as a responsible group team member. The rewards of this job is putting a smile on passengers faces enroute to their travel destinations (i.e. vacations, weddings, adoptions, celebrations etc). The hardest part of the job is transporting those enroute relocating from a divorce, to a funeral, surgery or last flight.  What I've learned is to be compassionate to everyone's needs. Never assume. Be aware and assertive. Enjoy everyday because they're all number!"
good,Fast paced job/quick training. you have the power to make this job likable. you work in the comforts of you home. This job is STRICT on attendance and time
good,"I had a fantastic 10 plus years working at Alaska Airlines in Juneau, AK.  I was hired as a Customer Service Agent and had many opportunities to learn all the positions at the station such as security, operations, air frieght and lost and found.  Learning these skills moved me into a Lead position which was good pay and other flight benefits on other airlines.  Great team building and leadership training opportunities."
good,"Typical day- being a people person, working with different co-workers everyday, working odd hours, a very physical interactive job"
good,"We have to off-load and load 6 planes a day. Once a plance lands, we have 20 minutes to off-load the plane and get the bags to the passengers. "
good,Great company with an established culture. Strict in most areas of operation but the formula is successful. They focus on safety and provide great service.
good,Alaska Airlines is an amazing company. I love working for them. It is a fair and diverse company with lots of room to advance. Overall it is a great work experience and a great company
good,"Being very short staffed, it is difficult to get days needed off. Be prepared to only have one day off, and not the one you need. Management is very bad and scheduling is worse. Working for a third party company in KC is difficult, you don’t get the same benefits as “real AS employees”. There are only two shifts, 3am-8am and 12pm-5pm. Be prepared to work both of them everyday. Know what your signing up for, you don’t get days off."
good,"Not very flexible on hours when it comes to busy season, they give mandatory overtime. You have the option to say no, but it is frowned upon. They are very strict on numbers, as far as your call handle time goes and the time you take after a call. Other than that, I would say that it's a good place to work."
good,"I previously worked for Alaska Airlines in a different department and LOVED my job, the company and the people I worked with.  I wanted to get back working with Alaska when I moved to Phoenix, but I had no idea what I was in for."
good,"if you/re interested in working for airline,alaska airlines is a great company to work for. Whether you're looking for something part time or full they have it available."
good,"Overall, Alaska Airlines is a great place to work. However, there's not a lot of room for growth, as it is a very competitive environment, and you have to apply for a new job, rather than getting a promotion."
good,"As a Passenger Service Agent, I had a well rounded experience of working for an airline.  I loved helping the passengers and have a great empathy for the traveling public."
good,"alaska airlines is a great place to work with alot of great people to work with. the down side is the starting pay is so low, a person needs a second job in order to have a place to live or even support a family."
good,"Fun coworkers, but insane hours, physically laborious work, and challenging management.  The hours killed me and I could never get sequential days off to use my flight benefits."
good,"Enjoyed working there, made a lot of friends."
good,On a normal day I would come on to the evening shift. I would pick up after day crew left off helping with cargo costumers and checking in passengers for the last flight out of Nome Alaska.  On days with bad weather or canceled flights I would re book passengers on the next flights out. On the occasional day I would have to deny boarding to passengers who were under the influence according to faa regulations.
good,"This job is certainly a highly productive one. There is never a dull moment at the airport. One a daily basis you meet all sorts of travelers, ranging from business travelers, high-profile and families starting their vacations. This position is definitely calls for a high levels of professionalism as well as customer service. Sometimes it can be tough to deliver such high customer service when the passenger has experienced numerous service failures, but in the end , it is my job to make sure they are satisfied and will choose Alaska again for their travel needs."
good,Very safe work environment to be working in. Alaska Airlines puts everything into consideration as far as safety goes and provides proper training to make sure everything runes smoothly.
good,"This type of work is on your toes and think quick type of job. "
good,"You deal with people who want to know more information about the airline, possibly do business with the airline and are frequent flyers. A lot of people know what they want when they call which makes a great day of fast call, some people have never flown before and want everything explained to them in detail. I love working with my coworkers, flying benefits are great but the amount of stress the company puts on us in order to meet quarterly goals can really question if were being paid fairly or not."
good,"I enjoy working for Alaska Airlines, it would be a wonderful if the pay was raised for porters, as it was for CSA’s. I love the diverse group of co-workers as well as the management team they are all Awesome. My favorite is assisting guests with disabilities, from all over the world."
good,I love my job and co workers. The longer you work with this company they become family! I love interacting with passenger daily and making sure they are happy with our services!
good,I currently work on the phones takikng Customer Care calls.  I can take any call from  Customer Relations to web or mobile support questions.  I enjoy helping others and creating a solution that is both acceptable to the Company as well as the Member.
good,"Alaska is not a bad place to work but resources for new employees can be better. Pay is good, but you only get paid for time blocked out, not for the time you’re expected to be present and ready to work."
good,Alaska Airlines focuses on providing differentiated guest travel experience by developing solutions that help the customer facing teams to provide exceptional service3.
good,"Enjoyed the position. I was looking for a part-time hours. Often if the plane has not arrived or if the plane is unable to take off, staff must remain"
good,"Based on what you were assigned for the day, you worked with passengers for your operation. Checked in passengers and handled had to have excellent customer service skills. Weigh bags and make sure they didn't have any dangerous goods or overweight bags. Checked in Federal air marshals, and inflight service coordinators, along with the following, unaccompanied minors, emotional support animals, service animals, and passengers traveling dogs going underneath the plane in Cargo. I also boarded the plane and was qualified to operate the jet bridge to meet the plane. I processed stand-bys, and accommodated anyone with seat assignments. I had to deal with irregular operations including delays or cancelled flights. I learned how to reaccomadated  passengers and give vochers to pax for meals and hotels if needed which was the hardest part of my job. I enjoyed in excelling in Customer Service and making our passengers were always satisfied and happy."
good,Would like to be associated with the company where individual talent and skills are appreciated and fair amount of attention should be given to individuals for personal development.
good,"Listen"
good,"I enjoyed my time at Alaska very much. I learned so much about the airline industry. The hardest part was I had so little hours. I loved interacting with the customers. All my coworkers were very helpful, it was a real ""team"" atmosphere."
good,inbound call center.  great training and support.  travel benefits are fantastic.  rigid rules on attendance Overtime is available if desired.  Great support from our Union
good,"No Comment, if your in the right department that has good company culture then its great. If you get stuck in a department that has bad morale then its not a great experience."
good,"Call Center Reservations.  Answer incoming calls from passengers inquiring about new reservations, revising reservations, general questions.  This job requires attention to detail, excellent customer service skills and patience.  The most enjoyable part of this job are assisting the passengers  with their vacation plans or their business plans.  The hardest part of this job is when you are not able to assist them due to lack of availability of flights.  Irregular operations is also difficult in the Winter months due to flight cancellations due weather or mechanical."
good,"Fast paced, fun, if you enjoy multitasking this jobs for you. You’ll meet people from all over the word. You also get flight benefits so that’s a big plus!"
good,It was a great place to work.  Flexible work environment. Able to have days off as needed by getting your shift covered by coworkers.  Great heath and airline discounts.
good,"No matter what area or group you work at Alaska, from corporate to the frontlines you'll meet and work with really kind, caring people. At corporate, the pace and lack of innovation can feel challenging in the Seattle-tech market. But this isn't unusual for the industry. I feel lucky to have the opportunity to work at Alaska. The company doesn't spend money on flashy things, parties, and employees spaces, but the benefits are top-notch."
good,Alaska Airlines allows me to work from home as a part-time employee. The pay is low but the company provides excellent benefits. I am willing to leave or continue employment to supplement my income.
good,great 'family' to work with....every day you go to work to do the same thing ....but no two days are ever the same......gives a great sense of pride to keep doing great things
good,I was hired in December as a reservations agent. You go through 3 weeks of paid training learning the basics of your job. You are required to learn and memorize roughly 118 airport codes for the airports Alaska flys to. They test you for this during the first week and email you the airport codes you need to learn roughly 2 weeks before you start class. You must score at least 85% to pass. The email says you are tested for this and are required to pass on the first day of class but we didn't get tested for it until the beginning of the second week and I know some people failed but did not get let go they just had to come back on there own time and pass it before the end of the 3 week class. You are taught things each week and tested on what you've learned. You aren't required to pass the weekly tests only the final test which is given on the last week and you must score 85% or higher. It's a rigorous process but honestly this is the easy part. The hardest part is after the 3 week class you are put out on the phones with people over seeing you walking around helping you with calls for 3 weeks. Reservations agents deal with so much stuff that you will feel totally unprepared and overwhelmed at first. After the 3 weeks of ojt with helpers walking around helping you they put you on your own. There are excellent help desks you will most likely be calling for several months on various phone calls until you get use to it. Every day is different you are expected to help the customers with many different things and it could take 6months to a year to feel fully comfortable. Balancing work
good,"I worked with a group of group people, supporting teams very helpful. "
good,If was given the choice I would have retired with the airlines. Very friendly coworkers. Flexible schedule at times. Great airlines to work for. Excellent benefits.
good,"Great benefits including flight benefits for employee, spouse/domestic partner, children and parents. Allotted 13 guest passes per year. Good insurance. Flight benefits make up for low wages."
good,Pay is not so great for the abusive and hectic hours but management is awesome and med/dental/travel benefits are great. Low in seniority means your schedule sucks but you get to work from home
good,"checking in and rebooking. Dealing with angry passengers, delays. boarding and meeting planes. interacting with passengers and crew members. but the benefits of flying standby for free. the best. the absolute best."
good,"In the four years that I worked for Alaska Airlines I had the privilege of working along side of some amazing people. For the most part the management supportive, and created a nice environment for everyone. Ironically, the most enjoyable part was also the hardest part of the job; which was assisting customers."

good,I enjoy the fast paced atmosphere and meeting new people all day long.  Hours are great too!!! have 3 day weekends.
good,"Loved working for Alaska. I felt proud to put on my uniform and represent the company. I loved what I did, but as a new employee with low seniority you’re at the bottom of the totem pole as far as shifts go, so you’re stuck with terrible hours. Say goodbye to your family and social life. And as great as the benefits are, what they pay you does not amount to the stress, often mandatory overtime, and hard work you have to do. I could get an office job for $5 more an hour sitting on my butt all day."
good,I thoroughly enjoy my job and the freedom it allows. After having worked there for some time it is fairly easy to rearrange my schedule to get time off of needed. The flight benefits are also a large perk.
good,"Make sure u have the proper clothing, and plenty of water not to mention be on time for your flights plus make sure u have had a proper meal.and be kind to your fellow workers"
good,Excellent company to work for. Leadership has a clear idea where they want company to go.

good,"I worked in Customer Service, baggage claim, cargo facility, and operations during my ten years at Alaska Airlines. A typical day at work was fast paced and challenging. I learned a lot about public speaking due to making announcements constantly during boarding and controlling flights. We had multiple managers, who all strived to make the company succeed. The hardest part of this job was seeing pets pass away during travel. That may seem odd, but it wasn't easy to tell a passenger this news. The most enjoyable part of this job was seeing the happiness of passengers going on life long trips! I loved that I was always busy and something was always there to keep us busy."
good,"Excelente ambiente de trabajo, todos los días aprendes cosas nuevas, trato con los pasajeros de manera personalizada así como trabajo bajo presión"
good,"Busy, ever changing, super interactive, and full of surprises. Never a dull day, always learning new things from passengers and staff. Dependent on weather and mechanical issues your day is always unpredictable."
good,"I love working for Alaska Airlines,  It's a positive safe work environment with a management organization that obviously cares about it's employees"
good,"Great place to work, CEO meets every new flight attendant in training, lots of fun events outside of work. Alaska likes to hire from within so starting as a FA is a great foot in the door position. Great job if you are flexible and love people. Starting schedule is not idea but as you gain seniority you gain flexibility and stability with your schedule."
good,"I give it a great review, It's an excellent company that takes care of their employees. The training is very detailed and they make sure that you learn the job so that you can perform well.

good,"Great place to work!  If you like working with the public, a fast paced and exciting environment then you will enjoy working in the airline industry.  Alaska Airlines is a great place to work."
good,"Absolute wonderful career path and excellent company to work for in the first place! Being able to have so much flexibility in your schedule means that literally the sky is the limit! You be a flight attendant full time and make enough money to make ends meet, or you could work with a little less of a ""full time"" schedule and work a completely different side job! Many flight attendants have their own companies in addition to being a flight attendant. "

good,"I run Xerox Docutech/Press Operator"
good,"Starting as a mechanic in Fairbanks, AK and ending up as Director of Services Planning in Seattle Corporate, the company offered advancement. This did require a tremendous amount of travel and often resulted in starting at 4 a.m. and finishing at 11 p.m. with visits to 2 or 3 cities during that time. My co-workers were some of the best in the industry, making it much more palatable. It was gratifying to arrive at a new city, prepare the site as a serviceable facility for passenger service. Opening a new station was most enjoyable even though it required a great deal of time and commitment."
