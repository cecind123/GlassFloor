rating,review
bad,"Lots of favoritism and unfairness. "
bad,Hours are bad if you have a family you want to see no time to learn new things to move around in the company management doesn’t care for your mental health
bad,bad place bad people bad food bad drinks food is always cold the breakfst was good at first then it turned nasty the hot coffe was to hot drink and you ha d to guzzle it down befor you go back
bad,"in my opinion this facility inparticular is a terrible place to work.the pay does not equal the hard work,the management is horrible and does not care about what you have to say,the team leads have nasty attitudes as if there better than you"
bad,"If you're working at a fast-food chain restaurant, good, stay there! It's better than working here. THat's the best way to sum it up. All the other reviews are wrong either. It's horrible management and for the salary, it's not even worth the stress. You will be happier working delivering packages at Amazon than this self proclaims great workplace."
bad,"Managers play favorites,give out easy work to some and harder for others making it almost impossible to meet production numbers and keep raising them weekly,also you get paid the same for being there a year as the people getting hired off the street with NO experience,old equipment always breaking down and down right rude supervision"
bad,They give 5 days of training 4 spent in the different sections of which you'll be picking the items from a list given to u  1 on machines such as forklifts then thats it youll be expected to be a pro after that so goodluck they only pay 11.25 a hour 40 hours guranteed all of which youll be on your feet 3/ 20 min breaks that youre expected to be back early from which barely feel like breaks
bad,"Avoid working for this shower of so and so's at all cost. I'd have more fun putting turds in a washing machine and watching them go round. Made a convicted s e x offend er a manager instead of sacking him because he can't go anywhere near schools or hospitals, you know, where there's kids...! Skanked me out of final wages. And managers break Heath & Safety rules and their polices all the time. Proper shady outfit. Avoid like a syphilitic whoore with dysentery. You'd probably have more fun with the whoore than working for these orrible cant's. Hours were rubbish! Some of the workers are alright, but mainly just divs... oh, weekends off is the only good thing to say about it."
bad,"Owens & Minor cares about money for corporate and not at all about its employees. Do not work here. It is a dead end job with no opportunity for advancement, at least on the warehouse side. They keep cutting corners to make more money for corporate and making lives more miserable for employees."
bad,At the beginning was okay but as time pass by things weren’t so good a lot of employees quit because of management a lot of people didn’t even make it to training
bad,This place is the biggest joke there is they dont train their employees right there for it reflects when a customer calls to check on status or has complicated questions we just dont know how to answer they get transferred around 10 times before they speak to the right person bathrooms are nasty no sick time management not there for you i feel really bad for our sick customers no one seems to care
bad,"Management doesnt know how to run the place and takes 10 breaks "
bad,Owens&minor used to be a good place to work but the clowns who run that place now are destroying it.  They are losing business and good people.  They treat the people who work hard like garbage and the slackers like gold.  A monkey could run that place better than those idiots
bad,At Owens minor you will never be good enough for the management they will tell you you are not good enough fo there.they don’t train people very well .
bad,They very dirty when I got the job I wasn’t even trained nobody go help you it’s not how they say it is run run far away and don’t look back this job only care for itself trust me I know I had to learn the hard way so I’m here to help you
bad,"I will never work there again. Don’t give raises, and run you around like a dog and don’t appreciate anything you do for them. Everything is a joke smh"
bad,Horrible place to work they hire people for management that couldn’t find there way out of a paper bag. You don’t get paid well enough for what they want you to do. If you work second shift you’ll work 12+ hours a night because they don’t have enough people and mangers are slack and don’t know how to mange there employees and if you work 1st shift you’ll be leaving enough freight on the floor for 2 days worth of work cause all they care about is second shift.
bad,I was told upon my interview we would work from 4pm to 12pm and rarely worked overtime.  I probably left at 12 once or twice while working there.  I had an appointment at the VA and tried to call in and no one answered and got reprimanded for no one manning the phones.  Moral is very low in the warehouse and I wouldn't
bad,"Management isn’t fair with all employees, they’re constantly doing wrong things with teammates. New employees are making more money than current employees who have years of experience and knowledge."
bad,"Company Is On Its Last Leg / Little To No Direction In Company / Senior & Middle Management Positions Filled By Individuals With Little To No Experience in Healthcare / Outdated Processes and IT Infrastructure / Little To No Cold Chain Distribution Capability To Service Customers / Company Mission is Vague & Changes Every Six Months / HR Department Heavily Focused On Sexual Orientation Presentations at Expense of General Business / LGBT Pride Posters plastered on ALL floors of corporate office as well as Elevators / Corporate Office frequently hosts Corporately-Sponsored Guest speakers to Promote Adolescent Homosexuality / Revolving Door In Several Departmental Areas Including Marketing, Category Management, & Sales / No Mobile Phones Provided to Middle or Senior Management Personnel and No Compensation For Mobile Phone Business Expenses. Avoid Working For This Company!"
bad,"bad manegment and very bad HR maneger no equality"
bad,"You would not like to work at this company,very cutthroat stressful enviroment. Stress through the roof, , thank God I left. If you are'nt the kind of person that, kissup or snitch you wont last watch out for Management.They could really give a less about you, they only care about themselves."
bad,"No cordination and cooperation between line supervisors/managers of shipts. No effeciant training of employees. Backtalks, descrimanation and insulting who are not english speakers are a daily news. No one taking responsibility, the only approch toward problem solving is to blame others."
bad,This place is the worse. They are in complete upheavel.  The employees are angry and disgrutled and fear for their jobs.   I have nothing positive to say.
bad,Not the best places to work management really bad. Nobody really wants to work. Bad hours. Nobody wants to help you. Pay is not all that great. Management does not help with your problems.They look the other way.Management acts like they do want to be there.
bad,"Never apply all you going to do it is quit as you start, not family friendly place to be, if you live a lonely life and only worry about your self this is the place for you"
bad,if you want to be over worked and under paid then this is the place for you. long work days mostly 15 hour shifts. lacks team work lacks proper training.
bad,"I didn't know slavery was back... I worked both production and warehouse, over worked and underpaid. Once they use you, you'll be tossed like garbage."
bad,Worst company to work for day in and day out you are forced to clean up after other workers from a previous shift than after you are finished that you are to start your own work that is now late to be sent to the hospital because you were forced to clean and now that your hospital is late your supervisor will harass you all day until you are caught up or given up
bad,"If your looking for a quick fix for a job to pay your cell phone bill then this is the place for you. The stress and the negativity in this place consumes your entire life. I was constantly bullied and harassed and slandered and pushed over the edge and was always being distracted. This place has serious negative upper management and the management is the worst of any kind I have experienced. The first shift supervisor is top notch and is one person who is truly awesome and amazing who deserves so much better than this place, if you like working 50+ hours a week, being hot and sweaty, enjoy being stressed and harassed, enjoy being a statistic and only a number which they refer to as MED Scores/Performance number, and enjoy horrible bonuses, 1-2 percent yearly raises with no cost of living raise, and no employee appreciation then this is the job for you."
bad,"No Work Life Balance, extremely high turnover, every February & March there are lay offs or ""Company Restructuring.""  McKesson much better Company if you want to do similar job."
bad,The company lost its major customer and is closing its facility by June 2018. There is no guarantee of any severance pay or job with Owens anywhere in Tennessee. So I am looking for employment.
bad,There is no team work at this company. they are a very dysfunctional company. There is no loyalty to no one. Every man for themselves. You are overworked and underpaid.
bad,owens and minor is a terrible place to work the managers and supervisors are very unprofessional and rude disrespect is a serious problem.  the staff is unhappy with this but of course nothing is being done to change what is going on. when you wok long hours its never because of the work load just mores so the supervisors do not know what they are doing when assigning the work out to get it done on schedule.  also very dirty to be a distributor of medical products.
bad,"The company is a good place to work,  but in the Carol Stream il location can't say that. The leadership and HR team are complete idiots. Use derogatory language  towards  supervisors and teammates. Such ad the N-Word. Leadership team and HR allows teammates to talk negatively about supervisors even write statements using the bad language. Hr does not have knowledge  of labor laws, employee morale well let's say she no nothing.  Favoritism and politics as race control the place. If your not part of the little boys club and your not white you have no place in this DC. The Distribution Manager is not experienced in operation and has no leadership skills and ability. No room for growth, unless you're  part of the team ( hr, white America team).  "
bad,"Owens and Minor could be a very good company to work for if the compensation was more, although I took a pay cut I enjoyed working here."
bad,"The regular day at work was stressful, they was in the process of changing personal, firing everbody that they thought wasnt good enough for the job, even if you been there for many of years. What i learned working there was how to handle my peer, withen mangement and taking direct oders if i didnt like them or not.Some of the co-workers i did work with was unfriendly, so that made the job even worst, they had everyday a new body coming in there to fill the postion, so it was hard to get to know anybody. The best part of the job was just working, getting paid the right money, it was very hard for me to enjoy alot of the job because i was working over 50 hours daily seven days a week."
bad,14 hours a day 6 days a week was not a fun job at all...but did get to travel all over the united states so i had that going for me
bad,"I interviewed in Itasca, and interview was conducted by a boy asking questions with an attitude, you can tell he favors certain employees and makes false comments to HR in regards to whom he wants to hire, I have more than 25yrs exp in every area in distribution and warehousing and yet I didn't fit what they were looking for? Poor management and poor quality people, shame."
bad,"Upper management was completely clueless. Leadership positions are held by people who should not have even been considered qualified for the job."
bad,"First glimpse everybody was doing their part. After 2 weeks I noticed  certain employees slacking off. Went to boss and he told me I was at the wrong, I needed to do my part. Overall it's a biased place to work. If u don't mind watching people read/text during most of the shift while you work under presume this place is for you"
bad,"These supervisors and warehouse leads have no idea how to run a warehouse efficiently. All day I would see these 3 leads chatting, laughing, singing to the radio, and playing on there phones. I have personally caught the warehouse lead playing games on his phone multiple times in the same day, hes also been caught sleeping off a hangover at work. I am still not sure why is position even exist to be honest. But he isn't the only one cause the guy who is the head of the warehouse has been caught watching movies in his office. "
bad,"Caution!! everyone this company's a huge joke"
bad,"Very bad company!!! Does not care about thier employees, management is a joke, does not care about thier employees, only cares about work getting out, very racist and sexist managers, every last one of them!!! Very low pay, raises are a joke, if you want to waste your time, energy, and life, apply here!! Benefits are a joke also, very poor for a so called medical company. The company is so bad that the workers are turning against each other, no team work, etc, all because of management and how they treat us as employees. Not a good company to work for, I am a current employee looking for something better. Management expects you to work twelve hours a day without calling off, five days a week, 365 days a year!!! Company is not family oriented at all. I could go on and on but I wont!!"
bad,"too much nepotism, favoritism. Does not treat employees fairly. Supervisors use curse words at employees. No respect for employees."
bad,I was a patient care technician in another state in a smaller than most clinic. The staff was not caring and treated the patients the same
bad,"	Handling inbound and outbound calls"
bad,"You never know when you will go home from this place days can be anywhere from 10 to 16 hours,then you are expected to take online classes on your 8 hours off,not sure when they expect you to sleep,but if you want to have 10 minutes of your own personal life owens and minor is not the place for you"
bad,Worst place I have ever been at. Little paid & your hours get cut short & management is so fake especially the GM & Warehouse Manger so I would thing twice about signing up for this job.
bad,"Horrible place to work. Mediocre benefits.  forced to stay till job gets done. Unpredictable hrs and work volume. Mandatory weekends whenever they want. They promise you a bonus but never pay with any excuse. Only 0-2% salary increase after a yearly review. No opportunity for growth, you’ll be overlooked for promotions. Unreasonable management she’s constantly changing your hrs and schedule and non engaged with operations.always changing supervisors and managers.HR is a fraud."
bad,A medical distribution company that has gone downhill dramatically do to extremely poor management and questionable business decisions. During  my time there the work/life balance was non-existent and they would over work the entire staff to the point people would just quit randomly. Revolving door type of establishment to the fullest extent with customers constantly pulling their business from us due to poor quality which was directly caused by idiotic business and staffing decisions. Disrespectful supervisors and lack of leadership is the norm.
bad,"I have worked here a few months(almost six) and the while simple to do is made worse by the expectations of management.  Like most jobs there is a system in place where you need to hit a minimum rate/amount to be retained, though it is very much polluted by other things they want to track to essentially micro manage every thing you do and expect you to just come in and work like a robot.  Something that ""The Average Joe"" can come in and meet as stated by upper management.  Though that is a problem when most people in the buildng are not hitting the rate which in part is due to the lack of training as all they do is teach you how to do the job but never the ins and outs of their polluted metrics system on how to actually hit it and getting write ups for not hitting the rate that start after you have been there 6 months and essentially get walked out for that alone.  It's a good temp job if you wanna look at it that way.  Management only cares about numbers.  They don't care how much overtime we put in on a weekly basis.  They just expect us to come in and do it again. There is no employee appreciation what so ever.  Most of your dealings with management will essentially be them telling you how you are not hitting the goal in one area or another, sign off on write ups, sign off on errors, etc.  Going back to the overtime I mentioned, there is A LOT of it.  You practically live there.  Just about every day and every week there is overtime with no signs of slowing down especially when people get fired or just up and quit to save themselves the headache of having to work for a company"
bad,It's a dying company that harbors favoritism. If you have to just get what you need and get out! You're live is worth much more than 15 an hour. Walk away!
bad,"typical day requires you to be ready 10 min before punching in and immediately going 100% after your punch.  If you were friends with management you could slough off, but god forbid you stop for 5 seconds to talk to a friend if you weren't.  Picking scores were standardized but only a few people actually hit 100% picking for the day.  No one was held accountable for mispicks or not packaging product properly.  Overtime was mandatory 2 hours pretty much every night - maybe 1 day over my year there we went home earlier than the 2 hours mandated."
bad,"Poor management skills , they do lack of experience and they do not care about the money lost every day ( rcved wrong items , shipped extra , short ,wrong , losing customers ...etc) or the time being wasted ( the regular time and over time ) .........its a big fxxng joke , never worked in a place like that , associates watching movies on their phones while driving the forklift IN FRONT OF MANAGEMENT ."
bad,"In de basis een leuk bedrijf, opslag en distributie van medische artikelen waardoor je iets kan bijdragen in de medische sector.  Echter door slecht management is er een extreem te kort aan personeel waardoor de werkdruk erg hoog is. Helaas wordt er vanuit HR niets gedaan aan het grote verloop van personeel."
bad,"Typical work day is whatever they say it is, could be 8 to 12 hours. Management has doesn't care about the workers. very stressful work enviorment and not communication from management."
bad,Long days with lots of overtime weekends off need to work on overall attitude in dc. Hard to keep good employees there to stay for a long time. Good pay.
bad,if you like being stressed everyday you'll love this place they put so much emphasis on employee loyalty and their profits but shows none in return never again
bad,"Far too many hours, forced to pick up slack of slower workers, no set time to leave daily/weekly always changes, average day 12 to 16 hours, extremly poor managment."
bad,"The management is not very straight forward. They choose favorites and pick on the people they do not like. They make people feel unwelcome ... have lost several employees in the last week behind hectic work schedules and drama in management. They work you 60 hours a week, but complain if you ask for a sick day or paid time off. They mix up your hours constantly and try to gip people on overtime pay ."
bad,"Standard Operating Procedures are determined in large Distribution Centers with 100's of teammates available for all tasks. In small DC's, like Albuquerque, you are expected to wear many hats and do all the same tasks while being measured for performance and time utilization and expected to hit all company goals. The expectations are impossible to meet and teammates usually cheat the system to hit their marks. Upper management is a joke and does not listen to lower level manager and supervisor when they tell them the goals are impossible to meet! They want to be the best but never lift a finger to help. Employees are constantly getting written up for poor performance. Moral sucks and teammates have a, ""I'm doing what's best for me attitude and I don't give a darn about my teammates!"" People call in all the time, and could care less how their absence impacts their teammates work day. You never get out on time and employees will do as little as possible. NOBODY TAKES INITIATIVE to do more than expected and there is way too much drama for a little place like this. Expect to work lots of overtime because its always short staffed and even though teammates know this, they still call in and make it worse. The pay rate is low for what is expected and pay checks are good because your constantly working overtime and have no life. Worst company I ever worked for!"
bad,"Current management is bias and favortism runs rampid in this place.  The management team covers up everything that is going on.  All you have to do is complain too much or want to talk to the corporate HR department and be ready to receive a gift or gift card to keep you quiet.  "
bad,Managers seem to be biased and unfair toward their employees. They almost force you to work 10+ hr days. And they give you no assistance with furthering yourself through their online classes
bad,OMHCL is a lost company in a real 3PL world. They have turned over their management team at least 3 times since its inception in 2009. They continually waste money and customer trust by hiring the wrong management team. They are now going through round 4 and I am sure there will be more rounds after this one. It's sad to see a company waste so much money and continually churn through hundreds of dedicated teammates.
bad,I feel like this place is the worst place to work at corporate people are very stingy here and they dont care how hard your work is it is never good enough
bad,Don’t do it believe it’s something better for u!!! Not worth the time or hassle trying to make it work... Long hours poor operations. Human Resources and Upper management sucks they don’t care.
bad,It's a struggling company.  Not sure what the future holds.  There are some good people and some places are better to work than others.  It's tough to make any money in distribution.
bad,"Started off well, been a downward spiral ever since. There is no stability from top to bottom. Constant change is the only constant, leaving management (and workers) to ""make it work"". You have to know the right people to move up. Promotions are sometimes not based on ability. Management spreads most DCs very thin leaving enough people to get work done in 10 to 11 hours everyday yoare"
bad,I would never work here again the won't place ever you never get rises.they over work they lie to you and say you get off at 7:30 or 8:30 but you get off at 10 you have no family time and they don't care.poor mangment poor everything just run for your life warning run not worth it.
bad,The management here is horrible and they have a point system you won’t have time for family because you will be working a lot of overtime they don’t care about their employees
bad,"If you like drama, long hours, bad attitudes and favoritism shown amongst employees , dealing with dirty creepy men then that’s the job for you. Females there are young dumb and chaotic. Management and HR sucks."
bad,"This was the worst place I ever worked, the hours were long, no motivation and the management was a joke no leadership the people there are horrible to work for and with. I wouldn't recommend my worst enemy to work there and I'm glad that I left my life is a much better one, one of the best decisions I ever made."
bad,"The leadership needs to be looked out and how the little people are treated. "
bad,"Worst company I’ve ever worked for. No leadership, no plan, no strategy or process in place. No one knows what they are doing and there is a ton of turnover and layoffs. Don’t waste your time there."
bad,"I can only comment on the department I'm in, but it's a mess.  Hiring people, then moving them into different roles.  Laying people off who were hired within the year due to a reorg.  A lot of turnover at the top."
bad,They Expect you to work a mandatory 3 to 4 hours which isn’t bad but they are not culturally diversed And there are not equal opportunity as soon as they find out something petty about your background no matter how good of a worker you are they will let you go. Need a  new human resource manager asap!! And better guidance
bad,The training sucks they have nothing implemented to train people management is about self doesn't care about there employees at all. The coworker were friendly long hours never kno whem y oui u going home.
bad,The worst company i have ever worked for. They will take advantage of you if you allow them too. Upper and lower Managment do not have people skills at all.Turnover is off the charts. Think hard before joining this company. The only thing i like about Owens & Minor
bad,"Enjoyed the work and learning experience.  Upper Management created and perpetuated a hostile work environment.  Local management created an environment of favoritism and hostility.  There was a culture of ""throwing each other under the bus"" to save one's own job.  No teamwork.  People stopped trusting each other.  It was horrible.  I've never seen anything like it, or worked in an office like it."
bad,"Management is terrible,  good employees are overworked and lazy employees are left to lay on you leg.I worked there 8 years thought at first good place to make a career , but in the end you are just number"
bad,The job is not a bad job. Management is the problem. There is too much favoritism and no appreciation for going above and beyond or for loyalty to the company. You are not treated as important to the company
bad,the company is going down hill ... and they treat people unfair .... it was a great place to work many years ago .... with all the changes I dont see this company moving forward they have lost alot of contracts and they still dont get it ....
bad,"This is without a doubt the worst warehouse I have ever worked for. The management is so incompetent it's not even funny anymore. I'm still waiting for my yearly review and raise, which was supposed to happen months ago. But the GM claims he's working on it. Yet we all work 12 plus hours a day with no relief in sight. "
bad,Factory work. Underpaid. Overworked. No regard for employee work life balance. A lot of impractical solutions. Management had unrealistic expectations.
bad,"Owens is not the place to work they preach work life balance but it is not that way at all. Most teammates are overworked and underpaid. Raises are a joke and bonuses are low. Rollover is at 70% or more."
bad,"Management is incompetent, they (Tony & Dino) have no regard for the lives & safety of their employees. You'll be cheated out of your break times & the excuse will be because of the RF system designed by corporate (just an excuse to force employees to work even faster in a dangerous environment). If you're desperate for a job, and don't mind working like a slave and being treated like a child, then this is the job for you. 1220 Forest Pkwy, Paulsboro, NJ 08066"
bad,I used to work for avid medical been there 10 years till owen and minor bought them owen and minor is a terrible place to work plain and simple they tell you that you have the opportunity to grow in the company maybe but when a good position opens they hire from outside the company an dont say nothing to the person who went for it the health insurance is insane cost way to much only gives you 35 cent pay increase a year the management consistently tell the employee they not working hard enough they to slow the human resources department is terrible they dont investigate nothing the equipment is run down the ceo promise new ones and never came they liers as well don't work for them you can do way better then Owens and minor
bad,"Screwed up the account for the last few years and couldn't get anything right, along with staff who are rude and all they want to do is try to make you look bad in everything you do, it's so bad that they are on there 4th manager, the company can't get there stuff together then try to put it on the employees like they are the reason they have been horrible. Hospital staff is poorly trained and don't even know what the supplies are and they are using it on patients and they are RN's they should know. The O&M HR ladies are horribly rude and spread bad information about the employees this place needs to be sued."
bad,The manager I worked for did not follow all rules. Had material that should have been returned for credit throw out several times. Seemed to pick on certain employees. Said that employees would work together as a team and be held equally for problems which did not happen.Took action aganist employees when they were doing the job of others to the best of there abilities when they were out of work. Did not seem to be the right person for the job in many ways.
bad,"Now it is the equivalent of a ""death march"", the current GM has zero charisma and makes no effort to get to know the staff. He may know how to read a report and schedule a meeting but beyond that he is severely lacking. Not sure how corporate determined that this was ""the guy"". He put some office wonk in place and she spends most of her time alienating people. All of the good talent that is left are having the life sucked out of them , with crushingly long hours which sadly is no guarantee that you will still have a job, should a light at the end of the tunnel ever appear. Not a healthy environment at all."
bad,Management team are a bunch of liars. Dont apply there is you have a criminal record even if its from 1999 as they will tell you they can hire you but they wont even if you are a great employee! I would not recommend this company to anyone!
bad,"Enjoyed working at different Owens & Minor locations...The one in Richland,Ms...is honestly terrible...no advancement...only certain people work...management is horrible....enjoyed my teammates n supervisor.. only reason I stayed as long as I did..."
bad,Management refuses to listen to any suggestions that would help make processes more efficient.  Work 12+ hours on most days because the company won't hire the people needed in order to make the deliveries needed.
bad,"Director was chauvinistic."
bad,Horrible GM . Bad management . Horrible equipment. Don’t do it!! Hours are too long. The standards that are set are wrong . The code of honor is a joke. Don’t do it.
bad,"Company is to top heavy with Consultants and SR Management positions. Most of these positions are from areas outside Medial Distribution and Sales. Most of previous Sr Management has left in last two years and they have been replaced by outside people. There is no creativity for growth, just cutting operations and quality of service to Hospitals. They are not interested or do not know how to grow business without cost cutting. The stock prices verify the current direction of the Company."
bad,Management only cares about numbers and money. Could careless about people and their families. Would not recommend anyone to work there and if I would it would be to gain experience
bad,its not good the people are cool at first then when you get comfortable then all the bad things start to come not a career but cool for your first job if you can take it
bad,"Expect to have no personal life at all.Hours sucked.Management is two faced talks about employees to other employees.Drama in the warehouse. Poor work environment. Hr was a joke,she could care less about the issues you had with management. Overall not a good place to work."
bad,"I work there for about a year and a half and I had a problem with the safety that the place have and nothing get's done when complaint about it. Is very  easy to get hurt. This company is a medical supply for hospitals and I didn't understand why they had needles and IV's all over the floor and hydrocloride and other IV bag all over the floor when this product it supposed to be steril. I complaint many times and including talking to the manager  and at the end just cause me my job because I care about the well being of the sick people in the hospitals."
bad,"Owens&minor are the worst company I've ever worked for, ""especially under Stanford hospital."" This company has temp workers training each other, then your put on the spot the next day doing the job alone ""how can you do it with just notes done by your hand and they move through everything so quickly!!!"" (I wish they would of given me a book to study at least before letting me go)"
bad,Good health insurance good pay because of the overtime moving up in the company is not based on how good of a worker you are it is based on how well you know management
bad,"Company is horrible. Management had excuses for everything job advancement when it came to black people examples such as point, errors, attendance or behavior. Management even gossiped and talked about employees"
bad,"Physically demanding and they play off injuries as if they were a preexisting condition. When you begin there is no accrual for sick days, so for 90 day you have to be on point"
bad,Owens and minor was a fast paced work place that focused on numbers. The management was horrible. I never received my annual raise and my review was 5 months past when I was suppose to have one. The only thing great about the job were the people you worked with. They made that place tolerable.
bad,"The biggest issue here was and still is terrible management. Favorites were given special treatment. Some managers were woefully under qualified for their positions and had bad judgement in  making some of the worst employees leads. OT is frequent and mandatory, no matter if you have a life outside of work and if you could not work you were given attendance points, usually double the going rate. Always the ""threat"" to work Saturday unless the job could be done during the week with a lot of OT. HR was unsupportive and unhelpful. Anytime a complaint of employee misconduct was reported , it was ""investigated"" and nothing ever came of the investigation. I was repeatedly bullied by one individual as were others. Multiple complaints were made on this individual and nothing was ever done. Poor management has always been an issue here and has driven a large number of both supervisors and team mates away. I am very happy to have left. The starting pay is average to above average and the best way to make more money is to apply for different jobs in other departments to get better pay. Regular pay raises are nominal."
bad,"Pay and benefits are great but it’s almost not worth it having to deal with the things that goes on here. The job posting says mandatory overtime but it doesn’t say it’s a mandatory 3-4 hours EVERYDAY(that the mangers and supervisors don’t even stay and work, they leave after 2 hours) .... And you only get a 30 min break for working 12 hours smh. You can’t call off or have emergencies because they give you points for literally everything.. late, sick, exhausted,overworked.. it’s honestly just a horrible place to work if I’m being COMPLETELY HONEST"
bad,"When hired they said some overtime. They need to say OT every night until 2 or 3 a.m. Management is terrible,no communication and lack of training. I would not recommend. Pay is good but not worth the energy and time you put into this place."
bad,"Onsite at the DMC, very unprofessional environment, very small workforce for a job of that magnitude. If someone calls off you’re in for a 12 to 14 hour day easily. No work life balance. Job basically sucked."
bad,"Every day started out working 3 hours before you were told how many hours overtime were mandatory for that day. 3-5 hours overtime (more than 8 hrs) were extremely common. They were very flexible on start times or end times as long as you put the hours in. NO TALKING! If you talked you weren't punished but you would have to explain to the bosses why you weren't super productive. They track everthing: time working, time on breaks, and could listen to your conversations through your headset (which you used for order picking) For the work environment...if you aren't running from bin to bin you aren't picking fast enough. The upper picking floors were a sauna with no air movement. No easy access to water."
bad,"45 people were just laid off august 27,2016..reason cause they lost 60 percent of there business.. there is a lot of favortism,high insurance rates,if you like to work 11 hours days including weekends "
bad,"Management is incompetent, they have no regards for human life. If you're desperate for a job, and don't mind working like a slave and being treated like a child, then this is the job for you, Louisiana DC only, I'm not sure how the other DC's operate but this one is a horrible place to work."
bad,"This is a company that caters to Health items, stocking Doctors offices and hospitals with supplies, so it was s surprise how little they cared about people and their employees, not a people company at all, they did not care about you or your health or anything that was going on in your life. They seem to thrive of anger, hate and lying to employees about the most trivial of things"
bad,"Start the day with team meeting then off for a LONG work day. Each day in Carol Stream you can expect 13-15 hour days. You pick orders going to hospitals in Wi. and IL. When we were in Hanover Park it was great, everyone got along, had great hard working teammates, only worked 10 hour days and the team helped each other to get the work done. Then the company decided to go into an RDC and consolidate 3 DC's into 1 with more space, product, equipment and teammates. Things fell apart and work hours exploded with the lack of training on new automation, new teammates hired, the getting away from verification of orders. Customers who were completely satisfied are now suffering the growing pains of this RDC. Swat teammates were brought in to help correct the downward spiral and train teammates on the automation and on picking orders properly. This helped slightly but apparently not fast enough for corporate? It has gotten so bad they put the GM on administrative leave then fired him? This man worked for O&M for 18yrs and was GM of the year and awarded DC of the year. Then came the termination of a manager, several supervisors and teammates. In which all have worked hard and tirelessly to keep productivity going and customers satisfied. O&M continually states that the teammates are the backbone of the company and them tosses people away because of their lack of for sight in planning. Sadly enough this has happened at other DC's around the country and odds are will continue in the future. I believed in the company and the management I served under in the past, but not the future. "
bad,"No time to do anything during the day, typical day at work was till about 2:30am if not later that is with starting your day at 3:30pm"
bad,management is racist. worked here for two years & seen so many black employees quit simply because they were never put in a position to succeed. I was on the receiving team and my shift start @ 1am there were days we wouldn’t get out until 1pm
bad,"Terrible place to work. Everything you do is monitored. They suggest you use the restroom on your break. Must Meet quota each day or you receive points. late for break, points. Late to leave break, points. Late for work by 2 minutes, points. It goes on and on and on. They moved to St. Louis to buy the Burrows; the company that had all the hospital contracts. They acquired Burrows, then terminated everyone. Then lost the contracts a few years later due to poor management.they specialize in automation and logistics, not customer service. They are staunchly non-Union. 2% raise is a gift. In your yearly evolution supervisor will go over how many times you were late for lunch, forgot to clock out for break, anything not to give you any raise. The average is around 1.5 %. That is the absolute truth. Please stay away."
bad,"Four CEOs in four or five years."
bad,"They are short staffed all the time, over time is a must and the hours they work are crazy. Swing shift workers have no life working here. Things have changed and I feel like it's going down hill with the way things are going. They expect you to work until you can't work anymore. And they have lost so many employees since I've started working here. I just left because I was being screwed over with my days working here and the pay."
bad,Management needs to be improved. The manager at the Jacksonville DC did not get around hardly to speak to the workers.
bad,Changes in management for the worse. Low morale to a point when the employee doesn't want to come in a bad working environment. Too strict. Unreasonable
bad,This place is not good at all management is racists to the highest degree i hated it do not work at this place long hours low pay bad management 1yr is all i could do
bad,"This company used to be a pretty good company to work for. In the past 4-6 years they have decided that the more efficiently their workers work, regardless if many if not most people work differently, they will stringently put their workers between a rock and a hard place, while favoring only a few and those who are young enough and mentally strong enough to survive in the name of meeting their hospital supplies needs, and in fact abusing the basic need for their workers to thrive in a balanced environment, and using ""time study"" tactics to basically demoralize their workforce while increasing their profits in an extremely unfair way."
bad,"You will be thoroughly trained and prepped before you enter the clean room. Before very kit you will be given the instructions. Sometimes coworkers can be caddy and childish. other than management the whole vibe of the place is to just do what you have to and get out, a lot of people tend to complain about the pay."
bad,"Phones, billing, Kronos, payroll, emails, error billings.  Most enjoyable part of my job was working with and helping my co-workers.  The hardest part was trying to strike a balance with management and teammates, knowing what to say and when to say it.  We all got along great and I looked forward to going into work every day."
bad,Not the company it used to be.  Stopped being a company that cares about customers and Teammates.   The new president is taking the outline Cardinal Used and is following it to the letter.  Not a original thought in his head. No loyalty to team or vendors.
bad,"Poor training,  they are so short handed there is next to nothing in training, management needs to get more help in the building or more will quit, I was supposed to be their new warehouse lead and I felt as though all I was hired for was to fill a void, the work environment is miserable, I will never work there again"
bad,"terrible training practices"
bad,"Could be a terrific establishment to work, but new management needs to take over. Management never gets anything accomplished, can’t keep employees because of the way they are treated. Throw the whole management team away including HR."
bad,communication and respect not so great with supervision. Having the oppurtunity to show my related work skills that I have receive over the years of experience that I have optain over 18+ years.
bad,Poor decision  making telling  lies stories  not adding up good workers  leaving  for better opportunities managers  pick and choose  who they want fo invansment
bad,"The Williumsburg site production and WH shifts work enviornment was totally unprofisssional, harassed, tuff and discrimating espacially for immagrants and non US citizen employees. They use labors like machinery. Shifts work culture was(he or she did) just no cooperation. Disobying FDA rules and product quility"
bad,agement has no respect for its employees all rules do not appy to everyone .they don't care about their employees. only concentrate on the negative situations never a job well done
bad,This company was great when I started here 5 years ago.  Then they started taking away benefits like sick days and any kind of make up time to give us some freedom to participate in family gatherings and functions.   Most recently they are moving into the city coming up in 2018.
bad,At OM you know that the work your doing is helping to save lives. That gives you the motivation to pick your orders quickly and accurately to ensure hospital workers have what they need to properly care for patients. That's the most satisfying part of the job. The downside is the company is poorly managed and you receive no support from management. After your one day of training you are left to figure it out for yourself. The management there never did the job they expect you to do so they cant help you succed in your role. You receive no coaching or feedback on your performance unless your being written up for it. The pay is poor
bad,They are unorganized. Poor management. They change their minds how they want things done every few months. You are supervised by people who are new and never worked in this field So when you need questions answered or solutions to a problem they do not know themselves. More than half our accounts left the company to Medline. Not enough work to go around and they are close to bankruptcy. Run the other way
bad,"I’ve been working here for a few years. Since I started we had softball, free gym memberships, golf outings, employee picnics. Now is all gone and left into darkness. Culture was ok and not the best now.  Now ever since new management took over everything turned upside down. They look at numbers, charts, stats and not the reality. Lots of favoritism, few supervisors and management are so picky towards certain individuals. If they like the person they’ll treat them like gold. If they don’t like certain individuals, they tend to mistreat, talk down, pretend the person don’t exist. I’m a very hardworking employee and always get the job done. Others like myself get overlooked, unappreciated, with no rewards, not even receive a “job well done” from management. It’s all clockwork to them with no regards but unless if they like certain individual."
bad,"the upper management is not in connection with lower levels and they work in different ways, at the end they want to meet upper management expectations but the work done in lower levels was not in accordance with desired strategy"
bad,"A place where you have to make you percentages, but however, when you make your number upper management raises the numbers so till your unable to reach your mark."
bad,"Felt like getting a whip, but without the actual whip. They keep track of your performance, which is fine, however they have unrealistic expectations. The management just said what they thought you wanted to hear, so you would go away or leave the subject."
bad,"You are just another number to them.  No matter if you are sick, injured or have family.  If you are not there working MANDATORY overtime EVERYDAY, you are out the door no matter how much you give to this place."
bad,it has poorly trained supervisors. there is favorites within the workplace. there is supervisors sleeping around with employees. they overwork their hard working employees and let the slack offs get away with doing nothing. poorly ran place by the people they have in charge overall on the afternoon shift. no end time for work your there until whenever.
bad,"I didnt stay very long, I found a better job opportunity. But while employed there the people were friendly and allowed me to be myself.  I met some very nice people there."
bad,Not a good place to work they use you  and dump you very stressful no work life balance no pay raise no promotions you only get two 15mins braak on an 12hour shift.
bad,Owens and Minor is going downhill fast. The distribution center I work at is run by incompetent people who don't have the first clue about what it means to be in a leadership position.  Would not recommend.
bad,Company does not care about their employers you get points for everything even if you are a minute late and if you get sick on the job company all about making money
bad,worked hard but raises were 1 to 2 percent. A lot of lying from management about pay and company status. The turnover was at 80 percent in 2016. You worked hard and received grief in return.
bad,"it started in the afternoon.We will do a lot even some, house keeper work. But that was not our title at all.Also we had to be in a very hectic environment where people are very competitive."
bad,"You have to train your own bosses here, No room for advancement. Corrupt Management and HR Department. Heavy workload with minimal pay in the department I worked in."
bad,"I hate going to work. People are always faking injuries and going on light duty which makes others have to pick up their slack. If you disagree with anything management says or even have valid complaints and solutions, they with ignore you and/or take your ideas with no credit to you."
bad,Not a bad place to work if you don't have family and want to devote your life to a company. I have driven forklift at a lot of places and this place was easily the most dangerous place to drive that I have ever encountered. People driving don't stop or beep horns so you have to be very very careful. Was forced into resigning because I no longer felt safe even though there were a lot of other things they could do with me there. They told me I could resign or they were going to fire me. All in all probably the worst experience I've ever had.
bad,company no longer has warehouse in Orlando.product is drop shipped from Jacksonville to 3 trucks that park in a Penske yard.Losing major accts.due to changes in operations and management
bad,Not a great place to work long term.  Low morale throughout the company.  Low pay and extremely long hard hours. I have never told one person about Owens and Minor the entire time I've been there.
bad,"Company as a whole is great, but if management & employees don't like you for whatever reason, your life will be miserable.  You will get written up for anything minor & will be fired just as fast.  Manager will not leave their desk to give you the proper training required to maintain your job, instead a coworker will ""train"" you. Get written up for the most ridiculous things like chewing gum, unpredictable working hours - days could last 13 hours instead of 8.  You feel as if you have to walk on eggshells all day so not to anger management.  Towards the end, I was physically sick going in because I never knew if it was my last day or not."
bad,Does not leave time for a life outside of work. Long hours with little pay.
bad,The company cant seem to keep people at work due to the vast amounts of overtime. Trying to get time off is hard due to the amount of senior employees getting the best days. So if you have a family or a life outside of work you can almost say goodbye to that!
bad,"Ok job, but high turnover rates because workers are treated poorly and the ""point"" system is terrible! If you miss any days, for any reason... your personal time, vacation time, and or sick time will be used without your consent."
bad,"Sadly they've gone from the heros (#1) to zero in 5 years. Stock was $40, now $3/share. Board of Directors put new CEO in place.His changes began and O&M sunk. No longer did we treat our customers like they mattered so customers starting leaving then lay offs began  and continue in 2019.  O&M mistakes and poor management have benefited 2 major competitors. So sad"
bad,"The job is easy, management makes it hard. Supervisors lack leadership. They expect you to slave and whenever you ask for help, you don’t receive it. The point system is ridiculous. A lot of good people have been fired. Temps coming and going. This company has a hard time keeping good quality people. Beware of the surreptitious colorism"
bad,Wasn’t a place to work if you wanted a good work home balance. At our DC we were severely understaffed and some of the people in higher position didn’t feel they needed to pull their weight. It really wasn’t the best job culture and there was definitely special treatment of certain employees.
bad,"Went from being a secure, dependable, trustworthy organization to a deceitful and disorganized company. Customer satisfaction used to be one of our main priorities, not so much anymore."
bad,"Be prepared to have no life. You do not have a set schedue so one day is 3am, the next is 6am, then 2am...all over the place. No consideration for your well being. The company itself isn't bad but the manager is a moron sitting behind the desk to collect a check."
bad,"Owens and Minor as a company is not a bad place to work. In my particular distribution center, there were several issues with the GM that continue since leaving. Massive turnover, no accountability."
bad,The company overall is a good place to work. The location in Kansas City for Owens & Minor is less than satisfactory. Very long working hours with less than normal staff on hand.
bad,"Empty promises, management asks for opinions but immediately shuts them down because they are smarter than you, but then will try your opinion and say it was their idea the whole time, multi-faced people fill the warehouse"
bad,Can't keep a full staff so the amount of overtime is ridiculous. your life literally revolves around that place. Terrible benefits and horrible raises.
bad,"This place had a butt kissing contest. Seen alot of good workers before me leave due to this. The ones who stayed were the ones who didnt want to do anything. Made managers aware of wrong doing of other employees and nothing was done. No advancement. If you are good at something, thats were you are staying. Even when they say you can go anywhere in the company. Raises are also horrible."
bad,I learrned more about medical products at the distribution level. Also learned more applications as well at military softwares. There's always something new so its a challenge at any point.
bad,"Company professes to be ""team environment,"" but management is not supportive of teammates. Leaders in HR seem anti-teammate and mean-spirited. Poor pay, low benefits. Development limited to favored employees. Prefer micromanagers who do not understand or support technology or their teammates. But since they get results (task oriented), HR loves them."
bad,"no balance between work and home.  Massive amount of hours required to work there from 8 - 12 hours per day 5 days a week, you never know when you are getting off and cannot leave until your supervisor dismisses you like you are a naughty little child."
bad,The company would not be a terrible place to work if management actually existed. Too many buddy buddy situation and lack of holding people accountable for their own actions and responsibilities of their job.  Many times people were allowed to do subpar work while the rest of the team was required to pick up the slack.  Unfortunately upper management was aware and did not hold its supervisors accountable for the decision or lack thereof decisions made. Often times trucks were loaded 3+ hours after scheduled departure times.
bad,I have been here for over a decade and unfortunately the company has gone from great to not so great to now poor.  Many people have left so it feels less and less like a thriving vibrant place and more like a quiet morgue.  New leadership is trying to make things better but unfortunately I think the damage is done and we are now waiting for the inevitable.
bad,"Change is good, and challenging.  It is what you make it.  There is good and bad everywhere.  Keep your glass half full.  I loved my job and was well compensated."
bad,There are many roles in the company that make up the new center. These roles are entry level with not alot of advancement and little to none training. Not sure where the company will end up within the next 5 years with how it is now.
bad,This is a good company. The issue here is management and employee policy. Its a problem when executives don't understand the information and you have to educate them.
bad,"Only work here if you need the money "
bad,"Company is in in transition operating on lean staffing "
bad,"Cons: "
bad,"You must order pull Medical supplies..throat tubes, syringes, gloves, etc. Lay off's are also controlled by contracts hold between employer and local hospitals."
bad,"Your a speck of dust in a dark shadow, you are left behind as some of your teammates ( favoritism) get to do what they please and leave when they want, you are just a voice that travels in one ear and out the other"
bad,Owens & Minor had poor senior Management  recourses were not made available to me when I needed them. I had no work life balance only worked even on my off days I work. I was salary but I was working 12 hour days mon-fri  and 6 to 8 hours on my off days
bad,"If you don't like knowing when you're going home, perfect place.  If you like working thanksgiving, Christmas and NY, perfect place.  I make more than some that have been here 3+ years based on my prior experience.  You're expected to pick items at a ridiculous amount of time.  Bathroom breaks count against your numbers, adjusting your pallet goes against you, disorganization at it's finest in managing.  Hopefully I'll be out of here soon."
bad,"Not a bad place if you need work to get by, but there is very little room for advancement. One supervisor seems to try his best to make this the most miserable place you could ever work."
bad,I increased my knowledge on the distribution side of the business
bad,These people contacted me through linked in. The male recruiter said he was going to call me and never did . Poor mangement and follow up. Be careful ...
bad,Managers seem to be biased and unfair toward there employees. They almost force you to work 10+ hr days. And they give you no assistance with furthering yourself through their online classes.
bad,I got hurt on the job and recueved Workman's Comp. It was a good job while I was driving trucks. Until I got hurt and had to do light duty in the warehouse.
bad,"The company no longer cares about its employees, They let long time good employees go for all sorts of reasons with no proof of certain things they were accused of doing."
bad,At Owens and Minor it is a business of medical supplies. there was many errors in supplies going to the customer and lack of checking orders to ensure things went well
bad,"If you gonna work here,get ready for mindless job the longer you are there your speed increases,but you can't compete with the ones that been there for 6 months or more,. . They have a unrealistic expectations  just to push you!!!unrealistic expectations never change,maintenance  worker help production half the time to create fake production outputs, it's a system that's simple enough to keep people moving  constant,it's a good 2 job if u need a second job it,they rely on foreigners with low English ability to manipulate and push like dogs,and don't speak just listen environment,but 401k good matches free money so do wit you gotta do.you see threw the bull if you value your self"
bad,"If you are a new hire, you will most likely start on the 2nd shift.  You will never know what time you are leaving because you can't leave until all the work is done.  I would estimate that a normal day would be about 10 hours.  The warehouse is not temperature controlled, so it is hot in the summer!  The majority of the time you are pulling small medical supplies in tight quarters with a bunch of simpletons crowding you.  Your coworkers will be either ghetto or  .  They talk about advancement, but that would be years in the future, and those positions don't look very promising.  Bottom line, you can find a much easier job for 12.90 an hour."
bad,"After being scouted by Owens for over a year, I finally decided to take a position there.  They offered a large compensation and benefits package, and promised me advancement and career growth through the roof.  Shortly after starting with Owens I became increasingly more aware that their HR, Management, and Culture were seriously lacking.  I was having to create HR documents from scratch as their National HR did not have a standard.  During management meetings I realized that everyone in the room has an idea but no one knew how to follow through or implement.  I had multiple teams and different hospitals in supply chain who had not received yearly reviews in over a decade, and some of which had not received an annual raise in that same amount of time.    There were Area Managers who had not visited their sites in years.  Overall, this company has the potential to be one of the greatest distribution and hospital process improvement specialists in the world, but they are lacking oversight, standardization, and integrity.  Given the opportunity I would gladly take a position as a consultant to help them resolve this matters, but I would not be willing to take any other type of position.  I left this company with a sad and bitter taste in my mouth from the lost potential.  They have deep pockets and buy their way into new industry practices but fail to implement them as successfully as they could.  This is the kind of company you take a job with to make a large sum of money quickly and then run for the hills before your integrity and morale are incinerated."
bad,"Small satellite office. Out dated and dirty with bugs."
bad,I honestly dont remember much about my time at roses other than I was charged with keeping theft at a minimum.  I was part of loss prevention.
bad,"I picked, shipped and received orders on a daily basis, maintained forklift batteries, and used UPS and FED EX shipping on on line"
bad,"12-16 hour work days, this is not what I signed up for and it will only get worse."
bad,"Already done this one."
bad,I worked for Owens for seven years. They were a great company that took care of the teammate and the teammate was the most important part of the company.  Over time the company changed and the current model is all about doing as much as possible with as little as possible and only the people at the top matter. Management teams that are noninclusive and work to undermine each other. This is no longer a place that one would want to continue in a long term carrier. There is little to no work-life balance unless you are the General manager who chooses to work from home many days.
bad,Very corporate environment with a lot of change happening.  Some concerns around job security depending where you are.  They do have great training opportunities to utilize.
bad,It’s a job most workers are friendly and pay is ok need more pay for the work and hours we work and start at 5am to whenever the job is done so if you got family don’t plan on spending much time with them we are always short workers either quit or get fired.
bad,I would not recommend this place to anyone. Your are worked to death and they don't value their employees. They worry more about  getting patients in medical facilities supplies than their employees.
bad,the metric system sucks. the guidlines for that facility has never been measured which means that no one can get the numbers in that facility. management does not care
bad,Hard to keep a good working outlook with this company.  Especially with all the charges going on and people losing their jobs.  Very sad to see the direction this company is going.
bad,"Management don't offer enough training and time to meet production goal. Warehouse employees, sabotage new hires.  Management don't know how to manage warehouse employees. Management  expects employees to solve their own problems.. If you have an issues, management blames the employee. You can't depend  on  management.  In 8 weeks management expect for you to meet production goal  98%, with very little training. Again RUN FOREST RUN!"
bad,"The assembly itself was not an issue. It was the staff. The line supervisors have ""big head"" syndrome. They argue on the floor in front of everyone like small kids. Instead of working together it is every man for themselves. Working overtime on Saturday's gets old quick. Especially when it is months before having two days off a week. Family life VS work life is a horrible ratio. I would have stayed much longer but there are people that have been here for over 15 years that needs to go.Their common decency on how to talk with people have disappeared. The attitudes are nasty. The revolving door of people should tell HR what is wrong at this location. Besides the ridiculous point system."
bad,"The work isn't bad, the people are fun to work with. The management is extremely poor. Zero work/life balance. Insane overtime, the company doesn't want to hire the help needed."
bad,"I worked at the Austin branch. It was a nightmare. One manger and or lead would tell you to do one thing and then another would say the opposite. They really need to learn how to communicate with each other before giving orders."
bad,"Fast paced environment; management push up employee to getting score.They not really care about people, but for result only."
bad,"Originally last year when coming aboard, the company seemed very promising. However, as time continued, and mainly with the change of new management, they have reinforced a goal of moving backwards, lacking common sense, and ESPECIALLY apathy towards their employees. I would not recommend anyone to work for them."
bad,"High pace and fast work flow, just a regular job the people are not friendly at all but it was a job."
bad,"even though you are a good worker and do a great job on you tasks. A manager will look for false things about you so they can let you go. Top manager does nothing about this and I feel there is a lot for discrimination. Even if you go to corporate about what is going on, they do nothing, even when you have the facts."
bad,"Been with the company two years at the CEC downtown Richmond. I was turned down for a position once based on my color. Got another position and the manager was the worst! she does not fit in with the culture. She's rude and vindictive. Women there are 55+ and gossip worse than high school kids. Management nor HR does anything about it. HR doesn't care about employees,  only managers. ,"
bad,They made several supervisor positions this past year and filled those spots with incompetent people.. Supervisors constantly changing the way things are done.. If it aint broke dont fix it.. They change thing around and hospitaks start complaining nd threatening to leve. Supervisors suck a the managers as well.. 2 leads run that whole place and are over worked and treated unfairly..
bad,"Many small benefits have been taken away from employees, There are only 2 supervisors worth anything there."
bad,They always want you to do so much but yet they hire other people in making more than what your making and will not fix the situation. when I have first started they said that they permute within more than looking outside but now changed all the management and that is no longer the case. If you work there more than 4 years your not good to the new management
bad,"O&M is a dependable company, but the pay is very low, and the opportunities are not great.  When being interviewed I was sold on cross-functionality, but I have done nothing but my own position.  I have had 5 managers in less than 4 months."
bad,"Owens and Minor is a difficult and stressful job. You start the day fast paced and it does not let up until you leave. You are sweating and stressing for 10 hours straight. "
bad,OM is going through some very interesting changes right now. The direction of the company is changing and not in a way I think will allow for advancement.
bad,"A typical day would be 10 to 14 hours. New management making changes to improve efficiencies but made changes all at once. This caused long hours, moral issues, increased sick call off, resignations of quality teammates and the resignation of both operations supervisors within a few weeks of each other."
bad,"this job is a pretty tuff job hard work, and long hours as well. Coworkers there are pretty awesome. they help the time go by."
bad,I started out driving a truck for owns in minor it was a good company to work for poor management changed my opinion of that 7 years later the truck driver part of the company was sold or  Out sourced
bad,"Owens and Minor is a good place to work if you make friends. However, if you don't, it is a very gossipy environment that can be hard for some to handle. The warehouse itself is incredibly disgusting and frankly it's hard to believe a medical supplies company is able to function this way. They are continuously understaffed and the turnover is way too high. The overtime is 1-4 hours every night."
bad,Company had much attrition amongest employees within my time there. Biggest reason many felt training was lacking! Not an organized approach to equip employees for success and promotion in their roles.
bad,Everything about my employment there sucked. Didn’t like anything and was very happy that I got another job offer to get out of that place. So long O & M!
bad,"Interesting establishment, disjointed  would be the kindest wording possible. Inventory Control Mgr. probably only “ realistic “ and effective manger in that distribution center; with the exception of one talented Operations Manager who is so over utilized it’s literally a sin."
bad,Great work culture . Work is clean and fairly easy to complete. It was a great place to work until a few years ago. Corporate management and the new CEO completely changed the company we once loved.
bad,Typical day involved working with leadership to develop plan for the week and staffing needs. The changes in the company and local leadership required working on the basic needs and instruction on a yearly basis before being able to train on other needed skills.
bad,This company used to be a great place to work. In the last few years the management has gone downhill starting at the corporate office and working its way down to the dc's. People are miserable and its throughout every DC in the country.
bad,"Constantly very busy environment.   Many options for flexibility for hours of work schedules, as there are multiple shifts that are scheduled throughout the day."
bad,Did not like the fast passed enviorment. no room to addvance. very set in their ways. good benifits though which I think is how they get people to work there
bad,"Not too much direction within job description."
bad,"the job itself isnt horrible. its just the people you have to work for and the way they make you and expect you to work. coworkers werent the greatest nor the smartest. machines are garbage, always out of neccassary supplies to do the job function"
bad,Pick items using a voice automated system while trying to hit a certain rate and not make mistakes. You didn't leave until the work was finished. so an 8hr day could end up a 12hr day.
bad,A day at Owens and Minor consists of 11 or more hours a day. The management can be a little insensitive of your personal life and my co-workers are sometimes the only thing that can get me through the day. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that I am helping thousands of people everyday but the hardest part is working all day long and not being able to spend time with my family.
bad,Started off getting 40 hours then new hires kept coming in dropping everyone's hours.If I am hired as full time I expect full time hours. Other than that it wasn't too bad.
bad,"Smh people do what they want, its favortism there, no ot available except.for.certain people alot 0f work for 0ne person. No respect toward people rules are petty depending on your shift you will get beat for your holiday pay"
bad,"Management doesnt know what they're doing. As if they are learning on the fly. A few want to actually help the company and they work with their employees, but others are clearly there for their check. Tons of safety training but not much of actual training, especially with their picking system."
bad,"long hours - too many redundant conference calls "
bad,start at 2pm.there is alot of medical stuff that u ndont think about!
bad,"contact, attend and provide the estimates to the client is done with satisfaction, existing a culture of commitment to the business. The development of the work is done in the estimated times. the management peovee the machinery and materials to perform the service and the security details."
good,the ware house manager seems to think if its not done the managers way it is not the right way. Manager is always in your face. manager does not trust any of the employees to do their job. manager has a habit of chasing off employees. Hence a really bad turn over rate.So if you want to work long tiring hours and be criticized for your work with low low pay then this is the place for you
good,"The manager was rude, never helped, I honestly dont recomend any hispanic people to work here, nadamas por ser paisa se valora menos el trabajo se uno alv"
good,All companies have their ups and downs right now they're at a low. They need to figure out how to regain the interest of the employees. How to bring new ones in and retain the ones they have.
good,"your job is your life.......crazy overnight hours. job first, everything else comes after. trying to get a day off is like pulling off a limb by hand"
good,"More focus on quintity rather than quility. Shifts accuse eachothers for missing. Disrespect, poor training new employees, races are the major factors of Hustile work culture."
good,It was chill i guess. Worked with some cool people for 8 months. The day after new years we came to work only to be laid off without any prior notice smh.
good,"my review is based on working here years and years ago so things may have changed. The hours were long but there was never a shortage of work."
good,"A typical day at work in the 1st shift was great, we worked as a team helping each other out. There were many times we had triple the work for the team but we manage to over come the matter. The hardest part of the job was dealing was a lot of call outs and people quitting without notice. I learned to work hard and safe on a rapid pace to meet deadlines as a team. The most enjoyable part was meeting the quota for the incident free report every month and being rewarded with lunches and company rewards bucks."
good,"Not willing to work with needs, they charge you points for sick time, one each day and after a certain amount you are fired. once on night shift always on night shift"
good,"There is not a lot of concern for work/life balance.  It doesn't matter the work load, you will do more, even when working sun up to sun down.  Company in limbo from last CEO and stock is just now coming back up."
good,They expect everything and give little. The good workers keep leaving while the slackers stay. Some people can do whatever they want and nothing gets done or said.
good,"It paid decent money, but I have never worked at a company where you are praised for your dependability and hard work but you don't receive any monetary compensation for it? The good thing is while working here I saved $15 K in a year."
good,"Job security is next to none. I worked here for 7 months. They have unrealistic expectations of work. But overall, pay is there. If you are looking for a job that will work you to death but may let you go for very little reason, this is it."
good,The teammates were great to work with and at times it was a fun place to work at but in recent months the moral has taken a hit and too many changes and layoffs have hurt the companies reputation
good,"Constantly changing start times, and ends times is never consistent. when we get over time, they end up taking it away by sending us home earlier on light days. so one day we stay for 11-12 hours and the next  couple of days could be 7 hours. management cuts our hours only so they can get their bonus on low overtime for each department. "
good,Good place to work . Management needs improvement . No much room for advancement you have to  know somebody
good,"I need another job, very stressful, and the stress is unecessary"
good,If you are wishing for a place that will have your back this is not the place for you no proper training pay is not up to cost of living they just throw you in without proper training
good,No room for the lifts and really nobody cares about each other. Basically when they asked are you a team player? They must be talking about the higher ups. The suits. Management and supervisors. The front office people. Because it seemed to me the bread and butter of the company were nobody's. I'm talking about the people who get there fingernails dirty you know the warehouse and the truck drivers.
good,"fun work place if you like fast pace. "
good,"the work was easy enough, however the management at the time was laughable. they liked to play favorites among the staff. the only thing that made working there tolerable was the pay"
good,"I came on board during a transitional phase. It's an okay place to work, but I would not reommend anyone close to me to work their. Before they switched from their home office to the now permanent location it was more laid back. They said when we moved to the new location there would be all these places we could go, and ""destress"". I've never worked in an enviroment where I was so micormanaged before in my life. It is interesting how it was supposed to be more relaxing, but people seem to be more stressed out."
good,"We used to have an amazing GM before we move to this new regional facility. Now we are on our 5th. Company has cut a lot of jobs, and is centralizing to Richmond, VA. So in an office that once had almost 100 people, there will be 10. Although medical distribution is cyclical in that every 3 to 5 years hospitals change distributors, then come back, it seems that this down cycle will last a lot longer than the ones before. The warehouse is overworked, understaffed, and retention is a nightmare. If management would care just a little about those in the warehouse, retention, production, safety, and morale would all increase. Errors would decrease and customers would stay. Definitely oversimplified, but true non-the-less. I really hope this company turns things around and it becomes a good place to work, but until then, I am definitely looking."
good,I really enjoyed my job. the only real uniform was steel toe boots and a hair net. the only problem was the fact that there are only 3 places to clock in with one usually broken.
good,"Although things didn’t work out with Owens and Minor, the job was not difficult, it just seem the hours was hard to managed. Plus was still trying to purse going to classes."
good,"typically understaffed in key areas, expect much of managers, hard to communicate with senior management, field staff and corporate purchasing staff were good to work with."
good,"The job wasn't all bad. it was very simple and straight forward. But, my manager didn't know what he was doing and his boss was his buddy so it became an issue because the manager that was doing things incorrect, was getting praised for it and everyone that was working on the floor had to jump through loops. combine that with not having a life because of the hours and it becomes a career set to fail in."
good,"Bad turn-over-rate; management not stable; do not give good raises. Low employee morale. Benefits too high. Could be a great place to work if there was a good solid management team. The job is not hard, but it can be frustrating when dealing with some of the Sales Reps.,"
good,Very easy company and job. Just currently unstable due to losing accounts. Culture is very unbalanced. Do direction with management . The schedule changes often.
good,"The job itself wasn't hard to do.  What made the job difficult, was the metrics.  They were so strict, I was far behind on day one.  It took a week to get any sort of ""real training"" and everything was thrown at you all at once."
good,"work 2nd shift, very hardworking crew, we work as a team...managment fair and, will get out on the warehouse floor and work with us as well...hardest part about my job are the hours getting off late hours and, having to drive 40min to get home."
good,Good place to work but the health care is the worst to be in the industry
good,"If you have a problem with management, they will always take the supervisors word until you have a lawsuit."
good,"While working at Owens and Minor, the company was contracted as the medical suppliers to Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. I worked as the direct link between the hospital staff and the inventory. I communicated with the hospitals staff to quickly supply them with their medical supply need. Owens and Minor taught me Supply Chain Management, and as one of three employees to control the inventory, we worked well under pressure. The most enjoyable part of that job was knowing that doing my job well meant helping to save a life. The hardest part, however, was the communication barrier between my company and the hospital staff. Only because there were different terms for different medical supplies, and sometimes it was hard to understand what they were asking for."
good,"good place, friendly co-workers....terrible hours. shift usually start around 1am for drivers, 4am for dock workers....not the greatest hours if you have a family. and for the management.....your a number!!!"
good,"Once in management, home life balance becomes minimal without appropriate direction and leadership given from above.  Held accountable for unknown KPIs and are always ""playing from behind""."
good,Overall its a good company to work for but they are very picky about who they promote.  I had learned every dept almost but still couldn't get a promotion.
good,The whole organization is constantly changing but you  are notified of the changes. Management are for themselves. There is a constant turn over of  staff.
good,Owens and Minor is a good place to learn how hospitals procure materials and stock their facilities. Overall it's a good place to work but has gone through many difficult changes.
good,Poor management.  Bad work atmosphere.  Need to fill up this box to move forward.  I can't believe that I have to fill in information for a job I had almost 20 years ago.
good,"poorly managed program, there is no work life balance.   There is way to much finger pointing and lack of accountability.  Difficult to trust that the right actions are being taken"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of reviewing and submitting purchasing reports to management."
good,"Lost its culture, very competitive market and O&M is losing the battle.  The once teammate culture has drastically changed but upper management tries to tell you and convince you otherwise."
good,I really enjoyed my time working with the employees of Owens & Minor. In the beginning of my time I had a few different managers but the veteran employees help me get adjusted. They established a network of stability. I  respected and appreciated very much
good,"unfortunately there are many lazy employees, 10% do 90% of the work. good benefits. pay does not match the work load. cant advance unless you are in with management."
good,good job but with all the money they make they should pay there workers a little more. only way to move up is if you bust your but.
good,"Management was not very good and didnt seem like they really cared too much about there employees. Hours were decent, employees were good people to work with and around."
good,"I learned a lot "
good,Economically challenged and has many admirable competitors.
good,Would be a good place to work except for poor management. Either too much overtime or none at all.
good,"No real job security and you had to work til the orders were pulled, but the people that work there were pretty cool and management was decent."
good,owens and minor has a lot of opportunitties to offer when u come aboard.their warehouse have a great environment to work in.
good,"Company lacked on the job training, basically you learned your job as you worked with no supervision. Sink or swim."
good,In the beginning I was over joyous working for the company.  In time many changes came about and with the company being an outsourcing company jobs were in jeopardy.  I enjoyed working for the company but was not happy when there was no job placement. A
good,"Overtime and Holidays mandatory. A good place to develop and learn new skills because of cross-training for all teammates. The workplace culture has changed drastically and teammates feel like a #."
good,Was a good place. But closed doors due to local market. Fun job with very easy work. Family like atmosphere were they cared about how things were at work and at home. Ample pay and good home time.
good,"I have been working at this company for sometime (more than 2 and a half years) and i have a family but with this job you work long hours and get off late because of overtime and some people not pulling their weight. start work at 9 and getting off at 6:30 is considered early which is weird (was told i would do a LITTLE overtime on interview, lie!!)  because of this i get home late at nights when my son ie either in bed or almost there and i'm super tired and the pay doesn't even make up for it, smh i was held at a higher standard than those that came after me and i excelled at everything but not having time for myself and my family just make this place not ideal. as i said if you are young and just need some cash to party then go ahead you will fit right in, a family oriented type....skip this place!"
good,"I feel as if Owens & Minor could stand to have some major improvements, but there are some things that they do well."
good,"Owens and Minor pays really well but the Allentown DC has some management issues which is resulting in a staffing issue, and from there their issues just pile on top of each other."
good,"At times, I felt like I didn't get the support from my DC. I was sent out to the middle of nowhere in Oklahoma and it was difficult breaking into the culture there."
good,"In the last year decision making has been taken away from local management, part due to the company going through a Rapid Business Transformation.   This has caused unsettling at the local levels with leadership/teammates.  The management and teammates at the local lever, for the most part are great people which I enjoyed working with."
good,"Busy, always on the computer. Work with customer service, Analyst, Sales team and the manufacture. Always things to learn and keep your brain moving. Manufacuture backorders make the job hard to satisfy the customer so we work hard to do our best to locate supplies. Teamwork is close nit, we all help each other to succeed."
good,Fast paced job but the employers don't care about their employees just as long as the work is done. The pay isn't worth what work for in that facility
good,"easy job"
good,"Good Pay, good job, Terrible Management, with unrealistic goals, clean warehouse, great training. Mgmt needs improvement or workers will quit. Temp Agency for trial."
good,Great place to get warehouse experience. Co workers are very friendly. Company you get certified on lift machines. Comes with benefits bonuses.
good,They select who they want to have certain positions. The company doesn't really appreciate its employers like they say they do. Management was OK the teammates were OK.
good,the job is great but leadership is bad and the people are ok as long as you work hard and come to get the job done and go home. I love fast passed jobs this is exactly what that is
good,As all corporations who think they can run trucking companies this one is no different.you have people who have NEVER driven trucks running the show who think spreadsheets and what looks good in truck driver monthly is law...no real world experience to speak of..they fumble over each other looking to put their stamp on something so they can pat themselves on the back.you are part of the collective here one person makes mistake good drivers will suffer and the heart of the problem ( management who hired the bad seed to begin with) will go on as if they are doing a good job...this company has real internal issues and no resolve in site..steer clear of this company.
good,A typical day is at least nine hours.  I have learned all aspects of the warehouse setup and must continue to learn as the company continues to make process changes.  HR department is very supportive.  The hardest part of the job is employees calling off making a very long shift for the rest of the team.  I get along with most everyone I work with.
good,pick medical orders for hosptials. Workplace is decent but the management is terrible. No leadership with to many chiefs and not enough indians.
good,"I enjoy the job I perform. I have learned to work independently picking orders by voice pick. The management team is functional and I enjoy working with all my co-workers, The hardest part of my job is the hours. The hours are long and the orders are sometimes non stop, The most enjoyable part of the job is completely the orders timely with no errors, I strive at being proficient."
good,Overall pretty good place to work. Good people great company values.
good,Working with Owens & Minor I found out that they changed their schedules after I was hired it rotates day shift to night shift and I can't do night shift but all in all the company is fair
good,Typical warehouse where there are days with very slow work and most days with steady volume of work.  Lack of advancement opportunities considering the diversity of employees  Fair working conditions considering the fast paced environment.
good,It was very hard work and expectations were set impossibly high to keep driving employees more and more. Eventually you can't push anymore and are just getting beaten down all day for long hours.
good,O&M was the first company I worked for out of college. I had good mentors that guided me in job. Good opportunities to work anywhere within the US. My group traveled a lot which wasn't too desirable.
good,Constant turnover due to incompetent leadership and failure to innovate and adapt with competitors. Job stability was always an issue unless you were a higher up employee.
good,"The company is nothing like what it used to be,  when it was run by the Minor's it was a great organization to work for.   Since Gil retired the company has declined and does not even resemble what the culture was all about."
good,Scripts had to be followed. Strict adhereance to lunches and breaks. Micro-managed. Large turnover at management level. When the company decided to close it was devastating to many.
good,"Owens & Minor has been a fairly typical company.  They are a small business grown big and (typically) have not kept their infrastructure,policies, and practices in pace with their growth.  I have seldom found a friendlier place to work (overall) and am impressed by their family atmosphere.  A conservative, young professional can find a good home here - as long as he/she has a degree and mediocre compensation (benefits and salary) expectations. Be sure to negotiate your starting salary - your next opportunity for any significant financial improvement will be a promotion.  No pay for performance - just a straight 2.5% across the board."
good,"Working off site at a different company for Owens is interesting. The place I work is amazing. However, most of the Owens people are not. I would not recommend this job to anyone that isn't in desperate need of one"
good,"When I worked for Owens and Minor we were working as independent contractors to Stanford Hospital inside of the hospital. We worked hand in hand with hospital staff, but were not employed by the hospital itself. It was a high stress environment; I worked specifically in the Pediatric ICU. Management was not extremely helpful; my supervisor almost never had a certain answer for me. Job security was somewhat scary because Stanford had the option to terminate their contract with my company at any point. As far as advancement in my company, I applied to move up twice and was looked over. Moving up was not easy and management did not help shape you to get there either."
good,Company is going through a transformation from Management in order to compete with the competitors.  Human Resource is not highly trained with courtesy communication with team.
good,"It is a fast paced job with very little room for growth within the company, minimal benefits, and unorganized management. The hardest part of the job is the pace as well as the workload with very little staff."
good,"disrespectful leads, i was the hardest worker yet they showed favoritism when it comes to promotions. Very sexist and judgmental. I loved driving the cherry picker. Managment did not obay labor laws."
good,"So my shift was the swing shift so I started at 2 pm. We came in right when the morning shift should be getting off (but never do, will get to that) and you try to find a lift to go drive on. Over half the lifts have wonky wheels that aren't very comfortable so you will destroy your knees and back if you work for more than a month. The job is supposed to be 8 hours, but the only time I ever saw an 8 hour shift was on the day we didn't ship product, Sunday. All the other days were 10+. So you will get your overtime but you won't see your family. It's in Tracy, but the far far side of Tracy. So if you're coming from Modesto, it's a long drive. Adds about an hour to your whole day. The people you work with are really cool. I got close to a lot of them. Most everyone cares about what's going on in your life. A lot of people like to play video games. Supervisors can get a little shady. I'm pretty sure they rigged the numbers for a few employees to fire them instead of lay them off when they should've been. But shift leads and managers are pretty cool. All-in-all, it wasn't a terrible place to work at, I liked it better than my restaurant job. You get a nice pair of Red Wings boots out of it. :)"
good,"they loose contrac with the hospital , for tha reason they dond''t have 40 hours a week, they have a good truck but no good maintenance"
good,The job was important and rewarding. Great benefits. Wonderful co-workers. Long hours and management with poor communication skills.
good,When I started at O&M customers were the main focus and every new technology we had revolved around the customer. Today everything is geared towards making the employees accountable and the customers secondary.
good,Productive work place with good staff in need of directed leadership.
good,"7:30 a.m - 4:30 p.m. 1 hour lunch with two 15 minute breaks. Learned new computer programs Management was good in some departments, but regarding the reception position, was very lacking."
good,Fluctuating volumes and sales presented challenges for the workforce.  Quality was emphasized because of the criticality of the medical products that were produced.
good,"Did not get hired, worked really hard. Company is trimming the fat a little too closely. They are disolving positions, cutting, and firing. People are resigning left and right."
good,Very long hours very unorganized management sucks some employees we're okay the money was okay management shows a lot of favoritism was okay after they let me go
good,Good job to work for. Great people. Management relaying informations could be better. Feels great to pick orders for the hospitals. What you do here is very important.
good,Had a poor time to adjusting to the environment. Was bribed with the work schedule & didn’t have the best hours nor enough ppl to work ! Staffing was poor & pay could’ve been more
good,"Open work environment so communicating is easy.  Management encourages an open door policy.  A place were your opinion matters. "
good,"O&M corporate culture still feels like family.  Each day is never the same as healthcare demands continue to change.  As technology improves efficiency, good customer engagement becomes ever more vital.  A strong company maintains the element of acknowledged customer value."
good,"A good place to work"
good,High turnover rate on all shifts.  Difficult to get to see HR department.  Hour tracking system was not very good and seeing the work hours was hard to come by.
good,The job is easy but the people make it difficult. I’ve been here a year and been in the office many times because they start useless drama. Management doesn’t do much until they have no choice to do otherwise
good,The awesome culture O&M once had is dying. I have been there for over 12 years and have witnessed its demise. I keep hanging on to hope it will get better. We'll see.
good,"Owens and Minor offers great benefits and vacation time, but the management is not strict enough with its employees. to the point were issues with and between teammates would go on for months without resolution."
good,did all functions of warehouse operations experieced sucsessfull and knowledgablein all areas over 10 years in operation worked in shipping and receiveng and inventory control operated all types of crown equipment and totally warehouse certified
good,"Constantly multi tasking. Learned how to time manage. Workplace culture was great, had a great coworker who we worked well together. The most enjoyable part of the job was that we were constantly busy, never sitting and had a lot of responsibilities. Which I don't mind at all."
good,Busy and sometimes hectic work environment. Customer service is unfortunately not very helpful towards their own employees. Management is sometimes unable to understand basic employee duties.
good,Good company to work for. Management in the Boston area could use a little work on sensitivity and communication as well as consistency. They could also find a way of working with the employees that create a better teamwork type of environment.
good,"The environment is fast paced and never dull.  Your experience will depend on the DC, and management.  It can be wonderful, or absolutely atrocious. Your performance is based off of your ability, and not off of what would be a reasonable expectation of another person in your role.  Pay is not competitive as you're not compared to others, but rather what it is believed that you are capable of."
good,"Phone and email communications with customers."
good,With almost 13 years with the company I have seen many changes occur. Some of these changes for the better of the company and others not so much. The company used to be more for keeping your employees happy as well as the customers
good,"good people. lot of changes going on now."
good,"I work for Owens and helped get the LUM department up and running. This was a few years back and I only write this review now cause it’s pretty obvious that everything we built has gone down hill. Very unfortunate. "
good,"The company culture has changed since I first started.  Through the reduction of team and company activities and unexpected layoffs, the moral of the teammates has changed and their overall outlook related to company stability."
good,I liked working at Owen's & minor it kept me busy. I drove forklifts a couple of different ones. I picked orders for different  places. Working with alot of different  people was very cool as well good job.
good,"not friendly , good place to work , overtime is avavilable upon request ware house easy to find job has many oppertunities , can move up after about 5 years"
good,It is the worst place to work u never get a day to rest they work u to much never get to see your family. They didn't  really care about their employees.
good,"I work. For. Owens. Minor.  Since. 1987 "
good,"some of the people are great to work with, the management doesn't know what they want. the pay sucks, you don't get very good raises or advance easily. they want to keep giving you more work to do without compensating you for the extra work."
good,Assigns and reviews the work of personnel in the hospital material distribution center. Assigns work to hospital personnel engaged in material distribution and ensures that assignments are completed. Examines incoming shipments to verify receipt of the correct type and quantity of materials and supplies.
good,I worked at the dock doors just unloading and unpacking products to place them in an order. Very clean environment and the people there were very nice to work with. I had no issues there
good,They were ok over work personell to much.o need to raise they pay scale. They do not pay enough at all The work day went pretty well they do have a great work shift from 6 in the am until 230 pm.
good,"You're picking orders for hospitals all day. Managers are nice enough. Pay is alright. Time off is great. 2 weeks vacation after 6 months. Sick days, holidays, 401k, etc..."
good,"No work life balance. If you want to make a lot of money and don't mind an unpredictable schedule, it's a great place to work. Retention is low. Attendance policy is relatively lenient. This leads to long hours with lots of call ins. Some weeks are 12 hour days, others are 9 hour days. Haven't worked an eight hour day yet. The production numbers are achievable. Training is minimal. They trust you will figure it out. Coworkers are helpful. Management is varied and in transition. Breaks are regular. Everything is timed so if structure isn't your thing, you may want to keep looking for another line of work. Promotions are available. I don't hate going to work but the long weeks really wear on you."
good,"Company is re-structuring as many teammates are losing their jobs. I loved my job working with Hospitals and their staff on-site. I learned many skills, advanced my knowledge and tuned up my abilities."
good,"Owens and minor is a great company to get on your feet at. I have learned how to be a part of a bigger organization. My people skills have improved greatly over these last 11 years. A typical day at work involved working as a team, making sure all products are safe and ready to load on the trucks."
good,"On at typical work day, we would come in and receive our order from the team lead, then depending on what account you were on you'd head to your forklift, harness up and head out onto the floor for picking. The day went by pretty fast as there was very little down time. We used every type of forklift imaginable (Hi-Lo, Double reach, Standard Forklift, etc.), in and the narrow aisles you pick next to a friend ask how there day is and then its on to your next location. It was a very competitive work environment, which made for some pretty exciting days. Best part of the job was definitely the competition amongst the staff."
good,great company to work for but not under the supervisors that are at the DC I was at. Tried talking to urgent supervisor and would turn every conversation into an argument.
good,"load and unload products from trailers using forklift trucks and other material handling equipment,sorted, wrapped, tired and labeled products as per company"
good,"New and ever changing environment, policies, regulations & technical processes. Many opportunities to work with upper management, government agencies, and customers from all walks of life."
good,"its a job that you have to need and want. Its a job that demands a lot of your time but only pays a little as a supervisor you have to pick, pack, load, scan, ship, unload, stock and still keep up with everything in the computer that your employees need"
good,"I liked the people I worked with. After 5 years of dealing with false truths from the management I decided to move on. I was one of the most productive individuals in the warehouse, that although I applied for several positions was never given an interview. The only time I was given raises or an opportunity for promotion was when the threat of resignation came about. It made me realize they valued my work ethic, but not the individual. The management has since changed, this was 10 years ago."
good,Love the coworkers at the location where I worked for many years. Owens-Minor does have good benefits for the employees.
good,O & M was a Medical supply company wit hover 500 employees.Work hard. learned new systems. My co worker was excellent team players. I enjoyed working hard and accomplishing deadlines.
good,Work order picking job for deliveries to local hospitals.  Physically demanding job with high productivity goals.
good,"Ship medical supplies in truckload down to single box quantities to clinics, doctors, hospitals, etc.  Also includes shipping parmaceuticals."
good,Started as material handler and got promoted to warehouse lead. Handled shipping and receiving medial supplies
good,its okay. Not a big fan of it. Definitely better then my last job. I feel like there incentive program could be better and their pay raises could be a lot better
good,"Owens&Minor is an extremely teammate and community focused organization.  The location where I work has a gym with lunch time classes and an onsite OMUniversity that offers courses on a variety of topics.    Volunteerism in the community is enthusiastically encouraged by all levels of management and the company routinely supports events such as Special Olympics and Richmond Rebuilding Together."
good,In my current role I enjoy working onsite with customers finding supply chain solotions while improving processes with all departments of the hospital. Typical day involves working with a vast variety of employees and using data to help increase quality of care while working to reduce spend.
good,"working at owens & Minor was ah good, learned a lot form there some day it was hard some days it was easy it got me ready for my job at coca cola it thought me how to order pick and als pick and pack"
good,"I loved working at Owens & Minor, enjoyed our purpose.  After 10 years I was a victim of change that did not make sense to me, I bled O&M red.  I had taken on many projects and spent time away from home to assist other DC's on continuous improvement projects.  Worked with great people at the time, from what I hear things are changing for the worst."
good,"management was good to work with, frequently did nice things for the teammates such as free lunches, celebrations of various events. management sought feedback from the workforce and was open to the feedback"
good,"I learned a lot about the job,the different trays we builded for the different operations in the different hospitals.And how to wrap traps and send them to the sealer."
good,Lots of hours six to seven days a week management would leave after 8 hours and staff would keep working. Great crew to work with hard working and nice
good,I feel they loss good people daily. I feel they don't care about their employees they don't invest their time in keeping good people employed. The Lead and the supervisor put a lot on pressure on the warehouse works while they go nothing.
good,Job is ok. I like the management but the pay could be better. I work contract so i do have the insecurity of not knowing if my assignment will end. Overall I am content for now.
good,"The job is repetitive and boring, and the pay was lower than it should be.  But it was close to home and the people are really nice.  Benefits were pretty good and reasonable priced, however they have a very inflexible points based attendance system.  Something I found strange is that they gave you sick days, but then you were penalized with attendance points against you if you used the sick days.  This resulted in lots of people coming to work sick and spreading their germs."
good,"The placement and consolidation of items received, using a cherry picker, and other equipment. I was responsible for crushing boxes and plastic as well as the bailing process for the equipment involved. Focused on safety and efficiency."
good,"Picking orders for hospitals and clinics, loading trucks, stacking pallets. heavy lifting, very easy. you leave when the work is done so there is never a definite out time which is the worst part of it all."
good,"a typical day of work is about 10-12 hours, best training and depending on your manager, you can either learn a lot or nothing at all, co workers are usually friendly and the hardest part of the job is dealing with office politics, most enjoyable is the coworkers"
good,"Coordinated meetings with managers, and vendors to determine product needs, Prepared cost Analysis for hospitals, Oversaw new and renewed contracts, Managed and prepared equipment conversions"
good,I have learned about contracts in more detail. I work with a variety of employees over several states.
good,Work is very email centric and spent significant amount of time resolving customer/sales rep questions on product lines.
good,I would arrive early enough to get me a good RF machine and a picker. Then I would wait for a order to upload. Then off to picking I go. I also have to check make sure I picked the right product. A lot of the items may have close numbers but was different product. I also had to make sure I had the right quantity. Sending the wrong amount to the hospital was not good. You also got wrote up for to many mistakes. I also had a chance to learn how to drive a reach truck.
good,pick order pick order pick orders... management kick a++ all they think about is money! hardest part of job is long hours
good,Huddling up for team meetings. I learned how working in the hospital important. Management wasn't that great the was ok it wasn't the best making it to work especially when you you feel some type of way.
good,"From the time you clock in to the time you clock out you will be on the clock. Each order assigned has a time limited, so each item picked need to be with precision."
good,Much potential here for long career.  Presently in transitional phase causes a stressful environment at times. Inventory Control are very knowledgeable and welcoming group.  Learned quite a bit here with some relevant experience I will definitely be able to use in any company.
good,Had a unique position with O&M years ago but the support from management at that time was questionable.  It was a revolving door of management type people from different parts of the region coming and going to oversee our operation in town.  Very unpredictable at times.  For years they mentioned building a warehouse here in town but never thought it would actually happen.
good,"good company to work for, not so much opportunities for growth(warehouse). pay is decent and benefits are good. fast pace environment, plenty to do. some unrealistic standards that upper management wants everyone to meet daily, with limited resources and staff. speaking more of my location, but sure that other locations encounter same issues and setbacks. expected to do work, OT is required, cannot leave early. but management is willing to work with teammates to accommodate schedules due to personal matters, family events, vacations, etc,. like any other workplace we have some good teammates and some not so good, overall good workplace, need more involvement from upper management in the field."
good,Great people and fun local management. The company does many enjoyable after work activities for employees. Don't expect to work till retirement as everyone gets moved out eventually.
good,"The warehouse is temperature controlled and the work is easy with not much heavy lifting, but expect lots of mandatory overtime (as of this writing, there has been over 2 months straight of mandatory overtime, with 9-10 hour work days).  There are opportunities to move up, but if you are looking for a computer/IT job, look elsewhere."
good,Turn over is really high. System has a lot of ongoing issues which makes it hard to do your job to the fullest. They don't appreciate people with experience.
good,"Owens and Minor has been in business for over 100 years. Typical day was to assign the work to the teammates for the daily routine. The hardest part of my job was keeping the team motivated. In a fast pace environment, It's easy for a individual to become unmotivated. I enjoyed watching my co-workers grow into a solid team from my command and leadership."
good,You learn new things everyday. Communicate with nurses and patients on daily basis. Coworkers are great. There is nothing hard about the job its just needs be done.
good,"A typical work day is 10+ hours."
good,"all around this was a good stable company. however as my tenure went on, many decisions were made that made my particular warehouse a bad place to be."
good,enjoyed working there and with all the people that I worked with. great oppurtunity for advancement.the management was easy to get along with. Lots of equipment training and chances to move up in the company
good,"Owens & Minor is a company that cares about their teammates, but upper management does't really make sure teammates are taken care of especially if you are not in favorite's club."
good,"I entered credits and rebills for pricing errors "
good,This job was ok not to bad but if you excel in your zone u will have to help everybody else in theirs which gets frustrating especially when you can tell they aren't really working
good,"everyone friendly."
good,Enjoyed working here very much. Though the job could get boring at times it was very stable and allowed freedom without serve oversight.
good,A lot of foreign employees that were there just for a paycheck and did not care to much for the company.
good,Overall working for Owens and Minor is a rewarding experience. There can be long days servicing hospital networks but the employees at each location are loyal and hard-working. The workplace environment is acceptable for a warehousing organization. Management has turned over at a very high rate but there are still many knowledgable and dedicated employees. Overall compensation is competitive in each job market. There are many opportunities for advancement and growth within the company.
good,"Pay could've been better, hours could've been more steady. Never knew when you were going home. Their were times when we worked 15 to 17 hour days in a row."
good,I start my day with a morning meeting to discuss previous day and current duties. Our management allows us to voice our opinions and ideas. My coworkers are great to work with. I have learned how to implement projects. I also have learned how to clean and inspect surgical instruments. This job requires a lot of hours in a day and on weekends.
good,Had some fun times and some pretty low times as well. Compensation is a challenge for the amount of work that you are required to do. Would consider coming back if I left and were allowed.
good,Not knowing when you were getting laid off - it happened a lot. I had my contract cut with the hospital I was working at due to poor management decisions and they refused to listen to my input / warnings about the bad relationships O&M management had with hospital management. No roles were offered at company with contract ended.
good,"In the past year and two months I've been at Owens, my shift has been through three supervisors and more than 10 employees (co-workers). Most have moved either completely away from the company and found employment elsewhere, or they have been offered a different position in the warehouse and have turned it down."
good,"We handle medical supplies for the hospital. Shipping, receiving, and stocking units in the hospital. "
good,"The job was good, easy, and fast-paced. The people were ok, just not trained properly. Poor management. Extremely filthy warehouse. Climate-controlled facility. The lift trucks are poorly maintained and always broken. Hardest part of the job was dealing with lazy coworkers and dealing with supervisors and leads who know nothing about managing people. Overtime was extreme. 12-15 hour nights. If you have a family, the night shift might not be for you, because you will either never see them, or you will be dead tired. Benefits were ok. Salary was good."
good,Reinventing business model and business processes. Not enough time in the day to accomplish all task. Trying to retain customers in environment  where margins are slim.
good,"My time was short at O&M.  I learned how to operate a stand up forklift for the first time.  Overall, it was a typical warehouse.  Work was consistent."
good,"you have a job and u get up and go there and do what you have to do. I did use to like to work on the night shift it was fun. Management was okay, they taught me a lot."
good,"Employees are Great!"
good,When they say until it means until....... There are no set hours except the start time. Make sure you have a babysitter. IDK what else indeed wants me to say.
good,"I love working at O & M, while being a mother. It was a wonderful experience and i accomplished a lot there. It gave me a first hand view of the real world and all the challenges that one experiences. Management was very professional. We have a great team and everyone loves completing their assignments in a timely manner."
good,"I worked with Supply Chain Services within the hospital. I sat in on three products committees. I provided savings and potential savings opportunities monthly. I learned that in this ever changing healthcare industry we need to constantly listen to what our customers needs are and be their trusted advisor. Management and my coworkers were always supportive. O&M had some of the best mentors out there. The biggest challenge was all the wind shield time I put in. "
good,"Decent job with lots of opportunity for overtime. Management could definitely be changed! But overall, an ok company to work for."
good,"We help people get well. It is a good company.."
good,"The warehouse jobs are easy enough for most people.  Of the people who can't hang with it, the majority are either unable to wake up at an appropriate time, or they can't differentiate between similar numbers, or they just adopt a laid-back/lazy attitude early on."
good,"A decent place to work although O and M have lost several accounts of late so they are streamlining operations and job advancement opportunities have dried up. "
good,"I working in the accounts receivable dept. Helping customers with shipping issues, pricing and contract issues and helping them become current. phone calls and spreadsheets were a must and they do have a lot of training classes for employees that had issues with anything."
good,"The job is simple and fast paced.  For the new employees the schedules are very bad and stressful, after some time things get better.  The managers are fair and treat people with respect."
good,Company due to their own mis management of things caused the loss of bussines resulting in lay off's affecting hundreds of employees  Their new direction of the company is hurting their best employees
good,"Not your typical job with set hours, your day doesnt end till youve finished all your orders for the day. So your end time depends on how fast the entire shift works to get things done."
good,Working for Owens and Minor was an enjoyable experience. I was given a great amount of latitude in my job and the work environment was pleasant. My first supervisor was wonderfully supportive and an excellent communicator.
good,"decent pay.not really hard work.will train you for other duties if you show commitment.i've received ok raises.if you have perfect attendance you can win a car.they give a mustang away every year and $1,500 checks as well."
good,"I enjoyed driving for Owens and Minor, however I left due to the hours. They were midnight to ten or eleven in the morning, and it was more of a stepping stone for driving experience. The people there are very pleasant"
good,"A Great place to learn about logistics and distribution, and how the medical supply chain works. A lot of great people that you work with, like many businesses they have made huge drastic changes in the last 7 years. which have not always been the best. the managers  can either be involved with whats going on in their departments, Or in their owns world, depending on what DC and Department you work in.  Hardest part is too many chiefs and communications from Corp to the Dc's are poor."
good,"I worked part time at O & M , while attending Broward College . It was a wonderful experience and I accomplished a lot there . It gave me a first hand view of the real world and all the challenges that one experiences . Management was very professional and gave me every opportunity to succeed . We had a great team , and everyone enjoyed completing their assignments in a timely manner . I am now a better person as a result of my experience at O & M ."
good,"I have enjoyed working at Owens & Minor for the last 6 1/2 years.  "
good,"The warehouse has receiving, put away and inventory control positions.  The work load is very busy with productivity requirements."
good,A typical day of work would consist of inspection and picking orders for customers. At first the job was hard but once i got used to the orders daily then they started becoming easier.
good,"Great company to work for. Lots of good people. Depending on the department you're in, ability to work from home often. Free gym on site at the Home Office. Lots of learning opportunities in house as well."
good,enjoy leaning operating system and new technology of using Jennifer operating system .Meeting daily deadlines of meeting customers orders needs .
good,Here I picked and pull orders for different hospitals and different departments. Night shift job. Great co-workers
good,Great job great company bonuses are available feed you every other month great employees but bad managing
good,I believe it was a good experience driving locally. Most everybody was easy to work with. Driving and working in the warehouse was routine. Free lunches were beneficial.
good,Owens n minor for me was a good work environment. Unfortunately my hours and work schedule were effecting my family time at home. I worked there seven years on second shift.
good,"Owens and Minor was the place that helped to propel my Leadership career, of which I am quite thankful for."
good,Picked up to thousands of orders for medical supplies to shipped out on daily basis and ensured items were stored correctly in warehouse. Used RF scanners tool to ensure inventory. Communicated to Hispanics.
good,do want needs to be done to finish the job right the first time. be safe in want i am doing not to damage product and work safely around other cowokers.
good,"Do not wish to comment.   Working within the office was fine. Many people on their staff were dominating in our relationship as vendors, and they continuously beat the vendors to death over money and acted as though all blame was the vendors fault. This made for a bad relationship."
good,"Good place to work, I learned a lot here.  Office and warehouse folks all jump in to help each other. Home office is in Virginia so we got a slower directive versus if we could have made decisions locally.  Hardest part of job is keeping warehouse employees due to the long JIT environment. The enjoyable part was the people and helping them."
good,over worked and under appraised. never know how many hours a day you will work or what time you will get off work.  screw you out of the overtime you have worked by sending you home early. Day shift gets OT while night crew get's screwed out of our 8 hrs and sometimes our 40.
good,"Being sick is the worst thing you could do. If you go in and are sick and go slow, God help you. Don't even bother going to court either. You'll still get attendance points. Oh wait you brought notes? TOO BAD. you still get points. The attendance policy is nuts and if you go slow even a little bit they'll send you home, even if you explain that you're sick they'll say they don't care. They'll askyou what's wrong and ignored every word. Don't work for this company it's not worth you losing out on your children's lives, unless you're lucky enough to get first shift, don't do it."
good,I was responsible for the replenishment of the 25 clinics. I built relationships with the staff of many of the hospital units.
good,"A good company with the best of intentions. Distribution is such a low margin business it's hard to make a buck."
good,Day would be busy from the time you sat down at your desk until you went home.  Lots of phone calls and emails as well as orders to review.
good,Great family environment with fellow co-workers.  Challenging and fast paced workload.  Management engaging but constrained by the environment of a centralized corporate office.  Extremely detailed and accurate data reporting that internal and external customers depend upon for business decisions. Satisfaction of positive feedback due to my reporting.
good,Picking is not hard and there is OT occasionally.You have to start off working second shift which is 3pm till 1130pm
good,Basically my position is based on collections and customer set up. I have learned basically all facets of distribution in my 22 years at Owens & Minor. The most difficult part is collecting finance charges and maintaining relationships with customers. I do like working with people so customer interaction is my favorite part of the job.
good,"40-50 hr weeks"
good,"Working there is okay. But its really demanding. I was hoping to advance, but i dont have a degree. go to school, right??? I cant because at least once a week i will work a required 17 hr day. i cant do that and go to school"
good,"Travel kept getting longer and the territory kept getting expanded, had 2 pretty drastic pay cuts in my last year.  Loved the company for a long time and loved dealing with all my customers from military accounts to civilian hospitals.  I enjoyed researching and helping my customers with any day to day issues."
good,"To work at Owens-Minor is to have a full understanding of teamwork, when all teammates interact to get a project complete. Great benefits, to include vacation  and paid time off."
good,"Con: Management has a “my way only” mentality. Communication is terrible. Facility is not adequate for the amount of product that enters the facility."
good,Aprendí a manejar forklift  y tenerte las órdenes a tiempo para los hospitales es genial  solo pienso que los médicos necesitan a tiempo los medicamentos a su debido tiempo para los pacientes.
good,Work environment modeled to enrich teammate support and productivity by allowing employees to exchange ideas and engage in customer support plans and initiatives for best response to customer needs.
good,"Great job, nice atmosphere, rehire eligibility sucks. Medical should be considered a reason for rehire. Pay is awesome and the hours are lovely, just some of the hr is ridiculous."
good,This was a good company to work for.  My job was very challenging but it helped me to develop my work ethic and gave me a lot of experience in the working world.
good,"I honestly enjoyed the people, and more importantly my customers that I serviced for many, many years in my customer service role at Owens and Minor for over 25 years."
good,"My machine has 15 people with a team lead and a packer 2"
good,"The sky is the limit for advancement, if you are willing to relocate.  The DC here is small and there are many tenured teammates.  For the most part, your fellow teammates are like family...some you like, some you don't get along with all the time.  Most are committed to getting the job completed everyday.  Safety has come to the forefront in the past couple of years.  Lots of changes in leadership at top levels.  Company is trying to better position themselves for the future.  Our DC is left alone for the most part.  Not a lot of visitors.  New GM is not very personable, but we won't see him much anyway.  No a/c.  Hot in the summer.  There are lots of fans, but it's still hot."
good,-Good people
good,I love working at owns and minor and i love the people there. A typical day at work consist of picking and shipping products. The most enjoyable part about the job is working as a team.
good,"Good company but in order to get promoted you have to move to a different positions. There are no levels and hard to get other positions, don't always promote from within."
good,"I really did enjoy working at Owens & Minor.  My teammates were great people, and I always got the support I needed from my managers and co-workers to succeed in my role."
good,"In the time I worked at O&M, a lot happened in the medical supply field.  With those changes, O&M has changed to save money.  I loved my job when I first started and still like it, though not quite as much.  Hopefully they will get back that great associate-centered culture they once had."
good,Great place to work and good people to work with. Great management all around and they want you to succeed. Benefits are good and pay is reasonable as well.
good,"The warehouse is modern, focused on reducing cost, and very fast paced.  Call outs and heavy delivery days cause you to have to work over a eight hour day consistently."
good,"Owens & Minor is a family based environment where teammates are close knit and adhere to the family type environment of a company. I have learned many things at Owens & Minor from warehousing, logistics, operations, purchasing, and sales."
good,Its a good job to work at i been there since september 2016 and i started inside the room. Doing setup then i moved up and started boxing and irelly loved doin that job
good,"Owens is a good place to work. I have already did this review for this company so I don't want to keep repeating myself. Work hard, find a niche and maybe you will keep you job."
good,good experience learned a lot from being there management was amazing they have a lot of great hard working people there that have really dedicated themselves to get the job done
good,"customer service representative , not a bad position. Fair pay but limited locations to work. The job consisted of processing medical supplies for local businesses and hospitals."
good,If your a person that wants to grow with a company this is  the place you would want to  work at  . A lot of great people to work with and if you want to learn new things they will train  you.
good,The most challenging part of my job is the scheduling. You have to be flexible with hours and willing to change times in a days notice.
good,"Organizing work for warehouse coordinators. Get all of the paperwork ready for shipments. Helping out other employees in the warehouse as I see fit to get the job done as efficiently as possible,"
good,My typical work day is very fulfilling.I honestly just want to do something more gratifying and showcase my hard work in an different work environment.
good,"i operated reach trucks, orderpickers, electric pallet jacks, and regular forklifts"
good,Mid sized office where office staff and warehouse personnel maintain a close family like atmosphere.
good,"After a month on the job, I was promoted to Quality Control a division of Inventory Control. We oversee the outbound orders are correct and up to customers standards. Handling most of the major Hospitals in the Cincinnati Tri-state area, we have a reputation to up-hold. "
good,"The day starts off with making sure the deliver truck arrives on time at my location. The morning hours are mostly dedicated to observing orders in the system and pushing them through. You have to check the levels in the distribution center to make judgement calls on whether or not to issue stock. You also must handle customer needs, conduct research on new items, and follow up on items that are on back order. Over all, pretty simple but somedays you can get a rush of orders especially before extended holidays. Working with the military has been difficult due to their foolish rules. Management is good, but because I'm an on-site rep, I am hundreds of miles away from mine. The company has nothing to do with my network issues (it's a military network) but I have felt as if my protest go unheard at times. The military will not allow me to plug my work laptop into their network due to security concerns, even though it is vital to their business. Being autonomous, is great but has drawbacks."
good,"A day at Owens&Minor consisted of lots of inventory,loading,unloading and lifting. Much of what they do is repetition so I was really use to the work already. Management got in the trenches with myself and the co-workers because lots of times we were short but that meant lots of overtime which I loved. I'd say the hardest part of the job would be that the bulk of the work came torwards the end of the day when everyone was tired. Overall though I would say I enjoyed my time at Owens&Minor."
good,New Management Team With A Much Needed Direction to Control Employees! A Fast Paced Team Atmosphere and a 4 Day 10 Hour Schedule. Needs A Lot of Support Help
good,"It's a good company itself but sometimes teammates makes it a little bit difficult.  They like to talk about your personality not even about the job. And when you make a mistake, you get to know it even before your supervisor tells you about it. I mean some teammates are ahead of others . You are being discussed before you get to work, so you get in and meet some tension environment.  If you do not have self control and patience,  you will always fight a teammate.  I love what i do in the care room but some teammates are unprofessional"
good,"The work day has changed since I was laid off."
good,"Working at Owens & Minor was a breath of fresh air, I felt supported by them constantly, my co-workers were friendly and approachable. The specific work that I did was not complex and pay was decent."
good,"I enjoyed working at O&M and I wouldn't mind going back to work there.  Great working environment and good opportunities to move up within the company.  My managers  were great and liked to promote within.  I learned how to be a better supervisor and leader.  The workplace culture was great and there were times when we felt like family.  I enjoyed the safety meals, every time we went 90 day's without an injury we would have a meal paid for by corporate.  The hardest part about the job was leaving it."
good,Working in a division of Owens and Minor is extremely active and rewarding. Long hours  that allows us the time to service the customer the way we should.
good,"Owens & Minor had a structured system that I enjoyed being a part of. It was a fast paced occupation, but satisfying. Also, Team leaders were very knowledgeable and helpful."
good,It was a great experience working at OM. The work that is done inside the warehouse directly impacts the operations in the hospital or care room. Accuracy is key in this industry as it is very important that the hospitals are receiving the correct items to service their patients.
good,"Owens & Minor is a well established company that provides you with the tools and abilities to push yourself to excell. "
good,"The reason being that team mates aren't just doing any warehouse job,  but one that requires excellent attention to detail and quality because the good delivered are medical devices used by Shands hospital and all of its satellite clinics around and out of town. The jobs are easy to perform but they need to be completed quickly as orders made by the hospital are delivered the same day. In that sense, you can't leave until the orders are finished for the day. It has good, comprehensive array of benefits as well as vacations, sick and personal time."
good,Nice family oriented company. Managers and supervisors care for employees and well being but there's no opportunity to move up in the company
good,Typical day included receiving and putting away product according to location. Mandatory overtime with timed breaks. Management good for the most part. Co-workers friendly. Hardest part not knowing end time of the day.
good,"Great company to work for and provides many opportunities to advance your career. "
good,Owens & Minor is a fast paced warehouse for the ware housing and distribution of medical supplies. Within  Owens & Minor there is plenty of opportunity for advancement.
good,great managemet team.and co workers.its a medical supply ware house were we receive. pick. pack.and shipped supplys to hosipitals.
good,Hardworking from start time till finish/fastpase must remaine above average product accountability productivity is managed through rf system work as a team hardest part is keeping a average production number at 35 puts per loction an hour the best part of the job is challeging skilled based/and steady
good,"It's not the highest paying company in the world, but O&M highly values its employees and advancement opportunities are available for those ready to go above and beyond."
good,"I've enjoyed my time with Owens & Minor. The company firmly believes in promoting a teammate centered culture. It proves this by investing highly in Teammate development. If you display that you have the talent and will to move up with the company, the company will afford you the opportunity to acquire the necessary skills. I learned a tremendous amount about leadership, employee relations, inventory management, supply-side distribution, customer relations, and fiscal management."
good,"I had no bad experiences here, the people I worked with were nice and the work was satisfactory. I wouldn't mind working at the company again if I could get a comparable pay for what I am making now."
good,The job is easy money is good only bad thing about this job is all the OVERTIME you work but if you really like overtime this is the job for you. Supervisor was a nice guy. As long as you do your job they dont bother you.
good,Worked night shift position. Flexible schedule that allowed a good home balance. Positive work environment and support for management when needed. Able to advance.
good,"Staffing was the only issue with the Hebron Owens and Minor location. It made for long days where you were not sure when you would get off. But, it was rewarding knowing we were helping stock hospitals with the tools they needed to help, potentially, save lives."
good,I have been a teammate with Owens & Minor in Flower Mound for over 10 years. I’ve seen a lot of change in our company especially in the last couple of years. Management under the gun to hit numbers. Until recently that meant cutting corners. That seems to be changing now. New GM actually seems to care about the people. Getting equipment fixed and cleaning the building. Previous leadership forgot about these things. I was looking for another job. Now I want to see how this goes.
good,Typical day start is with morning meeting over the day to see what's going on. After the meeting you go check your order picker to make sure everything is working properly. If everything is ok you start to put away all the supplies and equipment until finished.
good,"typical day at work was jump on your cherry picker, log in to your RF scanner and start picking orders.  Time goes by really fast cause you're busy all day.  Lots of benefits and incentives."
good,It is a growing business that is in the medical industry so the work will always be there. Some days are longer than others but a job is a job do your job the best you can and go home.
good,This company use to be an awesome company to work for but a lot has changed over the years.  There has been changes made in all the wrong areas. Down grades in compensation evaluations and time off benefits.  The medical insurance is at it's all time worst.  It has increased in payments and the insurance has decrease in coverage.
good,"Sales runs company at the detriment of operations. The demands put on by sales not ever pushing back on the customer results in higher cost to operations and overall lack of synergy. "
good,Owens and minor pushes for a team atmosphere and really pulls it off.  They also do a very good job of educating teammates and helping them grow.
good,"Daily task of payroll, benefits and administrative tasks to solve and complete. They have classes to train you to better serve customers and the employee needs. Management and co-workers a pleasure to work with. This company try to give the best customer service and stress free environment for the company."
good,"From top management down everyone was treated kindly and with respect. We had weekly TEAM TALK, with the General Manager. The atmosphere surrounding O & M was light , and very positive ..we worked together to accomplish our goal ..daily."
good,The job is pretty easy but fast paced. Hours are honestly not the greatest. since they are shipping medical supplies you have to be in til all work is complete.
good,Was a good conpany to work for. Was fast paced and competitive. Trying to improve times to get faster and better. Is a big company and has warehouses all over the united states.
good,"Owens & Minor offers a comprehensive training program and encourages all teammates to participate in the offering.  Some classes are assigned and mandatory; however, there is a varied list of training that is completely available to staff."
good,Other than working up to 16 hour days / 6 days a week.  Great place to work.   For the most part the people were great.  I worked second shift.  Start time was 3pm off rime as late as 8am
good,"A Typical day at Owens & Minor consist of either using a Voice Picker   and RF Scanner/Gun to pick customer orders on Stand Up Picker or Pick or orders off the racks on the line. I learned the ins and outs of picking orders using the RF Scanner and Voice Pick while working at a fast pace. Management were incredible communicators who understood the importance of employee feedback, and were contemplative of our suggestions. The culture at Owens & Minor was pretty good. The hardest part of the job was the long hours some nights and sometimes. I Enjoyed my experience at the company."
good,Fast paced quality centered environment. Just in time warehouse focused on hospital supply. Hourly workers get two paid 15 minute breaks in a 8 hour shift taken when you want. These can be stacked together for a 30 minute paid lunch.
good,"owens & minor is a great place to work. the culture is great, they have a strong involvment in the community and volunteering events.  they take care of their customer"

good,"At Owens and Minor, we have to pick items for hospitals using a voice command system. We are scheduled to work 8 hour shifts but we can't leave until the work is done, so if it takes 10+ hours then we have to work the 10+ hours. It's good overtime but it sucks."
good,Somewhere to look forward to coming to realizing the importance of what u do and the people you help who may even be your family. Work by yourself and be responsible for pulling your own weight.
good,"Good place to work. They train you and give you enough time to understand what you need to know to do your job. They couch you. Work days can be very long, but they do not complain about over time. Benefits are good and you are insured the day you start."
good,"Great company, nice boss, just looking for a bigger piece of the pie.  I don't see much room for advancement in my current role, and I'd like to shop around for a company that promotes from within that I can make home."
good,I maintained inventory accuracy made customer calls on orders. I shipped and received orders. Met with drivers to complete there loads. I also had to complete invoices
good,Great place to work. Management is a little bit on the eh side. They don't seem to place much concern on issues presented by employees. Some favoritism shown. But overall very easy job and a great shift schedule.
good,At the DC level management is the best but upper management is less than ethical.  They cancel bonuses to increase their own compensation.  They talk about integrity but fail to walk the walk
good,"This is not a bad company to work for, everyone is like family. We do work some long hours at time especially during the holiday times. We are off 8 holidays a year."
good,"Always be able to work with other drivers worked together looked out for each other always help supervisor"
good,"I worked as a account manager/sales representative.  Very little micro management, the company provided you with the resources and flexibility needed to excel at your job."

This is accomplished by being a part of one of several teams.  During the day, distribution coordinators receive inbound shipments that are eventually put away in the warehouse for a later shift to fulfill outbound orders.  Customer service assists customers by creating orders or resolving other issues.  "

good,As an employee who spends 40% of their day on a computer and the other 60% in a distribution center a typical day is fast paced and has new challenges on a daily basis. Picked up a corporate environment rather quickly. It is a very team oriented environment to the point where line workers and management pair together to accomplish company goals. The hardest part of the job is being able to react to the whirlwind (day to day operations) on a daily basis but this is also the most enjoyable and rewarded part of the job as well.

Have experienced with warehouse matchines like walkie and forklift for an example and many more. Friendly co-workers and it was a fast paste but was enjoyable. Mark Davis was a really good person and I liked how he would like my ideas when I'd change something or route. I feel like he also like the work I did and how sometimes a electronic device would go out, I knew how to fix it. It's good to feel like you can work on something else rather just your work routine.

good,"Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company. The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them. The office started to get crowded as the company grew."
good,"The people were nice and I learned a lot, I became Maintenance, I put in racking, cameras, always met with vendors, met with management on different issues."
good,"a typical day at work i would unload the trucks, set up the pallets with the goods for brake down, then after is broken down, i will start receiving so it can be put away in the assigned location, so it can be picked.  i always got along with my co-workers and it there is a negative attitude from some body i just talk with my supervisor and confront the teammate i fix the problem.  the hardest part of the job was that i couldn't make and appointment after the time i was supposed to finished work, because they where receiving trucks that had no appointments or wasn't on the schedule for the day.  the most enjoyable part of the job was that it didn't matter how busy we were, we manage to accomplished the task for the day."

good,"My responsibilities are quite easy and repetitive. I have permission to cross train with other departments (my focuses are on Administrative work and Human Resources), but time never seems to allow opportunnities for it. There are great training courses online (company site) and I take full advantage. We have a small office and usually, advancement opportunities appear to be offered with relocation. I'd like to be able to utilize my admistrative skills more. Also, our company appears to hire from the outside, as opposed to promoting/hiring from within, aside from upper-management positions."
good,"medical product recalls, 42 dc's across the US product complaints."
good,"Check this job out! It is a great place for an entry level employee. Perfect for College students, or recent High School or College graduates.

good,"I spent 5 years at Owens, the last as a lead. It was a great job. From  what i saw, the only people that hated this place were the people who wanted to do as least as possible. I saw how the most vocal workers, were the 1's who did the least. I know for a fact that I wasn't  in some ""good ole boys"" club, and management went the extra mile for me on several occasions. I speak as a black man... I personally experienced no racism during my time here. I never felt discriminated against. I enjoyed working here. And I would be surprised if i don't regret leaving at some point. The vast majority of the people here are genuinely nice people. The hours tend to frustrate people though and tensions runs high sometimes. The goal from the top down is the minimize hours and increase morale."
