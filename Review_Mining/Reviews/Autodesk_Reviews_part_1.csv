rating,review
bad,"The company is prestigious the office is great but the managers are horrible. HR are not helpful. They will say Work/Life Balance but they will not make you feel that way. This is a modern company with a very very horrible management who run it as if we are still in the 80's. Check the Integrity and Character of your managers. Check how they treat their employees. No one will last in that department until you do something about it."
bad,Big egos and not enough proper management material. The pay was great and location was perfect! The perks was all the snacks you can eat. The working areas were fun and exciting!
bad,"I know that this observation is typical of an employee that did not fair well at an organization.  AutoDesk, however, was horribly deceptive, and the management there lied through their teeth!"
bad,"Was brought in as a temp. data analyst. Very unstructured and unprofessional work environment. People in my group were treated as 2nd class employees, work is very unstructured and often times leading to great confusion among analysts. Culture of fear, do not ask questions, just keep head down & do in order not get fired. I spoke up agains this, my contract was not renewed. I was told it was due to speaking up but entire team was let go. Was then offered to come back in a similar department, apparently because I was a good worker in other department (?), refused due to insufficient pay and zero career advancement opportunities."
bad,"The place is very Siloed."
bad,"The HR, Hiring team and Executive Management make a lot of promises to the people they want to hire to leave their ex-companies and join Autodesk. During the interviews, they ensure job security and a lot of promises to grow within the company. Once you are on-board, they do not care of the sacrifices you have made from a family perspective or monetarily as prospective new hires are promised a lot. There is an air specific discrimination based on your background once you come on-board."
bad,"The overall experience dealing with peers was nice but every manager I had (and the managers of the friends I made) were toxic and ran their departments like fiefdoms. Racism, sexism, homophobia was ignored. "
bad,"This company has everything you would want from a job. Great people, great workspace. The manager I had was petty, incompetent, and liked to yell at employees for mistakes instead of coaching. I was treated like I wasn’t one of them because I was a contingent worker (as are all Autodesk employees when they first start). I would recommend going into a finance position or technical support  because you will be treated fairly."
bad,No Job Security. 2 layoffs a year and for no reason as this company has never been more profitable. Your just a number. Don't leave your stable employer for this one.
bad,Good culture and industry standard pay and benefits.  Worked there for 2 years and saw 3 major layoffs.  Hard to feel comfortable with an organization that is in a constant state of restructuring.  Absolutely no job security. Moving jobs back to San Francisco.
bad,"Started as “contract to hire”, was told every 6-12 months I was next in line to be brought on as a full time employee.  After 5.5 years I was finally laid off after my duties were outsourced.  Never Made it to full time employee status despite the promises.  During my time there it seemed like there was a re-.org every 6-12 months and my team was always concerned whether or not we would be impacted.  Despite all this overall it’s a great company and a great place to work but probably even better if you are a full time employee and not a contractor.  I would work there again but not as a contractor."
bad,"Dirty politics played by bad management because they don't have the skills to do the job."
bad,"Very little training, no support, pushed into uncomfortable situations with no preparations or guidance. Paid extremely well but wasn't worth the environment."
bad,They have a Good long term vision. 3-5 years.  Short term is going to be a little bumpy. This is your typical Silicone Valley company.
bad,"**The good:"
bad,"In general this was a place of good culture.  However, in many cases they seem to target employees that are over 40 and eventually dismiss them using the disguise of a performance improvement plan which is designed to be impossible to succeed."
bad,"Paranoid and reactive middle management."
bad,Give to third party vendor . Unorganized and unplanned projects
bad,Worked for 5 years and some fo the management and hr practices are just unethical. You stay quiet and heads down of you're a woman and figure a way out as there will be little options up. The culture is plagued by silos and cutthroat petty managers who dont think twice about firing you if you speak out.
bad,"For Denver office:"
bad,"At the time of this review I worked for Autodesk for 1 1/2 years, there were 3 restructuring cuts to employees during that time.  Does not make sense because the company has never been more profitable."
bad,"A typical day at work is busy."
bad,"I would put them on the bad side of average.  They leave you to your own devices, which is a plus.  But the raises and bonus are not very good and there is no career development at all and they do everything they can to prevent you from getting a promotion. You most likely will not do the job description that you interview for.  They say that they pay for school and reimburse charitable donations, they don't.  If you want to work with cutting edge technology, you will not be doing it here.  Although I must say that the developers seem happy, and people with ""manager"" in their job title (and there are a lot) seem pretty happy too.  But for me it was pretty much a waste of time."
bad,"I worked their for 2 years..They admire the restructuring.."
bad,"I don't believe these questions are productive, ""confidential"" or not."
good,"Non-stop, frenetic, work before the moment I walk in the office (cell phone begins ringing before 7:00 am). I have learned what type of work stress I will no longer tolerate. My management is no management at all - just micromanage to death and then change everything anyway. The most difficult part of the job is finding some sort of connection with the person for whom I currently work. The most enjoyable part of the job is the other people I get to work with on a fairly regular basis."
good,"Great company, solid business model, but has too many changes with management & uncertainty in the upcoming times."
good,"If you're not a full time employee you will not get far in this place. Contractors only get a review every so often, with no increase in pay until 2 years after from my experience. "
good,"Workplace is good."
good,"As a first job out of university, it was easy to focus on the negatives. Namely, my manager was not trained on how to manage people."
good,"Great projects. Learned a lot. Interesting work, varied work. Worked on a number of projects and assignments and was never bored. Work required creativity."
good,"I like my job even under pressure for 9 hrs/day  in 6 days. I can work & deal with different nationalities. Bias must not be a trend in a company. With my  Salary issue with a Junior Position / connection/relative. Senior position , work experience, potentials/ability , hard work, work dedication and workload must be the basis of salary."
good,"Autodesk is recently expanding into the world of manufacturing. "
good,"While an outstanding company in terms of innovative and important global products, the culture of personal entitlement and collaboration (read ""keep things from being accomploshed"" by others) promotes a stifling corporate environment where constant change management is called for but unsupported at the mid-management level."
good,"Autodesk has been good to me over the years, I've been able to do a lot of interesting work with good people. I have found ""good niches"" to work in that were somewhat isolated from some of the less desirable aspects of the company. There is a concerted effort to address cultural issues, but management continually blunders by promoting inept people, and prioritizing ""looking good"" over ""doing good""."
good,I was the 5th rep in the territory in the last 5 years.  The channel partners hold all the relationships and do the deals on their paper.  No one wants to deal directly with Autodesk and Autodesk has conditioned the end users as such.
good,"working day 9-5:30 "
good,Multiple reorgs a year make it hard to trust in the company and have job security. Mangers with poor skills are kept and talented people will be laid off. Women tend to let go off first. Lots of talent in the SF Bay Area.
good,"While the leadership of the support group seem to care, they in fact are more concerned with their spread sheets, than their employees and customers."
good,"I think I am a little too blue collar for Pier 9.  I set goals, I meet them, I give deadlines, I meet them.  I don't over promise, and I don't under deliver."
good,"I have started my 1st career for IT operation from Autodesk Singapore."
good,"This is a great company to work if you are working with good managers. Flexible, but at times workload can be very heavy."
good,"A typical day at work is characterized for the flexibility of the working hours and the large number of meetings."
good,"Autodesk is one of the last great large American companies with a significant focus on software for Engineering and Manufacturing. "
good,"There are changes underway that may change the conditions, but for the past few years, this place has lacked any regard for the people working here. Really smart and engaged ppl, but treated like nameless resources and made to compete for projects in a way not benefitting the quality of what is offered to the customers."
good,"Pros: Benefits, Salary, Location, Facilities, Resources, decent/fairly interesting products, free lunch 2 days per week, work from home on Friday."
good,The Media and Entertainment division is horribly managed.  Folks with no actual real world experience make decisions while ignoring folks who do have that experience.
good,"It was ok. There are a lot of silos and sensitive people that work remote. There are a lot politics at play, so put your campaign hat on when you interview."
good,"At times high pressure caused by demanding release schedule."
good,An innovative company with many changes.  The frequent churn and lack of support can make it a difficult environment.  Good people but management leaders can be hit or miss.
good,I haven't worked here in so long  the quick brown fox jumped over the fence and caught the rabbit and had a delicious lunch and then took a nap and that's it
good,"Autodesk is a fun and exciting place to work on most days. It is doing amazing things for its customers with its tool offerings. Autodesk is literally in a position to help its customers have a huge positive impact on the world. Further, Autodesk has many incredibly smart, creative and talented employees. We receive excellent benefits, and have a Foundation which offers great perks including donation matching and paid volunteer time. The drawbacks are the opportunities for advancement and the overall culture. Autodesk has undergone a major business transformation, resulting in many organizational changes, which has created a stressful, challenging environment in which to work."
good,"I enjoy working for Autodesk, But I realized that the salary is not fair.  I designed and implemented Change Management to all Autodesk sites.  Now that the project is completed, I think it's time o move on."
good,"Autodesk was a great place to work, but the company was not ready for Data Governance and the practice didn't yet have the needed support. Several week after I started the resources were pulled."
good,"Flexible work hours with flexible location for most"
good,"The new Business Model Transformation is a great idea but taking tolls of many great thinking minds of the company and frankly killing the culture on the services/ Customer Success side. Typical for a large corporation, their VP level has no clue what he's selling and seems to have taken a textbook adaptation of what he thinks Customer services should be. But, there are still amazing people and thinkers in the company and the technology is mind-bending when it comes to disruption and the future. Could be a good fit if you know what you're willing to handle in terms of corporate culture."
good,"Challenging work. Very project oriented environment (scrum, agile).  Great people always willing to help.  Management does a good job of communicating but its mostly top down.  Requires flexibility as many co-workers will be international."
good,"Autodesk, Inc. is an American multinational software corporation that makes software for the architecture, engineering, construction, manufacturing, media, and entertainment industries. Autodesk is headquartered in San Rafael, California, and features a gallery of its customers' work in its San Francisco building."
good,Cognizant has the best working culture and lot of fun at workplace to relieve the stress at work. Resources are highly qualified and certified. Its an awesome company.
good,"Position was infiltrated by poor middle management, and unclear roles and responsibility.  On the positive side, many good co-workers and great technology/tools to work with."
good,Fun place to work great team and lots to learn. There is constant change to keep it exciting. Great Product that is needed in the market.
good,"Autodesk provides really cool technology to a variety of interesting industries.  A person beginning their career could really learn a lot here.  But executive management is erratic, with no centralized product management or strategy.  Too many products, some of which overlap each other.  Lots of territorial conflicts due to lack of leadership."
good,"Autodesk has an excellent benefits package that includes (as of this writing) a six-week paid sabbatical every four years of employment. But the company does not pay very well, and offers next to zero job security. But they do provide opportunities to transfer within the company to other jobs where appropriate."
good,I was there for very short period of time where i was involved in Support packs and few enhancements in SAP.
good,Autodesk provided strong compensation and benefits. Autodesk did not create an environment for job advancement and job security.
good,"Worked as a contractor for Autodesk; the company has a great culture, with plenty of perks."
good,Good management and very flexible and I am very enjoy the work . Workplace culture is good. I learned from that company how manage the work . And very useful.
good,"The division has a lot of work that is manageable and the management sees it.  They allow for great work life balance.  However be careful of what manager you end out with.  Some are great, some not so.  Upper management is fantastic.  All the people that I have ever worked with there have been fantastic!"
good,"Managing and building out business development team to manage and grow Plangrid relationships across South"
good,A solid company and it was a start up in Dublin which was very exciting at the time. A one trick pony so from a planning prespectibve it wasn't very exciting.
good,"Autodesk is going through lots of changes in business, technology, and management all at the same time. Need I say more? There are many reorgs and shifting teams and this happens frequently. Immediate managers are good, but the top level keeps everyone off balance and not quite knowing what to do."
good,"This job taught me how to ship, pack and use forklift. I first started as packer then moved up to a shipper. Quarter-ends are good because of overtime."
good,"Each day is challenging and smart people work at the company.  Career advancement is possible if you are willing to move from department to department.  Politics at the company run at high levels. The further you advance in your career, the more the work becomes about managing VPs and appearances."
good,"Challenging workplace"
good,"Working at Autodesk is great for your resume, although the culture here is not the best. Many contractors, who are all treated not very well, singled out of everything. Not much room for growth unless you become a full time employee. I would definitely recommend this company if you would like to learn a lot, and set your self up with a good career.  Good place to kick off your career, but difficult to become a full time employee"
good,"What I Liked:"
good,The company has it's fingers in a lot of amazing sectors of technology and has great products to boot. M&E division maintains different culture and has weak management in place.
good,- amazing team to work with
good,Been with this company over 13 years and it is time for something new.  Was put into my current role and it was not by my choice.  I received no couching or assistance and it would never have been a role that I wanted.  It is time for something new and exciting.
good,"Most days are 8 hrs, and usually have flexibility to work from home on Fridays"
good,"Autodesk is a great place to work in many ways.  Work life balance is great, and there is always something cutting edge going on all around you.  The work that customers do with the products is celebrated throughout the culture, and it is very cool.  "
good,"Great place to learn but work culture mainly depends on how good the project manager is. "
good,Good working environment.Learned new things.Working in Agile environment. Co-Workers are good.Commute is a big problem.
good,"I've learned to stay consistent, detail oriented, and focus on projects/ tasks. Communicate clearly to employees, guest, and vendors via email, phone and in-person. I was able to work alone without supervision. Made decisions to hep prevent risks and hazardous situations. I enjoy working with a team that was hands on and focused to get the ob done."
good,"Autodesk being a large company varies in culture across teams. In our team our day to day activities were collaborating with Product owner, understand requirement, implement and demo the work on the Sprint basis."
good,"ENG Comércio empresa pequena, com uma estrutura muito boa. Valoriza o funcionário e dá boas oportunidades."
good,Autodesk is a good place to work for. You get reasonable learning but not much on cutting edge tech. People are very friendly and nice to work with. good work-life balance.
good,"•	As part of my current role i am involved in Environments designing for Testing Environments, System integration test, Stage and Production environments apart from this I am involved in Architecture and identifying the existing system gaps and fix the loopholes of the ancient build system."
good,Great working environment bad upper management within the marketing organization but great support within the sales organization.  I would recommend sales over marketing.
good,"I was there only on a short term contract and therefore cannot speak for an FT. Good products, nice people. Could have done with a bit more management support."
good,"Autodesk is a great place to work for ... Only if you are a full-time employee working under the company. "
good,"Culture is good, fairly comfortable and relaxed environment"
good,Your ability to move up completely depends on your manager. Lots of old allegiances and management gossips like crazy. Benefits are great and compensation is average.
good,Your PTO will never grow. 12 days a year to use plus the the last week of the year off. You may be required to take 3-4 days off for the 4th of July weather you want to or not. Leaving you with only 8 or 9 days to choose to take off. Frustrating for a tech company where their peers give significantly more.
good,"Autodesk has a great product and employees can be proud to work for a company with such a good reputation.  The people are terrific and the space in SF is pretty awesome.  However, management is very uneven and not everyone is on the same page.  There are a lot of mixed messages.  "
good,"Autodesk has to solve hard problems for designers, engineers, and makes in Architecture, Construction, Manufacturing, and Media & Entertainment. In terms of process, tech, and culture Autodesk tries continually to make the mark, and occasionally has come close to succeeding in the recent past."
good,"It's a great company to work for, with good benefits.  Management could do better with training and leadership and holding on to good employees and not always getting rid of exceptional employees.  There's always a constant revolving door of employee change, and management could do a better job of transferring knowledge and company culture.  As long as you keep your head  down low and are not to opinionated with upper management, then you may survive the yearly company purge."
good,"For the most part a great place to work.  You are expected to work hard long hours, but they reward good work and most of the people are great.  However, don't speak out about senior management because there will be repercussions and you will likely find yourself in the unemployment line during the almost annual layoff cycle."
good,Future will tell if Autodesk will be successful in the conversion from desktop products to cloud products. Autodesk uses Adobe as the lightning example but it might need its desktop products a little bit longer to make the bottom-line.
good,A typical day at Autodesk includes Stand ups and Sprint discussions. It was a great learning curve for me as I had to work with the Salesforce platform and Rally which was a new introduction to me.Our team was a small one consisting of 7 people which included couple of developers and QA with the lead. We had lots of Fun at work as we had team outings and team lunches happening more often.The hardest part of job was the travel! I had to travel 72 miles one way to reach my workplace. The most enjoyable part of my job was to be with my team mates working and the stand ups. The environment was challenging and kept us on our toes.
good,"Good place to work"
good,"Very fast paced always something going on from events set up and moves to tickets request, learned a lot about the firm workplace culture. Going home is the best part of the job at the end of the day."
good,Autodesk is coin-operated and can stay with a long term strategy.  The firm was highly political and cut throat.  I did not enjoy them although there was a great deal of travel which was fun.
good,"All the pluses of working for a large company but at times feels like a small company. Nearly everyone at Autodesk is great and pleasant to work with. "
good,"As a high-tech company, Autodesk is on the leading edge of challenging work opportunities.  This give everyone an opportunity to learn and be fully engaged - Good things!  That said, they have a high frequency of company re-organizations, causing high employee attrition. This pattern creates a highly competitive environment among peers for future job security."
good,Large company dedicated to create design tools widely used in diverse number of industries. Learned to work in a large matrix company structure reporting to different teams and regions.
good,I've been working as technical consultant dealing with customers and sales teams all over the world. During my stay I improved my presentation and communication skills along with the metrology knowledge.
good,"At Autodesk, I survived many RIF, but it's a culture of not ""if but when"" and my time finally came with 1150 colleagues. It's very much a heavy management versus worker environment and a who you know more than what you know in most departments. I really had a great manager so I was lucky, but regretfully, he didn't survive the RIF either. "
good,"- This company changed dramatically in the 10 years I worked there"
good,i have learned so many things in the company. It is best company to learn new things to the freshers.Every one should have to work individually . Good company.
good,Small team and fun environment. Great place to work as beginners. Great place to learn. People are very supportive and helpful . Great work life balance
good,"The work is cutting-edge and interesting on a daily basis. My team was very easy to work with, international, competent and friendly. However, in a team of 20 people there were only 2 professional female members."
good,"Hardest part of the job was that much of engineering was located in India and China. As a UX designer, I had many meetings that started up after coming home from work and went into the wee hours of the night. "
good,"Autodesk is a world leader in 3D design, engineering, and entertainment software and services."
good,"Ambiance très décontracté et dynamique."
good,"Autodesk is a very unique company focused on all about design products / services. It has a good to be at company feel bringing positive changes to lives of many people: consumer products, buildings, roads, plants, machinery, and movies."
good,"Great culture 2000 - 2010, then not so great, But overall a good experience. Not much room for promotion but opportunities exist for lateral movement and/or role swapping."
good,"Difficult to advance as management doesn't focus on your career growth as much as they should. Company has been going through constant change so job security is hard to maintain, navigating the complex structure is also tough but culture and benefits are great along with having highly skilled employees."
good,"It is productive place to work. Good Learning opportunity towards professional development "
good,"Enjoy the best years of my employment in my professional career in Autodesk, especially working on big research projects with external partners, and enjoy working with my long time colleagues, some of them over 15 years long, and very good working relationship. However, Autodesk laid out employees in a few rounds, in some unexpected fashions. I lost some long time colleagues and good hard-working team members during my years with Autodesk."
good,"Great people, great benefits and great products. The technology is cutting edge and you have opportunity to work with every type company manageable."
good,"Management teams are excellent."
good,"Great colleagues, Great products, poor internal systems and tools, fun culture but poor succession planning for the recruiting team."
good,"Management is hands off and does involve itself until things get bad, then they want to blame someone. "
good,Autodesk provides a strong work ethic based company. A typical day includes several interactions with various customer opportunities - progress - since they are generally Long Term Sales Cycles which could last nearly 2 years.
good,"Typical Day is:"
good,Workplace culture was very relaxed.  People brought their dogs to wrok.  Regularly.  This helped counteract the stressed callers who were having difficulty with anything from getting the program to actually load to needing answers for very specific questions for operating a program.
good,"The workplace is beautiful and work life is in balance.  Not a lot of innovation is happening in the main body of employees at Autodesk. Its safe, pleasant for parents, money is spent in strange ways. Innovation seems to be happening with the sustainability and the R&D departments."
good,"Autodesk is an exciting company that is constantly reinventing itself to provide more possibilities for their customers."
good,"Autodesk is doing really interesting work, has great people, products and customers, has the best work-life balance of anywhere I've worked but is also a really frustrating environment.  New management has not helped things -- with continued restructuring, reorganizations, shifting things around, and lots of people not being completely clear what their job is.  Some people work really hard and others survive for 20 years hardly working -- while plenty of decent people are let go because the company can't quite figure out how to move good people where we need them.  They're telling a good story to Wall Street about their transition to subscriptions but the next few years will really tell us if Autodesk will succeed or not."
good,"The company is doing great things to revolutionize the industry, but the only way to move around the company is to make diagonal moves. It's very difficult to ""climb the ladder"" and career advancement is very unclear."
good,"The atmosphere was relaxed."
good,Autodesk makes things harder than they need to be.  Interesting culture of collaboration.  Focused on moving to a fully digital company where sales transactions are high volume at a low cost and no services are required.
good,"Exciting technology, great people, nice offices but frequent re-organizations and staff reductions. Good benefits and compensation, interesting work but short term focused based on meeting the demands of the stock market."
good,"All is well, when you are professional and workholic, You can learn and earn name is quite complicated to comment, But overall good to be here for 2 years"
good,Very young professional's atmosphere.  Hard to advance unless you've been there for over three years.  The workplace culture is exciting and fast-moving. I enjoyed the commissions and disliked the turnover of management every year.
good,It is easy to communicate between team members. Regular all-hands meetings. Decent amount of politics and sometime it delays the work process.
good,"It was very easy for me to move up within the company. Not only have I gotten to use my skills in a productive way, but I have also been able to learn new skills whilst on the job."
good,"Advising business owners, strategy managers, BIM managers, engineers, architects, constructors and who is involved in managing their work success and processing efficiently in order to apply BIM in the most proper way and being leaders in the market. In addition to move forward into 3D designs and visualization to meet the customers’ needs and expectations which all leads to Imagine, Design and create a better world."
good,"However, there are big cultural differences between some of the departments here. I'm learning the more longer I work here. I started as a temp and should be converted to an employer closer to new years 2020. I'm working in Client Services at the moment, and there is a work flow schedule that I was not aware would be applied to my role. To me, this is very similar to typical Call Center Culture, and not in line with the Autodesk culture, but that is just my opinion. Other department, outside of Client Services, are not made to adhere to the same schedule structure; they have more freedom to manage their own work/time as they see fit. "
good,Good group of like minded people to work with in this office. Unfortunately each year more and more people are let go due to reasons only upper management and stock holders are privy too.
good,"The company is operating in very niche market. The company has a very volatile management as a result there are concerns related to job security. The people working here are some of the best talent to see, and the company promotes healthy work life balance."
good,"Great place to work, lots of politics though. Many employees are looking to advance their personal agenda. great products and a innovator in the industries they are in."
good,Great workplace culture.  Changes are always good but sometimes can be hard.  Work/Life Balance is good but it depends where you work.  Advancement can be tough sometimes which depends on management.
good,"Great people to work with, great tech and enjoyable to use however going through two restructures in the same amount of years was not fun, and made it kind of uneasy not knowing when your division may be eliminated"
good,Autodesk is a progressive software company with excellent benefits and compensation.  It's a great place to work for someone who wants constant change.
good,"- a typical day at work: 8:00 am-5:00 pm  "
good,"After 18 years, it is sad to be part of the 10% reduction in force at Autodesk.  It has been the most challenging, exciting, and rewarding place I have ever worked.  "
good,"A typical day at work was calling all of my registered clients and resellers to ensure they were satisfied with service and software."
good,Great place to work way back when.  I owe a lot to ADESK fo rbeieving in my and givn me the hnce I need to susced in the corporate world.
good,Learnt how to program a MIS system that helped automate company processes.
good,"Learnt Advanced Frameworks like Backbone.js and Test Driven Development Approach."
good,I loved this company. But with the bad economy came lay offs.
good,"An amazing place to work and be a part of. Really great people and products that are truly amazing, with great customers who do really cool things with the products."
good,Mostly operations work. not much work load. Only the brand name is the gain. Can join after 15-20 years of experience to relax and lead simple day to day life.
good,Lots of talented people creating an environment primed for innovation and learning. Work culture is based on collaboration and giving employees the opportunity to express themselves
good,"Lots of opportunity for travel and flexible working. Lovely, modern offices. A typical day involves lots of meetings, many of which happen over Skype as colleagues are located all over the globe so you'll often find yourself working in multi-national teams. This can be awkward as it often means working across multiple time zones."
good,"Teaching architects how to utilize the latest software in architecture field is really interesting to me. I learned how to interpret the technical "
good,"Good company to work along, technically and process wise will provide most of the knowledge. On Employees company follows Employees first and Customer second policy."
good,"Management does a good job of being transparent on the business goals and company direction overall."
good,The vacation is limited in the US but they try to offset it with offering a sabbatical every 4 years.  They are very good to the community.  The employees are very dedicated and bright.
good,"Great company, great coworkers and fun place to be. The hardest part of the job is that technology changes so fast. Always adjusting to the new terminology and new technology can be hard. The job is very rewarding."
good,Autodesk is an experience and I am lucky to work here.  The people are wonderful and always there to assist when needed. I've learned a great deal.
good,"A typical day at Autodesk is enjoyable.  Colleagues are steeped in experience and typically friendly and engaging.  I've learned a lot about how to design and develop apps and platforms in the enterprise environment.  Management in general is laissez faire (hands-off) and this approach tends to promote ""being your own CEO"" and driving success with one's own power and hard work.  I have made quite a few great friends of co-workers.  The hardest part of the job is carrying what can be a very heavy burden, depending on the role, team, product and division.  The most enjoyable part is learning from wonderful people."
good,"It is never boring, the company is growing fast and the customers and products are amazing.  The hardest part of the job is working in a large matrix organization where getting consensus is not always possible."
good,"Excellent work environment."
good,"Les horaires de travail sont tres flexibles dans le petit bureau socialcam. Les gens vont et viennent, ce qui fait qu'ils sont tres independants. Il est pour le coup tres difficile de travailler en equipe. Les projets sont individuels mais ont des incidences sur d'autres parties."
good,"Autodesk is a great company to work for in general. Excellent work-life balance and overall benefit. Its niche is in CAD, where it really dominates. However, in the field that I'm working in (simulation), Autodesk is still searching for directions."

I was hardly allowed to pursue skills of my choice which were not completely different from the current skill set

good,"I love working for Autodesk and everything it stands for.  However, it really depends on which team you are working for.  Some organizations have highly dysfunctional senior leadership while others have better leaders.  If you are considering working here, be extra assertive with compensation and benefits, or you will be lowballed at every turn."

good,Typical day consisted of daily meetings with my team/co-workers. I met with manager every week to do my evaluations of my satisfaction at Autodesk. The culture of the workspace is very vibrant and welcoming. There is usually a bonding time for people to have fun every now and then. A good example was karaoke during lunchtime.

The work environment is the best in San Fran; not quite as wonderful in San Rafael but still good.  The business is changing; moving away from the old-line desktop software space into a full-on SaaS model.  These changes can be painful at times, but senior management is not letting any grass grow beneath them as they work through it.  All and all, very positive.  You owe it to yourself to look here if you're in the market for a tech job."
good,I learned a lot about programming and CAD programs. Other employees were always willing to help me with my projects.
good,This was a great comapany to work for but management was not good. I was let go after 17 years of dedication and hard work. Reason was job redeployment
good,"Overall Autodesk is an exciting company to work at.  It's fast-paced and collaboration is a must. If you like meeting people from around the world and working with some of the best minds I would recommend Autodesk. The benefits are standard for the tech industry including paid sabbatical. In some parts of the country the salaries are highly competitive while in the big cities they have some work to do. City locations are not necessarily convenient for commuters. "

good,A friendly environment with an amiable atmosphere and culture.  Provides a nice work/life balance and the ability to telecommute.

The cafeteria has an amazing espresso machine and coffee grinders to get you the best cup of coffee you will ever have at work (well, unless maybe you are a barista?).

After about halfway through the day, we would have another meeting about our progress so far, and if there were any issues along the way."
