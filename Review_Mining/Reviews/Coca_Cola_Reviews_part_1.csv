rating,review
bad,"hard work, no concern for workers.management not concerned about workers.constant miscommunication about work hours. no concern for workers safety.would not recommend."
bad,To much labor intensive work for the pay rate.  When in the store you work for Coca-Cola and the store itself.  Meaning you are being told what to do by both sides.
bad,"This is not the Coca Cola of old.   Too many restructures and unfit managers have turned this place upside down.  A majority of the HR, Accounts Payable/Receivables, IT and payroll positions have been sent to India, Manila, Costa Rica, Buenos Aires and other countries.  Not a good look for an American company"
bad,Work over there for 5 years they fire me with out questions or checking security cameras. managers don't know what their doing Union is garbage. find out
bad,Never apply here. The work is too much. The stores always complain about something. The customers are rude and always in your way. I sort of wished I never went here and always be thinking about the bad experiences I had here
bad,Very old equipment because all the profits go to the shareholders and it’s not much because they will cut off their noses to steal a Pepsi customer  very long work days and no ac in the trucks  they don’t have any cargo secure in the trailers so I spent about two hours a day picking up product of the floor. Management doesn’t. All they do is find reason to fire anyone who complains about the day to day difficult irs
bad,"Under paid"
bad,"Estuve en el edificio del Costumer service de Barcelona , ambiente pésimo de trabajo , los eventuales solo tratan de hechar a los que entran nuevos para que trabajen mal y traten peor al cliente, sobrecarga laboral, coacciones continuas, comunicación nula con los superiores, nada de formación, los fijos hacen todos los descansos solo para y se reúnen a solas para no trabajar"
bad,"Worst company, total racists, no chance for advancement, unfair management, co workers are racists, no raises, work 60 hours to 70 hours a week, no compensation,"
bad,"Péssimo e muito estressante,chefes puxa sacos, que não sabem valeu rizar um trabalhadores."
bad,"If you enjoy working for a corporation where you are seen as a replaceable number then look no further. Managers do not pay attention to scheduling, routes make zero sense, and the hours are horrible. To make it even better, they work you till your body breaks and pay less than $30,000 per year."
bad,"Micro managing, cliques and favorites. Culture of retaliation. If you weren't a friend of the supervisor, you couldnt work from home. They didnt adhere to their own printed standards of qualifications to be eligible. I saw managers try to take away an employee's severance package by telling lies. At the end of my time I was more than ready to leave. The deceit and.               games were more than I could stomach"
bad,"Horrible Hours, work/ life balance non existent, always changing policies,not enough help to answer questions,no supervisors available to take escalated calls,mean customer's,no insensitives,no benefits"
bad,I was actually happy I got injuried and was able to get out of this company. The pay was ok the overtime was pathetic. And the managers could care less about you nor do they know anything about their routes.
bad,not a very good paying career. barley able to make 36000 when hitting bonus. using own vehicle to get to stores on route. working 60 hrs plus a week and salaried.
bad,95% travel; they say they encourage professionals development but that’s a joke.  The pay is good but the benefits are not inline with similar organizations...unless you live in Atlanta.  If you’re field based you can’t access the majority of perks
bad,No promociones  Do not listen to employ suggestions very low pay benefits are very low Treatment of employees management needs to be you restructured Big company would you just an  They don't help the employee.
bad,"Rutas interminables ,puteo a los repartidores hasta por parte de Coca Cola  hora de entrada excesivamente pronto terminar la ruta es un milagro muy mal en general"
bad,"This company is the biggest bunch of wimps to work for. When approached with multiple documented situations of theft, and the person accused of theft threatens to ""put a cap in the #ss"" of the person who reported them, and is documented by multiple people who heard them brag about it and reported it to their supervisors, human resources decides to ""wipe the slate clean and start all over"", like nothing ever happened. But if I'm caught driving around the company parking lot  in a company vehicle without my seatbelt on, I'm automatically terminated. Like I said. Biggest bunch of wimps. Especially when it comes to minorities. We have three kids working on second shift who make up their own time to come in and leave whenever they want to, do not get with the lead man when they punch in to see what he has laid out for them. And once they bring something in, they disappear, or stand at their tool boxes playing with their phones. They'll cry racism and threaten to sue, claiming that the leadman is harrassing them when he telks them to get to work. Then, we all have a big meeting between the two shifts and sign sheets of papers with a new set of rules, thanks to the three kids, until said kids find a new way to get around said rules. Apparently, there's a set of rules for us who work hard and a set of rules for those who don't. I had another word for wimps, but could not submit my review due to inappropriate language. If this company would get a pair of balls and deal with these three the way they should, we'd have a much better enviroment. And yes, I am one of those currently looking"
bad,Terrible place your a #. No compassion..could care less about you or your excellent performance history. Keep scrolling up and please don't apply here
bad,Merchandising is literal slavery and you drive your own car around the city plus they dont give a fuddk about your health no benefits or any package for the only people who actually physically work in the entire company. To boot the sales reps are f ing lil babies you take so much BS from them until you quit. Training methods are drive around with another sales rep lol jokes
bad,The management sucks they pick favoritism ! Every night they mandated you to say 10 hours especially when it’s hot and you can’t breathe the warehouse manager looks at you like your a born criminal I would never advice anyone to work here
bad,All they care about is the customers. they do not care about the employees unless you are the circle or management. otherwise they can careless. i got ran over by an electric pallet jack and was put on light duty but still forced to work beyond my restrictions.
bad,"Unless you like running like a maniac to barely scrape together 300 dollars. I would never wish this job on my enemy, and they lie to you about advancements then give you impossible things to do to obtain it."
bad,"Put most of the work on the only people actually working. Poor management. You don't have to work at all if you are friends with upper management. No encouragement or motivation to get the work done from management. Always negative towards builders. The ones that do work are punished for not getting ALL the work done when others are talking and laughing with management.  No help from upper management at all, just complaints. Entire warehouse needs to be re-evaluated. Very poor working conditions. Changed hours from 8-12 and made days off mandatory to come in. Absolutely no time for personal life as work days are unbearable. Extreme weather conditions. Have to remind them of breaks and lunches. Hard labor for the minimum pay. bad insurance. No room for advancement."
bad,They don’t pay enough they over work you and don’t care all they care about is their money they don’t care about your personal problems you have come up they don’t care if your sick or in hospital all they want is you working they put you down for making mistakes and just overall don’t care about their merchandisers the faces of coca cola
bad,"I have never felt so undervalued by a company!! The work is way too hard and stressful for the pay. There is no advancement if you don’t know someone. The store mangers will not hesitate to complain about the littlest thing, and it is a rarity that the company takes your side or really even tries to figure it out. There is no union, so you will never have any pull of any kind."
bad,"The union is bought and paid for , the company is corrupt as corrupt can be , for the love of god STAY AWAY. There is no union there , you pay a union they steel your money and do nothing in return . The company does not care about your safty at all , not even a little bit ."
bad,Came in with great expectations. Yet the company did not fulfill everything that was offered to me. Great workers who were tremendous at filling orders and picking. Yet we’re quite upset with the conditions of the equipment.
bad,"The first job ever really hated. And have lots of jobs ,the work hours or crazy, no time for personal life . And management don’t care about staff , it’s like I got mine you get yours . They or afraid on change . That why they or not the number one soft drink company any more."
bad,"Stay away FAR!!! You will die or get injured for what they put you through...they do not communicate, they lie. Treat you like a piece of garbage ..they do not care"
bad,Mala experiencia los superiores no tienen idea de lonque es andar en campo
bad,"This company is only concerned with profit. Management does not care about doing the right thing, they don’t care about working you to death and they do not care about there people"
bad,"this place sucks.this place sucks.this place sucks,this place really sucks an i will never recommend this place to my worse enemy on my worst day on this planet"
bad,"CCR made a huge mistake selling such a crucial area. Sales are plummeting, customers are super unhappy, and let's not forget employees are as well. The company got rid of 50% of its employees and dumped all the work on the remaining employees with no extra compensation. They got rid of bonuses and raises. 8hr days became 10+ with little time for lunch. Managers are micromanaging due to fear of getting fired and making work miserable."
bad,Management doesn’t answer phone when u call to ask a question. They order lunch for themselves all the time. Drivers do not get anything. It’s management vs. Drivers. Put my 2weeks not one person asked why I was leaving. They don’t stick up for u with the customers when u deliver.
bad,"First of all they send you what time you gotta be at work the night before I will said between 8-1am. It is mandatory you work all weekends. Manager or boss is disrespectful.  They will offer you part time work so you won’t received the full time benefits, but instead you will work full times hours with a part time salary. Hours was horrible too I spend all day working 8-14hours basically when the store is completed. Then they will ask for pictures even though is not on your job description of the work. They will schedule you to work but the days you have off changes every week so you never know what days you have off till mid week for the following week. Overall the worst place to work even workers that been there for many years told me they hate it. So turn around the work you do is not even worth how much they paid you."
bad,"Huge let down in years of services!"
bad,I traveled through out Virginia and West Virginia delivering coke products and vending machines to various stores and other business locations. Great work atmosphere.
bad,"The regional chef and upper management is very racist and do not respect woman or religion."
bad,"I worked as a driver for coke in Rock Islands IL. It was a good job, everyone got along. I was a relief driver, so being fron K.C. everyone kind of took me under their wing. Because I was a cover driver, there wasn't much of a need for me anymore. I was determined to come back to K,C, which when i started at Roberts. After that, I went back to Coke in Lenexa, Very negative working environment."
bad,"This is the worst place to work for."
bad,"you get paid more working in a warehouse, all we do is stack Tesco and Asda shelves, deal with store staff that don’t want you there. Bad management and they lie about progression"
bad,"Coca cola force you to work 2 to 3 weeks with out days off and 12.5 hours daily. Forget about your life and family if you work for coca cola in Auburndale. And your cooworker are the worst, cutting your through. Do not work there."
bad,"Your just a number to management  and company. They'll try to mentally and physically break you down. Your in a no win situation  and no appreciation.  If you get injured  your then treated like a criminal.  No way of advancement, it's a dead end job!  It's not what people think.  Dysfunctional  toxic  environment.  Save  yourself  the headaches!"
bad,this company has too much work for us and not enough pay coworkers are friendly not enough time to be productive orders go missing and accounts get unpaid
bad,This was the worse place I ever worked. You would show up in the morning 5am and have to work until your truck was empty sometimes 20 stops or better. You would have to unload take into the store and stock and rotate the shelved. Sometime you would not get home until 7 at night
bad,A declining industry that is finding it hard to make things happen and has been trying several product lines to stay in line with times and is reflected in how they treat their employees
bad,"You will sweat, you will get little rest , and only one 30 minute break, you’ll work almost 80 hours a week, and you’ll need to bring food and eat good before and after work ."
bad,its was one of the worst work experiences of my life not fairly treated made to work 6 days a week worked from 4 a.m to 7 to 11 p.m. was worked to the bone with no regards to the person
bad,A sweat shop type of job in which people have to work. Its not designed for someone that doesn't want to be slaved. Its extremely hard and overbearing
bad,"La jefatura no tiene ningún interés en el trabajador,para  ellos somos números "
bad,"I worked in the coca cola warehouse and I started on a pallet-jack, but with my forklift experience I was able to advance to about 3 different jobs and pay raises, but like many jobs if they don't like you , you are done."
bad,"I am sure it may have been a great group at one point but when you have these up and coming recently promoted managers that care only about how much you sweeten their ears rather than how your numbers look then you are not going anywhere. I saw many people leave and become depressed thru their ""career"" at this place of work, everyone is so anti social and hypocritical that honest help or advancement is not possible because they fear you becoming better than them and those that happen to be hired on they are so high up in the clouds that they may feel they are too important to give you some insight. I am glad I left this position and look forward  to much success in life."
bad,"They max you out on the 60 hour rule, even if you have 3 hours left they make you come in on a Saturday for those 3 hours. Worn out trucks, bad mapping on deliverys, nothing strapped in truck"
bad,"Didn't have such a great experience here.  Maybe it was just the management team at the time, but the work environment was toxic and the mission was not identifiable."
bad,the day begins very early in morning with a lot of product to be thrown in a very short amount of time. the day is very fast paced and long and you are under paid for the amount of the work you have to do.
bad,Horrible to work for. Nothing is ever good enough they only care about their case counts and spots you could work 13 hour days and anything you did wouldn't be enough. Not a good place at all they dont treat you well.
bad,"management doesn't know what they are doing, or even what's really going on out in the trade. They only look at numbers. Not a single care about their employees or customers."
bad,"I had a horrible schedule with forced overtime, weekends, lack of breaks.  Management and coworkers were rude, racist, sexist, etc.  They insulted members of other religious minorities."
bad,"No good equipment, trucks didnt meet dot requirements.  Just the worse place ive experienced learned that the drivers are slaves to the managers, and are not appreciated"
bad,"This company was the most poorly run company I have had the opportunity to work for.  The people in Management positions were promoted from within, there for they never had the education to be in the positions they were in.  They did not know anything about managing people and therefore were not qualified to be a manager.  In other sections the management was so out of date that they had processes in place that did not generate any profits for Coca-Cola and it caused poor moral, and low profit margins at the end of the year.  Employees were over worked and then mandated to work on their scheduled days off.  The company was ran very in-efficiently and management was uneducated to recognize the problem."
bad,nice job for a teenager lack of pay is big factor. management not the leaders they should be lack of communication with the employees provide a negative culture.
bad,"Does not treat all associates the same. The management does not care about their employees, only the bottom line. Not customer friendly. Does not offer a good work/ life balance"
bad,"Coca-Cola company it consists of hardworking and commitment of working, long working conditions and less salary."
bad,The Work atmosphere was insanely hard to handle with the personal drama of the HR department/upper management. The job itself wasn’t that bad. I was lied to about the working atmosphere in order for me to leave my previous job.
bad,"No advancement or incentive bonus or raise unless you are the favorite or the correct color."
bad,"really bad place to work, Horrible management now and stressful place. Bad pay is the worst paying company I've ever worked for. No appreciation at all."
bad,"If you are looking to work for the amazing brand of Coca Cola, this isn’t it.  Those days are over. When CCBF came to town a group of tyrants who know nothing about customer service or employee relations ruined what we used to have.  Gone are the days of loving your job and being incentivized for doing a good one... now it’s nothing but negatitivity and threats if something isn’t exactly how they want it.  Run for the hills... everyone is so much better than this company"
bad,Drivers are expendable . Management will not regognize your effort and don’t listen to the drivers input. If you want to work hard for garbage pay then have at it.
bad,Horrible experience. Just not able to move up. Bad pay. Crazy hours. Never had any time to work around the work schedule. The hours could go high and just never know.
bad,It's a good job and everything but the pay and the work that you have to do doesn't add up and it's hard to move up at that job. that's why I left because it wasn't for me
bad,Once you get tagged for standing up for yourself or you get injured you are labeled as a trouble maker and there is no room for promotion even if you have the experience.
bad,terrible working experience. would not recommend to anyone. It is a cut throat environment and very stressful. Work with a team but everyone is working against you. Very little support or care from all levels of management.
bad,"Worst job in the world. If you dont want to have a social life and be broke after working 50+ hours, then this is the place for you. Management keeps all the money for themselves and only leave you the crumbs off the table."
bad,"Worst job in history. If you dont want to have a social life and be broke after working 50+ hours, then this is the place for you. Management keeps all the money for themselves and only leave you the crumbs off the table."
bad,Coca Cola is a stressful environment in which people are overworked and treated badly. Poor Management that is inexperienced in the beverage industry.
bad,"Another cut throat fortune 500 company.  Be aware, if you are not the right color then all the usage of STAR technique will not get you in the door."
bad,Be very careful of working in Edmonton Coca Cola . Place is full of racism and management can not do anything infront of union. If you are not white then don’t work there . Just an advice very toxic culture.
bad,"Poor management, a lot of favoritism."
bad,"Coca Cola is a horrible place to work full of rude, nasty unprofessional employees and the worst customers I've ever had the misfortune to deal with.  The Account Manager role is aa horrible job that I would not wish on my worst enemy.  I would advise no one to ever work for this company or buy there product."
bad,Company expectations are not physically possible and the pay is very low. Management is not good and only cares about how long you can work because they refuse to hire enough people.
bad,Management sucks at this place. Union representation is non existent. No one has your back and management has their favorites. This is not a pleasant environment. You are  number and not a person. No one cares about you. There is racism and sexism rampant in this company.
bad,This company was the most racist and inept company I ever worked for! If you think I'm exacerbating with this review ask any person of color about this company.
bad,"From the get go, they make it clear they don't care about you at all. There's a huge amount of turnover there, and for good reason. Their equipment is so old and outdated that it makes it very hard to do your job."
bad,"You would be a fool to work for this company in Denver!  The manager and the entire culture there is unorganized, non-supportive and kaniving!  keep it moving and sweep streets before you work here!"
bad,"I worked as quality controller.I gain more experience in the supply chain management but I did not enjoy working there.i was treated unfairly most of the time,I tried to make most of my time pleasant but unfortunately its did not work out for me.the shop floor  employees are not treated well no matter how hard working they are,they are not appreciated even when they put more long hours.I was generally a quality controller.I groomed my self in getting more experience the company did not provide any training at  all."
bad,This company has changed hands at least twice since I worked there 2 years ago. I have little recollection of the job since I haven't worked there in 9 years. I will say it is sad that you would lay someone off unexpectantly after over 20years of loyal service.
bad,"Ive never seen a company care so little about its work force. Management is very poor. I still know people working there who are being forced to quit because the work environment, thus coca cola will not have to pay any severence when the warehouse closes. Which will be soon i imagine."
bad,"Key accountoperation pertaion to develop the  shop for coke and excute the coke at shops etc "
bad,"Discriminates against employees with illnesses and/or disabilities, does not pay employees for the hours they worked, threatened to cut employees hours until they had no hours at all to make them quit so that they didn't have to pay out unemployment."
bad,Coca Cola is a good place to work for. The difference is the leadership that is in place at the locations you work. You are only as good as your leadership.
bad,I have lost my patience they descriminate me I'm only giving a gift with my co worker they fired me and that is unhuman process I have no late no absence I did my job well
bad,In the short time I worked for Coca-Cola San Leandro I found out first hand that there is a disconnect between upper management and production. There should be a follow-up in the town hall meetings on how the company can be more accommodating towards its workers.
bad,"The company  used you are dump you"
bad,did not like managers were not supportive in the trade. no communication didnt get paid right. managers wasnt avialible when i needed him. not a good place to work
bad,The pay sucks!!!! And so does management! I don't have anything good to say. People hear the name Coke and think of a great company. Ha ha yea right!!!!
bad,I would not tell people to work her they do people wrong and don't care about any one or there family emergency's they over work you 15 to 20 hours a day and they expect way more then what the company is worth
bad,Go into work get route and complete my route. Also turn in all money. Also help customers order product that they need. Go to safety meetings every Monday morning before starting route.
bad,"Camden Arkansas location is the worst on earth ! Horrible manager supervisor etc people steal drinks everyday , trucks all run bad , equipment all old and unsafe ! Just horrible"
bad,Very bad management. Care more about micro managing than running the plant as a whole. Constant problems there. Always looking for something but other than making the plant better and efficient
bad,"The supervisors aren't willing to properly inform individuals of how to improve their performance, Work associates are verbally abusive. "
bad,A woman supervisor who works in the WH doesn't know a thing about her job and is in everyone else business. Avoid and never trust.
bad,"You come back to other merchandisers garbage absolutely no help. a merchandiser has to be able to finish everything by his or her self every single time. management never answers calls, you eat on the run all the time. As a merchandiser has to finish 104 pallets in 10 hrs"
bad,Terrible place to work I was not compensated properly or offered any opportunity to advance. I was looked over for being to educated.
bad,"I would not recommend any person to this company ,not to many people could handle this kind of work but I stuck it out for 5 1/2 years I learned a lot how not to be a supper visor"
bad,"Company was very unprofessional not very good training employees basically did as they was pleased no good job,life balance not good management."
bad,С трудом отпускают на выходной. Нет отпуска. Нет больничного. Их не интересует ваше здоровье
bad,I worked for Coca-Cola for a little over 10 years I started out as an order Builder then I ended up taking the job title as a forklift operator from that point on I never advanced through the company even though I performed multiple duties and work harder than my coworkers I never received any sort of recognition for it then about a year-and-a-half ago I received an injury on the job and it was the company's fault that was out of work for 3 months and received workman's compensation within a year-and-a-half time they worked up enough paperwork to terminate me after 10 years of hard work I believe it was because of the injury they blame me for damages two company property that they had no proof that I had done
bad,Management sucks here..I worked the night shift at this location and was the only driver out at night. 15 to 17 turkey hills a night 14 hours a night. Place blows nothing positive to say.
bad,"No work and life balance. Your schedule can change up six times a day."
bad,"i have worked for this company for three years. the management does not care about the turnover rate, how busy one is, or anything else. what they want to do, like any billion dollar company, is sell, sell, sell. i feel sorry for the supervisors, as they do NOT know the meaning of teamwork. i dislike when i get emails saying ""team""this or ""team""that. there is no team. coke sucks."
bad,My husband started here as a seasonal employee with the promise of permanent position only to be told that they no longer needed him and would call him back in November when it picked up again...they gave him no warning no heads up what so ever which I found wrong
bad,This is a horrible place to work. Management is useless. They treat employees like nothing and have even taken away the free Coke beverages that we once got every month. Now they are being sold and who knows what is going to happen now. Do not work her!!!!
bad,"Long hours for low pay, very hard work. Hard on your back and hard on your wallet. They make you drive your own car with no pay compensated into your check for repairs. Management was a joke."
bad,"long hours, slave work, hot warehouse. some supervisors will fire you for nothing fr. its like everybody waiting for some one to mess up"
bad,The hardest work you will ever do. The pay is great as long as you don't mind the overtime and hard work. A lot of lifting and physical labor.
bad,"I worked here 15 yrs, its been 1 year since i left and i still wake up somtimes stressed or kinda panic. It goes away when you realize it was just a nightmare....or was it"
bad,"You get hired in as a union worker, and the management there does everything they can to make your life difficult. It was a joke."

bad,"No good mangment work all type of hours and then you get cut next week so that you want have that much overtime, good job for a come up"
bad,"No opportunity for advancement, always hiring from the outside instead of from within. Pay is way too low for the amount of work and responsibility.  Benefits are okay, but medical insurance is very high deductible."
bad,revolving door. Management didn't know what they were doing. Good company on resume but that's about it. I wouldn't recommend to anyone
bad,Too many side deals within the organisation between upper management and hourly associates. No discipline towards any process if the hourly associate doesn't like the decision made by a middle manager then they approach upper management where the decision is over turned.
bad,"They advertise like ""very professional job"" like a Pharmaceuticals sales rep. NOTHING like that they work you to no end. every month getting worst. they don't care about you at all."
bad,"work your tail off with no gratitude for work completed. long hours, short staffed. will hire a bunch of temps but wont hire anyone full time."

bad,"great company company and  the work culture. Loved working there it was only a contract position.  Would have loved to go permanent if it was option,very good work environment."
bad,Job sucks too many chiefs not enough Indians. Nobody has any accountability or consistency. Never see your family. Supervisors wont answer their phones.
bad,"Cons: Not Paid OT, treated badly, sales/account managers make you do extra work"
bad,"I've been working since August 2012 as Part-time merchandiser. I was recently offered a driver position in distribution department. It's amazing, because I didn't even apply for it but was contacted because my former boss recommended me. I did accept the offer and start my training and settle all paper works, but merchandising team needs a work force that time. I have no choice but to stay for the team and wait for a new member for my replacement. The business slow down and the driver position was closed. I am very worried about my situation as the new people joined our team and getting more hours than me. I got two day shift a week and makes a huge impact on my financial obligation. I can’t help myself to feel that I’m not getting equal treatment as they cut my hours for just reason, and I am so disappointed as I constantly working hard and efficiently doing all task and project given to me. I am faced with a dilemma, I am supporting my wife’s family back home as I do not want to have more debt but if I leave this company now would never find one right away. I am so stressed thinking and searching for source of income. I was hoping for help from our union but they do nothing."
bad,"Could care less about their employees. All they care about is the bottom line. Stores do not get the proper merchandising cause hours are cut way back. Impossible people to deal with. No loyalty to their employees whatsoever. You have to be real desperate to acce4pt a position here as they will give you no respect, expect you to do 40 hours work in 10 hours and absolutely refuse to give anyone vacation time, even though it is against the law to do so. Worst company ever."
bad,"At the time I was working for this company, management was absolutely under educated and lacking communication skills"
bad,"Their is a lot of favoritism at this company and it's not equal or fair employee opportunity. I worked there for almost a year and never received my raise that I was supposed to get after probation. After talking with management on several occasions about when I would get it, I came to the conclusion that they just weren't going to  give it to me. Management is lazy and does not motivate the team. The hardest part of this job was dealing with the work drama, lack of hours and disrespect from the upper management to the employees. I learned that Coca Cola is not the company for me. The most enjoyable part of the job was some of the people that I was able to work with."
bad,"I wish I could give no stars to this worthless company.  Unless you have no other option please stay away, trust me it will be the best decision you'll ever make."
bad,"Atendimento ao consumidor, com dificuldades normais a lidar, discriminar detalhadamente toda ligação, muitas ligaçães diárias, os colegas de trabalho, alguns com facilidade a convivência, outros não.  Supervisores e gerentes agradáveis durante o período do trabalho"
bad,"At coca-cola the only cool thing about the job are the people you work with. There was not much work life balance, depending on the time of the year. You could work 6 hour days or 15 hour days. The merchandiser supervisors always tried to help out any way that they could, but the company's corporate structure kept them from doing more for them. Good thing I got out because I was about to graduate from school. For those still doing it, get out as soon as you can!"
bad,"Long work days, management careless, machines break down a lot"
bad,"i didnt like it working here at all"
bad,if you want to be a slave go ahead and work for coca-cola. if you don't want to get paid for hard work you should work for Coke
bad,i was a four hook forklift operator pulling orders and staking them away to pull more and put away not letting the line catch up to u
bad,"Typical sales daily routine"
bad,All i kept hearing from supervisors was your job is going to be the worst job you've had. Who wants to hear that!?
bad,Bad no respect they  have on love for a temp.Cant move up as a temp dead end job
bad,"IT stays current with the business and changing trends."
bad,Work you like dogs and too much of a turn around in workers a new person comes in each day and people quit everyday. Not a stable job and the supervisor treat you like slaves
bad,"Only bring in contract workers. With Possibility of hire. Which takes up to 2yrs because they will continue to renew your contract vs hiring you. Pay is low, no benefits although working 40+ hrs. Will ask you to work OT over and OT. But if you need time off they don't even try to work with you. Schedule bids so you change schedules when you 1st start till about the first 8 months of being there every other month and then about every 2 -3 months. You can go from a 7:30a-4p to working 2:30p-11p in the drop of a dime so now life balance and they don't worry what life issues or children you have. Managers always take time off and are usually always in meetings so never there to assist. They never help out on the phones when calls get backed up and have asked workers to work through lunches. After being hired perm. it's nice you can work from home and pay increases about $3-4 more per hr but will take about 2 months after being hired to and then you go to the bottom of the barrel with no seniority!"
bad,"It took forever to be able to advance in this company.  "
bad,Teriible hours and poor management.I did receive my pallet jack certification there.
bad,not worth it.  they'll work you to death and pay you nothing for it.
bad,"Working right throu if all machines are good."
bad,"Cooler Data Capture"
bad,Family life suffered trmndous loss during my employment. Had to find a career that would compliment the love that I have for my family.
bad,Just know as soon as you clock in that you're going to be here for at least 12 hours. Management threatens with points even if you work for over 12 hours. No chance of advancement. The turnover rate is very high in this place and management does not care about your well being. No life because you are there from 4pm to finish (about 4:30am) everyday and when you're home you want to sleep and on your days off you just want to rest as well to come back and do it all over again.
bad,"Pay is decent but you are expendable. You are expected to eat, sleep, and breathe Coca Cola. Say goodbye to your personal life. If you can avoid at all costs."
bad,it was very good inviroment to work in I got more experience.I also lean more about how to deal with people
bad,"Non stop work, horrible pay, no consideration for employees, all equipment is defective, no life at all, not worth it.... Horrible company to work for...  Coca cola in hollywood, fl.....Don't waste your time!!!!!"
bad,coca cola has been the worst company i have ever worked for...im hoping in the future to find better and more job stability.
bad,got hired on 6 months later laid off. not recommended . no pay!!!!
bad,"The job itself was challenging at times, but we had a great team and got the job done."
bad,"WORK independently, maybe once a week, one store minimum"
bad,A typical day is hard I have learned a lot the management are horrible it's a lot of drug usage going on at that place they need to do random drops ASAP  the co workers are okay the hardest part is just working with them but the best part is not being there no more.
bad,"Needs better management, and A course for the supervisors, leads, and management on communication and how to talk to others"
bad,"10 to 12 hour work day;"
bad,typical work day for new hires can be considered asinine  the supervisors expect you to fully comprehend the flow of things in minutes. Mind you throwing you to the wolves is a bad idea especially for money invested in new hires. For all shifts there are at least two supervisors there for part time you can not ask for extra hours and they often change your schedule. Nothing is consistent their the workers complain about how they hate it there and all the lazy ones are high fiving and butt slapping eachother and management. Bullying tactics and forms of intimidation are present and for the hourly wage they pay you is not worth the job. For all the guys who work their now please reconsider your future as the company can drop you at any time(at will) For the ones with families if you do not spend time with your families you will lose out. This company does not deserve to make us so tired we never are awake to be with our young or loved ones. The experience I had their was ok and thankful for the opportunity but unless your single and can adjust to the culture there then be my guest and apply.
bad,"They got alot to figure out. Pay to work ratio is way off. Its a job, but you can't support a family with it. Other places pay close to same but have a smaller workload."
bad,They have no respect for their employees and will often make you work 15 hour days 6 am to 9 pm and come back the next morning to do it again.
bad,"this location on alsip,il is the worst... they want to have you merchandising all day for what they pay its not worth with no o.t .. and got the worst merchandising management ever !!! regret working for this company"
bad,"Pay is not adequate for living expenses in Tampa.  Tampa Tribune cited this in a feature article about the Coca-Cola Refreshments National Customer Care Center.  Many workers must work more than one job to make basic ends meet.  If you are caught with foreign product at your desk, you can be fired.  This type of workplace rule is a violation of civil rights for any employee.    "
bad,12 hour plus days with no overtime or benefits. No consideration for attending school. When hours were needed to attain a living wage none were offered
bad,worked graveyard shift too many politics if they don't like you they would find ways of getting rid of you if you like being a temp for more than 3 years then this is your place but getting permanent is far from possible
bad,This job is back breaking and you have to make production carrying heavy crates of sodas. the manager on cares for his self.
bad,That place has good people aside from what you do. For one the truck are grade A garbage. Tractor and trailer meaning no ac no speed old as the 80s. Trailers are slow going up and down they smell like human waste. Your route will be 500 to 600 case or more day. With NOOOOOOOO help you will work 14hr a day. Other people will quit before you end your training just so they can load you down.  I don't want you to believe me go work there and find out yourself.
bad,- Contractbreuk
bad,Travel 50 miles per day and make no money for start point to end.
bad,Excellent pay and benefits. Job security is excellent. Work life balance is good. Overall rating of company is high.
bad,stocking 6 stores a day in 3 different towns. no coworkers to help. standard shift 7-7.
bad,"Fast pace, Diverse Company, but Senior and Middle Management does not treat employee's with integrity. The company that everyone wanted to work at is no longer that type of company. Now they have problem filling position due to low pay, poor benefits, and poor management."
bad,no advancement opp.

bad,Better know someone in the company in order to move forward in a career
bad,"Stay away. "
bad,"A classic over-managed American corporation. Management resides in an Ivory Tower upstairs and dictates to lowly subordinates clad in red/black polyester attire downstairs. "
bad,"Avoid this company at all costs. They do not value employees at all and management sucks. It is a sinking ship for sure. "
bad,"Management only cares about production and won't allow you to grow as an employee.  Untrained supervisors that only care about making management happy.  Definitely a place where employees are treated as numbers and not as humans.  Long work hours due to shortage of people wanting to work here. No promotion potential,  only responsibility potential for no recognition.   And also during my 2 years here I only received a 50 cent's raise."
bad,"If you like getting paid $10 an hour to fold clothes, sale overpriced merchandise and perform magic tricks for spoiled kids then this job is perfect for you. Once they get you in the door they make it seem like you have alot of options to grow. But that is a lie. Once the holiday season is over your hours will be reduced to coming in one to three days a week without notice. Not worth the headache or time."
bad,For it to be a billion dollar company it doesn’t pay well. Also management is horrible. They don’t really train you properly. I wouldn’t recommend anyone to go here.
bad,"Not a great place to work"
bad,"Supervisor is very contradicting, rude, sexist, threatening with her red Coca-Cola bat that she refers to on her wall if you don’t follow orders, forcefully insisting on relocation, definitely NOT a company to work for if you have a family."
bad,"In shipping Dept there is no training at all , people expect you to just get in there and do it all with no problems and if you do then you might get walked out my suggestion find somewhere else to work especially if you have a family and want to spend time with them the days you are off you have to sleep"
bad,"Worst place I've ever worked in my life, horrible pay bad management. I've never worked for a company that is ok with discrimination and actively practices using it. I refuse to work for a company that does so."
bad,Trabajad mas de 10 horas y no si quiera te pagan horas extras
bad,Been there 2 yrs management has changed more times than changing my socks. They desciminate on age. Upper management doesn't know what to do. They set you up to fail. They expect you to do 800 cases a day with 16 stops and don't expect you to bring anything back. Pay is decent but if you want to get hurt this isn't the place. Short term disability is a joke. Was off didn't get paid a dime.
bad,Do not work here... Seriously theres a manager there with red hair named JOHN he is awful and treats all new hires horribly... He needs to be fired. Also the numbers are impossible to hit! This job is terrible wouldnt even recommend it to a homeless man
bad,Management is clueless about what goes on in the trade. They sit at a desk and demand more while they do little to nothing. Years ago they used to hire with in no drivers are in a dead end job
bad,"Stressful place to work!! Management constantly walks around trying to write people up for any reason. Management is dishonest Human resources is worse they lie and try to terminate everyone."
bad,"Company was averaging a 70% turnover rate at one point they finally did a pay increase to stop the bleeding but they don't give annual increases or bonuses so your locked in for life. There's no formal training, horrible gas/mileage polices for in the field employees, and no incentives to be a better employee."
bad,"Sueldos malos, y pesimo ambiente laboral. Envidia y mala onda en todo momento por compañeros de trabajo."
bad,When I appled they said I had 6 weeks of training but when it came to acutal training class it was 2 weeks big diffrence there. not to mention management team doesn't know what's going half of the time with the different bootlers always giving us misinformation. all they care about is you making sales making them money they don't care about what you feeling when it comes to dealing with customers I wasn't a Inside Sales agent it was more of a complaint dept all calls i got was people complaning about the bootler yelled out and cussed at all the time. the management team doesn't understand that all they want to do is suck up to the bottlers that are in charge of them. Their computer systems always faling on us always crashing at least 1-2 a week you have no room to breathe when it comes to taking calls its back to back none stop. people there are two face and sneaky when it comes to management be careful about speaking out again the bottlers they will try to get rid of you.
bad,"Management catastrophique. Évolution impossible en rapport avec la qualité du travail mais possible si copinage avec le management."
bad,Its not a happy place to work at none of the managers or supervisor likeneach other so it makes it worst for people and also because of that peopple start hating and fighting with eachnother
bad,"Sucks. basically your drive In your car A lot of miles from store to store. When your at the store the employees there are upset with you, only mistakes are pointed out, good service not appreciated. Coca-cola gives you a sales goal that is not achievable."
bad,"You are always on the edge of your seat wondering if you are going to be impacted by the next round of layoffs. Coca-Cola Refreshments does not value the employees, but the dollar signs and increased stock value."
bad,Not a place I would recommend to work. The management screws you over every chance they get. There is always something more than you can do instead of looking at the positive things you have done
bad,work too many hours your personal life is nonexistent. very fast paced must be able multi task. not compensated fairly for the amount of hours put into the job.
bad,"Terrible equipment,  the use of battery powered forklifts and the amount they are used in a single day you would constantly swapping batteries all night."
bad,The hours were too long with to much forced overtime. Several months working 15 plus days without a day off. The job was 12 hour shifts on your feet the entire time.
bad,"Management focuses on weaknesses rather than strengths.  Your numbers can be great, but if you don't conform you will be cast out. There are some good people, but there are a few that will black ball you if given the opportunity."
bad,The job was very simple and easy but pay was low and you never had time off for family. Also they send me 1 hour away to work when i told them why cant I be treated fairly like all other employees who work within the area they live. And you have to use your personal car.
bad,Management and salespeople do not care about anyone but themselves. The only time you hear from them is when you do something wrong. Which is all the time. No one can ever do anything right.  No home time. You are scheduled to start at 5 am and they make the routes so big you aren't getting home until 5-6 pm. You have no control on how to run your route. The manager who has never ran a route before in his life decides how to route it for you. DO NOT WORK HERE!!!!!!
bad,This company is being ran into the ground. The only good thing this company has to offer is a 401k plan. The company is constantly restructuring. They hire based off of ethnicity or referrals not who is fit for the job. The job itself is great. There are challenges but if you like sales it is fun. Dealing with the company and having to run around for tours to make stores look above and beyond what they actually look like and then go back the next day to take everyhting down is extreamy waistful for company productivity.
bad,No training or help with job expectations.  Did not find this a nice place to work. No feedback from supervisors. Fellow workers not friendly or willing to help either.
bad,"My day started at 7am and ended at 5pm or later.I had customer list to follow. I inventoried accts.,ordered product,rotated product,and presented new products and promotions. The mgmt.  was as all young and advancement driven,but my fellow acct. mgrs. were all good people.The hardest part of the job was the quotas and the pressure to reach them.The best part was my customers and the good people i met."
bad,"very deficit job, with no benefits and not good pay. management team don't communicate to their staff members.  supervisor do not care about his team, only focus on getting a daily number. very very poor place to work and terrible work environment."
bad,You never know what to expect or hours your going to work on any work day. The hardest part of the job is the fact that management is very lacking.
bad,"I have been at coke over 10 years and out of all the management here, this is just the most horriblest management team I have ever seen.  No respect for employees"
bad,There is ZERO work life balance and no room to excel to new roles.  it is a very stressful work place I have been apart of 3 company lay offs
bad,the  worst management ever they all tell u different things to do.back stabbers they work u to death then lay u off.one word the company sucks !!!! drink pepsi its better anyway.
bad,i have nothing good to say about the Abilene area coke. i do not recommend working here at all. but some of the people were nice.
bad,"You'll learn to love 14+ hour days or leave them. You'll utilize your one 16 hour day every week. The hours to pay ratio gets down to near 14/hr. This job is lifting, lugging and more lifting. It is not worth the beating your body takes for that wage. Benefits are average at best. Coca cola, being a multi billion dollar operation, falls way short of expectations. They have decent eguipment, but the tractors are filthy. No housekeeping skills applied in the fleet. I left here very disappointed."
bad,"Was there over 12 years as a merchandiser/reset person they pay ok ,but after you reach a certain pay level they will cut your hours ,or in my situation I was making over 50,000 yr. they phase out your department or position,make you reapply for the same position with a different name and less money,15,000 less in my case,and they bring back the department a year later and hire people in at a way lower pay rate,so overall ,I would avoid them ,especially now they are going threw some major changes with CCE (coca cola enterprises)being bought out by CCR coca cola refreshment),and jobs will be deleted and benefits revised,normally not for the good.My advice is find something else."
bad,Low seniority members are treated as slaves. There is no regularity to the schedule. The management is incompetent and highly unqualified. There is no opportunity for advancement.
bad,"This used to be a good company to work for but it gets progressively worse each year. Minimal yearly raises and shrinking payrolls are the effect of management wanting to increase profits at all costs. This company makes insane amounts of profits each year, but it all goes to the top; absolutely nothing for the little guy. They want you to work harder for less money. Adding more insult to injury, the same position at Pepsi starts out at $3 more an hour.  The only way to get a decent paycheck is to work five plus hours of OT, which used to be plentiful year-round, but is getting much harder to come by."
bad,"The operations and plant manager beat up on employers for 20 to 35 minutes on minor issues...even going off topic...and call it development. The Ops manager doesn't speak english well and misguides and misdirects employees, who can barely understand him...and then throws them under the buss."
bad,"Management is not qualified to lead employees. Culture of bullying and intimidation to motivate employees is demoralizing. Very little chance for advancement. Discrimination is rampant and almost encouraged. Absolutely no work/life balance. The pay is surprisingly low for the tremendous amount of work required. Fundamental systems such as merchandising, delivery and warehouse are broken. The hardest part of this job is having to accept responsibility and blame for elements that are beyond your control. Most employees are looking to leave because the culture is so toxic and fearful. This job actually is blue collar, requiring a lot of manual labor."
bad,"No room for advancement, unless you are a favorite or family. Management listens to nothing you have to say, very close minded. No room for error, you MUST be perfect or be wrote up."
bad,"They tell you its customer service call center but they actually have you selling and you get nothing out of it, if you dont make their goals. The quality moniters are a total joke, the benefits suck, its a revolving door there. They dont care about the customers only the dollar bill. There is no resolution, only sale sale sale.."
bad,outdated equipment and lies about things changing from management. Pay is really bad compare it to any other job doing similar tasks and they rank at the bottom. The good thing is they have a good program to help you to obtain you cdl if you do not already have them.
bad,This was the worst job I ever had. I would never recommend anyone to ever work for this terrible greedy company. They do not care about the merchandisers or their families. I don't even drink coke anymore because of my horrible experiance.
bad,"The job is hard enough, but senior management makes it more difficult by tying your hands and bogging you down with busy work rather than allowing you time with your people. some truly great people work here who are just burnt out and tired of the way things run."
bad,"I interviewed twice with this company in the space of one year - once for a production position in Richmond, BC, and another (for which I was hired) as a seasonal order picker at the distribution center in Montreal, QC. The hiring was done via a phone interview with the head office in Toronto, ON, and an in-person meeting with one of the warehouse supervisors. I had done the same process for the job in Richmond, only without being retained. What stood out at that particular engagement was the way the hiring manager referred to his habit of ""booting out"" temporary workers that, for one reason or another, didn't meet his requirements (namely obtaining a ""boiler ticket"" - the reason for which was never clearly elaborated upon); and that they met with many candidates for my positions, and so I shouldn't get my hopes up. He also made me wait for 20 minutes past the appointment time in the lobby. Generally very unprofessional and corporate in diction/demeanor."
bad,"the mood is really down around the warehouse most employees feel that they are being forced out since the new supervisor came in. I used to like going to work there but now its like i gotta get a check so i go, but no job should feel like that, u should enjoy where u be for 40 hours out the week.my co-workers are great people with big personalities. the hardest part of the job for me is dealing with management and the different rules that are added each week."
bad,Over baring mgt. hard to maintain a normal life after work. 12-14 hour days and not enough money to make it worth it.
bad,"Managers scream obscenities at employees when they are displeased. They will make you work 12 hour shifts, 7 days per week for 4 weeks straight. Even if you meet your goals they will take volume from other plants and make you work OT for free on salary. No flexibility and absolutely no work life balance."
bad,Management does not care about employees safety or distress of overworked individuals. Mandatory overtime 6 days a week with one day off from a 72 hour week is overkill to employees well being.
bad,"Read the top stars "
bad,"Don't do it!! my son works as a merchandiser and I've never seen him so stressed  like I do now, this job should be a 2 man job for sure, u work too many hour and don't get paid overtime all stores want to get serviced first so they call ur boss and complain about u, u could be busting ur a** & they still complain,  if u try to get everything done ur taking too long & if u take short cuts ur not doing ur job"
bad,The way this company is ran now is a shame. I use to love coming to work the people was great. Now the management these is totally bull and present a slave like culture
bad,"The typical day was busy, always learned something new about mechanical breakdowns. management was not so honest. Most of the culture around was acceptable. hardest part of the job was listen and follow mismanaged departments. Most enjoyable part of the job was leaving work."
bad,Management was very poor. Pay was poor. And the communication to the merchandisers to the sales rep or the team lead was poor. Very poor company and I will never recommend Coca Cola to anyone.
bad,Union was there but broken. The company does not care about anything but profits and the people running and driving the circus are only worried about one thing Self profit and personal gain into the corporate infrastructure..
bad,"You're going to work 14 hr days, any time after 8 hours is over time but its only paid at $8 hr instead of $22 like its supposed to be paid. They pay for your miles to your car but its monthly"
bad,Are you single? No kids? No life? Then have at it. Management really pushy. Equipment was a joke. Everything broken in some fashion or on the verge of breaking down.
bad,This company only cares about the bottom line.  They do not care about employees nor do the care about customers.  This company made many promises that went unfulfilled to both employees and customers.
bad,"Management feel like they can talk to you any kind of way they,don't have no respect for employees. They don't like the pay people they just want to use employees the best way they can"
bad,Over worked with no extra help. Poor Management. Severe stress with No relief. Gave me high blood pressure that will never go away. I still have nightmares about working there. Made promises...Not kept. Would never go back and will never recomend.
bad,Do not apply here You will regret it. You will be grossly underpaid.Its a sweat shop. You will get in trouble for using the bathroom Horrible management. Blink the wrong way and you'll get fired. You don't work for Coca-Cola you would work for the Bottlers. Even the bottlers are dropping our services. Even the bottlers don't see a value in the work we do so they have fired us one by one.
bad,"Micro Management "
bad,"Salary is given very late, almost around 10-14th."
bad,This is not a Monday- Friday 8 to 5 job. They will work you to death blame you for everything that happens . You will have no home life. Run run fast and hard. This place sucks . I work here now and search for a job every day.
bad,The company stole 4 hours from me and never worked to give them back and told me did it really matter. They also talk down to you like your a child and never listen to what you have to say
bad,"The only benefit this job has is freedom. We are paid less than competitors, even being the biggest corp., in the world. average .25 cents raise per year, nontraditional interview process. Uneven work load between workers. Unreasonable expectations along with judgement and little to know praise for a job well done. NOT RECOMMENDED!"
bad,Theres no communication at this job they never promote within the company always hite outside of the company they give horrible raises make you do other jobs that is not in the description the bear suit ways 85lbs and is very uncomfortable an they dont care if your in pain
bad,"I'm was the only black person to work in the front office of coke. There was a couple whom.was married to other people, whom.always started with me. And then they began to mess with everyone, and the  manager or Human Resource Manager never dis anything. All they would say ignore them.they are childish, remind you they are 55 and up. Its sad that this is still.going on today."
bad,"Hostile work environment, nasty petty backstabbers, wont talk to your face including management, I missed work because my Mother was on her death bed, so I was let go 2 days before Christmas."
bad,company is not good if your are hispanic. descrimination. and working in a hostile inviroment. supervisor not giving you help and always living work to sales rep. to do it. always not good do to lasy people and not help you. always try a way to get rid of pleople if you dont agry with them. my work was always take care of my costumer and make them happy. but to many boses that want to deal with custumer. and we are the ones to put our faces to manager of the stores .
bad,"Most managers were not capable. Very little to no experience in supervision and or management positions. Too many rules, i.e. I am diabetic, therefore needed restroom breaks, I was penalized for these breaks when no one else was. I was penalized for coming back from lunch, two minutes early."
bad,Great benefits poor pay good work environment good people a lot of hours worked not enough pay hard physical work great job if had more money for employees
bad,"You are just another body. Injury rate here is very high. You will work all holidays and weekends. Cant get good working equipment to do your job, You will never see your family"
bad,Takes away any life you have had or want to have. Merchandising was great but the company does not care about their drivers and want you to work 12+ hour days
bad,"Worked as a order taker for the Mom and pop convenience stores when they would call in their soft drink orders for delivery.  manager was a twenty something, and wouldn't allow me to enlarge the print on their order sheets from a 9 pt to a larger font for reading purposes.  Told me to buy corrective eye glasses.  Their dispensing machines kept malfunctioning, taking the money but not dispensing the product. This was in their Steeles ave in Brampton location.  Hated it."
bad,"No training, managers are not leaders.  They do not take the time to teach you or show you how things are done. No overtime approved, favoritism on who gets promoted."
bad,"Lousy starting wage....seasonal work, no benefits until you become a ""regular"" employee, but first you need to advance to ""temporary"" status....which may or may not happen for a long time. Favoritism, never praise employee for good work, only for mistakes while you're learning. Weak union, and seniority union busting and selling out future hires."
bad,"You never know when your getting off and for the pay its not worth it."
bad,Coca-Cola had poor leadership during my tenure at the company.  Individuals lacked educational qualifications that would be mandatory for similar positions at other companies.  Management also did not communicate truthfully with employees which created an environment of distrust.
bad,"Not a good time to work here.  Things constantly change never for the benefit of the employee.  The company is constantly looking to cut wages and benefits.  If you are in the warehouse or union employee you are nothing but a number.  No accountablity for management for human rights violations.    You will work for years as a temp before being hired full time, if they do hire you.  They will"
bad,"The branch manager is a joke. Doesn't have a clue and is disliked by all employees. If you are not a ""yes man"" you will definitely never be able to advance in this company.  Example being, there are people there that have been on routes for 15 plus years without advancement."
bad,the company itself is not a bad company to work for depending on the position you work. the wear house is very fast paced and non supportive. management lack in communication and support to the ware house workers.
bad,"Interviewed for a sales position and one of the manager attending would not stop watching tv above my head in the deli area of HEB. Although I have held that position before and one even higher, I was asked repeatedly if I was sure I could handle it."
bad,The Coca-Cola company is the worst company I've ever worked for. The company treat you like you need them. They treat you like a # not a human. The managers pick favorites. They pick who can or cant break the rules. The management is awful.
bad,"The atmosphere is very cut-throat...lots of backstabbing....trying to get into a new higher paid position is next to impossible if you are good at what you are currently doing. "
bad,"Coca-Cola has a goal of making 80% of their workforce contract and not permanent. This combined with large scale offshoring means that there is a pervasive fear that the lights will be turned out at a moment's notice."
bad,"Pay is well below market for several non-union positions. No opportunity for advancement or increased income.  Gender biased, union environment.  Good environment for someone who just wants a basic job."
bad,"Typically nt a good place to work when you are not respected and recognized your hard work. There is no training or walk through when you join, but you have to know everything before hand, which is not professional. Team lead and Manager do macro management. Employees are not treated with respect."
bad,The entire leadership team is garbage. They are a bunch of crooks who would bleed you or any integrity just to fabricate a bottom line. It is the messiest environment you'll ever experience
bad,"promotions are based on how much you are liked by certain members of management, not on your ability to perform the job. this also affects whether or not you will be able to get a normal day shift. longevity and loyalty mean nothing."
bad,It could have been a good place to work.  I Needed a full time job with benefits.  The company has many and  good product.  It is would have good benefits for a full time worker.
bad,"New owners took over and management leaves a lot to be desired. New managers have wrongfully Fired drivers as well as supervisors. They play favorites and rules are not equally enforced among all drivers. You have to constantly watch your back, and the hard workers get rewarded with more work while the slackers continue to slack."
bad,this was an okay place to work. typical warehouse work with long hours and hard work. I enjoyed putting in a hard days work for a good pay rate. overall not a bad place to work.
bad,Worked there for 7years and was fired becouse of a manager mistake they even admitted ti the Union they made a mistake but the company did nothing ti fix it horrible company where u can't advance unless u know someone personally in upper management
bad,"to work here, is just having a job. don't look forward to much, just long hours. there were no real benefits to working here, unless you are a full time employee. Even then, the difference is next to nothing."
bad,"I typical day revolved around picking orders for multiple grocery store chains, and wrapping up the pallets and loading them on to the trucks. Their was not much to learn in regards to skills other than I learned I am able to work consistent 12 to 14 hour days on a daily basis. Management was rough on the workers with an insane 100% work quota that had to be met on a daily basis. If you were to for instance drop a pallet or had to re-wrap one you would not be able to hit your numbers. This resulted in many unnecessary injuries my fellow employees sustained by working too fast and putting themselves and the ones around them in danger. Honestly I can not see any enjoyable part of this job other than the Paycheck thanks to being in the union."
bad,management is clueless and awful long hours and no appreciation for  any of the work you do. you sometimes have to do your salesmans and supervisores job for them
bad,It is not what I expected it would be. Really long hours and other workers do not do what they are supposed to do. The work itself is really easy and I like that you do not have to stay in one location all day.
bad,Never have a worked with a company that's so unorganized. For it to be Cola Coca I thought this place would be the idea job. Long hours poor pay. They complain when your sick or tired from the next day of working 12+ hours. 6 days a week 12+ hours. One shift pulling all the weight. Poor management poor training and no chance of advancing to a better job. This is all at the Hollywood warehouse. I wouldn't suggest anyone to work here unless you have a need to see a doctor.
bad,pues llegar contar el producto lavado de unidad  y salir temprano ya con la carga lista para empezar a repartir en en las tiendas
bad,Good job people were fun to be around. Lots to learn very busy building pallets gotta be consistent with production over all can be a fun place to work with the right people.
bad,"Been working here 4year management didnt treat employee right, stock to your position for a long time and no chance of being permanent full time management give you false hope. Lot of partime guys still waiting to get full time but no hope. Pension no good benefit nothing!management force you to  work like a full time but paid as a part time."
bad,"I thought I really wanted to work with Coca-Cola but they have very little regard for minorities from their management structure to their advertising.  For it to be HR, they were very inappropriate during training and their videos regarding race and nationality. 30 minute lunches to choke your food down, they monitored how many times you went to the bathroom, and the ""lifers"" had no idea how wrong the atmosphere was because this was all they ever knew. Of those in the training class that were true HR professionals, they were out of the company within 2-3 months.  Big mistake but I guess everything happens for a reason."
bad,"No opportunity available for growth. Compensation package is extremely low due to supplemented incentive package. However, Incentive program removed."
bad,It's all smoke and mirrors. Once you are doing the job it never lives up to what you would expect a billion dollar company to be.
bad,"There is always something to be done, so there is work, overtime is mandatory. So you will keep busy.  District manger ""We rater hire from outside the company than promote form within. It is cheaper and easier because you don't have to train"". There is no future there and constant turnover. The place is ALWAYS short staffed and patched together. Training is a non existent, management violates labor and dot laws.  Will not accommodate for any reason, even medical. Anybody that upsets the status quo is shoved out, even when acting like an owner and fixing a broken system that costs the company thousands per facility. It is a place where favorites are played and nobody stays unless they have to. and everyone is treated like dirt form senior management and the good old boys."
bad,management doesn't treat employees well..  if something goes wrong they don't communicate--they just ignore you.  A typical day is driving a delivery truck and delivering pop to stores. I learned that coke has a big image but poor relations with people. People are just a number. The only good part of the job was meeting customers but the customers didn't like the way coke treated them either..Stay away from this totally poorly run company.. Most of their equipment is from 1998.. One might have thought that coke might be more current than that.

bad,"As a merchandiser you start between 3 Am and 5AM, I can only speak about Rancho location but the sales reps and merchandiser supervisors are not good  here the reps don't know how to order and you get yelled at for it at store levels, the supervisor don't know what they are doing.they call you at 11pm sometimes to tell you about the next day you start at 3AM what's that about? Very un origanized for being coke, your route usually has 3 to 4 stores sounds good but you are never done even if you finish early you go help out til about 4 or 5 daily nothin early, honeslty for the how psychical the work is the pary isn't good."
bad,"when I applied for the job the recruiter said This is a summer relief position that would last at least 6 months."
bad,"This job consists of long hours, this job teaches a person that no matter how bad your day is you can make the best of a best situtation."
bad,Can't say anything good about night shift management at the Auburndale plant. You go in as a temp and maybe get hired on. As a temp you are held to a much higher standard then the actual Coke employees. If you go to work here make sure you've got a back up plan so when they fire you with it warning you're prepared.
bad,"	Manually lift and move product to restock and repack ensuring date code accuracy and proper rotation"
bad,"I was lied to from the get go.  Promised a sales route 20 minutes from my home, and pay starting in the low 40's with room for negotiating.  Accepted the job and was assigned a route 60 minutes away and base pay of 40k. Zero room for negotiating. "
bad,The day changed by the minute.  I did aquire full Merchandising experience.  Union contract negotiations.  Time was never enough to get what neeeded to be done so you had to become skillful at prioritizing daily goals.  Sense of accomplishment when you corrected an issue a customer may have had.
bad,"Where do I begin?? The Account managers are the salesman of the company and are the face of the company. Meanwhile the drivers and merchandisers are union employees and are trained to not listen to the account managers and constantly use their ""union card"" so they can do less work. For instance if u place an order the driver would take his sweet time delivering it and then u have to hope that the merchandiser shows up to pack it out. And if they don't,  it's your fault and guess what? Cause of the union you cannot touch the product. So nobody wins and the customer suffers. The DSM uses his team to make himself look good and never provides you with bonus updates so you can actually make some money. A daily conference call that wastes about 20-30 min of your morning which is sent to you in an email anyway. Then a weekly Tuesday meeting repeating everything for a 3rd or 4th time. Horrible training on handheld computers which they just expect you to know and if you don't learn on your own management won't help, they will just dump it on a fellow employee. If a fellow employee is on vacation you're told to run his route as well. The DSM is responsible for that but he will put it on you. The DSM spends the whole day in the branch checking his email and calling you 5-10 times a day about issues that you cannot resolve without his help. Also if a merchandiser does not do his job you're asked to become a private investigator and take pictures of the merchandisers and drivers poor work. Which created friction with fellow employee since  you're trying to get each other in trouble instead"
bad,"No placement, management team was poorly ran. Management didn't care if you were sick or if the roads were iced over, you had to work even though they sit home."
bad,"learned time keeping is inportant, how too operate a drinks machine with safety"
bad,"The sale managers Were ok but upper management seemed uptight as expected. For a company that rakes in millions you would think that they could afford to pay a decent wage, a typical day would be walking around a store for 4 to 6 miles inside the stores stocking shelves and displays. The people I worked with were fun but seemed stressed all the time. The hardest part of the job was constantly organizing messed up pallets of product and dealing with contant overstock. Coming to work at 5 AM gets old when you gets split days off and have to work very hard for 9.50 an hour. Pepsi pays their employees much better, you will regret doing this kind of work for low pay when you see guys for pepsi making almost  twice as much as you do for doing the same exact thing. Supervisors do not care about work life balance and expect you to work grueling hours at their conveinace , I took the job because it was part time and was working another full time job but coke did not seem to care about my other schedule. Thank god I found another job because being a coke merchandiser is a nightmare come true."
bad,"12-14 hour days"
bad,A empresa não da oportunidade trabalhei 2 anos e não tiver oportunidade não aprendi nada a gerência escolhe mal os linde. os colegas de trabalhos são legal não tiver dificuldade 
bad,The management was only concerned with production numbers. They would run their people till they droped. If safety or cleanliness concerns were brought up you were ignored.
bad,I found it a great disappointment to not be able to advance in such a well known company. They do not believe it complying to guidelines or ethical standards. I truly wish could give them a better review.
bad,"Everyone there was constantly afraid of losing their job.  I lived in fear everyday.  Everyone there knows that if you ever get injured or slightly hurt and miss work even with FMLA, they will fire you right after.  You are a number, a commodity nothing more.  My boss was a woman who constantly reminded everyone that she was in charge.  She said that to her employees were like batteries and once used up they were no good to her.  She yelled at me all the time.  Once a package fell off a truck and landed on my foot and she called me a sissy when I winced from the pain.    It was a very bad place to work and even thought they fired me and contested my unemployment and gave me bad references I'm still glad I left there.  They kept my last check which they said was to teach me a lesson but they make you sign paperwork that says you cannot sue them no matter they do to you.  Think strong and long and hard about working here."
bad,Management in this location is giving based on the friendships you have outside of work not based on experience. I was let go after 10 years with no reason giving the warehouse manager doesn’t know what he is doing he’s never there for his department he only worries about where he and the other managers are going out to drink. His answer to everything is to throw bodies at it.
bad,This is the worst company I've ever worked for. I worked there for 18 years going through buyout after buyout and it got worse every year and that's why I quit. I wouldn't recommend anyone with a family work this company because you won't see them!
bad,"Poor management"
bad,Systematic racism and sexism. Made to feel like you were less than a person. Do your research and look at the amount of lawsuits this company has. Would never recommend.
bad,It's hard to work with cocacola company due to management to heading the pressure of work place and duties is not good place to work with my experience of hospitality
bad,Always a huge workload with unrealistic expectations. Almost impossible to juggle work and home life while merchandising. Little to no compensation for OT.
bad,"Arbarta Coca-Cola was not good. They had management issues all the time. No one was happy with company. Mileage did not even cover gas. Drove 40,000 miles in 10 months. Got about 400-500 a month in rembursment for vehicle.  Benefits were expensive.  Always working in fear of job. "
bad,Structure of route was terrible too much driving was always picked on and no support from management. The have there favorite people whom they support
bad,"Most days it seems like this job couldn't possibly be worse. Coke has a seemingly unlimited amount of product, yet you're expected to work all of it yourself. There's nothing more crushing than walking into the backroom of a store on a truck day and seeing 8 pallets or more, sometimes 11-14, and no promise of help. You're expected to move at a super fast pace, making it even more stressful. Would never recommend this job to anyone. Ever. You would think that Coke would be the best conpany you can work for, but you get paid less than Pepsi and Fritolay even though you do three tines the work and work much linger hours. I once worked for 18 hours straight and was still expected to work the next day like it didn't happen. Stay as far away from this job as you can."
bad,"You are replaceable, don’t get too comfortable and you always have to be on guard you feel as if you constantly have to reassure yourself of the work you do, and the culture is surrounding the managers is that they are untouchable and you are easily replaced"
bad,This place has a revolving door for all management positions! They treat everyone like trash. If you are part of the workforce/union you will get away with murder. Anyone else beware!! Managers are not qualified enough or have enough experience to make basic decisions. There is heavy favoritism and high-school level gossip mongering within management. Food safety is a joke here which makes life extremely difficult for honest workers who care about quality and food safety.
bad,The most depressing place I have worked and i worked for a mortician in the baby division. If I were to do it again I would be a merchandiser. You work alone.
bad,"I hated this job, worked here for 9 months,  never worked less than 12 hours, worked 21-23 hours in a day on multiple occasions, then had to turn around and be right back at scheduled time.  Hours were sooo bad."
bad,Don't ever work for Coke. Bad environment. Long hours. Expect you to be a miracle worker in 8 hours but you always end up working more than that. They were never fully staffed. Had to pick up stores on a daily basis.
bad,"There was not a good way of managing hours as the department was understaffed. That being said, days worked were incredibly inconsistent and sometime we would only know if we were working a 12 hour shift 12 hours before we needed to show up. Poorly managed department of quality."
bad,"Worked hard, never late to work or lunch yet never had any positive feedback. Always willing to work late and on weekends- management never recognized the effort. Job relocation was announced with two weeks notice. Couldn’t get HR to extend the date and I was let go since I could not be at the new location. No severance- no insurance benefits - nothing"
bad,"I was a maintenance supervisor in a unionized facility.  This means, I had all of the responsibility to ensure equipment ran optimally, with none of the authority to do so."
bad,"Great place to work if you are making 6 figures.  If not, you are a just a cog in the wheel that can be replaced for someone who is trying to get their feet wet for less pay."
bad,"The worst place I have ever worked in my life, as for respect for its workers. The drivers and warehouse makes the company the money not there useless discriminating management! Management is horrible and treat you like a number and are very disrespectful to the workers, if you have any self respect or pride for your self please stay away! Very unelical and very unorganized place. It would run better with just the workers, no managers!!!  If your looking for being a AZ driver there? Move along  you can do better!!"
bad,"I was an employee who left and I  haven’t been happier.  They work you like a slave, then pretend you did not hurt yourself at work.  Engineered labor standards are a joke. Voice pick system is a joke and causes errors that you get punished for. Night shift gets the brunt of the work and the highest engineered labor standards to achieve.  Discipline is handed out on an almost daily basis. Definitely once a week, you are “reviewed” and followed to make sure you are achieving optimal numbers.  No quality, just quantity.  While others who know how to kiss up to the bosses, stand around and gossip about the people actually doing the work.  Toxic environment, and blind management.  Actually had an employee scream at me in front of supervisor who did nothing.  Would not recommend working there unless you have skin so thick a nail couldn’t penetrate.  Can’t believe I stayed so long.  I recommend you read a few of the reviews before you apply because you could be wasting time working for a company that does not deserve good employees. Revolving door of employees and management."
bad,"Management is beyond rude, plays favoritism to older permanent employees. Talks badly about employees to other employees, hinders you from taking other job opportunities within the company. Pay is not that great"
bad,"Manager is waiting to retire, completely checked out and allowing a profitable business to collapse around him. Warehouse is undersized and filthy, not up to food storage standards. Inadequately staffed so be prepared to work overtime 6 days a week. Also, Warehouse Manager is ""Culturally Insensitive""."
bad,"Very big company that doesn't give a hoot about the little guy. Over worked and under paid. 6 days a week , they try to force 7, and Long never ending days."
bad,"Since I started I have been lied to about about everything including being thrown under the bus by superiors with lies to place them on a pedestal. They even managed to get my start date wrong."
bad,you get burned out and barley have time for your family. The company does not care about the workers only profit. The union sucks and doesn't go to bat for the workers.
bad,Easy place to work except for the people were not motivated and slow at getting things done. Too many hours for the amount of work we had to do usually 12-16 hours a day.
bad,"Managers have no clue what's going on, very bad culture, revolving door, turnover rate is horrible people constantly leave wouldn't recommend. Salary is bad"
bad,"The management is very poor, the people don't care about their jobs mainly because of the management. There's no ""atta boy"" when you do well and meet your goals, all you get is written up when you do poorly. Favoritism plays a major role in my department. There's somewhat of a ""teachers pet"" and it creates a hostile environment for the rest of us, plus it doesn't help my supervisor is racist. Company shafts you on hours and pay check vary with the same exact hour amount week to week (exp. 40.28 hours is $500 one week, next would be 40.28 hours is $480). It's somewhat nerve wrecking knowing that they will literally fire you for anything, probably why the turnover rate is so extreme. The company as a whole may not be bad, but I would definitely recommend picking up human feces then starting a career here."
bad,"Management has or had 0 experience in Managing anyone, Everyone that was hired either knew someone and got a ""hookup"" "
bad,If you do not fit in with the clique run by the DSM's then you do not have any chance.  My newly promoted DSM made advancements that were denied so fired me.

bad,Management an the supervisors really didn't give me a chance or give me the proper training it was other employes  who did it was a good experience but i would pass personally on working there again.
bad,"forced overtime 12 to 16 hours with little lead time. if you have a family dont apply unless you dont care for them because you wont see them due to work load. money is good but all money isn't good if you cant enjoy it. the high standards for cases an hour is crazy, and they waive it in your face if you cant keep your numbers high"
bad,"This company is a joke... to put it politely.  No such thing as a summer vacation. They treat there employees like dogs, unless your a salesperson. They will tell you you will work a 4 10hr days per week. I was there for 4 years. Never, ever, ever saw a 4 day week. They make you work 6 days.The equipment is awful. 70 breakdowns in 6 weeks... it sucks.only good thing about this place is the employees, and the pay is decent. Other than that it's a joke. Choka Cola"
bad,Do not agree with the culture here.are about Outsourcing and saving money is all they c
bad,"Uma empresa boa para trabalhar , porem a desvalorização do profissional é desmotivadora , contrata-se e demite-se todos os dias , sem segurança de crescimento na carreira proposta. Fui demitido apos sofrer um acidente de moto, tive que fazer uma cirurgia no joelho e fiquei afastado por 90 dias apos a volta ao trabalho depois de um mês o medico indicou recolocação de cargo pois não poderia trabalhar com moto mais , devido ao joelho, e ai o meu gerente não me recolocou e me demitiu. Apesar de ter me destacado no cargo que exercia não fui valorizado no momento que precisei , a concorrência ao cargo la dentro é bastante grande."
bad,You get management that have no experience in the department they are assigned.  They seem to thrive on the revolving door policy.  Ship in the employees and get rid of them on a regular basis or force them to quit.  Stay away and you will be happy you did.  Lucky thing COKE sells itself or CCR would be out of business in our area.  Very bad local reputation.  Best part of the job was interacting with the poor workers who did a fine job but dealt with ineptitude from management.
bad,"A typical day as an Account Developer is going to about 15-20 accounts, rotating product filling shelves and ordering for the store.  You usually have at least one meeting a week that lasts two hours and eats up a good part of your day.  That meeting is also where the upper management can tell you how bad you are doing and threaten to fire you if you dont get better.  I was never given any training, business cards, and it took a year for the company to even spell my name correctly.  The Sales Director has no sales experience and has no clue what he is doing so he just yells at everybody and threatens to fire them.  He spends his days resetting stores and not in the field with the salespeople helping them get better.  You typically will work about 11-12 hours a day and still not even come close to completing what you need to.  Avoid working here unless you enjoy torturing yourself."
bad,Após a troca de presidência se tornou uma empresa péssima de se trabalhar.
bad,"Worked as a part time merchandiser and the work is extremely labor intensive which was not illustrated during interview Also, communication is very poor at headquarters and was sent on various routes on different weeks. This job is not for everyone."
bad,"This company doesn't know if they are coming or going. I was actually bullied into resigning. Because my boss was not able to handle the situation he had to make it look as if I could not handle my job when in fact HE could not handle his job. He bullied two of my employees in to quitting and then couldn’t figure out why the job wasn't getting done. I had to run two full routes (The two employees my boss bullied in to quitting) in addition to my regular job duties. Because my boss had no idea of how to run the department I was in he simply let the wheels come off and blamed me. I contacted HR and was ignored, I also told other upper management about the issues and they also ignored my issues. They have far too few employees to run the business and the good ones quit due to this reason. I worked a hard 15 years at this company and this is how they treat you. I have 3 other employees who can tell you the same story. One was there a lot longer than I and the two drivers who were bullied into leaving. It is a shame to have worked so hard to get where I did with nothing but success for 15 years until the bully boss came along. He still works there and from the contact I still have nothing has changed, I still have never received a call from HR. If this is the kind of company you would like to work for more power to you."
bad,The management is a JOKE!!!!!! They expect you to work 12+ hours per day with NO overtime pay. Pay is OK but not for what they want you to do. The union contract is set up so you dont stay long.
bad,Poorly ran company with no safety mesures in place for the physical labor involved.
bad,"Never would I have imagined the Brand I grew up loving so much would treat their employees so unjustly. even after the entire market unit was terminated only months into my career I was still shocked 10 years later when they once again had mass layoffs and started with the most senior sales associates. In a Unionized State to watch all the Drivers, Merchandisers and Warehouse employees that had job security while we were all sitting ducks was just sad."
bad,"Supervision is horrible at best horrendous.  Management is in over their heads. Bo accountability for anyone in the company just like to point fingers. For my daughters birthday weekend couldnt spend time with her or my family and friends for her 1st and 2and birthday because managment was more worried"
bad,"3months then kick u out the door, they worked us so hard that even our loifts could not charge in time for the next shiftto use, then a hour before getting off then would be like oop we are working 16 today boys,, lol. no thx"
bad,too much micro management . no communication between management and staff on the floor. toxic environment to work at. management treats employees like garbage
bad,"This is honestly the worst place i have ever worked. you are talked down to by customers and management does nothing about it. management also tells you that particular rolls at a customers location is not your job but when sales reps call manager . all of a sudden, now it is your job. all of them are Liars and very Dishonest."
bad,Lots of work unloading the entire truck before you come back to the shop very demanding and physical gob have to deal with bad attitude receivers who don’t want you there and you have to put everything on the shelf
bad,"It is a huge burden to be responsible for stocking and building displays of Powerade with several outlet chains frequently promoting .44 cent sales way too often.  Once a year,   Winco Foods has a large promotion in the produce department using up an entire row built with each flavor in pallets and it is exactly like working out at L.A. Fitness when merchandising, plus in the backroom is like going another fitness fitness and repeating the same strenuous workout without any breaks in between in the same day.  Plus the receiver wants us to stack up high as possible to eliminate space in the backroom and that includes way above your shoulder.  We as Merchandisers don't get paid $1.50 an hour more for stocking Powerade when Pepsi and Kalil don't have to and their rate of pay is about $1.50 to $2.00 more per hour.  Even if Swire Coca-Cola raised the rate of pay for this purpose, no job should have any employees burning 2,875 calories per day plus pulling the pallets on top of that."
bad,"All work and no life. With no end in sight. Felt like a number and the management was giving two different wants and needs. Always striving to perform my best for the company, but in return asked to do more and more. Was given very little support and constantly being moved around and never able to grow a strong culture with a team. Most work days were 12 to 16 hours, 6 to 7 days a week."
bad,"Management does not work with team members to resolve issues , always a problem if you don’t fit in , looking for ways to get you out , bunch of  males acting like females in there"
bad,People work there for years and they lay them off  and it’s a union job they don’t protect your job the shop keepers don’t fight for you if you get written up it’s a mad house there
bad,"job was fast paced, though i didn't mind too much. hours were long but manageable. pay was nice. Eventually hurt my back from the fast paced work combined with the weight of the product being moved. was fired when i called in unable to get out of bed for the job."
bad,"Working at the Coca Cola Company, was very organized at the beginning, but than the management became horrible & the pay became even worse and the pay wasn’t satisfying at all."
bad,"Company is slow paced,  doesn't train adequately,  difficult to advance, great work hours, but not a long term job that will ever allow you to earn $75,000 +"
bad,When the new management came in Human Resources came you can see the way it was going To go they worked to closely  they would only go after the people of Mexican decent we were the only ones getting in trouble plus they had a lot company snitches working for them it was cut throat in the warehouse
bad,The manager of the drivers was nothing short of a bully. She openly beleived and expressed that the drivers were incompetent. Annual raises sucked. Stay away
bad,"It is a “good old boy system” it’s about who you know, there are people in positions that are made up and it hurt them tremendously when they were bought out."
bad,"I have not worked at a place more filled with drama/clique culture than Coca Cola Richmond. Started work as a seasonal then became temp the next season. Experienced hostility from fellow co-workers, and was berated a couple of times for requesting lost hours by full time staff. "
bad,sometimes things works out and sometimes they dont. when things were good they were great but the bosses tend to change on a monthly bases and thats too often for comfort for me
bad,upper management doesn't care about the backbone and the faces of the company! they are only looking out for nothing more then their own pockets. management will boost your ego higher then normal just to keep their pockets occupied. 0verwwork their truck drivers and warehouse workers! they have no concern for you and your life outside of work.
bad,"Coca-Cola Refreshments has been bought out by Atlantic Bottlers  so this review is pretty much moot."
bad,"Unless you are seriously desperate, I suggest looking elsewhere. Not sure about anywhere else but the Reading, Pa. facility is an absolute joke. In the time I was there while a wave of new employees were always coming in and out, there was always one constant, management. If you enjoy having to work at 125mph 12 hours a day..then sign yourself right on up. Drivers get slaved, warehouse workers get slaved, merchandisers get slaved, I promise you. You dont want any parts of this place. The pay will never add up to the amount of time and effort you put in."
bad,"I can say I learned a lot in regards to time management and how to deal with extreme protocols.  I don't want to sound bitter when I talk about Coke, but its hard.  I do feel there's a ton of opportunity for those willing to commit their life to selling this product.  You will also meet a lot of really cool people along the way.  On the flip side, your home life will suffer under this regime.  "
bad,If you have experience they will overlook you applied two times got the interview which is always two people I know I can stock anybody can plus I live 2 mins walking distance but they over look me
bad,Leadership makes all the decisions and are very inconsistent. Then are not accountable but wants you to be.. Great Brand but poor organization with no structure..You don't have a voice and if you ask questions your are indirectly retaliated against! I love what I do and I am the best at it but it's not rewarding when Managemet is horrible.
bad,"Awful place to work. Management is a joke and has ridiculous expectations, you're driven into the ground day in and out with little rest or time to recover, your hours are immediately cut if you start slowing down due to injuries accumulated from the work."
bad,the worst place to work in Philadelphia. its a big nasty machine that only cares about numbers and not drivers. You will work 12 hours everyday and anything less is rare. you have to make about 20 stops a day driving all over the city.
bad,It's only good if you become full-time and you have to kiss but to get that management  is very dishonest only way  you can get anything if your one of there  favorites  if you're not Hispanic or white  expect to get nothing out of this company but kicked in the behind
bad,Long hours bad pay management is terrible. They allow people to walk out multiple times and still habe a job . No room for advancement
bad,"Management is horrible. Now they are hiring people just because they know someone who know someone."
bad,"the leads are not good at the job the make the day longer the supervisor don't look out for you unless they like you or you suck up there professionalism is horrible, there isn't really any way to progress as a order builder even if your efficiently and continuously making your numbers you get to meet fun and interesting people and that's the only good part of the job talking getting to know the people you work with"
bad,"computers and software way out dated, Extremely slow internet while in the office for updating your computer weekly at a speed test of .02x.01  Everyone looked out for ones self and did not help each other on the same teams out.   Protected areas so no conflict there.  Every night was still doing work from home in bed.  Did like the people I worked with but the processes made it horrible.  software did not communicate so you had to go all over to find out status of orders, and then some went to a black hole to never be found.  Customers stayed up set.  NOT the job for me."
bad,"Pay is good but management is terrible, Management don't care about their employees at all. 12-16 hour shifts with short breaks"
bad,"no life working there.. our hours were 11 am until...sometimes we didnt leave until 2-4 am during the winter and then back at 11 am. only got 2 breaks a day, a regular break, and lunch. terrible machines, management just watches you work, no safety values or practices. summertime you can be prepared to work as many at 17-hour days."
bad,"you start day at specified time, but cannot leave until work is done.  most of the time you work 12-16hr mandatory shifts with very little break. people either quit or get fired all the time."
bad,"revisar que todo este en orden, tener una buena  seguridad en la empresa, carretera Apatzingán- Nueva Italia, colegas entregarnos los turnos con una buena orden, y seguridad dentro del misma empresa, lo mas difícil del trabajo tener la responsabilidad de que nada se pierda dentro de la empresa, lo que mas me gusto es tener una buena responsabilidad y cuidar todas las unidades de la misma empresa como todos los productos de ella misma."
bad,Excellent pay and benefits.  Hard work but it is worth it.  Superior is horrible.  They are like a high school.  Dishonest company.  I will never work for them again and would not refer anyone
bad,É  bem  interessante  o ramo de promotor de vendas pena  que  foi por  pouco tempo a parte mais  complicada  do emprego era que os repositores de um mercado  dificultavam o nosso  trabalho  ocupando nossa area  reservada  o intereesante era o contato com as pessoas
bad,Pay was good but you work a lot of days and hours and you weren't sure what days you will have off. Management was the worst I have ever worked with. They will harass you till you quit or do something to get you fired. They were more concerned for production numbers rather than safety or quality. Bad gossip culture that you can't avoid.
bad,The worst place I Have ever encountered. Poor management who know absolutely nothing and are the most vindictive people I ever encountered. The other employees are some of the worst people you will ever meet who will stab you in the back any chance they get. Drug use and illegal activity is an every day occurrence from regular employees all the way through management. Expect no gratitude for anything you do and expect to be abused day in and day out.
bad,"Worst job i ever had. Very disorganized, they won't pay you for the amount of work you do. It's a backbreaking job with too many deliveries and lots of driving here in little rock. They start you at $100 a day and work you long for at least 13hrs. Old trucks with no power, bad transmission, no AC, and at times no trucks. Lots of favoritism going on here too.For being Coca Cola you would think it was managed well, and they would provide you with Good working trucks. Don't waste your time working for Coca Cola here in Little Rock Bad Company."
bad,horrible place to work my supervisor was so lazy and i never seen him to see how well i was doing. no raises lowsey pay
bad,"forced overtime almost everyday, swing shift with no time to see your family, your never home, they go against union policy, always getting shorted time on your check just enough that you don't notice so they don't have to pay into your retirement for the week. trying to get the union out so they can terminate everyone to get lower wage workers in the warehouse"
bad,"I was not comfortable spending all of my work hours apolagizing for late deliveries or constant customer complaints, not happy with the way coca cola handles it's clients."
bad,Trying to get in the union at Coke was an eye opening experience. Your forced overtime 16 hour day consists of building pallets of product for shipment to local stores. Its also a cases per hour type of job. Breaks are short for the length of time you are constantly running to make your quota. Its a very physically demanding job. Say goodbye to your life and family. if you are single and no kids you might like it.But be perpared for the HOSTILE union work environment. its and us against them mentality there. Its my overall most hated job but the money was great.
bad,"As a 20 plus year employee (now former) it was a joy going to work everyday. Everything became progressively worse starting in early 2000s and still getting bad. Good employees let go or left off the promotional ladder. Incompetent employees put in positions they have no business being in. In short, despite awful management, the product sells it self...if it were any other brand they would have been out of business long ago."
bad,Big company that shows very little value to employees. No loyalty or help to get current employees to advance to better paying positions.
bad,You work hard all day and dont have time to take a break. You never have a set schedule and they wait to call you in the morning to tell you the time to be at work. You put alot of wear and tear on your own car and you are tired even on your off days.
bad,"I worked here for 15 yrs AND definitely learned to look the other way on ALOT!! "
bad,"Minimum advancement possibilities, as soon a position is open it already has a name. Terrible management, in 3 years working there the boss of my boss never  gave me not even a Hi. Terrible system since never improve. Salary just ok. They talk about safe firts an never give not even a training for it. So is better than nothing, just a huge name but a poor company."
bad,"Let me get one thing out of the way about Coca Cola, it was a decent company before swire and my new boss took over, working for coke was fun at times but full of backstabbing and childish behavior, I was promised certain days off and I did not get those days even being close to the top with seniority, I worked long hours and still was expected more, I was blackmailed before cut from the bottom and was almost terminated for falsely accusations the first time around I could’ve sued but I enjoyed working for Coke for the meantime, I had one slip up and it cost me my job, no write up or verbal just a termination, I advise most people looking to get involved with merchandising especially Coca Cola and expect to get good money, make some good buddies but stay away from management they are not their for you. They will bully you and tell you what you want to hear and make you do their bidding. Like I said I worked long hours and did w.e it took to keep people happy but it ended up with a termination. Don’t trust swire good luck. Pay is nice and insurance was good. That is all."
bad,Poor management in the merchandising area.The manager at the time would almost never respond to concerns. NO benefits for part time employees. They say they are inclusive but they are really not.
bad,"Expectation upon expectation. New task upon new task. There is not enough (paid) time in a day to achieve what is asked, while also trying to do your job and sell. Employee perks are continually being taken away leaving no room for incentive to stay. HR and disability departments are awful. No one knows correct information and would let claims expire if not followed up on. Care for employees is lacking in many areas. Salary and bonus is not enough to make up for the amount of stress endured on a daily basis."
bad,It used to be a fun place to work with a postive atmosphere. The new management that came into place created a very hostile environment which lowered employee moral
bad,"results and achievements mean nothing to the company, once you achieve an equatable salary and do well in the bonus structure, they find a way  ie: restructuring, they will re engineer the roots and mandate you to a lesser paying job"
bad,"This company does not care about the ""little people"". The management overall is absolutely awful. I would never recommend to anyone that they should work here."
bad,My job was to do cold calling business. to have coca-cola installed. Help current customer. Management was hard to understand from time to time. Other employees were nice and helpful.
bad,"I had high expectations for this company when i joined ... "
bad,"weekly pay extremly low no overtime,overtime only for senior mechanic guy, co worker so selfish, them senior guy wont work as a team ,they only stand around 12 hours not doing nothing watch you working..realy bad management."
bad,"Managers push subordinate dog-fight and serve self interests in the name of growth and ownership. Schedule, processes, and reporting overweight real work."
bad,"I was not trained properly and more or less thrown to the wolves, struggling to get things right. The warehouse could not properly palletize product, resulting in a lot of damaged product. If brought to managements attention, they hold it against you as a poor driver. Management would tell you to call them, for authorization, prior to returning to the shop, but would not answer their phones, no matter how many times you called."
bad,people in upper management don't care about the employees below them and the life balance of said employees outside of work
bad,"10 to 15 hour work days, I learned on my own how to handle most situations. The hardest part of this job is not getting trained properly and being expected to know it all."
bad,"Disappointing to see over 15 years of a successful facility, and it's staff, being systematically dismantled by territory refranchising"
bad,"Under staffed and under equipped meant overworked employees. Every night was over time, anywhere from 12 to 16 hour shifts mandatory."
bad,If you enjoy having no life because you work 12+hrs everyday. Then this is perfect for you. The management team is a joke. Unable to do anything right. Supervisors are more interested in their Facebook account then their employees. New voice command system is very annoying and hard to deal with. Isn't easy to reach company expectations of 100% efficiency. If you can't get to 100%. Then you'll never get a full-time job.
bad,i worked for coca cola for a long time. in the begging it was pretty decent. the only thing management hardly spent money on buying parts for the equipment. now we got new management and things are a lot worst. the new managers/supervisors are coming from kraft. they don't know anything. they run the equipment none stop. so there is no time to work on the equipment. the only people held accountable are the mechanics. you're pretty much doing the operators job because the supervisor is calling for every single little problem. there is no structure anymore. also don't count on the union to help you.
bad,"Long days, arguing with line operators. No one knows what their job is. no one cares. Management is terrible, people in places that have no business being in management. Maintenance coworkers are all pretty cool. One woman in maintenance, has no business being in maintenance. The hardest part of the job is putting up with all the complaining about what a rotten place this is to work. Most enjoyable part of the job is going home."
bad,buen trabajo solo que la mafia que hay en la agencia de la piedad no te dejan trabajar agusto porque te roban mucho con las cargas que te ponen de mas.
bad,tem que ter equilibrio em tudo e o sufiente.com os horarios e etc.
bad,Disappointed that after 12 years of dedicated service to the company and it's customers they let me go when my body stated to have medical issue's. I was tossed aside like an old vending machine that had outlived my usefulness.
bad,Coke has went to a structure where they work you 24/7 365 days a year. I had a stroke due to the stress of my job back in April and had only one of my bosses check in on me. There are a lot of promises said and a fraction of those promises are actually true. If you like having an emergency Dr's hours then this is the place for you to work. If you have an amazing family and dont want to ruin that relationship you have then I would suggest to stay away. Im not judging I am only being honest.
bad,It was really bad we use to them work to finish the work and then when we dint have anything to do and we were asking what to do they were like go and do something else but never specific what we need to do is pretty bad management
bad,"This company had unfair expectations for there employess.  They provided a workload that was unreasonable and dangerous.  I learned that a company like Coca-Cola doesnt care about the amployess as much as you would think.  The Management, I would say 60%, did not care nor want to care about the well being of the employess.  The workplace was very diverse. The hardest part about the job was dealing with all the unfair politics.  The only good that came from the job was a few good friends and the driving experience.  Other than that, this company is terrible to work for."
bad,"I would never want to work for Coca Cola again! Management is very rude, and hardly ever did his job. He would assign mandatory overtime, and never show up to run the machines, so we were running everything ourselves. It so much overtime that you never get any time to be with your family."
bad,"No Advancement"
bad,"Good company, but horrible management. They did eventually fired a manager, however, should select management based on qualification and not Nepotism. Hopefully they learned they're lesson."
bad,Company dosent care about workers only margins matter. Laid off hundreds of employees recently. Managers cant manage due to owners controlling all aspects of the company
bad,"Worked with this company for over two years. every week the message changed from management. employees were treated like garbage. In my two years at a location that had 15 employees working, 12 people left, 4 quitting on the spot and 2 were forced out by management because they spoke up when things happening were unethical and discriminatory. Huge company that is probably great elsewhere, but TERRIBLE management in St. Johns, Newfoundland, Canada"
bad,"False promises"
bad,Não tenho experiência mais tenho esforço para aprender
bad,"Every day presented a new set of achievements, so it was refreshing and challenging."
bad,Many of the employees have been working for the company for 20+ years. Lack of innovation and motivation to change. People are so excited to say they work for Coca-Cola they are willing to back stab to move forward. I've never experienced such a circus of CYA. If you are motivated to introduce fresh ideas and really grow the organization be prepared to stakeholder your presentation to everyone person you can imagine. By the time you complete the stakeholdering process your not even motivated to execute. It's amazing this company has lasted this long. People are so fearful to be associated with something to risky or out of the box that they create barriers to success. This is not a place for young professionals that like to push the envelope and have a proven track record of success.
bad,"Maintains product in store racks, shelves, displays, and coolers. Transport product between backroom and display floor with manual equipment. Manages backroom by organizing and consolidating backstock."
bad,Great workplace and place to grow.  Place to display your leadership skills and lead others to help achieve company and professional goals.  We honor God in all that we do.
bad,they start at i think it was 18 an hour and you dont go to 25 an hour until after a year. They only have enough work to work you 2-3 days a week so your paychecks are tiny.
bad,"coke is an okay place to work, if you put your foot down with the company and you will have no issue with work life . other then that place is ideal place"
bad,I'm all for hard work but this place is hard on your body. Long hours. Driver/Merchandiser. Paid by piece delivered. Pay structure sucks. Where I worked they couldn't keep drivers So their always hiring and wishing you would stay.
bad,"empresa era ótima na época de Bebidas Ipiranga e após ser vendida para o grupo Andina ficou péssima, salário diminuiu sem motivo e sem explicação concreta, comissão deste tipo e complementos de salário desonesta, aumento de convênio e outros cortes de benefícios, não indico para ninguém."
bad,I sit in Atlanta but manage merchandising results for Memphis/Little Rock and Louisiana Market Units to delivery quality customer service while reducing waste in our systems and processes.
bad,"The job is easy. You put pop on wood, then on a truck, then deliver it to a customer. Not saving any lives here. The employees are a challenge at times but that's because the upper management and HR are so out of touch with how a proper support structure works. Strong and malicious unions are a direct result of poor management. If you don't crack the ole boys club they will sell you down the river over and over. They,(the managers) are all recycled through the ranks over and over. The top brass executives say the right things but as it filters down the ranks it's not even close to being aligned with the companies policies. Work anywhere but Brampton unless you like being blamed for everything because the useless managers that are recycled, and because, it will cost to much to get rid of them. plus the absolute blatant nepotism is your thing go for it. Hey at least they will pay you good. I was, and many more will be tricked by big red, I had such high hopes for working there for the rest of my life. But remember this review when you think about how the majority of your days go. Good Luck. I could go on for days but most are going to think I'm just a disgruntled former employee so I will let you figure it out yourself."
bad,"Management does not know how to communicate with employees, leads by fear and intimadation. Co-workers were great, this was a great team held together by a thread we helped each other thur the day. This location has lost 3 small store acct mgrs in the past 4 months that speaks volumns. Hardest part of job is dealing with a negative, not knowing how to properly commuinicate, non-motivational dsm. Most enjoyable Fellow employees and customers."
bad,"Coca-Cola looks like a great company to work for on paper, but if you value balancing your life and work, this is not a job for you. The management was some of the worst I’ve ever seen. The supervisor would typically give himself 2 to 3 days off every week while the rest of us were working 6 days a week. There were multiple occasions where I worked a 16 hour shift with no breaks as well. The only good thing about this job was the pay and benefits."
bad,"They have a no phone policy, no Bluetooth, headset or electronics whatsoever. Camera picked up me with my phone in my hand, trying to put on navigation. I got written up and the second time it was an emergency, I was told my 4 year old jumped out my second floor window and  guess camera caught me picking up da phone and they fired me and I feel like they could of looked over that emergency situation but they ddont care about your children just Coca Cola."
bad,"Or else, Don’t give it.  Because it not fair to the older employees that the new hire exceeds them in pay , upon entrance.  On top of that,  you’re required to train the new people.  Isn’t that ironic.!! "
bad,"I worked for several componys in my life time but after working for coke a cola refreshment in apopka fl, I could'nt believe that people making as much money (min $15 per hour) as they did could act like such children! I guess that's what has come of the southern worker,poor me..."
bad,"indifferent, politics low pay grade, typical work day, learned every large name company is not about advancement only about the politics and distribution of the the low pay grade workers."
bad,"Weld truck parts was always the same thing it was pretty hard ,but had to be done day day the job did not pay good for the work and WELDING i was doing for them it was very tuff and had to get use to cause had to work very close by the next worker,"
bad,The advantage of change is new computer programs and updated technology.  The disadvantage is reapplying for your job.  They like to go through a department and change the job title so everyone has to reapply for the job.
bad,"Work environment is terrible, supervisor A.L. has brought down the morale here, I hate coming to work. Long hours, no teamwork, or thanks for job well done. No chance of advancement. All incentives taken way, commission cut. Stay clear of bulk side and red truck side."
bad,It's take you 3 months before you cleared to drive also the equipment is very bad always breaking management sucks the pay sucks this a bad place to work for they care bout no one the only thing they care bout is the soda long hours no OT
bad,"The days were very busy from the beginning till the end. I learn to use a fork lift an a walking staking .The management  was ok, mi co-workers all was good an professional people the hardest part of the job unloading big palette in a broke dock finish my day without problems in all."
bad,"Management doesn't know how to do their job. Don't care if you break your back. They hire people who don't have any people skills. Too much favoritism. You build pallets then get yelled at because your not working fast enough. But you can't do your job because you need a forklift to get the product you need. You get on a forklift and get told to get off because you don't have enough senority. But your certified to use the equipment. You tell the supvisior the stocker is not around. Nothings done about it."
bad,the mangers were always truthful but the people i worked with were ok
bad,Great compensation/benefits. Unique company culture. Lots of opportunity for advancement.
bad,They don't care for the employee they don't try to help you. You get to work at 530am and don't get off till 830 pm management there is very terrible jus care about gettin the product out no family time
bad,they dont like very many people. the work is tollerable. and you just keep too your self and do your work.
bad,Shop checker mean check bottle fridge and coke metrial thanks  plz take a chance for job we need job urgently coke company is very good and also help workers or people’s
bad,"Long hours  "
bad,"Everyday is a push day for me , I love the culture but the opportunity behind it is not fair,the hardest part being at coka cola is motivating other to success"
bad,"good pay"
bad,Company doesn't care about employees and pays a low salary to its employees. Better off to go work for Pepsi and have a company that actually cares about you.
bad,Not worth it. Seek employment somewhere else. The stress and lack of bonuses is not worth it. Company ask for a lot but in return they will micromanage you day in and day out
bad,Praca przez agencje pracy w Islandii to bardzo zły pomysł! Nie polecam!! Po odliczeniu wszystkich opłat już nie wiele zostaje a życie w Islandii jest kosmicznie drogie!!
bad,Lots of favoritism. If you don’t want to be apart of a certain group the supervisors treat you like you don’t mean anything . If you work hard they treat you unfairly . They appreciate the people that do the bare minimum
bad,awful atmosphere but if you can take the mistreatment then its not too bad. poor treatment. lots of forced overtime. terribly lazy union. overall its a terrible place to worl but the pay and beneifts are good.
bad,"Company staff behavior is very bad, all asm nonsense, account department not coprait with salesman, vehicle is in bad condition, in every condition they forced to selsman, allover I waist my time in CO. I sujestud to everyone don't waist your time in Coca-Cola,"
bad,You see the name and think that it's a great place to work but this company is so disorganized and management is so incompetent that you wonder how they stay in business. They may have good benefits but I wasn't even making enough to afford the benefits and that 14 cent raise was just a slap in the face. So go ahead and work at your own risk but don't say I didn't warn you.
bad,"Great company to work for. Team operates like one big family, helping out each, supporting and empowering each other. Had it not been for the long commute, I would have loved to work here forever."
bad,"Coca cola company based on good behaviour,panctual on time and tranparancy in every things,every day gate meeting,time to time officers visit in market,"
bad,"Есть карьерный рост, но это не мое. Так как больше нравиться готовить"
bad,"Overworked, not compensated enough. No help. Work injuries happen often. There is nothing great about this company. the only fun things is the parties, and free beverages"
bad,When I got the job at Coca-Cola Refreshments i was a order Builder. I thought Coca-Cola would be one of the best places to ever work. My paycheck was always short the management was unprofessional
bad,The place is ran by workers who hate each other black are made to do the hardest jobs at the plant if your at temp you will  not get the job the drink is bad for any won to drink
bad,"ACCOUNT MANAGER"
bad,this was an ok job I just felt that my heart was somewhere other than with this company they kept changing managers like every 2 weeks it seemed like
bad,Cost cutting to show profits in a decreasing market.  Still chasing the  per-capita drinks to show growth.  Smart people with an uphill climb.
bad,"I been there for 5 yrs as a order builder and it seems as if it gets worse and worse.""Management"" and ""supervision"" are completely clueless.This company has broken every agreement in our bargaining agreement,they bulling as a way to get sh#$t done."
bad,"the first day in syrup room trying not to confuse how to transfer the rigth syrup to the rigth line. if you not sure of what to do always ask before you press the wrong button and cost the company. supportive management, everyone was open on sharing information at request. everything was interesting as a student - it was a great exposure for me, i enjoyed every part of my being there."
bad,My experience was not good..................I would never work for them again.
bad,It was ok. not much to say. The management wasn't the best but I made the best of it
bad,A typical work day would include working your butt off and barely getting paid for it
bad,This job doesn't even qualify to a lot of other trucking companies as experience. If you take this job you'll regret it. High turn over rate
bad,"I thought FedEx was the worst. I was very wrong. Full timers do not have a set time to get off. If you work 1st shift, you will do the bulk of the work. As a woman, it isn't woman friendly and there's no opportunity for growth if you begin in the warehouse. Management is horrible. The plant manager is awesome though. They don't care about the employees within the warehouse, only the work. Your schedule will change without notice. They posted my job because I turned in my two weeks but technically I'm still an employee. I am on vacation and I still have my badge. I still have until May 2 to retract my notice. I was forced to quit even though they threatened to let me go. If you see things going wrong and report it, they will find a way to get rid of you. I can go on and on but I believe you catch my drift. "
bad,i have experience of working in coca cola company. it's my pleasure
bad,it was fun in the beginning but as time passed on it began to get stressful and it was hard you had a certain amount of stores to get thru and had to be done in less then 10 hours.
bad,nothing bad to say..its a lot of work more than people realize it is..you get to meet a lot of people on a day to day schedule...its a lot of high expectation that comes with the job
bad,"I think it a very good company that has good strategic planning as most of the times targets are met, meaning the implementation of strategy to obtain desired goals is visible. and shows how much of an effort is being put in both by management and staff."
bad,"There are a constant influx of incoming calls that pertain to coke orders."
bad,Coca Cola Beverages Pakistan is good MNC (FMCG) in Pakistan & its openness & policy are very good.
bad,Tener mas experiencia como carretillero.
bad,"This company was good , but now with the new management is a headache to work there, nobody cares what happens to the people, the safety of the workers is not important."
bad,"Work life balance"
bad,- Sundays
bad,This was a good company with great benefits.I worked there for 13 years and it was very challenging and fast paced environment. The job is very secure as well there is always something to do.
bad,fine and ideal work place for any employe.really enjoy the time spent at coca cola.every one is very supportive and there are many  learning oppertunities.
bad,The company doesn’t give the production workers family time at all. The insurance they offer takes a big chunk of your pay and you have a large deductible to pay on top of the cost. Management be out living life on weekends while production workers are force to be working.
bad,I was a sales rep for a small division in a small town. Super pressure to make the bosses bonus! 70+hours a week for salary. Working all week to catch up on your sleep on the weekend. No time for family. One plus....I adored my store managers. And was sad for them when I was leaving.
bad,"During my time at coca-cola I was considered a better than average employee, but  it was my first experiece using a time clock and I had multipl infractions because I did not have my badge.  If you did not have your badge 3 times in a quarter, no matter what time you came to work you receieved a infraction which lead to probabation.  same if you clocked in10 minutes early of 5 minutes late.  This was very difficult for me and I maintained a time clock issue the whole time I worked in the bottling company.  This was an inflexible enviornment and I would not suggest this place for someone who may have dependants to take care of."
bad,"no work life balance with coca-coal, they made us work into the a.m till 3 am, most days, all you could do was go home and wake and go back to work.  it was tiring."
bad,Always wondering if I would be laid off on a daily basis.  No room for growth. Not place for me but could be great place for others.
bad,"In a typical day you have 10-19 customers to visit starting early and ending late.  You have to merchandize, inventory, and up sell your products.  I learned how to manage my day to reach company objectives and sales goals.  You have a clear line of management but do not expect support.  The hardest part of the job is being blamed for things out of your control along with verbal abuse from customers.  I enjoyed building close relationships with the majority of my customers."
bad,"Worked several years with the company in the management level.  Along the way was given many opportunities to work on several large projects only later to have them handed over to less experienced, non qualified personnel.  No juatification was given to me when questioning this changes.  There is no appreciation for years of service including management staff that had worked nearly 40+ Years with the company."
bad,Might have just been the location I worked at. I'm not one to take kindly to managers calling me out of my name during ore shift meeting and skulking us.
bad,Management very poor.  My supervisor has lied to write me up yet as well as he didn't try to advance me for promotion for his own selfish needs.   The ethics around this job as well as transparency procedure is very poor as well as it's a racial hostile work environment
bad,"The management was not friendly at all the cared nothing about your personal life and all the extra hours you were forced to work, they just ran out the door after their 8 hours.And the first shift manager was the worst of all of them! Not trained right when you start the job and as a general laborer in the bottle plant they lay you off every other month for a couple of years. I started my position the last week in February and was laid off all if march.When we were told that we would only be laid off 3 times a year turned into being laid off more than we worked! I just ended up going back to a competitor at least I knew what kind of BS they were about!"
bad,Management has no control over employees and needs to confirm with upper management for any decisions.  Vacation is hard to take for low seniority for they only allow a few people off per day.  Union makes it hard to work with others for employees are afraid of helping for it would change their job descriptions.  Lower seniority is bounced shift to shift to cover other crews.
bad,"5 day work week that turns to 6 when summer comes, or holidays. Your first day off is a waste due to the amount of hours worked and the physically of work. Managers are worthless. Accounts treat vendors(that’s your) like garbage. The harder you work, the more work you get."
bad,Management is more worried about their bonuses than long term stability. Mobility is more nepotism than ability based. Poor work is often times rewarded more than talent and ability
bad,The company franchised the part of the business. The territory was sold to independent bottlers. Most employees transitioned to the independent bottlers.
bad,Poor Management.  Constant pressure mostly due to poor communication.  High expectations with little incentive to do task at hand.  Demanding and no compassion.

bad,Seasonal employees are able to work overtime once qualified for a specific machine. Shifts are 10+ hours which is good. Hardest part of working there is wondering when they will let you go which will be done without warning.

Zero training, zero direction from Merchandising ""Supervisors"" they give you a Blackberry and an ID badge and you're off. The first month I had not 1 conversation with a supervisor! I was a brand new employee! Then I was to train with a ""supervisor"" we met at the first store...... 15 minutes later he was gone, never saw or spoke to him again. Bottom line if you do start with this company demand training demand someone to show you the ropes so you can perform your duties and become comfortable with your position."

bad,There were long hours and management was disconnected. The job was very labor intensive.
bad,"Well i can say that the job was a challenge for me, i was trained to do almost everything in the warehouse, which was a good experiance. the part i feel was unexceptable at coke was not knowing what time would you come in or get off. there wasn't any set schedule. the co-workers we're great but managment wasn't so great, they was just to busy to deal with any problems or situations we had. in other words if its not about numbers, don't even bother complaining with your issues."

bad,Way to much favoritism shown in the warehouse. They don't wanna let you advance out of the warehouse because it's hard for them to replace the workers in the warehouse.

bad,I have been working at ABI as production process controller.It was a temporary contract for the period of five months from 8 September 2013 to 20 January 2014.I was  assigned to move crate with naigrall machine
bad,Hours and schedule are unpredictable. Go to work super early and get home just in time to go to bed for the next work day. They lead you on and make you think you will get hired and use you up until the very last possible day when the union makes the company hire people in and then lay you off. This company is deceptive and a horrible place to work. I regret wasting 9 months of my time and declining other work opportunities thinking I would be full time as they kept telling me.
bad,No appreciation for extra  hours worked. Solely focused on the bottom line. Poor leadership. They set impossible sales goasl so that bonuses are unattainable.
bad,Besides the summer time months coca cola would have you working less then 30hrs a week on average. And they will have/keep you as part-time so they dont have to give you the benefits that a full-time employee would get.
bad,"Management needs HR training."
bad,"I learned an extensive amount about business, revenue, profit, margins, profit growth and how to accomplish it, how to grow a business in many aspects, how to manage inventory levels while growing profit for a business, and customer service."
bad,"No training program, No maintenance PM program, Run until it breaks. No parts in inventory. 80% or the operators have been with Coke for over 15 years with no other experience in a manufacturing environment, therefore they do not understand efficiency and productivity. Management does not hold employees accountable. Management has no concept of team building, Employee development or lean manufacturing principals. Allows operators to dictate schedule and efficiency. Poorest group of management I have ever experienced."
bad,I've learned all I can learn in the current position as an Inside Sales Account Manager.  The only option for advancement requires relocating to another state.
bad,"Poor management in the New Windsor NY branch. Account Managers are abused. Routes are extremely large and difficult to complete. Management is not supportive and does not communicate. Your only form of communication is being bombarded all day by phone text email of everything they want you to do so they can make their sales goal. The branch is a clique , many people who have worked with each other a long time and are friends so there are different rules for different people. Management often complains they can not make their unattainable sales goals ,they need to take a hard look at themselves instead of blaming the Account Managers. Horrible experience. As big of a company as coca cola is , their pay does not equal the workload and the benefits are not very good. No benefit to work here , not worth the headache."
bad,"Very unstable environment with layoffs annually. The company is struggling and it is clear the shareholders and financial analytics agree.  Work life balance does not exist, resources are allocated to the wrong areas, morale is horrible. Do, undo, redo...waste of time and money. Leadership should lead by example, very entitled mentality. Antiquated processes and procedures, tons of red tape, nothing gets accomplished."
bad,One of the most unhealthy work environments I have ever found myself in. The management was poor. Very hard to advance. We were over-worked while others were allowed to relax and live life.
bad,"Can't live on starting base pay, you have to work 8 to 10 hour of overtime to make ends meet. glass ceiling here is very visable from day 1,   Many resign after the first 5 weeks of training.  The turnover is way to high. The moral is low, and can be down right depressing."
bad,"Day at work"

Quick to get hired but quick to get fired by you're self saying I Quit!!!!!!! Co-workers are awesome but too busy them selves to help sorry you're on your own.
bad,"discover new places"
bad,I thought it was great until I was let go at the last minute. Management lets outside companies tell them how to run their inner workings and business.
bad,"typical day is the night before receive an email of your start time and where you will be working. drive your personal vehicle, .50 per mile compensation, to location and move product from backstock/delivery to store shelves/drop zones. not much contact with supervisor or coworkers other than text on work phones. VERY physical work with little compensation"
bad,"12-15 Hour days, consistent heavy lifting, little pay, the benefits hurt more than help, commission is invisible, management only pacifies you more than helping you."
bad,"excellent great work ethnic team players, help each other out ,dedicated and great benefits......................."
bad,"Being at work was okay. I learned how to be patient and tolerate different kinds of personalities. I didn't work in the same place as my co-workers,each of us were assigned a different place. The most enjoyable part was being in a place I was not familiar with so it was quite interesting for me. The hardest part of the job was having to sit alone and dealing with some difficult customers."
bad,"Regardless of what they say, or ""how much better it's getting"" you will work 60+ hour avg. week. after return filing can be as little as 45 hour week (minimum expectation). Manager is preoccupied with her own tasks, so planning is minimal. Sr. Manager pretty much the same. They try to make up for professional ""absence/aloofness"" with potlucks, cakes, cookies, candy, etc., but reality is more like slave labor camp. Work is somewhat interesting (many pieces to the return filing process), but seems overkill when considering the ""big picture.""  managers step over dollars to pick up pennies and are in denial about why people leave the tax team (""they're new, they want to be accountants, don't like tax, don't want to do the work,"" etc.). Real problem is the process to prepare the tax returns is irreparably broken and managers don't have time to consider sweeping new options (they will consider minimal process improvements, but are very adverse to change). Salaried positions: must wait 18 months to post out for another position (if available). The manager will be mad at you for abandoning the ""team"" when you do.  Only consider this dept if you are desperate for a job, can handle no work life balance, long hours, and manager's expectation that you will work as they do (from home, weekends, evenings, early mornings) to get every manual task done on time, regardless of the circumstances.  Other tax accountants are nice, but will always be a revolving door and managers will blame those who left for all problems.  there is no official comp time policy (all at manager's discretion & its"
bad,It's a finger pointing game working for Coca-Cola. If you have tenure you can do no wrong. It's all about putting numbers out no matter how it affects other departments.
bad,"nothing good to say,nothing good at all to say. they closed down and 10 people where laid off"
bad,"tough place to work if you are not in a management position. management is non union so they just try and get you to work harder and never tell you good job. 12 to 14 hour shifts everyday building pallets using vp software,"
bad,"Ok place to work if you're single. Your job becomes your life no free time to enjoy yourself away from work. The only way you make a decent paycheck is to work overtime and more overtime, but they will tell you that your working to much overtime."
bad,"senior management is absent (not physically), turnover is very high and it takes forever for them to backfill an open position thus causing the current employees to be completely overwhelmed."
bad,no dan utilidades y las gratificciones son bajas hay mucho abuso en el sueldo a los trabajadores y por ende no hay union

bad,"You would think working for Coke would be great! But it is terrible in Brampton, by far the worst I have ever worked for......"
bad,"By far the most un-organized place I have seen! The senior leadership is out of touch with what is going on and the poor hourly people take the brunt of it, I now understand why they need a Union. In my opinion if you currently have a job the grass is not greener here, expect long hours, verbal abuse and very little recognition for your efforts. I have seen very high turnover in the salary work force and the Corporation does nothing about it, even the HR team does not react to all the mis-treated people and their issues. Honestly I would not recommend this as a place to work unless you are desperate for work. The big red machine is turning many people Blue."
bad,The managers make this the worst place to work. All are fat lazy and will take credit for your ideas. They all talk about everybody else behind there back.
bad,The job is fairly easy and you will have a good check every week but working 16 hours a day sometimes is alot.  When I worked there the pay was around 10 bucks. I did everything they wanted but was never praised for good quality work.  The guys that have been there for years are set in their ways. And only want to advance their friends. They will drop you like a bad habit if they dont like you personally.
bad,"autonomie agréable"
bad,"A typical day at this job included drink pallets not secure by the warehouse so when you make it to your first stop expect to open your trailer to drinks everywhere. After you pick up the mess you have to down stack it again outside stores, roll it inside stores on a dolly, count it in, stock the customers coolers, take their old product and repeat for 15+ stops. Then you have 10+ pickup after that putting you at 16 hour work days getting paid chinese overtime is what they call it. Was definitely a learning experience."
bad,Under new management since I worked there. Can’t say if it is better or worse. Coca Cola is a huge corporation and you are pretty simply a statistic on their payroll.
bad,Been working for 3 months and still have no route. Everyone has a set schedule of 4 days a week. I work 5 days straight sometimes with only one day off. I work 16 hours a day with no help. Product is always falling because it’s poorly wrapped in the warehouse. I was promised a route and schedule after 8 weeks of training and nothing. We have no driver helpers and everyone quits within training. Yes you make good money but it is a very stressful place especially working 5 days with no designated route.
bad,"Poorly Managed. No promotion, no leadership. Workplace culture very poor. Hardest part of the job is no leadership. Best part of the job is the ability to work from home."

Bonuses have suffered, quality of insurance keeps degrading as the cost stays the same to you and overall pay for time worked is horrible. There is next to no job security. Everyday is a battle for your job. Management I truly feel bad for as they get caught in the cross-fire from the upper management and are forced into interesting positions that they themselves do not want to be in. However, with all the negatives i stated, there is also positives. They invest into their equipment. They invest into making sure you have all the tools and training necessary to do your job. They are always expanding, always changing. You will learn a lot from this company!"
bad,Hard job. Long hours. Constant stress. Lack of support from management. Lack of training. Weekends and holidays required. Must drive personal vehicle.
bad,change is not well communicated.  keeps recycling the same old underperforming managers.  not open to new ideas or technology.  just stale and ineffective.  Need a refresh of top people. Keep leaders too long.
bad,"Coca cola is an overall toxic place to work.  Management treats employees poorly.  Management always looks for a scapegoat, whether it be an employee or supervisor.  It is difficult to have a life outside of coke because you're always forced overtime and it is always last minute.  You can't plan your time off ahead of time because you could get forced to work and not have any further options.  "
bad,"Work environment is pretty toxic. Saw lots of unprovoked confrontations and personally faced one for some reason unknown to me."
bad,As a merchandiser it could be so much fun. Yes you can start at whatever time you like. But then it turns into slave work Long Day's never-ending work Management gets very mean management very pushy management is very time pushing the pay is great because you work an average of 10 hours every day holidays I was working 60 hours a week. My check is great but I feel so dead after work. Your teammates are never there to support and help you. You will get left out in the field by yourself. Just because the company is red and shiny doesn't mean that it's a great company to work for. I wish better luck for the company years to come because things could be better.
bad,"Change Change Change... Low Pay"
bad,"Very fast paced, if you do not keep up then you are fired. They put me with a person who was on drugs or something cause he was overly fast pace. I was hurt on the job and then laid off."
bad,"In the ""old days"" as a bottler when it was known as Coca-Cola Enterprises the rating I think would be different.  Rebranded after acquisition and broken up and sold in pieces it is a shrinking group that TCCC wants to go away."
bad,A lot of favoritism.Have to watch back all the time. Doesn't matter how hard you work you wont get compensated and less you're one of the managers boys.
bad,"I worked their for a year- jobs being outsourced, and they wanted you to pay for your own travel and re-apply for job- with no guarantee that you will even get it. Nice place while it lasted- but they definitely need to hire more minorities- was the ONLY one in that department."
bad,"Fast paced, very loud 24/7/nearly 365 operation. Contentious relationship between union and company. Culture is strained and uneasy. Little time to make correct repairs. Management likes to point fingers and place blame."
bad,"typical day is trying to figure out what is needed, learned a lot though since had to figure things out on the fly quite often, could not rely on management. Culture is ok, hardest part is being responsible for things that we had no control over. Best part is that there was a sense of accomplishment, and did help people."
bad,"lack of reviews, poor management , overtime was forced, no perks, favoritism, when managerd mess up it was ok but when a good employee makes a human mistake they were fired."
bad,You will work very hard and long. They cant keep any one in the whs so your truck is always messed up and loaded so that you the driver has to work 10x harder moving product around many times
bad,No work-life balance and the company is constantly re-organizing therefore there is little stability.  You worry each day what will happen next.  Associates are not treated fairly either.
bad,"Good luck advancing or getting promoted, even for top performers. They use layoffs as a fear mechanism. Later when you try to get advanced or promoted, they tell you that you should be thankful you were not laid off. Terrible work environment to encourage performance."
bad,"I've worked a lot of places in my life but none quite like coke. when you first get in you're caught up in the name, the recognizable logo, but let me tell u, that fades rather quickly. I was a driver there for a couple of months and to put it simply I would never work there again nor would I recommend anyone else to do so. the management team in my opinion should take most of the blame for such a poorly run company but of course, they won't. The hours I worked as a driver ware ridiculous..14 hour days sometimes with no help. You'd go into a Dollar General with 200 cases and literally have to pack every single case out, meanwhile there were still 17 stops on your truck. So imagine the pressure you'd feel. When I was there it was around summer time so I'm sure they were a little busier than usual but even with that, the lack of help and support from management made guys feel like they were on an island. They stretch you to your absolute limit, until u break and then they'll have a new guy come in and replace u. Look elsewhere, there are so many places where u can make so much more money for less work. Believe me, You didn't get your CDL to be a store merchandiser."
bad,long work hours and you never have time to spend with family. i wold recommend this job to a person just coming out of high school...on his/her way into colloge
bad,"No communication, poor management. Long work days, trucks are poorly maintained. Just an over all bad work place, people are treated poorly, worked to death....."
bad,Management in the facility I worked with discriminated you if you weren't African-American. If you were a different race they would push you to double your numbers and work harder while your co workers could talk and not work on their shift. Your life is no life. Your body is over worked and their is no advancement if you're not favored even if you work hard and show up to work everyday on time. If you're part time you can't take any days off. Your breaks are 30 minutes long. The pay for this type of work isn't worth it for how hard you work and how much stress you add to your life and body.
bad,"long shifts, offer all 3 shifts, great place if you are young and place to make a lot of money. then I would encourage college or high school students."
bad,"early starts"
bad,This job can be decent at times but the cons out weight the pros about 99% of the time. Management is very backwards . Favoritism is the way to get any where here. God forbid you have a smart Idea because supervisor and management will kick it to the side
bad,"While it may sound exciting to work at Coca - Cola, this is the farthest thing from the truth. The management team is unaware and don't care about you."

bad,"The environment is not for the weak of heart or those looking for the minimal work-life balance"
bad,"Work, work and more work.  Salaried positions work 70 hours a week.  Some work months with no days off.  Management was clueless and thank goodness corporate finally saw he light and ended the reign of terror.  It was too late and the plant lost 17 good supervisors with hundreds of years of experience.  3 years later and the plant is still struggling to regain what it once was."
bad,"I don't want to be to negative about this company, but the reality is that it isn't how well you perform on your job, the matrixes you hit, or the relationships you build with your clients, sales executives, planners, and technicians it is all personal if your manager likes you for you to be successful to advance."
bad,Was not properly trained. Only 3 day of training. I had to learn on the fly and I made some mistakes buy corrected them immediately. I did not feel that I was considered a valued employee.
bad,"I have worked for alot of companies and dealt with some bad managers but they take the cake on this one. They lacked alot in their training efforts, some companies do from time to time, but when they start evaluating me on my progress and giving me bad ratings i have never been trained on it really baffled me. They even sent me out with the assistant merch manager to a store to build a display and she didn't even have a clue on how to build it. Another thing that angered me is when i was working part-time they would send me all the way across town to work for 15 minutes than tell me their is nothing else to do and go home, you don't even get paid mileage on your first store or on the way home."
bad,Unpredictable workload and hours.Negative work environment.None to very little pay increases.Very few incentives offered.No real skill development offered. Ideas often given to improve situations but were not used due to cost or poorly managed led to low employee involvement and morale.
bad,Company management changes frequently and low pay raises throughout.Inconsistent hours constantly.Overall negative work environment.Low advancement opportunities.Hours required to work often physically overwhelming.
bad,I worked seasonal it sucked they sent us home sometimes 4 days a week. And they siked us up talking about over time and promising hours and advancement.
bad,"I worked for this company for many years and at first it was a great company, however as the years went by they slowly quit promoting from within.  This led to more and more people in management that had little experience creating unrealistic goals."

bad,"It's a tough place to work because seniority is the be all, end all of every situation including choice of trucks and pallet jacks and choice of routes. New guys work the harder routes and get bumped off the route if someone with more experience wants it. Management only cares about the product being delivered, not who what when or how long"

bad,"They make promises of working on your own and the ability to advance and make loads of money with their comission programs. The joke is on the employee you work an average day between 12 and 16 hrs with no overtime pay. They make the commissions in a way that even if your doing a great job you'll be extremely lucky to see a lil extra money in your checks every once in awhile. Had a route of 200 sq rural miles; 2hrs away from headquarters and was called to get ""checked on"" on an hourly basis hows that for micro managing.

We mostly work six days a week now because we cant seem to keep anyone.

Lavoro faticoso ed eccessivo, faccio spesso 12 ore, disorganizzazione assurda, poi tanti piccoli problemi! non so da dove iniziare per parlarne; se si eseguono gli ordini di coca cola, i responsabili dei punti vendita si arrabbiano invece se si ascoltano gli ordini dei responsabili punti vendita è coca cola ad arrabbiarsi; impossibilità di soddisfare tutti, ascoltando coca cola i responsabili dei punti vendita genereranno varie antipatica nei tuoi confronti e alla fine parleranno male di te a coca cola nonostante si lavori bene, alcuni punti vendita hanno il magazzino troppo in disordine e transpallet manuale non molto funzionanti rallentandoti e affaticandoti molto, alcuni punti vendita sono pretensiosi sul come fare il bancale d'avanzo facendoti perdere molto tempo e affaticandoti, alcuni punti vendita fa ordini sbagliati avendo cosi poi un sacco di avanzo, diffidenza e mancanza fiducia tra tutti quanti reciprocamente; ho solo detto alcune cose ma ci sono mille problemi."

bad,Too much buddy system with lack of professional leadership. No teamwork nor cohesion. No trust between anyone. Entirely too much backstabbing. Not a good work environment.
bad,"I have been in my role a few years short of 10 years and have gone thru numerous managers.  Currently the manager I have in my department has been not so pleasant to work for and with, other"
bad,You get paid very well for the work you do. As a driver you are home most nights. The current management team is not good to work with or for. The equipment is newer.
bad,"poorly managed facility. worked 7 days a week every week, and union job where the union would not represent its members but made sure to collect their dues."
bad,اعمل مع فريق تحت ضغط ساعات كبيرة فهم العميل والسوق
bad,"No way to move up, not very good pay, management doesnt care. Spent 6 years there and ended up with nothing to show for it. Hard working people who are on time get the same bonuses as those who are not."
bad,"Lot of learning from business processes and manufacturing processes. Target based company. Learned how to work in tough timelines, presentation skills, people management and managing the stakeholders."
bad,"good job but was never home , i was held to very high standards and under time restraints, it was hard to accomplish all the tasks  and get home in time to sleep and get up for work the next day. i worked 10 to 12 hour days"
bad,the job is you don't have a life they don't ask the co worker for there input they make choices based there benefits they want you to work on all this equipment but don't want to train anyone with no experience and don't want to pay
bad,Coca-Cola is an amazing brand with so much potential but with being a global company the resources to help train/support an individual in their role does not exist. In addition management expectations do not match the support that is provided.
bad,"There was practically no chance for advancement except if you were a woman, at least 90% of office staff was female, while all the Merchandising was done by men. Management was not very eager in improving working environment. Empty promises for promotions were a general practice to try to keep employees a little longer on the hook."
bad,"Ok wage but poorly managed, unsafe work environment apparently it is nobody's responsibility to clean up after themselves, everyone wants to pawn off their work on someone else."
bad,"Not a good experience for the most part at Coca-Cola. "
bad,"Company has great brands and some great people.  However, I would not recommend to a friend.  CYA all the time.  Culture is challenging.  Bottlers have too many decision rights therefore causing a lot of internal conflicts."
bad,This corporation lacks true leadership and chooses to lead through fear rather than encouraging growth through engagement. Days are long and factoring out the pay/hour your better off working where you are appreciated and valued for your skills.
bad,Didn't like the company work condition was poor equipment was not up to standards. Management was poor did not know to take care of emoployees and did not pay well.
bad,"If you are looking for a company to grow and develop do not work here. Nothing but false promises on growth, but after you have been in one position for 5 years."
bad,Start your day early in the morning appx 5 a.m at coca cola finding out witch stops or customers you have. Go to each customer take the product into the stores. Fill there shelves and leave.
bad,the benefits at the company are great but management is poor and no room to improve your stature as a worker. they are terrible at listening to there employees complaints and never seem to want to improve
bad,My time there was good.  Most of management is out of town so it is difficult to work your way up.  Liked my co-workers but wish there was more opportunity for advancement.
bad,"Long hours , changing routes, and low pay. You had to work by yourself with no help on big sales or promotions. You had to use your own car they refunded your gas money but not wear and tare on your car."
bad,"fast paced and labor intensive, long hours and not much time off. met a lot of good people though and pay was decent. good about cross training so employees learn to use forklifts and power trucks"
bad,I walked three miles to and from work daily.  No days off were allowed. Must reconcile monies daily.  Constant going in and out of refridgerated coolers often caused respiratory illnesses.
bad,"very long nights 12 hour shifts worked over nights mid afternoon until morning, the best thing about the job is that you can get alot of hours and have nice checks but you will never see your family"
bad,"Overall, I think Coca Cola has a lot to offer, however at times I feel that some of your superiors can keep you reaching those goals. I feel that school and your family is very important and when those two topics apply, you should definitely work with others so that they too can be great at the work place and home. Not so stressed because you feel work is against you."
bad,It was a good company to work for until they reorganized.  People they put into management are unqualified and know nothing about the work or the people they manage.  The turnaround is horrendous.
bad,"The best  and most enjoyable part of working at Coca-Cola is the fact that the name brand stands on it's own which makes it much easier to sell and shortens your work day considerably. It also sounds more prestigious when you say you work for Coca-Cola. "
bad,"Look after all incoming and out going product, inventory control, loading and unloading of trucks, general clean up, set up service appointments for all equipment.  The hardest part of the job is never knowing what time your product would show up from the supplier and to learn after years that there is no job security.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the fellow employees and the customers you get to meet and grow a relationship with."
bad,Higher positions have been taken over by numbers people who don't know how to inspire or manage or handle morale. Trainers and first level supervisors are the only reason anyone can last here more than a year.
bad,when I started years ago I enjoyed the work environment however for me I am not satisfied with the way my manager helps the team to succeed and make bonus
bad,"The culture at this company was not great.  The BU and location that I worked, management did not seem to care about their front line employees which created a very hostile work environment.  You were required to work 11-12 hour work day minimums and as a manager, were on call 24/7 without good compensation.  There was not a lot of training or support for supervisors/management as well - everyone seemed out for themselves and trying to make themselves look good at the expense of others around them."
bad,They make u work like dog and the give no raise no promo son they don't car about you family or some day are 12 till 16 hours and ther time they make work 6 day a week without let u know in till that last min.
bad,"Start early"
bad,This is an intense hard labor job that no one should do this for a long time. I was there for over six years and I think I needed something different.
bad,Powerful brand. Not career prospect. Not professional development. Not meritocracy. ALL is based on seniority. Organization is super vertical.
bad,salário inferior as demais empresas de vendas e tira sua qualidade de vida.
bad,"Working at Coca-Cola gave me a great example of how warehouses should not be operated. Management was poor and keeping employees was even harder than finding good management. In my four years there we went through three managers just on my shift and at least 25 employees, and that's not an exaggeration. The people I worked with and the excellent benefits is what makes the job. I learned quite a few good skills while being employed there, despite the disorganization and hardships of the workplace."
bad,"I was harassed by a co-worker.A manager and two supervisors where notified. Only one supervisor talked to the co-worker but nothing was ever done besides that. I continued to be harassed with them knowing and other co-worker telling them, but still nothing was done. It got so bad i left the company and the co-worker that harassed me still works there."
bad,I would not recommend working for this company to anyone that is serious about an actual career. Unfortunately I do not have anything positive to say.
bad,"Old warehouse in bad shape. Unsafe. Potholes everywhere. There is even holes in the ground. Bumps and hills everywhere. Roof leaks when it rains. Required to pick in rain some products staged outdoors.They dont follow labor laws. Favortism by management. Pay is good benefits also. Only one ten minute break  before lunch time and one lunch break, then they will work you sometimes as long as eight hours without a second break. Sometimes working as long as 15 hours. You will never finish the same time...ever. Faulty unsafe equipment. No local hr department. Terrible work/life balance. Plenty overtime. Some employees treated better than others they bend rules n dont follow protocol for certain employees, thus the favortism. Employees in same position are more privileged than others with access to production rates, work orders received. Some employees get to pick and choose what work they get versus everyone else randomly gets work orders. In this company for this position its all about who you know. Responses to employee disputes and claims in an unprofessional and untimely matter. Majority of nights you will go on dehydrated. One water fountain located opposite side of working area."
bad,"Theres no future with a billion dollar company that feeds their employees crumbs, and hard work goes unnoticed due to bad supervision."
bad,"Good place to work, but as time went on - with all the corporate changes ( plant closings, layoffs,etc) - people became to have more than one job on their plate.  Coca Cola was a strong asset to our county, but it really became all corporate America."
bad,Not an environment to grow in.. I would not recommend this job to anyone. My training period was inadequate and for the most part I trained myself how to pass the class a written and behind the wheel tests.
bad,"Working in the west coast office for distribution of water and juice, the environment was very tight knit, and a little cold.  This was a temporary position while an employee was out on leave.  Previous knowledge of SAP was not helpful as the module being used was different but catching on happened very quickly.  The position called for logistics and order creation for various types of vendors and retailers including over-seas."
bad,"Non Professional Management, Supervisors and Team. Long hours Mandatory overtime for second third shift,none for 1st shift."
bad,Once a great company with hands on management.Now a mere shadow of itself .Disrespectful to their customers and employees
bad,"Overworked and underpaid"
bad,"do not work here"
bad,"Repairing equipment all over the service area.  Dealing with customers and customer complaints daily.  Co-workers I worked with were not the best they were all about themselves not ""team"" environment at all.  Immediate Mgr great person his superiors didnt have the first clue as to what we did for a living.  Was a fun job but as management changed so did alot of other things."
bad,"This place is a joke to work for!  During the summer you get tons of hours, they ask you to work overtime at the end of your shift at the end of the week. All good if you like to work right?! And so you work your tail off and never complain. Then October comes around and you get called in twice in the whole month. Meanwhile older guys are getting overtime. Then you don't hear from them again until 2 days before Christmas. So they screwed you over at holiday time...but hey it""s Coke, not many people drink cold beverages in the winter. So then your manager calls you at 6:20am on January 2nd because it's -40 outside. Or they call you the next week because there's 40cm of snow that dropped. How does that make sense? Schools are closed guys, we have lives too.  Pepsi was right...Coke is a 1 trick pony. A 1 trick pony that should be put out to pasture. The whole time I worked there they had Frito Lays products in their vending machine in the lunch room. In 6 months of steady work there, I saw them not renew the HR's contract, fire one manager because he wasn't mean enough, and get rid of a handful of other employees who were either on their phones or were stealing (so yes they all deserved termination)."
bad,"Few management opportunities"
bad,"Working at Coca-Cola started off to be a promising opportunity.  However about three months in and there were shifts in upper management and there was a feeling of anxiousness throughout our department.  The work hours were never scheduled consistently, over time was NEVER compensated. There was really no compassion for their own employees"
bad,"This company used to care about people and their families, but that is a thing of the past, thanks to their new money-hungry CEO. His leadership reflects all the way down through the middle-management and it isn't good. We were told to take whatever measures it took to advance the companies stakes in the marketplace. With some people that's ok, but with me-it's not! This company will continue to lose ground to it's competitors as long as the current management is still in place. My review is that Coca-Cola is a great company with horrific management and the morale of their workforce shows it. STAY AWAY!!! Don't fall for the lines of bologna that they feed you about great place to work and grow. They're looking for mindless drones who don't care what you do to them, but they will always follow the play. Approach at your own risk."
bad,all pull as one  to get the job done will to listen and learn new things
bad,"A typical day at my job entails having my core job duties halted because a new manager (who hasn't got a clue) wants something (and has no idea how to get it or produce it) and I have to put aside my core job responsibilities (which I am fully expected to be accountable for) on hold for the fix.  "
bad,Coca-Cola use to be @ the cutting edge of technology and grow as a company but the more they started cutting corners an hiring managers who knew nothing about the company the more the business stuffed. They got rid of the customer first attitude it had an focus numbers
bad,"What do you get when you add substandard pay, long hours, toxic corporate environment and nepotistic promotion policies? "
bad,For being such a big company I was not impressed with the way they treat their employees. They did not promote from within and placed people on favoritism.
bad,"como  toda  a empresa tem  seus  pontos  bons e  ruim  os   bom  era  o   horário , colegas de trabalho gente fina. e os ruim era ter que trabalhar com meu  carro  tinha  que  colocar a gasolina do meu  bolso e ia pra muitos lugares longe e desconhecidos ."
bad,"company only cares about one thing money."
bad,A lot of childish actions between the new and the old and there insistent desire to complain to management
bad,"I have work for Coca-Cola for over 10 years and never have seen it this bad. Everything is about numbers not people. Management is so worried about covering their own back, they will throw ANY ONE under the bus to save their own job."
bad,"A typical day at work is load and unload my truck at the warehouse, transport vending equipment from Pittston, PA to Syracuse, NY. The most enjoyable part of the job is being on the road. I learned how to drive a truck while working at Coca Cola. I work well with my co-workers."
bad,todos los dias tengo que estar en las playas del sur ya que esa es m ruta tengo una carteras de clientes entre bodegas grifos y restaurantes eso es de todos los dias.
bad,"I loved coca cola. dont get me wrong its got great benefits but horrible managment and security. I spent most of my time fixing everyone elses mistakes and mess's. although the money was great, due to the stike i was laid off."
bad,I have been in this pposition for 4 months and I still canot get used to the schedule. I enjoy the work but the schedule is taking affecting my personal life.
bad,What you do is go to store to store filling the counters with coke products. The management is non existent where I work. They treat employees unequally. Newer employees are usually given the short end of the stick. The hardest part of the job is working at large stores with a lot of volume. The most enjoyable part of the job is the co-workers are very fun to work with.

bad,"Used to be a small family owned franchise untill 2006 with company picnics,Christmas bonus etc. Was bought by a big franchise owned by a Japanese company,things have gone down hill and gotten worse ever since. No more family picnics or Christmas bonus and the company's attitude towards its workers,as well as management,is not good. I was fired after 11 years without missing a day because I used my company car on my way home from work to see my 83 year old mother who was sick. They said it was ""personal use"" of a company vehicle and against company policy. They didn't care what the reason was. Now,I'm out of a job at 57 years old in a bad economy with no health benefits for me or my wife that takes several expensive medications can't afford."
bad,"Good paid but not worth it if you care about your family and life, standard work week of eleven plus hours a day, six/seven days a week. The job work/life balance is not fair.  "
bad,"Highest turnover I've ever seen at a job (at 2 1/2 years on the job I was over halfway up the ladder in seniority) and rarely do people get fired (they quit due to having no life).. They work you until you are physically and mentally fried because they are always short handed due to the turnover rate & the fact people were constantly out on disability and most of it was work related. 1st shift employees often work 10+ hours a day and more often than not 6 days a week and you can never make plans because you don't know if you are off on your sixth day until around 5 PM the day before. They have to give one day off, or they'd have you working it too!"
bad,"All time is closely watched and managed by supervisors. Such a busy work day, fun & great work, but very busy and time consuming. Team manager styles differ enormously from department to department--and not always positively."
bad,"work alot with no advancement after 7 years, just brought in outside hires. really disapointing  for a big comp like this. had to move on and such a shame"
bad,"Simply put, the managers don't care about anything except themselves! They don't support you or your ideas, no one takes responsibility for their actions especially when it comes to damaging product, there's favoritism based on who can and can't come to work late. When inquiring about growth opportunities the managers get missing, go home early, don't come to work, or they have amnesia"
bad,"Expect lots of restructuring, lack of support, poor leadership, nepotism and poor culture. The organization is not focused on employee satisfaction and everyone is focused on keeping their jobs as opposed to making true change."
bad,Challenging company to achieve the goals set forth to grow great business relationship.The drive to creative a team and work together are needed and lacking.
bad,This company uses you in every possible physical way they can. You are working from early morning to late afternoon in the summer with a lot of overtime but in the winter time it so slow that you sit at home unemployed ( you don’t get payed because they don’t send you for EI ). I would not recommend this job to a friend.
bad,"by far the easiest job ive had. Thursday-Monday.you start early and leave early so thats always good. even on weekends you would have easy days, the occasional hard one."
bad,Leadership is overall lacking and there are systemic problems which are persistent and result in a bad management culture from the top down. More effort was put in to busting unionization attempts than was put toward correcting the issues for which a union was needed.
bad,"Not recommend unless your up for the manual labour. You will be pushed and reminded that you will be replaced. And led to believe that you can make it to the top with there team building or I like to call it brain washing, Don't take this job if you care about your body and mind. So underpaid and should be starting @ the $20 mark."
bad,"Union contract made it difficult forcing the lowest senior employees to work all mandatory overtime if no other employee volunteered. "
bad,"Once after the interview, it was made pretty clear that there would not be advancement or assistance from management on self progress for the job.  The contracting service was not efficient with dealing with worker and workplace issues for the temporary hires."
bad,"Very nice place to work before went private on the market as lIberty COke.I used to have time square route and handle over 100 account per week inclusion business professional such as Compass group and Europa cafe,"
bad,I was a builder in a warehouse and it was probably the worst experiance I have ever had. The paletjacks always had something wrong and were not always safe to be on. I was injured several times from a malfunction on different palletJack's. There was no climate control so if it's hot out you will sweat the whole shift and if it is snowing you better be able to work frozen.
bad,"You have to deal with late loads, store managers that hate us, and other employees who fake work and days when you go to that store you have twice as much work .."
bad,mal ambiente de trabajo y condiciones de los empleados
bad,"you get no break,you get a 30 minute lunch,the pay is 8.25 an hour,i got promised a raise to 9 after 3 months and im still begging for that and was told we get no raises"
bad,"We need a new facilty, everything is being crammed in a very tiny warehouse which is 100% unsafe. You'll become clausthrophobic once you work here in the Victoria warehouse. Every pallet is touching the pallets beside it and management is wondering why this specific location had a lot of breakage. We don't even have a baler and a tygard machine. Once you step in this warehouse you'll get extremely disappointed. It's not what you'd expect when you hear ""Coca-Cola"". And there are alot of other issues that has to be addressed. Workers making up their own schedule, coming in late, leaving early, not wanting to work OT, etc. It doesn't feel like a job, really. There's a reason why Coke isn't in Canada's top 100 employers while PepsiCo maintaned its spot for the past few years."
bad,This is a union plant in a really outdated facility.  The union workforce is tenured employees that don't want to work because of the poor plant conditions.  Equipment constantly breaks down.
bad,Sales team rarely meets requirements of new bonus structure. Bonus structure is a big disappointment. Work life balance is not well sales people are asked to be accessible by phone from 7am-7pm seven days a week.
bad,"all over the place, staff does not help each other everyone is against one another. management inst present and it makes it hard to get issue resolved."
bad,The management didn’t care for the problems you had with day to day work. They were interested in themselves and themselves only. Would not recommend this place.
bad,Cool company to work for. It has been a good time working fro this multinational company and I have learned a lot of independence in managing my accounts
bad,Great brand to leverage and have a fun company to work for but they recently transitioned to new owners which means new everything. That have a well prepared company vision but with a poor execution process so their vision is not executed not even at 30%.
bad,Empresa de grande porte com ótima formação dos profissionais e qualificação. Planos de carreira muito atraentes e ótima aprendizagem.
bad,"Coca Cola was great when CCR had it. Once it shifted over to Liberty Coca Cola, it went all downhill. They cut back on Marketing, supplies, added insane safety measures, and last but not least, cut around 400 positions."
bad,"Its a cutthroat environment, period. Every man for his self unless its some older guys who are willing to help you along. Management sucks and they do just enough to make themselves look good. Don't trust them, get your money and experience and get a better job."
bad,"Working at Coca Cola NorthAmerica was a huge step in my career. Not only did I learn about the business, I made some great connections as well. Recommend!"
bad,"If you going to school and trying to work here, then it will not workout and you will feel like you have no life what so ever. Also if you do not have a life then this job is perfect for you."
bad,They throw many responsibilities on your back but they don't trust anything you do. Half the company actually works and the other half is goofing off. It gets old because nobody does anything about fixing problems.
bad,They want too much and even when you give that they want more. They force pallets down your throat and expect you to work miracles and make the “disappear” just cause they wanna push sales and when store complain about a mess or stuff expiring it’s your fault...
bad,"I only worked there for 3 months, but the people were great.  I knew that if i wanted to grow it was not going to go quickly.  Found a better job with more opportunities."
bad,"After getting a job here I now feel as though I live at this plant. I was never told that I would be working 7 days a week for months at a time. I cannot complain about the pay, however I prefer a good work life balance."
bad,Management and Supervisors speak to you in a condescending and deeming manner.  Rather than developing and working with when a fixable mistake is made.  There is absolutely no trust between management and supervisors with lower level associaciates which has effect morale within the CCNA team over the past few years.
bad,My worst employer ever.  Bad Management.  Only things good at this place was benefits.  Every year there are reorgs.  they let people go and then rehired.  It's pathetic.  Business is not doing well either.  product development is poor and lacks innovation.
bad,"Es una empresa muy grande e importante con un crecimiento constante, lo más difícil es balancear el tiempo laborar vs el familiar ya que la demanda laboral de coca cola requiere un 24/7 de atención."
bad,"quite common "
bad,"you will start off training for about two months, new people will have to travel far the first couple of months, new people will have split days off in the beginning"
bad,"Once in a lifetime experience, but stagnant growth and shifts in leadership have caused the company to change and de-value people. Very smart people, but a challenged environment - high stress, cut-throat."
bad,To sum up my experience at coca cola is a tough one but I want to say this....Even though I understand truck delivery is a tough business....ive never worked for such a disorganized company. That being said I left cause my mother was dying and I needed to be by her side.
bad,"Expect to work your a** off.  Coca Cola has a habit of bullying their customers into doing what they want...and guess what, you'll be the person doing the bullying.  Every week you'll have yet another initiative to add to your already nearly impossible workload.  Pay is decent if you don't mind being stressed out all the time and looking over your shoulder.  Consider yourself warned.."
bad,"Coca-Cola was a great place to work at for many years. I myself witnessed it for about 3.5-4 years. But during the last three years, Coke was bought and sold a total of 3 times. Virtually everyone was fired and replaced with lower paid corporate workers, unless you were union."
bad,Wouldnt go back! Experienced  bad times. Long hours and dont have days off. Always had to work long days to cover other drivers route. Needs better management.
bad,"You do double the work for less pay"
bad,During my time there do to military injuries I couldn't keep up the pace the manager was always on my back but never say down and discussed options for help completing your route the company offered for disabilities I didn't know about these options until I called h.r. once I called h.r. It become a aggressive environment everyday till I left the company.
bad,No work like balance. Too many responsibilities and not enough compensation. New management and did not know what their roll completely intailed. I loved communicating with the customers
bad,"The people there were very friendly, but management never acknowledged you unless you made a mistake.  There were many hours when the call volume would be dead, then followed by 4 or more straight hours of constant calls.  The company likes to hire a large group of people then let them go once volume slowed down."
bad,"The company is exciting, but the culture and environment are toxic. New CIO focused on cost cutting as the value of IT rather than strategic partnership. I've been here 6 years counting consulting and there have been 3 IT reorganizations and significant layoffs. Pay is good, but benefits are mediocre at best."
bad,The company I work for was not a good place to work.the place was racist no benefits and no pay rases.the company has since gone out of business.the business was a small franchise.
bad,"Nice to work place specially for the beginners , a lots of room to move on specially if you are willing to be relocated , various culture envinronment and they have a strong union to deal with"

bad,With the intensification of the struggle to grab market share and almost saturation of Delhi market it had become imperative to look for new markets or increase the penetration in the existing market. In this regard we proposed to start our operation in a still untapped huge market of the 8000 buses plying in Delhi. On the basis of test marketing and business analysis we found out that this endeavor will increase coca cola monthly sale by 70-80 million.

Go home after 8 to 10 hours in the trade and do 1 to 3 hours of computer work from trackers to reading emails and other admin work not completed during the day. It has been stated on multiple occasions that they know they are loading us down with too many stores with the expectations in every account but little has been accomplished to help in that category."

bad,"Compensation structure changed after one year, unfortunately it was not for the better. The most enjoyable part of the job was working from home."
bad,Constant concentration and ability to multitask. Reviewing merchandise before leaving facility. Good communication skills are suggested. Environment is friendly and willing to help one another.
bad,"All everyone ever does is complain about others and talk behind their back. very cliquey, people are always trying to throw one another under the bus. Merchandiser pay is okay but company is very stingy when it comes to raises. salesman work 10+ hours a day on salary and don't get paid according to how hard they work and what comes with the title. Benefits are terrible. don't waste your time here because 95% of employees who work there end up leaving anyways."
bad,you might get the rare chance of job progression if you kick and scream loud enough but this is very rare in 5 years there was the opportunity to advance once this is beyond poor for a company that supposedly prides there selves in career progression and equal opportunities. If you are female and polish then you will go as far as you want with this company if you are white male and English then i suggest you look else where as you have no chance.
bad,"You'll work long hours and only be paid for a 10 hour day even if you work 14-15 four days a week and overtime if a joke. management is not capable and your have to run your truck route on the fly, no one cares how hard your have to work to get around the obstacle the created instead of just routing it the way your want and getting it done is a timley and proffesional manner."
bad,"A typical day is driving your own car to 4 or 5 stores and pulling product from the backstock to the shelves. They do not work around any kind schedule problems you may have and the schedule often changes the day before or day of. Very high stress job, I do not recommend."
bad,"Arrive at my first store at 5am give or take. Greet those who are there working overnight/morning shifts. From there I proceed to walk the store look at my shelves or any displays we may have up. Write down what I need to fill these sections and proceed to the backroom. From there I would check my quantity of product I would be working from whether its a new delivery for the days or previous back stock. Next I take what I need, build my cart accordingly, and go stock the product to the shelf. Once the shelves and everything is stocked I recheck the backroom, make sure everything is neat, condensed, pallets and trays are stocked properly, checkout with a store manager and proceed to me next outlet. No two work days are alike though some days you may start with 3 stores and end up five or vice verse. Poor management throughout the company and poor communication in situations as such that I just spoke of. Best thing about the job though I would say is the freedom. Not having someone hovering over your back all day, and being able to move at your own productive pace."
bad,"na refresco bandeirante, nao fui feliz por falta de oportunidade de crescimento e muita burocracia para inovaçoes"
bad,Management was very poor with communication between other managers and the employees. The co workers were extremely helpful and easy to work with.
bad,"Disorganized work environment which caused many safety hazards, miscommunication, and tension between management and workers.  Workers often not feeling appreciated."
bad,Its a place where the sales force are macro managed every day. There are no bonuses. Very long hours. Managers like to dictate and no help
bad,Fast Paced Merchandising Environment with little time to get to stores. Deadlines are considered on a daily basis. Management is not always easy to get along with.
bad,Work on problems day in and day out due to outsourcing. The outsourcers provide junior level skill sets that makes your job a nightmare. Management doesn't seem to care about this since everything comes down to the bottom dollar. Also with the new IT delivery model the job isn't as challenging and as rewarding as it use to be.
bad,Distribution center managers not trust worthy.  abolished full time jobs for lower pay part time jobs.
bad,great place to work to have the name on your resume. However the leadership is horrible and the people are just working here cause its a pay check. I like my job cause of the group of people I worked with however even those people are looking for a new job.
bad,"organized pallets of beverages to be delivered to certain areas in the state of texas and Oklahoma.  used stockpickers to move around pallets in side of a hot warehouse with no air conditioning.  I was responsible for moving trucks and docking them, also jumping on stockpicker and moving pallets into the trucks."
bad,"having to work from 4am going to upto 23 locations a day to fill coke machines and after you have done nine hrs after Tacho breaks there was no overtime. you was working 50-60 hrs for 45hrs pay, then having to load upto 200 cases of cans and bottles onto your lorry for the next day. this company wears you out prematurely. enjoyable part was out on the road on your own and customer interaction."
bad,"No leniency on time off, breaks, and tardiness. Accidents happen, but if they happen you are punished for them. They do have a decent environment and you can make friends at work and co-workers are friendly. I felt as though It did not matter if I worked hard because If I did anything wrong, the things I did right did not matter. I was singled out and discriminated against more than a few times because I made a few comments in relation to my friends and my heritage. I was very embarrassed and self conscious for the rest of my time there. I don't feel that they value and reward their super stars."
bad,"I came into Coca-Cola thinking I would be making some what decent money. Turns out they start you off at $10.59 an hour. For the type of work you are doing it is totally not worth it. You are throwing cases as an order builder all day. After 90 days you get bumped to $11.77 an hour. However I was unaware the supervisor didn't raise my pay until after about 6 months instead of 3. I was compensated but should I really have to be on my supervisor to give me my 90 day raise? I've learned working here you can do anything you want. You are supposed to hit an efficiency of 95% daily using voicepick, build approximately 4.5 pallets per hour, and have a very small amount of mis-picks. Majority of employees do not do any of this and are not disciplined at all. My crew is approximately 14-15 people and we average 4-5 call outs a night. Once again no discipline is done. Every day we are given a specific amount of pallets we are supposed to build. People, myself included, have walked out on the count and no discipline was done. Also there are people who sit on the clock and steal time and it is well-known throughout the warehouse but once again. No discipline. Overall, it's a free for all and the warehouse employees dictate what happens. I have become so frustrated with this place that I have started to become the bad employee I despise. It used to be tolerable because you could work as much OT as you wanted. Even then you look at your paycheck and say wow I worked all these hours and this is it? Now they cut any and all OT. They already don't pay you what you are worth and now they want"
bad,"A typical day at work consist of breaking down pallet deliveries so that it can be moved to storage and replenish display and shelf space."
bad,"Too many responsibilites continue to be handed down to the supervisor level.  Unable to be in field with employees due to workload.  Too many major projects scheduled at the same time doesn't allow adequate time to ensure project is executed properly.  Senior management continue to raise the performance expectations with very little support at our level.  Subsequently, you are threatened often with going on a PIP or worse."
bad,"The good thing about the company is the people you work with. The pay is low, the benefits are getting worse every year. Three weeks of vacation after one year is great."
bad,"My daily duties were to dock and undock pods and 53ft trucks, unload them via forklift and to scan out orders"

bad,"I work for (this is my last week) coca cola in NJ as a merchandiser. I've been with them over a year, still floated around to different stores. I'm forced to work sometimes an hour and a half travel time IN MY OWN VEHICLE NOT REIMBURSED. I haven't even had as much as a choice in my days off. Started off seasonal 10-hour days and going to school....was offered fulltime, no mention of change in schedule. Went from 10 hour days to 8 hour days, still had the same number of stores? Usually an average of 4 stores and 1 re-hit....so that's 5 stops with half of them having multiple pallet deliveries. There is no regard for your work load or end time....sure the overtime is nice but if i need to get out and my stores aren't done, we have a mandatory 2 hour overtime which literally happens even day. Some day's ill ""do them a favor"" and work till it's all complete which will sometimes run 7-8 pm....and sure enough in my phone ill have a huge workload for the next day that happens to be 30 miles further than the last store. "
bad,early hours lots of manuel labor and no real cohesive team strategy 
bad,Got my job done and no one bothered me
bad,bom de trabalho e sua chefia tem treinamento para exercer cargos altos nesta empresa

bad,When you come in from a long day. they make you go out anytime of the day to take more load outs. $130/day salary but back breaking work
bad,My co-workers and hourly staff are all fantastic. Learned more about cash balancing and AR/AP.
bad,If you like driving a forklift and lifting cases of soda and stacking them on boards and wrapping it. Then this is the job for you!
bad,"Sales to area large store customers, Only focused in company oblectives"
bad,Would like to find a job I enjoy going too.And know my job is stable.Where there is room for advancement.
bad,"Not the best job, but a good job if you need hours. The benefits are not that great. If you are not used to working out a lot, then this is not the job for you."
bad,"responsible for safely driving tractor / trailor, delivering and rotating products, handling cash and settling said cash daily. This is a VERY physical and independent job. Management gives little to no support locally."
bad,"Decent job with good health benefits. Poorly ran management team that is busy trying to look good on paper, rather than being a good production facility. The future of the Detroit  production facility is not good"
bad,"Being out in stores building displays and filling shelves can be a very difficult job. It is heavy, hard grunt work but it builds character as you are required to have good customer service within the stores. Coca-Cola continually changes business strategies in an attempt to keep up with competitors which can be difficult for those on the ground."
bad,New management is HORRIBLE!!  They tell you things will get better but they  only got worse! Unrealistic expectations and hours! No promoting from within. Or else they take it away after 6 months. Who does that?!?
bad,"Head manager was awesome to work for. The manager directly under him was the complete opposite. Mandatory overtime work/life balance does not exist. They say to give them a minimum of 1 hour notice if you're going to miss work. I gave them 6 weeks and still heard about it. No company cell phone/ or mileage reimbursement after 2.5 months is unacceptable. Did not have full uniform even after 2.5 months. Ridiculous loads which were uncalled for just so the sales rep can ""get the highest numbers""."
bad,Started out as a good company. But has declined over the years.  Worst leadership of any company I have ever worked for.  Benefits are good. Compensation is decent for the area.  Paid time off is excellent.
bad,Work your butt off and don't get any respect for it management will find ways to get rid of you if they don't like you only good aide was working 4 days and having longer weekends that's it this place will run you til you break
bad,"Not much training, unsupportive management. As you hit goals, your goals increase to the point where you can't hit them anymore. Expectations change and I didn't feel as if I was valued."
bad,"no type of training ,or communication. poor management. safety is not first. Always a huge over turn. employees does not matter ,business  needs  is not a priority."
bad,"Long hours of physical labor and very little pay compared to other companies. Forced overtime at half pay, 60+ work weeks and only get payed for 40 hours"
bad,Life to work balance is terrible. Managers do not care about employees. On call nearly all the time. Work itself isn't bad. Benefits are okay. No possibility for advancement.
bad,Worked as a merchandiser. Work my own hours. Have to be self discipline and self motivated. Money isn't all that great but you can put the hours in if you do extra.
bad,"I would have to say this company needs deal with their employees differently when it comes to accidents and all.  With out having any knowledge of what is right and what is wrong.  They put people in place that either need instruction, or help in area of work."
bad,This job is very stressful and very long hours and very physical work it is very hard to have a job like this if you aren't single there's no time for family I feel like I go to sleep and wake up and do it all over again there's no time for anything else the management sucks they don't care about you or your personal life they make the job sound good in the beginning and its not at all they make me come back to help other people after I'm already clocked out but when I need help they don't send any I am a very hard worker but I have yet to move up in the company they are constantly critiquing your every move and belittling you they are always behind on orders or don't make any orders at all and the store is empty but they blame it on us this job is probably the worst job I've ever had it is stressful and they do not care about their employees while working here I broke out in a rash all over my arms because I'm stressed to the max would not recommend for anyone to work here
bad,"Fast paced time sensitive work area, constant crew change over."
bad,le management de l'entreprise est participatif ce qui permet de partager les avis et les propositions
bad,"High demand on frontline managers, There were numerous occasions double shifts were completed without compensation (salaried), Was hired on as 45 to 50 and later told no you work till you are finished regularly worked 50 to 65+ hrs a week and sometimes Saturday"
bad,"It was a wonderful experince when I first started working. I had a hard-nosed trainer who expected a lot from me on the first day of training but I pushed through. I worked myself to the point where I was getting huge back strains and leg strains from the large work load on a daily basis. I had an awful schedule of 4 on 1 off,1 on 1 off with no room to make it balanced or offer consecutive days off. I went to great lengths to push for more sale space on the floor for most accounts in the hopes of getting some form of acknowledgement. But it didn't matter to Coke as it is still and will always be a clubhouse style of advancement. If you play golf, talk the talk, make informative posts with business jargon, then you've got it made. Let me explain a bit. We'd get appreciation but as a blanket statement during peak times of the year. No different than a platonic greeting you'd express to your neighbors on a regular basis. I have worked at a gas station and felt more appreciated there then I have felt here for this company. Your schedule will flip at the drop of a hat often overnight or 30 minutes before you are about to head out the door. Your breaks are driving in terrible traffic as merchandisers can't risk being late to an account because the order has arrived and is expected to go out immediately. Cuttin corners is frowned upon but ultimately is necessary in order to complete your day on time. Customers would complain that flavours would spontaneously not be in an account anymore and there would be no messages of any kind until you personally asked the sales rep. Speaking of"
bad,"Typical day at work is that your adherence is very strict and micromanaged, therefore calls after calls, very little opportunity to get to know your  co-workers. Rules after rules."
bad,Overall not a bad company yet they offer VERY little personal time. Work days can be from 6-12 hours and there are occasional days where one may work more than that. I became a merchandiser and within a few weeks had a problem with management because they were unable to provide a schedule to fit my needs.
bad,"The managers treat the employees like underlings. Work should never be more important than your family and these tools believe it is. It is a union facility, but they dont do their jobs either."
bad,"Coca-Cola hires from outside their company too much, resulting in a mis-match of management. They need a professional business review! They need to promote from within and hire those who are bilingual."
bad,Poor management was part of the reason I left Coca cola. Management was very difficult to work for. When given the opportunity to leave I took it.Training was at a minimal and requirements for new trainees was high. You were expected to perform job duties with very little training.
bad,"I was on the morning shift started at 5 am and ended at 2 pm. More times then not the afternoon crew would be behind so the morning crew would have to end up staying until 5 pm or later on a daily basis. Management was for lack of a better word very poor, no guidance, no experience in order selecting but order people around like he did it for years. The job itself wasn't that bad it was lack of knowledge with management and lack of career advancement. I knew co-workers there that have been there 30 or more years still in the same exact position as when they started so that speaks for itself."
bad,With any job or career it really does not matter what your roll is. It matters if you are surrounded by good people. And if you report to a good supervisor.
bad,Probably the worst management I ever worked with (It was still a franchisee at this point). Everybody was always out to get everybody else. Management was mean and obnoxious and always said thing that were inappropriate for a work place. Corporate bought them and cleaned house. Most the management was let go. I am sure it is a better place now than it was while I was there.
bad,Uma Boa  Estrutura de Trabalho aos seus funcionários
bad,"Worst place I've ever worked this company will beat you up mentally and physically,the management is horrible and warehouse is small and congested which cause major safety concerns which never get addressed"
bad,"No HR on site, more of a number rather than an individual."
bad,"Empresa deixa a desejar, local de trabalho inadequado, salários abaixo da média."
bad,Most of the warehouse guys do whatever they want. Upper management does not hold anyone accountable. When one supervisor calls out they force others to pick up added shifts which leaves you with no personal life. Unorganized and disgruntled work force and it all starts at the warehouse manager.
bad,In my experience i work the labor ends of the jobs at coca cola and for a career its a great place to be. But if you have a life outside and like having a predictable schedule than this is not a company to work for.
bad,"Il faut une très bonne déduction d'analyse,être disponible,jour,soir,nuit,car changement d'horaire fréquent."
bad,"The work was physical and you got paid for drive time, but communication with the manager was difficult at best. There were many times where I found myself waiting for an answer and not receiving one. Also found receiving if I was working or not an hour before my shift was obnoxious. Work and pay was good, management was not."
bad,Coca cola is a place i will not recommend anyone working here or filling out an app this place treats there employees poorly
bad,"This job seemed okay at first but over time it changed drastically. I was given training for 3 days in my first week but then the whole week after they never scheduled me at all and when I asked why I wasn't I never got a response until 3 days later & didn't work for a whole week. After a whole week of not working I was trained for 2 more days and expected to work in stores overnight by myself which I felt was really rushed. The job its self can be tiring, if your lucky there will only be one or two skids of product to place but usually there is about 6 or 7 loads to do per store ( you get about 3 or 4 stores a night ) and after awhile this can be tiring when working by yourself, I suggest stretching before and after if your going to do this job and to get alot of sleep and eat well before your shift cause work starts at about 11 pm - 1am and can go all the way to 11am the next day, depending on your load but most shifts are 9 hours so to anyone that isn't used to working overnights I highly suggest you prepare your body for this. Your going to random stores within the GTA so sometimes at certain stores the pump trucks aren't working well and there can be delays in when the trucks deliver coca cola product which can delay when you finish.  "
bad,"The pay is good, but the work is incredibly demanding, and the job environment is stressful. They have an incredibly high turnover rate for these reasons."
bad,"Theres tons of favoritism here.  80% of all the employees are very very very lazy and it seems thats how you move up here. It could be a great place to work if they had good leaders here, its a shame."
bad,"Typical day includes direct office support of second & third shift production supervisors, heavy data entry and analysis, scanning, copying, filing, interdepartmental communication, employee relations."
bad,"From the outside this company seems like a great opportunity, they make it seem as though its an hourly job, but its not, at least its not hourly Albany,NY. This job is a commission based job, not  so bad, but its not full commisson, so which means you get paid for each case around $.35 and for bibs it is around $.50 pre bib. The things is commission is only given for your smaller stops, but when it come to bulk stops like Hannafrods, Price Choppers, and Shop rites, you receive a drop rate of $17, this means that in steaed of you getting full commission they rip you off. lets say you you have a bulk stop of 400 cases, each case in commission is $.35, instead of you getting the $140 owed to you, you get the drop rate for the low price of, you guessed it $17. The best part is the pack outs, basicly your'er not just unloading the truck and delivering the product, you also have to put each product on the shelf. In most pack outs your putting away 50 to 250 cases of soda by your self no help, your filling the coolers also. With time and hours spent on packing out a 50 case pack out only gives you in commission $17.50. A pack can take 45 min to an hour and a half, and you still have 19 stops of pack outs to go. Unless you are super man nine times out of ten you'er working 12-14 hrs a day, with commission breaks down to around $14 an hour to driv a tractor trailer. Now when you first walk through the doors they will tell you you get $20 an hour and make it seem like it hourly plus commision. If you like long day hard work for low pay and just enough time to see your family for 5 min"
bad,"Very high turnover rate..poor pay. Extreme stress . Very very limited upward mobility."
bad,"I am not going to list pros and cons, but rather I will tell you under what circumstances YOU SHOULD accept this job and under what circumstances YOU SHOULD NOT accept this job. "
bad,"Being at Coca-Cola for approximately 16 years, the Management turn-over rate was rather high, which in turn gave employees an uncertain confident in Senior Management.  A typical work day / night / morning would be roughly 14 hours of more.  My co-worker were pretty good guys... We worked together for the entire 16 years I was there.  The most enjoyable part of working at Coca-Cola was training new hires how to safety operate in the beverage industry.  The hardest part had to be keep employees moral high after work 14 plus hours at night to finish schedule production.  Overall Coca-Cola is not a bad Company to work.  Senior Management needs to be more timely & consistence in their process."
bad,"There is no consistency or structure. A very lazy culture that is unable to show in pride in their work. Instead of fixing issues, they continue to let them go."
bad,"Empresa dinâmica, e um ambiente muito bom para trabalho. Tive muitas melhorias em como lhe dar com público, e trabalhar em equipe. Sempre tínhamos reuniões para estimulo, e muita pressão para bater metas."
bad,"One of the worst jobs out there for any recent college grad.  If this is your only offer of employment, please take my advice and do not take it..stay active and keep searching for better places to work."
bad,"Reconciling drivers inventory and cash. Update and maintain customer accounts. Create product codes and pricing for big chain stores. Working in different departments throughout the years taught me how to multi-task.  Some of the managers could be difficult to work with because they could seem uncaring about departmental issues at times which caused a hostile working environment amongst co-workers and department managers.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with co-workers and the most enjoyable part was getting free stuff; tickets, t-shirts, product."
bad,"Typical workday was 9 to 16 stores a day. My day was 10 to 14 hours long. I moved into a trainer type role. I enjoyed the training of new hires most of all. Management was not good due to: not answering/returning  phone calls, not knowing our customers, playing favorites and self promotion of ego. Our company vehicles were taken away and you had to start keeping mileage using your personal vehicles along with your everyday responsibilities."
bad,They make you work the most they can when they want to. Didn't have anytime for family in workdays at all. If management doesn't like you then working there is impossible or they eventually get rid of you with any little thing. They expect you to be fast without having a decent pallet jack to use. Pay is poor and if you want more money work faster. Holidays they expect you to work long hours and slow days they send you home early.
bad,"I felt Iwas alone there and didn.t have any support from my manager, supertvisor. I was being harassed by co-worker .Hardest part of the job was dealing with co-worker. The most enjoyable part of job was interacting with the customers."
bad,"Meet and worked with owner/ Manager to help build their business and make our brands stronger. Loved learning about the business and working with software to build our brand. working with my fellow employees, was like a network of people that helped each other out. I learned a lot from my fellow coworkers. The best part of my job is meeting with business owners and managers getting to know them and what their goal is for their store."
bad,"It is fun working for Coac Cola"
bad,"Horrible hours,no value for having a family at home, pen happy and very very very poor management"
bad,Low Morale and heavy workload. Little promotional opportunity
bad,Typical work day is long 10-12 hours. Management is slow and sometimes non-responsive at best. Co-workers were great. Hardest part of the job was being micro-managed with no exceptions to the weekly routines. Best part was selling the #1 soft drink brand to the trade customer's.
bad,"1- junta en la mañana planear tu ruta y visitar tus clientes.                 "
bad,"Worked 60+ hours a week.  When I needed more guys on my crew (more product and no overtime),  I was told no.  I did more with less, brought production up 30%, yet was unable to add to my crew.  After a while it really killed moral."
bad,"A typical work day is from 9 to 10 hours a day and includes customer service, pulling pallets and heavy lifting, lots of driving, and lots of walking. I learned how to effectively manage time. I learned quality control. Also I learned to work quickly and efficiently. The hardest part of my job is servicing stores when they haven't been serviced properly, the driving, and the heavy lifting. The most enjoyable part of it all is the people I meet by traveling to different cites."
bad,"Upsell display activity in all accounts with sales team to meet volume targets."
bad,"I worked second shift from 2pm until we were done 10 to 12hrs days .The whole time I was there not once did we have a full crew,,had very high turn over rate its  very physical work not for everyone.The job was based on 95% rate and above production. I enjoyed my co-works very much I met some good people,.i enjoyed hanging out with the guys on Friday nights  having a cold one after a long week,"
bad,The pay isn't worth the way you get treated there. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
bad,Buena paga .Y trabajo al 100 me encanta trabajar desde los 11 años trabajo
bad,"Por las mañanas entramos 6:30 am tomamos equipo de trabajo en caja general despues nos dirigimos  a la oficina a tener junta con nuestro jefe inmediato cerca de las 8:00 a 8:30 am termina junta , nos dirigimos al estacionamiento de los autos utilitarios checamos niveles y puntos de seguridad y una limpia al auto salimos a desayunar y terminando nos dirigimos a la ruta correspondiente tomando pedidos todos los clientes y todo lo que tenemos que ejecutar con ellos al termino de la ruta transmitir informacion  aproximadamente entre las 8:00 y 9:00 p.m. terminando de realizarlo nos dirigimos a la planta, colocamos el equipo en su cuneta y nos dirigimos con nuestro jefe para resolver pendientes que se vieron en ruta, al termino checamos salida."
bad,"Poorly organized, routes was always mixed up, a lot of confusion in stores"
bad,you sign in for your fork and you pull the line put the items in the racks and relieve people for break but always short in hand
bad,Great coworkers
bad,My typical day was great but the hardest of the day was balancing inventory. Over all pretty good work place.
bad,working for this company means that you will be micro-managed and board. The company needs to improve there infrastructure. The only reason they stay in business is because of the volume that they do.
bad,Management over all like a lot of professionalism. Work hours were grueling and the company really went out the way to let's know they rue did not appreciate the work that you gave
bad,When working for coke i meet alot of good people and not so nice people not saying names but u know who u are i wont be working that wear house again maybe different one one of the mangers were very rude needs some growing up to do the owner was a nice guy i wish everyone was like him.
bad,"Every level of management is measured which is fine when reasonableness is interjected. An example is that they setup new measurements and before they find out they don't make sense, they hold the employee to meeting them and even if they can't be met, the employee is penalized.  There is never an excuse for not hitting you numbers (and this is not a sales position I'm talking about).  "
bad,Employees are great but bosses have no idea what is going on. Favoritism with some employees mean some people can do anything and not get in trouble but others are in trouble for the smallest thing.
bad,Not a good company to work for anymore not the management but the ownership is the problem here ......................................................
bad,"I was disappointed to watch a great Director who had lot's of knowledge and great leadership skills get bullied by another, less qualified Director into taking various actions with the manager's that reported to them.  It was like being on a grade school playground."
bad,"i was a merchandiser and it was an easy job, you can literally blank out doing your job and get thru fine. but physically hard on your knees and back since youre basically bending and lifting soda cases all day. you gotta watch your hours and rarely get overtime and if someone called in in your area you gotta pick up the load. when I finally got a raise it was less than a quarter, I couldn't live off that type of income so I left. the trucks that deliver your product are really often late to store and youre left to do nothing but wait or move on to next store and yet they expect you to stay under forty hours weekly. oh and you gotta use your own person vehicle which is ok since you get reimbursed but also sucks since you put in so many miles a day."
bad,i wouldnt recommend this job to anyone The amount of money they pay for the amount of work you do is not worth it and the management isnt organized at all
bad,"So many lay offs over the last few years that there was nothing left to like. TCCC is closing our business and the people are being put out of work, myself included."
bad,When I first started working for company management was awesome in the last 2 year or so once company shares hand workplace has gone done hill.  Reyes holding made to poorly changed to company and have change workout without employees input.  Have enjoyed working for company but do not see a future in this company.  If you have any kids or a wife this job is not for you.
bad,"Management catastrophique."
bad,"Typical day, 7-5 that stretched to sometimes 8 or 9pm. Constantly in a rush to get to the next account and juggle 100 other things as well. Expectations were often unrealistic and unattainable within the allocated time."
bad,10-20 stops a day. Enjoy my job when I know where my route is.  Poor routing with stops out of my area often causes longer days forcing employees to work thru breaks. With new management a lot of policies are changing causing low moral. Losing drivers at a alarming rate.
bad,"Job wasn't as enjoyable as I thought. Broken promises, lack of acknowledgement. Trigger fingers ended up turning into twitter fingers, and that's something that I do not want part of."
bad,"Working for this job was really stressful, they over work you!!! some days we would work 16 hours, And the longest days were 18 hours! Your body is beat up and worn out because of all the overtime they made us work!"
bad,"Extremely hard to have a life outside this job. They will work you, mandatory overtime nearly every single night of the week, up to 16 hours a day according to regulation standards. The money is good, before taxes and pretty good afterwards. If you have the time and energy to deal with this place then go for it and get all the overtime you want; they throw money at you!"
bad,It was a disappointing experience. The warehouse employees are paid commission. You get paid 7 cents a case. I feel you don't get back the investment you're putting in.
bad,I enjoyed working for coke but win they changed or pay scale I need a job were u can move up I have a family an I am I single parent so I need a good paying job
bad,Even with you working your tail off a lot of times you have no control over when you get off. A lot of the job is out if your hands. Very corporate oriented.
bad,"you need your class a to make less then minimum wage, and work 10-15 hour shifts with no overtime. supplied plenty of soda and not enough water. my truck would always turn off while driving, no repairs were made."
bad,"Little opportunity for advancement, work culture is exclusionary. Low morale due to lots of lay-offs. Most enjoyable part of the job were my customers."
bad,The company is very unorganized in the management department. For the work that is expected a lot of the workers feel as though they don't pay enough.
bad,"I liked the ability to work with the warehouse, but be a part of bulk as a jockey. But management would try to control particular parts of how I was doing things without actually looking at the reality of the situation, but part of the problem was it was new management that didn't necessarily know what they were doing. "
bad,"Obtain orders and fill selves, check product for freshness, visit current account to establish and maintain relationship, Selling in New products to existing customers,  Locating new potential accounts to serve Coke products through cold calling, on phone or simply going into a location and gaining apt with decision makers, reviewing potential new accounts on line, IE facebook, google, search engines, online web sites to gather as much information to put together a sales plan for each location.  Often times having to go through and update information in the system for existing accounts, reviewing and monitoring equipment in the field to verify they are compliant with the agreement they signed on use, if not having the talk about options that they have to keep equipment, setting up accounts, gathering information to set up accounts, ordering equipment and products required to establish an account with Coke."
bad,"grupo de trabajadores muy unido ,supervisores la parte mas difícil de trabajar"
bad,"As a recruiter for Coca Cola Refreshments, I have seen great candidates that met or exceeded all of the qualifications Coca Cola was looking for. I have had over 8 managers that had me screen candidates to make it look like they have actually gave everyone a fair chance. They end up choosing their family members who have no experience at all for the position. "
bad,"Um dia típico de trabalho é estar disposto a executar as minhas funções, reportar ao superior hierárquico quando há uma irregularidade no posto de trabalho. aprende a ser mais ágil e a lidar com varias situações que podem surgir principalmente se acidentes. gestão é uma das áreas mas complexas do eu trabalho pois a de ter muita atenção com os documentos e com os colegas. Os meus colegas procuram ser ágil e certificam-se de que os serviços estão a ser bem feito. O mais difícil no meu trabalho e não responder a tempo e a hora as minhas obrigações, é quando as outras áreas ou colegas dificultam o meu trabalho. O que mais gosto é chegar e entrar o local limpo, ver que não mexeram na minha secretaria durante a minha ausência, é corresponder com as espectativas dos meus colegas, ver que realmente estou a desempenhar as minhas funções ao bom nível, saber que posso ajudar os meus colegas quando estão com muito pendentes e ser ajudada quando necessito e muito mais."
bad,During my tenure with Coca Cola Refreshments it was frustrating. Management was not so great at our Facility. I was able to learn many things on my own basically through self teachings.
bad,"While I'm thankful for my time with CCR and the goals it has allowed me to accomplish, I am disconcerted with how they manage their employees and develop talent.  "
bad,managers for the most part need more training on how to treat people they wont help you if you need a second chance lot of hours no social life
bad,The call volume is pretty constant and there are plenty of opportunites to make sales.  The program used to do your work is very outdated and as inside sales rep you take the heat for missed deliveries by the warehouse.  You are not allowed to directly contact the warehouses and they have NO accountabilitly for their work. The environment is nice but they constantly change QA making it near impossible to get monthly bonuses.
bad,"This is a great name company but when you get in it the story is different. Very slow, siloed, closed culture. Almost impossible to do anything without 3-4 levels of approvals and convincing. Very exclusion based culture. Everybody manages up and fears you are there to take them down."
bad,great benefits. great name. the management are ridiculous they never drive a tractor in they lives. so cheap. crazy routes and long hours. old and poor equipment to work and also a lot a tractor doesn't have A/C or heater.
bad,"retail sales within grocery stores. "
bad,"Working with the company provides no room for growth. I have been with the company for going on a year and I have yet to see any advancements within the company. I have witnessed a number of people quit this job due to the hard labor and lack of compensation. Overall I would say that the company itself is decent and what they stand for is admirable, but the position that I am in inspires no room for growth."
bad,"A typical day at work would start off with a shift meeting about what went wrong , whats still wrong and how you  should try to work around the issues. i learned that even very good pay they offered  in the waco area is not worth what you had to do. I know you get paid to do your job but i decided i was not worth it to me. Management would come out when something was wrong and demand that we run our lines regardless of what the problems are. My Co-workers were amazing because we all understood the struggle and made the best of it. The hardest part of the Job was trying to make plans outside of work, the schedule is constantly changing ; for example on Tuesday the schedule comes out  and you are off sat and sunday but come friday the schedule changes and you are working through the weekend with no heads up... your plans dont matter. the most enjoyable part of the job was when everything was running the way it was supposed to and everyone was happy . Its a good place to work if you are not too worried about spending time with family. If you are all about money and nothing else...this is your place."
bad,"Não e muito agradavél de se trabalhar na coca-cola, cortou varios beneficios aplicou descontos absurdos, e o funcionario, faz muito além do que e pra fazer. Só"
bad,"Low morale... management treat you like dirt, no days off, "
bad,"If you want to work all day from early in the morning before sunrise until the middle of evening with the same rate of pay no matter what, this your job. On a better note, job security should not be a problem because there is plenty of work to go around. It almost seems like they pay you to hate this job."
bad,"CCR formally CCE has a great brand and is a good company to work for overall.  However, the motto they use 'putting our people first' is just a saying. It is actually like you to put work first - everything else doesn't matter. Upper management does not recognize loyalty and hard work. The best part of working there is your co-workers."
bad,"I was excited when I first got hired by coke but that fizzled quick.  The customer service goals (score card) was adjusted several times to make it harder to reach goals and less bonus money coke had to pay (even though they were raking it in).  I went for a promotion and when they made the offer it was less than what I was making (with monthly performance bonus) in my current position.  Overall the worst company I have ever worked for, and one of the lowest paying."
bad,"checking schedules and once stop merchandising. Bad management, good coworkers. Hardest part of the job was getting all work done under short period."
bad,"Coca-Cola is a fast paced, dynamic company with a large portfolio of brands serving a wide array of consumers.  "
bad,"Warehouse work includes Hard work, physical labor, and no appreciation. Perhaps this comes as a result of being in the union, but the relationship between management and hourly employees is toxic. The work is un-fulfilling and being unionized, your chances of moving up are dependent on your patience because there are no performance incentives, only seniority. The pay and benefits are very good, but quickly decreasing with every contract. "
bad,"60-72Hr mandatory work weeks,"
bad,the day would usually start at about 6-630 am. the day consisted of pushing and pulling heavy pallets of soda. also building displays on certain ad change days. very physical.. very tiring by the end of the day. management was very unflexible with time off. and was quick to point fingers . co-workers were always accusing one another of doing a poor job. the most enjoyable part of the job was not seeing your boss very often.
bad,"Not the best place to work at in terms of employee treatment and working environment, but there is usual job stability, plus concession on what you can purchase from the company's product line."
bad,Huge fat IT department per the norm. Lots of angry Mac users who took it out on me and just wanted to scream. So happy I am gone. Oh and a manager who disappeared for 1 month while applying for a different position. Cheers to you it's the American way
bad,Working here is a fast paced environment which is fine but you can't go by what the schedule says you can't make plans with family they tell you at the last minute that you will work on scheduled off days.
bad,"Trabalhei nessa empresa durante dois períodos mas não era diretamente pela coca cola,mas sim por terceiros q não valeu a pena pois éramos muito lesado pelos mesmos incluindo nossas horas extras e benefícios..."
bad,"I worked & was top selector for 3yrs & was denied advancement despite numerous attempts.  Behavior, job performance, & attendance were near perfect.  I, as well as a few other employees, werent treated fairly due to nepotism.  Managers favored those whom they were fraternizing with after work hours.  I was not pleased & was released from my duties after being mistreated."
bad,Poor communication .........poor equipment .........lack of leadership. Not a safe place to work.  ......        .  No overtime allowed. Not recommended
bad,Pay is good.  And there are benefits but they get less and less every year.  Management is mediocre at best and communication is non existent.  Not a lot of room for advancement if you don't have a degree so even if you have all the experience in the world someone right out of school can come in and take a high paying position with no clue how to actually achieve success there.
bad,"An average work experience with below average management and pay/ benefits. okay as a temporary job but not to accomplish higher career goals. Although, one major benefit is working remotely."
bad,"The job is based on volume and not on hours so there is a lot of overtime depending on how fast coworkers work. I personally don't like having other people dictate what time I get because they are too lazy to work harder. 10 to 7 would be an 8 hour day because we don't get a paid lunch, but we rarely ever clock out at 7. We usually clock out at 8-8:30 and 9-9:30 on holidays."
bad,Fast paced working environment. I learned how to multitask and satisfy customers needs and fill orders. Hardest part of the job was being at each customer location at certain times due to Houston traffic. Work place culture was a mad house. The most enjoyable part of the job was working as a team with co-workers.
bad,"While I had an opportunity to learn different job skills and enjoyed doing so, often the crews where short handed. Management did not foster a positive work environment. I believe if more incentives were offered the turn-over rate would not have been so high. Management oten argued among themselves which directly effected morral and the work environment."
bad,I am sat at a computer desk for 8 hours a day with no support or interest. My manager is not interested in me and I need a job that is more practical and suited to me.
bad,"I worked there for a long time and went through a lot of changes.  They would pile on more and more rules and regulations stripping the job of any joy or satisfaction.  Add the revolving door of management and changing owners four times in three years, and this company has a lot of problems."
bad,"While I'm not opposed to working hard, I felt that it became a punishment to work hard with this company.  Every time you accomplish something positive you are rewarded by staying longer and covering other stores.  Seniority is valued over effort here."
bad,"They remove the highest paid and send the job offshore. Job security used to be very good, but not anymore. Upper management cannot decide on a direction other than removing employees to save money"
bad,Working at coca cola was fun in the beginning but new management don't care about their employees only about themselves their bonuses and the bottom line.
bad,Coca-Cola Refreshments wasn't the popular soda brand I thought it was. Team members argue and yell at each other. I totally disliked it. THANK YOU!!!!
bad,"i use to be proud to say that i worked for coca-cola, but for the past 5 years or so i am sorry to say that i no longer feel that way. Upper management at my local branch has completely ruined the work atmosphere. The employee moral is at an all time low. Coke use to care about costumer service, but now all they care about is the bottom line. The union does not care either, just so long as they still collect their dues. The only good things that are left to say about working for this company is, that the pay is decent and you get to meet new and people and possibly new friends along the way while on the route. Watch your back, gossip is commonplace."
bad,"Days are normally very long with a lot of work involved. Sometimes you have to deal with angry customers, managers, and etc. Job can be tiring, and leaves you with not much time for a social life."
bad,"I have worked with the company for many years. They always seemed to care about their employees. They sent us all to work from home over a year ago. Everything was going great and they kept repeating our numbers are sky rocketing in efficiency and although other departments were being laid off and bought out, our department was getting signed for three year contract. The after the first week into new year- we all found out we ad 60 days and we were getting laid off. it went from we were secure for three years to lay offs. i feel very betrayed and let down."
bad,To much favoritism within different departments. More layoffs coming. Some Managers give better percentage of raises to favorite employees instead of all employees on the team. Management is two face.
bad,Work was guaranteed for high-performance workers. temporary employees work full-time hours but don't receive benefits until promotion based on a seniority system. Equipment desperately needed upgrades. Safety standards were poorly enforced. Quantity over quality policies. Voice pick system was so terrible it could easily lead to mental health issues. Too much back lifting necessary. Only enjoyable part of the job was the overtime cap at 11 hours a day but guaranteed 8hrs.
bad,"A multinational company"
bad,job was exciting to work with many customers and dealing with people all day. the co-workers were fantastic. we had a great team!! but management was terrible. that is basically why I left very unprofessional/
bad,They are an okay business just need to work on being more put together but the people I work with are amazing always keeps a great attitude
bad,I worked as the 3rd shift maintenance supervisor with little to no support of the managers from day one when I started working there. The maintenance team I supervised were some of the finest and well capable people I have ever worked with. The hardest part of my job was that I was unable to conduct my duties to the full potential due to the fact I was never given a log on to the systems for SAP and various other computer accesses needed to perform my job.
bad,The upper local management bends over backwards to support non-performing hourly associates. They have allowed them to curse out supervisors and only get suspended.
bad,"Het is een goed bedrijf, en word serieus gewerkt, communicatie was uitstekend en word als een team gewerkt."
bad,"Acceptable work place. Not for family orientated employees, mainly in sales center. Mandatory overtime. Sometime sacrifice safety for production. Room for improvement."
bad,always busy with your route and other routes needing help.  management dont care about workers just want to make the customer happy. Dealing with the store are the worst part of the job.
bad,i have learned a lot while working at coca-cola. Many intelligent and capable people work at coke and it has been a good experience.
bad,"I recently got hired and my short time of me being employed there has not been the most enjoyable time. They have a lot of things to work on as far as management, leadership, knowing how to answer questions, etc....... However, I am very positive that it will not stay that way for much longer."
bad,"typical day beings at 8am, usually ends about 5pm. I learned organization. management was horrible. co-workers also. the hardest part of the job was building displays and reorganizing coolers. the most enjoyable part was the flexibility"
bad,"I merchandise small stores which include drug stores,small grocery stores and other places that sell Coke"
bad,Personalmente creo que Coca-Cola es una empresa que tiene solvencia económica y tiene buenos beneficios para sus trabajadores y sus familias.
bad,The Contract Company US Security Associates works for The Coca-Cola Company. I come in do my eight hours and go home.
bad,il lavoro di promoter è molto stimolante ma nel mio caso è stata un grossa delusione in quanto non confermato dopo 2 anni di contratto questa è la burocrazia lavorativa dopo la formazione scatta addirittura il licenziamento che squallida situazione lavorativa che viviamo...
bad,The tone at the top is terrible. Salaried employees constantly have their jobs threatened. Hourly employees aren't paid the industry standard. The company as a whole is a sinking ship.
bad,What Coca-Cola does is absolutely incredible. The product that we all know and love is on little part of that. Consider the logistics of inventory and supply chain management that it takes to provide customers with what they want when they want it! Millions of cases have to find their way to the right place at the right time.
bad,"Coca-Cola is beverage provider to businesses, restaurants, grocery stores, convenience stores, and gas stations. A Market Development Manager works On-Premise, which calls upon restaurants, businesses, and tobacco stores."
bad,"Kept me broke was driving 400 to 500 a week in my car. Was cheated on mileage first three weeks. I was trained and them forgotten.   "
bad,Great place in the beginning but your expected to now where everything in this large warehouse is in a short amount of time. A lot of heavy lifting and most of the times the pallet will be taller than you.
bad,Excellent benefits and work culture. However safety issues are ignored and was openly told to stop applying for other positions. Retaining and developing talent you would think is a priority but management feels otherwise.
bad,This was one of the hardest jobs I have had. Work/life balance was very hard to adjust to due to the long hours required to put in. Hands and body ached daily. Pay could have been better to match work.
bad,Vision for Department and company were constantly changing with very little training to proceed or advance. Management team did not work together to make the department better. As a supervisor I was not allowed to make business critical decisions with heavy oversight.
bad,"Driver has too many responsibilities and everything falls on the driver, very stressful, dispatching is terrible, customers make job very difficult and stressful, job is very physical"
bad,It was nice  work there though we were casual for very long time  and they would promise to register us  as full time workers but we would end up being told that there were changes every time they would promise and change the last time we end up losing jobs as casuals they say they only need permanents after we've dedicated our lives for years
bad,"- Rapid changes in the market "
bad,Management was confused they couldn't stay on the same page with employees. There were some employees that should have fired but weren't and could everyone else to have pick up the pace.
bad,Reaching goals was difficult because roles were not clearly identified.  Too much work to complete in a normal day and it is necessary to complete admin work at home after hours.
bad,"I'm a Brampton employee and a union member ( which is not an advantage if you're not a senior employee). The place had a very bad culture union is made up of all senior employees who put policies in place that are self serving to them and there alike. Not to mention the poor middle management staff made up of Supervisors with little or no experience. That are straight out of school and have no people skills or experience. And Managers that don't manage. It's a wonder how the place is still going. Between the bad supervision,  the lazy employees , self serving union, the lack of training for the production teams and the people taking advantage of the overtime. I'm amazed that the place hasn't been shut down yet!. Coke was always on my bucket list of places to work for,  but now that I'm  here it's left a bad taste in my mouth 😥."
bad,Job is good pay but very hard on your body and back. You need to have seniority to get anywhere in this company. If you want to work up to 60 hours a week non stop work then this is the place to go.
bad,A good job if you are straight out of school. gets you some quick monday and mon-fri allows you to have free weekends. but poor pay means it wont be a career sticking with.
bad,"when i first started to work for coke it was a joy. i loved going to work everyday and i did anything asked of me until i started to notice i was being used and abused. a job is for me to pay my bills but also to enjoy what i do. the management turned sour when favors wasn't returned. the system is built for the satisfaction of the company, no one really cares about the employees until it causes the company money."
bad,"The management lies and they work you like robots, but if your body can take it you'll make decent money.  The San Diego location is closing down soon and you can tell its going down hill there."
bad,"Been a driver for almost 20 yrs.  This is the worst I've ever seen it. The difference between then and now, is that they use to hire within and it really was a great place to work at. Lots of happiness and things ran more smoothly because they knew what they were doing. Now..... Majority of management have degrees and education, but have zero beverage experience. We as drivers know more than them. They try to tell you what to do, but don't even have class A licenses.  They put more work on the ones who work and baby the ones who don't.  Zero accountability for the lazy ones and no acknowledgement or appreciation for the ones who do it all. The morale at this moment is at its worst. Use to be a happy great place to work for. At this time I would not advise anyone to look for work with this company. Let me clarify that not all management is bad, but I'd say 95% are terrible.  The blind leading the blind. Total chaos  and lots of head butting!!!!!  I feel this is the majority of the problem. BAD MANAGEMENT!"
bad,not an overall bad job. you can make alot of money working here. Management is not very friendly and most employees have an I don't care attitude. If you want to make good money and be miserable at your job this is the job for you.
bad,This job was within the call center. my daily duties were spent answer phone calls and trying to retain customers that where endanger of leaving to the bank
bad,"I was very comfortable with the work hours assigned to me, they benefited me in my family life. I learned a great deal about the company's culture. The coworkers I was placed with were eager to train me in the correct manner. The manager for the area I was placed in , Marcelino, was a great mentor and promised me advancement in the company. Due to structural changes within his area and out of his control, he was unable to fulfill the advancement so I had to search for a better job opportunity with a better financial benefit for me and my family. "
bad,"As relief my day starts pretty slow but there is still plenty to do. Since it is a can plant, sometimes I'll have to use the forklift to provide lids or dump trash cans full of bad cans. I have learned that teamwork helps to make the workload easier so it raises morale, also the work is completed faster. It can be frustrating dealing with management because you will hear one piece of information from one person and a contradicting piece of information from another, the supervisors do not communicate well enough even though they have plenty of forms of communication (radio, email, phone, texting). My coworkers vary, some are hard working, some get by doing the minimum and some don't show up for work most of the time but for those who are there, they work very hard and are very knowledgeable about the machines that they operate. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the union and the rule of seniority, being a new hire means that a lot of extra hours can be forced on me with little to no notice because I am the lowest on the totem pole so to speak. Although the most enjoyable part of my job is the fact that working there allows me to provide for myself quite well."
bad,Long hard days with troubles and a bunch of people expecting you to bow down to them.
bad,Provides great knowledge in retail and merchandising. Great learning experience.
bad,"-Straight forward job"
bad,A empresa trabalha muito por apadrinhamento e nao por resultados. A empresa e boa mas seus geistores nao sabem se impor ..essa atual gestao nao presta.
bad,it was ok just didnt fit me most of the time you worked harder than the pay you got and the equipment wasnt  up to date or function right which made the job harder
bad,If u don't have a degree like me . U will advance to a certain point and be moved laterally when u top out with no degree. Other than that it is a great first job so a young person can learn how to work in a team and as an individual. Money is great and overtime is available most of the year
bad,"typical day in warehouse consisted of making sure the pallet jack was operational"
bad,"work usually more than 50 hours of hard labor. mandatory holidays, good job if you are just out of high school and looking for an easy check but after that not a great ida."
bad,My Job can be very challenging at times but very rewarding. My work is very detail. Handle all South Florida Cruise Lines Account with contacts form other City's and Country's. I enjoy working with people and problem solving.
bad,"Working here was very stressful, lack of leadership, direction or team players. No formal training on any of jobs given, but held accountable for any errors. "
bad,"To many politics, company is so big and afraid of getting sued. So as a manager I was not allowed to push people to work like I work, extremely frustrating when I out work all of my employees."
bad,"Management is at it's all time low, Coca-Cola would be a great company to work for if you could have a coke and a smile. Supervisors don't know how to supervise, they guess at it. Leads are promoted by favoritsm don't know the job. Sometimes have to use your vacation time to make up hours because they switch the schedule around to knock off days.If you can remove the Plant Manager out of the way with his bullying tactics then maybe the job can get done. They hold hands too much and the 90 day rule is never in affect. If the person isn't able to do the job don't keep them, their hurting the team."
bad,Es muy eccigente muy bajo sueldo y mucho trabajo y rol de turnos
bad,"Aside from the most recent corporate restructure, Coke is a very down to earth employer with great possibilities to succeed and strive for a better future."
bad,"Muito conhecida por todos e muito recomendada, uma empresa boa de trabalhar e organizada"
bad,"The management at Coca-Cola is very questionable. They don't care about what anyone has to say or have an input, they do what they want."
bad,"I have some good days and bad days in Coca  Cola but it is all hard work and stressful at time, because we all work long hours and have no time to do anything"
bad,"Taking orders and delivering juice/ smoothies to existing accounts. A lot of drive time, hitting about 9-15 accounts per day. Start time is 4:30 in the morning, and usually done around noon."
bad,Weird Management practices.. Nice thing is you get to work by yourself and generally have leeway with your own hours. No training was provided to me.
bad,The job isn't so bad. I had done it before with Dr Pepper but it just seems the way Coca Cola wants to run things is very backwards. The management isn't very motivating and definitely has a bad habit of favoritism.
bad,Build orders for customers and load them onto empty trailers.
bad,it was job as trainee and not a secure job... i work there quite efficiently but it was only a training job....
bad,"Being an employee at Coca-Cola has been my worst work experience.  They treated their employees like third class citizens.  The working environment was unacceptable, and the lab was not up to standards.  Having  a degree in Chemistry, as well as experience working in various laboratories, I attempted to fix the known problems. I even pointed out the problems to my supervisor, but some of the problems still were never solved.  I have never in my had to work in a laboratory for hours without being able to sit down.  Their were several working stations, with computers, but they did not allow us to have chairs.  When I asked about it, it was almost like I committed a crime against humanity. It was, and still is, a horrible place to work."
bad,"Worked in Minocqua, WI stocking and maintaining soda displays at 3 stores for Coca-Cola. Traveling was enjoyable although I was never compensated for mileage. Days went fast, worked with numerous other stocking employees."
bad,Stocked shelves with Coca-Cola Products. Learned to drive forklifts. Management seemed like all they wanted to do was find reasons to fire you. Hardest part of the job was abiding to the strict requirements set forth by the overworked salesmen.
bad,Learned a lot about business and customer relationship. Meet some GREAT people.
bad,I really enjoyed it but management and the back stabbing took the enjoyment of working there away from me. I started out as a driver then moved to the fleet shop.
bad,Did my CDL training with this company. They don't treat the employees the greatest so I left after training rather than taking a position
bad,"I have to check sales amount"
bad,"Long days, little pay, good benefits, no consistent communication from supervisors or other team leads. Only care about getting product off truck. No OT, they pay around $8.00 an hour after your 10 hour day. Then if you are out around 13 to 14 hours they cut your OT pay again to around $5-6. The longer you are out the less money you make an hour. They schedule you so you will have longer than 10 days everyday. Only time you can keep up with the time sheet is when you have help. But if your a good worker, good luck getting help. That goes to the slowest person or route specialists. Working on leaving."
bad,"Not Recommended!"
bad,its a good place to work for in abilene one of the best paying jobs in the area with 401k and good benifits it will be a goodr place to retire from as long as you dont get hurt on the job you will be good i tore my rotator cuff and librium and now they are giving me the run around and trying not to give me my job back but we will see how it goes
bad,"""There is so much flexibility with work/life balance that it makes it easy to come into work in the morning"" (in 62 reviews)"
bad,Management is willing to provide the safest PPE for their employees and they also good at taking responsibility towards every aspect that seem having to be nuisance to their employees
bad,"I like and enjoy working there,working hours are good,working environment is good,l like the challenges i phases in the workplace,but unfortunately the changes in the company affects most of us."
bad,"Typical work days very. There are some days where it is quite and you can focus on your work without interruption. Other days it can be extremely busy, jumping from task to task. The management needs to focus and prioritize goals. Management has priorities out of order and unorganized. The culture is poor. Many employees complain about the work conditions and safety. The hardest part of the job is the never ending interruptions. The employees do not care about any task that you are working on."
bad,I would only recommend this job if they got rid of some of the associates they have now. I like working there but not wit the people. They constantly yell out profanity. Some associates drink alcohol and smoke pot on breaks and lunch. They operate machinery under the influence. People argue and yell at each other to the point a fight might break out. People are not held accountable for anything they do. There are no consequences for not hitting your numbers for the day. It's just a free for all in there. Now there are a few awesome employees in there but management needs to get rid of the riff raff. This could be a much better place to work. Also people are driving around on their pallet Jacks talking on cell phones and texting. Somebody will get hurt sooner or later.
bad,"learned a lot about safety, keeping warehouse and employees safe, and teaching others about safety, and how to operate forklifts and pallet jacks"
bad,Not compensated for amount of hours worked. Worked over 12 hrs per day and the compensation is salary
bad,"Inside Sales/Customer service is a AOK department but stay clear of Dispatch they would rather have troublemakers than people who do their job, Its who you know in that department and If you happen to not know anyone you have no room for advancement."
bad,"Great work place, that work good hours has good benefits and mangaement that love to teach new face. the employes work at a fast pace"
bad,At this job I was made many promises. These promises were never kept. I was harassed by other managers not related to my job title. I was also harassed by other employees and the situation was never dealt with. I did not enjoy the environment of this job. I enjoyed working with the stores and the customers but not who I worked for.
bad,"No Guarantee of 40 hrs a week, other than Summer Season. You are home every night which is nice. Hours start at 230 am, off by 12pm"
bad,"Coke makes you work loads of merchandise by your self, in a little amount of time. and if you don't finish be ready to work 10 hour shifts."
bad,en la ruta compartir con los clientas era muy agradable y a otros no pero hay uno aprende a tratar a todo tipo de personas por que el cliente siempre tiene la razón y mis colegas bien todos se apoyaban.lo mejor eran los lanzamientos de nuevos productos´.
bad,"Tinha reunião todos os dias "
bad,trabalhei na arrea da indrustrialozasao de roupas um bom tempo aprendi fazer varias coisa xorte calsa e etc a parte mas difisil foi pessoa q queria mr tira do srvisso pq era uma pessoa hulmide q ajudava a todos .. e a parte mmas agradavel foi o respeito e a sinseridade de todos q eu conhesia e a esperinhesia de trabalho
bad,salario de 1400 a 1700
bad,"What started off as a fun job quickly turns into, literally, a back breaking job. You will be assigned 3-4 stores with everything needing to be done before you leave. While this may be easy at first, you'll eventually be on your own needing to go through anywhere from 4-10 skids. This job destroyed me mentally and I had no life while working it since I'd get home and be too tired to do anything other than eat and go to bed and do it all over again the next day. The definition of never ending. I do not recommend this job especially during the holidays because the orders are huge and you may also need to build displays as well as worry about your other 3 stores that have the same amount of inventory. This is a job meant for two people and that's how it should be. They send you out alone and you will get destroyed mentally and physically. Not worth it."
bad,"Uno de los mejores trabajo que e tenido me gusta mucho competir,buscar soluciones llegar a los objetivos"
bad,Started work early and some days worked longer than 8 hours.  I learned to communicate with different store managers and their staff.  It was a lot of individual work and there wasn't much communication between the manager.
bad,es una buena empresa para trabajar ya que el publico no se cansa de tomar el producto
bad,They didnt have much work after the first two mos i worked there.
bad,"sempre correndo para atingir metas"
good,My time at this coca cola is the worse it has ever been the management is poor at the most then they are hypocritical when it comes to inside promotions.  The management team is so unorganized about how the day goes and will fire you cause they just don't like you and make it seem performance wise.
good,"prior to starting the shift Assign routes to teams and doors, assignment of job functions (for the first quarter hour),"
good,i have worked here for a year. You are never properly trained the equipment you have to work with is pisspoor! Almost all semis have no A/C in 100+ degree weather conditions. Supervisors don't have a clue what they are doing. Pay is ok but not that great. Supervisors have no concern when issues arise.No opportunity for advancement. Once again this is a reflection of the supervisors!
good,no hay estabilidad laboral y la remuneracion para el personal de temporada es pesimoooooo.
good,"Was promised for years that I'd be brought on full time, but they ultimately outsourced positions that I would've been able to fill overseas.  Even took a cut in contractor pay with the belief that I'd be brought into the fold.  I did gain valuable experience working with Powershell and Office 365, but at a great cost during my tenure there."
good,"The compensation does not meet the level of work, the hours worked, or the intensity of the work.  You have to work any where from 5 to 12 pallets of Coke product per store, often times with no additional help."
good,"You work unknown amount of hours daily.  Personal life is nonexistent.  Pay is okay, but could be better.  If you don't desire to have a personal life, then this is the perfect job for you."
good,"To keep this short I've worked as a driver for fifteen years, the last five have been with Coca-Cola, and Coca-Cola at a corporate level takes care of its employees. On the other hand, local management in Arizona only sees its employees as numbers, not human beings."
good,Started out part time but was working full time.  Didn’t get any of the benefits or full time pay. Drove own vehicle but did get mileage between stores.
good,"If your order picking your racing time and wrecking yourself to keep up."
good,"no organization rules are made up everyday 90% of the works act like high school children. upper management is joke, listening in to employees is non existent"
good,"No structure. Customers were rude at the stores. They did not want to check you in in time. Riding with too many drivers, never can get use to one driver before you are with another one. Alot of store would have empty selves but had cases of the sodas already in there while we were bring in more that they already had. Too stressful."
good,"Required to work until the job is completed.  Maintain back-stock and also maintain a positive relationship with store manager.  Long days, manual labor, heavy lifting."
good,Long hours. Rewarding. Definitely had a lack of promotions and career advancements. Enjoyed moving around all day and dealing with different customers.
good,The management sucks !!!!!  The company has good intentions but the wrong people trying to maintain the company ! The benefits are awesome but the compensation could be better (meaning starting pay)! The hours are based on the work load !! U would more than likely hit 40hrs every week
good,"The IT department has zero corporate culture.  Actually, I should rephrase that.  The corporate culture is pretty much 90% Hindi."
good,been working here for almost two years as a order builder the hours are long most of the time the work isn't even in by the time we go in at 3pm. also the supervisors are very low key if you call in because your sick they jump on you even if you go in and explain that you had a long night due to family death or not enough sleep and you tell them i cant work in this condition because you dont wanna hurt someone or yourself they still want you to stay and that shows they dont care for safety and thats the number one rule for warehousing. The pay isnt that good compared to pepsi where they pay 16 an hour once a week and bonuses on each case they pick come one coca cola makes money but cant pay more. the warehouse had a major remodel and they expect us to be at 100% but they said it will be a better layout but its just worse and also no A/C units all they have is fans that rotate hot air never keeps us cool everytime we bring up new A/C units they always laugh. Coca cola is a fine company but they need to get there prioritys first they worry to much about them selfs but employees always come first.
good,"This is a great second job. But if this is the only job that you have, its not worth it."
good,"Very busy taking hundreds of orders from customers all over North America.  "
good,"Everyday is full of difficult task and problems to be fixed or solved. Half the days are taken up by trying to figure out why we can't run,"
good,"Uma empresa sólida, onde a cobrança era o incone principal e que com isso aprnedemos a cada dia mais um pouco."
good,A good place to work with reasonable hours
good,Me always want to do better for my company and seeing for positive results and do work so hard at least of finish my work.just do my job like an assignment.And don't think about time when working for my company fever.
good,"Aside from the mediocre upper management, the workplace is sometimes fun. For college kids, a part time position would be okay, but be ready to get a second job because you won't make much. For someone looking for a full time job and does not have a family to care for, it could be a great place to work but you might need a roommate to afford rent and have a little extra for yourself. It's definitely not for everyone."
good,"Working as a contractor was good, up to the point that we found out our contract holder was paying us less than half as much as we should have been making, and she tried to get us fired from our day jobs because we would not come in and set up free displays."
good,"A typical work day can be stressful depending on what your job title is and the equipment your working with. "
good,Don’t work here unless you have to Management didn’t care about their employees would accumulate points for being sick when the job is very physically demanding
good,You will work hard. You will not get benefits of long term. Company is focused on investor growth vs employee growth. If you are in senior management then this is the company for you.
good,high employee turn around I don't agree the company looks out for the employees. pay rate is great but the stress is as high too. I don't recommend for anyone
good,The biggest issue is the management they have monthly meetings causing their employees to work 13 hours twice in a month. The management only cares about ensuring they get the bonuses that the employees work so hard to get with no thank ever truly given. They force multiple unwilling workers to participate in projects that they don't even know what is going on in I know I did multiple and they had me explain what was going on the whole time what each thing meant and how it helped the company so they could tell the upper management how they are positively influencing their people. The only reason people continue to work here is for the money there is no moving up unless a supervisor favors you.
good,cocoa cola was unfair to me when I obtained  a cdl I wanted to advance to a driver position but they were shorthanded asked me to find my own replacement in order to advane
good,"the problem in coca cola is the supervisors , that they do not take the time to help the drivers. they wont go and see if they need a help to deliver the product to the costumers.. they just want to get their commision."
good,Coca Cola was a good company but didn't stand behind it's employees when it came to problems in the stores. this company didn't have any room for advancements unless you new someone in upper management. work days were never the same
good,"Hard please to work ."
good,"No place for advancement unless your in the office. be prepared for no recognition, inslaved work, not family oriented within the area an facility i was at"
good,"the warehouse is not a great work environment"
good,Constantly lied to by management. forced to take lunch 3 hours into a 12 hour shift with no other breaks approved. Time off for family events were never approved.
good,"Working for long hours and not getting paid hourly is not good at all, so I need a well paying job. There's nothing more to say."
good,An OK job untill you find where you want to be in life. They over work CDL drivers and underpay they warehouse. But the management is less then great so enjoy.
good,пришел без опыта работы всему научили все показали набрался немалому опыту
good,"Good place to work, long hours, and lots of great people, location not so great, no major highways close by, need to use local roads"
good,"If you are looking for a career and opportunity for advancement you need not apply for this one! I have been with the company for 12 years and things just keep getting worse with every change they make. The hours are long, back braking and to management your just a number. Management likes to use the word Team but don't seem to understand what it means. This is a job that sucks the average person in with the pay rate and benefits just to spit you out after you have given it your all. So in closing I say just beware of what your in for."
good,This was the WORST job that I ever had. Management was extremely lazy and expected THE WORLD and they couldnt even provide a peanut. No training and was expected to do my job....WTH!!! They should be reported to someone's labor board
good,"typical day starts at 4 AM in the morning, arriving at your first store and proceeding to the stock room to retrieve Coke's products, to fill the shelves with. What I learned is managers and receivers of stores could care less about vendors and merchandisers, they think of us as lowlifes, limit what we bring into the store, then complain when they run out."
good,"A day for a merchandiser starts early. With Coke, I have been given a route that is 45 minutes away from my home. In Michigan, that can be dangerous during the winter months because of the snow fall. Management only comes out when there is a problem. You don't meet very many other employees that work for Coke. And you don't have to think too much about what you are doing. It is very mindless work. Advancement is available but its to go into production jobs or being a driver which I have no interest in."
good,"Sales and marketing of products, learn how to comunicate and negogiate with diverse cultures. Enjoyed learning and sharing work related issues with colleagues.  Management drove you hard, but I always enjoyed the challenge.  Explaining out of stocks during peak session and strikes. Trived being on the road and interacting with people all day."
good,For a corporate position the environment does not seem corporate. The dress code changed to business casual and is too relaxed. People do not stick to a professional attire.
good,This Warehouse has very low morale and the supervisors and managment is bad. No room for growth and maturity. The pay does not equal to the work that is performed by the employees.
good,"This position involved handling all sorts of consumer phone calls regarding Coke products and ingredients.  In addition, this division also handled the various promotional offers and advised consumers on how to claim their prize."
good,"their customer service is no longer there, was work before family, worked long hours for little pay"
good,"Not a job fit for me. Day starts at 6am with team meeting on a conference call, listening to other team mates(co-workers) complain about having ""NO"" help and how the group is short handed and other groups aren't. Enter a Walmart, Target, Kroger, etc..Immediately began pulling or breaking down over sized pallets of Coca-Cola products. Hoping to only spend two hours in one store, turns to fours hours. Since their is so much product, with long & deep shelving, and different areas to be filled at certain stores would cause to spend more time then expected. Then your supervisor calls asking ""Why are you still in that one store"". Not to send any help. Oh yes, before I forget when I would call My SUPERVISOR would not answer my calls. Considering the way we communicated were through Blackberry cell phones provided by Coke. On another occasion I called my Supervisor and he told me I had the wrong phone number, knowing that he has called me from the same number I called and that was sent to me in an email with all of his contact info."
good,"started with coca cola though a temp service , started on line one first trial of 89 days ,they would lay u off before 90 days that happened 4 times to me until i moved to Colorado then they called me back to work i did not except the offer to just get laid off after 89th day . the job i did on line one was like a elevator to about 20 pallets "
good,I do not want to review this employer as I do not want my experience to deter anyone from wanting to apply or work for this company.
good,Fast pace working and pick merchandise and load onto pallets
good,"I was put down so much by hire ups, They forgot to stop. It became common place and normal to them. It is a good company to work for. Benefits are OK I guess."
good,"Managers are inconsiderate unless you kiss up and tattle on others.  Ran by the ""good ol boy"" system. Pay and benefits pretty good. Management blame employees and mislead them for things then write them up or fire them. They also force employees to sign off on documents both on paper and electronically without reading or them explaining what we are signing."
good,"I love working here but, pop industry is really slowing down  upper management always changing, no guarantee of work, tell you the day before if u are working or not, work like a dog in summer no work all winter while senior employees still have overtime while you sit at home"
good,"You can learn many things if they will train properly.  Management could be better,  to much favoritism. Paid weekly,  benefits are alright. Need to improve on taking vacation. (Shouldn't have to take a week at a time) !! Need better on hands training."
good,"I can not make a comment, signed papers, so I am not allowed to talk about the plant."
good,"not a good schedule hours and the not a good management system. also, a bad attitude towards workers, and also the workers did not feel good work in this place due to not have enough time to spend with their families."
good,No work-life balance. You work a lot in the office and then work even more when you get home.  Pay was not comparable to other companies and the vacation was not either.
good,Fui motorista e realizava entregas em parte das regiões norte e noroeste fluminense.
good,"With the new vision/mission, it got like crazy.  I have worked with them since 2012 and it was never like this year before.  I have worked now more than 15 hours on a day and also weekends.  Yes, work remotely is good in a way but is also implicated that you need to do what ever is take to get your job done.  Example; working during weekends until 2am, working from a hospital, etc."
good,One can learn a lot about beverage manufacturing and production process and gain a lot of experience while working in the company. Management system is alright.
good,"Process improvement meetings, budgetary meetings, interviews, director conference calls to go over regional statics calls to perform best practices and lessons learn to increase more efficiency."
good,I was forced into extreme overtime when I excepted Filler position. I was told we are getting more Filler Operators after 1 year still the same 15 + hrs a day.
good,Demanding work environment that was in constant flux and change resulting in inefficiencies in the workplace that could have been avoided if they spent more time at long term planning.
good,"When I started working for Coke 7 years ago, I thought it was a great company for minorities due the promotion we do in our commercials and advertisement about multicultural. Since being part of Coke I have noticed more minorities lay off, terminated, or underpaid than Caucasian Associates. Coke really needs to look at how they are promoting multicultural when majority of the company minorities are being laid off, terminated, and underpaid."
good,Would love to work there again with different management. harassment was abundant which caused me to resign. I was uncomfortable but I enjoyed my job.
good,"No job security horrible working conditions within the department's and shifts but the pay and benefits were appeasing.  You could move around within department's,and work independently."
good,this company does not balance work and ;family. the work load has tripled over the past few years but my pay has only increased 3 dollars p/h. in 8 years.
good,"started my days at 3:00am and normally did not get off work until 5:30/ 6:30 pm. Drivers given great work life balance, but supervisory position employees not so much. Would not have been so bad if we were paid hourly."
good,Working progress is constant which makes your day go by quick. Supervisors are good but management will ruin your day. New people are not trained properly on the equipment that's used to work with.
good,"Very difficult work environment.  Management never seems to know how to proceed   Business model constantly changes, and eventually goes back to the original model."
good,"Working at Coca-Cola is exhausting, lots of hours, little help, no communication, bad leadership. The job wouldnt be too bad if everyone worked together."
good,the don't hire good people. do not care if other can't do there jobs because they will find someone  to do it for them.The hard workers work hard an the others get away by just saying I don't know how to.
good,"a typical day at work begins at 530 am, and can last until 4pm or later, depending upon volume and other factors. The opportunities for advancement within the company are minimal at best, as I have applied for a promotion 6 times and was only interviewed once, and not even in my home plant. Long hours and hard work, as the product is not easy to carry/move around. the most enjoyable part of the job was the relationships that I was able to build with store personnel, but dealing with our management was a crapshoot to say the least"
good,"Good training if you are set up with the right trainer. Long hours, so don't expect to do an actual 8 hour shift. Back breaking.  Little supervision which could be a good thing. There will be times when you have to service a store that has a load that day and you have to do it in two hours and also they will give you more stores even if you have 15 minutes left of your shift. Don't take the position as an extra or seasonal, because they will not tell you what you can or cannot do. They will work you as a full timer without the benefits and you will also only get 2.5 days of sick time a year."
good,Exceptionally talented team members who are very knowledgeable.  This market unit was going through some restructuring so the chaos was to be expected.
good,A typical day would be starting off at 4 am and driving across San Diego services varies grocery outlets and retail stores stocking coca cola products within the outlets.
good,"No life balance mandatory 12 hours everyday with impossible standards, you even get mandatory on your  day off to come in. Management is looking for any excuse to fire you. Every day it was like going to war instead of work. They work you like an immigrant with no papers they break your back, stay away from this company if you want to healthy and live longer, it's not worth it"
good,"No at home life, no guaranteed days off. Issues with communication with management. No structure to the business. No certain ways to do any job."
good,I was with the company for 10 years hardly ever missed time showed up every day but one you have one little misunderstanding that you try to correct means nothing. once you have a target on your back your done with the company no if ands or buts. I'm not saying its with all the coke distributors just the one I was with. no chance to advance up management is always right your always wrong. the money is good the other employees are awesome its just to bad that management only cares about themselves. when they tell you your on a team unless your upper management your not.
good,"Due to re franchising efforts, the Company is going through perpetual change. Great parent Company, The Coca-Cola Company, but times are changing and you have to watch your back at all times since restructuring has become the day-to-day norm and not the exception. "
good,"Работая водителем-экспедитором 2012 по 2015 год зарплата за данный период не поднималась, хотя должностные обязанности вырастали в геометрической прогрессии:ассортимент продукции увеличился в 1,5 раза, кол-во максимальных точек доставки выросло с 25 до 45 в день учитывая то что компания грузчиков не предоставляет,никакой стабильности в решениях руководства компании. Вывод от компании в которую я устраивался 3 года назад не осталось и следа (одно только название)."
good,Management is not for the good of the people that keeps the wheels spinning for Coke. Between pay changes and overworking of the employees coke has becoming a very unpleasant place to work. There has been several employees with opportunities to move up in the company but was stop at first step because they need them to put drinks on the shelves instead of allowing them to better themselves. It used to be you get rewarded for the hard work of putting drinks up but now upper management either doesn't know or don't care hard it is to move all that product and not get paid what they desire.
good,"Not what I was described, nor is it what I thought it would be.  The concept is great but the delivery is very lacking.  No consistency, not very much person to person interaction, more electronic responses.  No real direction when you are new, very little interaction with management."
good,"Our products are everywhere and, hence, your career can go anywhere. From every geography to every function, Coca-Cola has expertise and opportunity."
good,"Physical hard work."
good,my typical day starts with making sales reports then my customer making sure i call them and find out if they recieved thier orders if not place them again and make sure they get them
good,"Decline to comment, no need to put short comings and other facts about this location"
good,"Managed and directed daily activities of checkers, loader/unloaders and equipment operators"
good,I worked here and when giving them my 2 weeks they fired me management was rude and benefits wasnt  great at time
good,"For working 14 hrs a day, you were reward with an incrementally smaller paycheck. The saying is true, 10% of the employees created 90% of the problems."
good,"Coca-Cola Refreshments in Carlstadt, NJ (preferably in the Distribution Dept) could be the ideal place for someone IF they've already had/have distribution/dispatch/shipping as their background.  I was hired on as a temp employee (1 yr. contract) to work in the Distribution Department and found that the amount of work was well beyond manageable - i.e., the work was piled on daily (sometimes with new procedures that even I wasn't aware of or used to doing) with no way of prioritizing the work!  Everything given was considered ""priority"".  Plus, little to no help was given in teaching me how to use their BASIS computing system.  BASIS is new to me, I'd never used it before, and those I worked with were usually too busy to sit and go through the procedures on how to do certain tasks within the system.  I understand that my co-workers were busy with their own duties, and I by no means fault them on that.  BUT, there should have been one person/co-worker who should have been asked to sit with me to train me on the system."
good,This was the worse job I have ever had the route manager doesnt know squat he is terrible doesnt know how to talk to people I worked there 6 months and the turnover is terrible because of the route manager
good,"Boa empresa para trabalhar, dinâmica,  liderança simples e objetiva, Aprendi vários funções administrativa  e comercial,  o plano de saúde  muito bom."
good,"Screaming and shouting from one station to the other work station"
good,"very long hours, they expect too much and set you up for failure. inadequate paid for work. managers and supervisors are unorganized and not on the same page so you here different do's and don'ts from every supervisor and managers so you never know whats ok and whats not. they also have a very high turn over ratio."
good,"Attention to detail fast paced, envirornment with many beverage producing machines. Being a relief operator makes it difficult to maintain a permanent shift. Co-workers are very respectful, while management is very strict on policies. The company is the number one beverage maker in the world, with many locations in other countries. A typical day at work consists of running a machine for the scheduled work day with two breaks and a lunch."
good,Anything you may be told by a recruiter before or during an interview make sure you receive in writing also.
good,co-workers are good people to work with. There are lots of things to learn.
good,"A uma grande pressão no trabalho, onde não temos material de qualidade para efetuar as atividades em rota de distribuição de mercadorias."
good,"Call center, not a very exciting work place. The sups play favorites and not a lot of room for advancement. Demand a lot from their employees in the call center and you take responsibility for other departments not fulfilling their part of the jobs functions"
good,A very physical labor job and the most rememberable part about the job is that I was the only female that worked there.
good,"Comensation is great, expected to stay for o.t last minute, strenuous work, easily let go."
good,No time for a personal life but you will make good money if that is what your after  managers have no clue what they are doing and treat you less than dirt
good,"Mal manejo de personal, no hay enfermería turno nocturno, equipo en mal estado, no hay transporte cafetería sin hora de comida en turno nocturno"
good,"It was an ok job. It just wasnt to the likings of my standards on an enviornment being a career instead of just a work place you show up to, to collect a small check."
good,They forced me to resign because of a discrimination lawsuit. Wish I was still working there. I have video surveillance of a caucasian male wearing a kkk hood and walking around smiling at employees of color.
good,Mucho cliente para tan pocos comerciales y falta de organizacion inerna con gestión de pedidos
good,"•	Sales Forecasting & Planning."
good,"The job itself isn't bad, if you're single with no family then it'll work for you. This company isn't family oriented like they say they are, when you're forced to work 16hrs a day, 75+ hours a week, it takes away from any possibility of seeing your family. I and many of my co-workers were given high hopes being with this company, unfortunately they took it away by laying us off."
good,Team leaders gang to dismiss account manager.unfair enquiry conduct.witnesses against the company are threatened.pre-concluded case against account manager are conducted.Hr not supportive to lower level employees.Company procedure is not followed.Personal vandata is maintained.
good,"Poor leadership if any at all. Bad culture. HR is powerless. If you are not near management in any way, you are screwed. However, all are playing ""all is good"" game..."
good,I worked for 9 years and a typical day was always busy where I learned new skills daily as a technician. the management was fair however the hardest part was lack of advancement.
good,coke coca cola is not in agreement to schedule balance with personel in school or working another job. at the time coke was not compensating employers with benefits or pay according to or asked of the job task.
good,The people that worked there made the time pass by fast. The assistant managers were cool and fun to be around and that didn’t made you more then you had too.since day one they started to show me all the tricks to do my job faster and how to get more stuff done.
good,"donner le maximum de son énergie et potentiel pendant 3ans sans garantie d'obtenir un CDI... "
good,Fue la primer empresa en la que empece a trabajar con AS400
good,"As a salaried employee, I feel that the work/life balance is extremely off, and job security is unstable, as the company is selling off portions of its business to bottlers."
good,"I only worked here part time, and at the time the warehouse manager was a bit controlling. His phrase was ,""It's either my way or the highway."" When he was hired in the conference room he said there's a new sheriff in town."
good,This is a good job if you want money and dont have a family. I wouldnt recommend this job to any college student but if you are just looking for somewhere temporary to have cash its good.
good,Stack cases of soda on pallets load into a truck to have it sent to the customers and after being done with the work load start cleaning up the warehouse
good,"•	Ensure that a proper level of Coke product is maintained and that the merchandise is displayed appropriately with proper signage and favorable shelf placement."
good,"This was a stressful position for me. I am sure it has gotten better over the years. The division i worked out of was non union and they really took advantage of that. I worked from dawn to dusk had trouble getting paid for my overtime. Problems where guys always calling off and you had to pick up there slack."
good,"This job should be fun, easy going and worth your time in as a career but with a real lack of leadership and understanding at the management level you are really a pawn for increasing sales (understandably) and part time baby sitter (unfortunately). As you work with several different departments throughout the day at the whim of their requests your requests are often ignored or completed incorrectly. You really are the communication vessel for all things but you have no authority to dictate any persons work direction or quality of service. With real leadership, changes can be made to ensure quality, efficient and satisfactory work and communication to exist. Also, comparatively, compensation is not competitive for the market and valuable training is non existent."
good,"I would call customer who have put in service tickets."
good,Tough environment to work in.  I have enjoyed the working team level and down.  Upper management has not shown the leadership I would have liked to have seen.
good,learn new things each and everyday. patience and great communicating skills. top class management. offloading drinks to the customers but it was great at times. learning how to operate new machines
good,"Working for Coca-Cola has been a learning experience. I would say I have advanced personally, but professionally I have not advanced professionally the way I would like to have in the time I have dedicated to the company."
good,The workers were ok but they were union and I was seasonal.  My job was only from Apr to Oct.  The work was really hard on the body and hours varied from day to day depending on the trucks.
good,Lots of in fighting between departments and little collaboration for the betterment of the company.  One positive was the flexibility of the work schedule and ability to work from home.
good,This position was only a 2 month contract that went on to 3 months because of many technicians dropping out due to poor Management. Manager did not know answers to simple questions and would not let me proceed with closeting certain tickets that were easy unless he approved first and he was only there 3 days of the week.
good,"Moi truong lam viec chuyen nghiep, lam viec doc lap va lam viec nhom. Duoc tiep suc voi nhieu khach hang khac nhau,..."
good,its not a bad job but pay isnt worth the hard work and you never get recognized for doing a good job. can become overwhelmed with lack of communication from management at times
good,Horrible work environment. Low compensation with room for advancement. I would definitely rate this as one of my favorite places to work based on staff alone. Hardest work I've ever done
good,Depending on your manager the job can be great. I actually have one of the most disliked manager in the department. I also work the worst shift. The job is not complicated but there are times where it can be overwhelming.
good,"You get there around 5 in the morning, you have store managers yelling at you because your products weren't in you bay. The work wasn't hard but the repetitiveness was, you get so sick of doing the same thing so often that it gets to you."
good,management could really use some training in communication and even in the work in general. Managers do not know how to communicate efficiently with employees.
good,i've only work in coca cola only when they needed me. sometimes the hours are too long but the work is hard and the salary was not that good. but i enjoyed working there because i can go to any places
good,"a typical day is 10-12 hours"
good,"Unpredictable work schedule/hours. Management is only out for themselves, and that is the same with co-workers. Typical day at work includes dealing with impatient customers and store management, having to wait on delivery trucks, and having to work behind your co-workers."
good,Job is basically moving cases of soda from the back room to store shelving and building displays that change every week.
good,"a typical day would be to go to your assigned route and work back stock and delivered items to the shelves in their tagged locations"
good,"You work primarily on your own with local stores, trying to gain displays, must be organized and self motivated to succeed, high intense job."
good,It was one of my first real so i enjoyed it till i had kids needed more money for my family.i learn  how to drive a fork lift  learn how to be a team player it was lot of fun i say.
good,Nothing really special about this job. Pay is okay but the work is hard. Not much of a balance between work and personal life.
good,"diversas coisas;"
good,Hard manual labor in the warehouse. Very hot in the summer. Does not pay good and benefits are not great. Loved the staff though.
good,"order pulling, pallet jack working, stocking, truck unloading, product wrapping and tagging, good team work, stocking and lifting product, order pulling"
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the people. Do your job and you will be alright. Management changes too often, bringing culture changes that is hard for many employees to adapt.."
good,Very Hard Job 15 To 50 Pallets Each Day Five Stores A Day 10 to 20 Hours A Day Never Get Any Sleep Never Time To Balance A Life Driving All Over The World
good,"Enjoy to drive with my chef in truck. "
good,"Coca-Cola is great to have on your resume.  The benefits are not that great and the pay is awful.  Management seems to have a chip on their shoulder and cannot be trusted.  If you must gain experience, this is the place to do it.  The company is constantly downsizing as this is a dying industry."
good,Good company with great benefits.  I was able to obtain a lot of new job related material and created many lifelong friendships with my coworkers
good,"It would be the perfect job if they had more communication which is a big thing, also because of the union everything is based on seniority and people just starting like me get left for dead."
good,"Great place to work if you are in the union... "
good,Company lacks executive level communication through management chain to efficiently and effectively deliver day-to-day results.
good,"It's a nice secure job with great benefits, but it's bias towards favorites and there is no room for promotion. a typical day is operating your machine and making sure everything is correct."
good,It's simple job for alright pay. It's not difficult but it is a lot of work. The schedule isn't family friendly nor is it a set schedule.
good,"A typical day at my job would include coming into work, cocking to work and proceeding to my pallet jack work working area to have my pre- shift, third- shift briefing. The on shift supervisor will then tell us how much work we have( load size) and how many employees we have working on the shift that night. After that, we will head to our designated working area. "
good,"Start very early morning, daily deadlines, communicate with diverse personalities.  "
good,they need to treat their employees like they really care about them like they say they do
good,company is great but management need better training and communication between staff.
good,"--Once I started doing my duties , everything was OK  "
good,ruim de trabalhar nao fornecia vale nao fornecia nada nao paga bem nem direito  pagava em cheque...trabalhava noturno e nao guanhava adicional ..
good,Find myself doing a lot of work outside of my pay grade.  Glad to have the experience but would enjoy compensation for added workload.
good,Dead end job and career. Physically demanding job. work both indoors and outdoors no matter weather.
good,A typical work day lasted from 10-12 hours a lot of follow up and communication with occasional merchandising work to do. Management there is not easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was enduring a manager that was not friendly and easily angered. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the merchandisers.
good,"1._tipico dia es verificar inventarios"
good,".Coca-Cola is a solid company. I learned quite a bit at Coca-Cola."
good,I was hired as a seasonal employee and would make production every day and do better than all of the full time employees. I asked to be hired part time because they were short in staff but they declined even though I was one of the best workers there.
good,"i liked driving for coca-cola, fellow drivers were well liked, wasent enough work"
good,empresa exelente de trabalhar
good,A typical work day consisted of being at work at 4am and work product loads onto the sales floor. I learned how to effectively work with store management and maintain a great client relationship. I rarely interacted with co-workers because I had my own store route. The hardest part of this job was waking up at 3am. The most enjoyable part of this job was being given the responsibility of maintaining store account relationships.
good,too many managers putting people into multiple different directions.
good,Coca Cola allowed me the opportunity to learn how a warehouse enviroment functions
good,Good place to work to but corporate culture is just average.
good,Long hours not real cut off time but work is ok for the amount of pay
good,Great work place to work was my first job and great employees
good,"Doing layoffs every 6 months for the past 4 years. Doing more with less people, half the time there is not enough work other half overloaded and expected to work overtime."
good,Great benefits work environment could be much better. Management should be more understand of workers and the strenuous task at hand. Sometimes it just get task done no matter we are talking about people not robots.
good,"Loving Coca-Cola, their iconic brands and legendary marketing is not the same as working there. If you are ok with playing following the leader who you can never question about strategy or tactics and don't mind that the company reorganizes its self every 3 - 4 years, this is the place for you. While I was there the company, took away benefits, reduced stock options for mid-level executives, got rid of company cars, stopped paying for home office expenses, started charging employees for company bottled beverages and laid off hundreds. The worst is in their effort to appear diverse, they have promoted some of the worst cat scratching women and minority leaders who are killing employee engagement while incidence and market share declines."
good,"You will never be able to change the culture, you just have to follow the processes.  Many things are set in place and you have to follow established procedures."
good,"Mi trabajo era con una agencia de promotoras que tienen convenios con la coca, el trabajo era bastante bueno y buen pagado."
good,The pay is the best for around this area. The amount of hr per week usually 40+ you will get over time. When first starting shifts will be all over. Could have all 3 shifts in one week.
good,"It's an ok place to work, good if you are a part time student, the hours are flexible, there are shift bids so that helps if you are in school or have small children that need to get to school."
good,The Leadership Team assembled post refranchising is at best lacking in strategic vision and at worst struggling to manage the remaining business for the future.
good,"Don’t really have much to say about this job, other than the fact that I made a lot of money but spent majority of my time trying to balance family time"
good,TCCC is a prestigious and well-known company that encourages staff development and long term employment. Repetitive tasks set the tone of the day completing calls to customers and meeting with management staff to determine the correct path in projects. There are many events within TCCC that encourage healthier living and environment awareness which the company has in their mission statement.
good,"I  worked at the company in Bronx, NY for 10 years. The Company is a good company overall. The management in the Bronx are not qualified for their positions. They have experience, but lack logic."
good,Its ok but the new people that come want make as much as person been there. And its a lot of favoritism shown. The mangement could be a whole better but i don't think that would change.
good,very long hours a lot of driving customer service stocking rotating of product dealing with large amounts of money and extra work leading up to the holidays
good,"Great job, too many changes constantly.  Very complicated review system and procedure with the only purpose of “justifying” changes or dismissal. Creative writing trumps work committment and loyalty."
good,Coca Cola could be one of the greatest place to work if not for the poor management and treatment of female employees. And if the supervisors did what was necessary to make all employees feel safe in their working environment.
good,"No workday is gonna be the same. Some days you can Work 15 hours, the next day you might only work 5. I learned a lot about the merchandising job field along with a lot about trucks. Management is the downfall of the company although there are a few good ones. The culture within the warehouse and driver side is very good. Merchandising not so much due to lack of interaction. The hardest part about it would easily be just the manual labor on a daily basis. From lifting sodas all day to dealing with truck problems, delivery problems etc. Also dealing with customers and managers everyday can be a pleasure one day and difficult the next."
good,"Was able to work lots of overtime and ask many questions. Located in Northampton, MA made the long hours worth my time there. Some really nice people to work with and loved my manager who made the time there better."
good,in April ben ik mogen starten als Interim bij Coca-Cola in Anderlecht. Heel fijne werkomgeving. Helaas was mijn interim contracte van bepaalde duur. Maar alle ervaring is mooi meegenomen.
good,"Great employees, very fast paced job, fun learning how to work with a team and also operating stand up forklifts. Learning how to build and stacking coca cola products was amazing."
good,"Empresa não foca nos funcionários."
good,"a good company, good benefits ,hardest part of the job is running more than one department and less remuneration. I've learned team work,leadership and communication skills"
good,"As a call center manager it is very fast moving, with multitask to complete work tasks. Must be effective communicator to be able to coach your advisors. I have learned it is very hard to manager a group of 30 advisors and make sure all calls are receiving highest quality customer service. The work place culture is very nice with all the soda you can drink from the Freestyle machine, ping pong table with WII and Xbox. The employee engagement is very good with end of year party. The hard part of the job is delivering performance counseling to advisors. The most enjoyable part of job is communication with the advisors and offer career counseling and life skills coaching to them."
good,"Une très bonne entreprise après c’est-ce que en font nos dirigeants  et managers  il y a des équipes épanouies le manger écoute et entend l’equipe Et d’autre c’est très difficile manager trop rigide ne pas oublier sans l’equipe le manageur et rien et les résultats ne sont pas présent. "
good,"fast paced, never caught up, management was helpful at times, culture was diverse, best part of job, schedule, worst part getting paid by commission, not consistant"
good,"This company is in a state of transition and is looking to reestablish its identity.  The Coca-Cola Company is undergoing business transformation exercises making it a stressful environment.  In addition, the principles the Company is striving to embody is not natural within many parts of the Company."
good,I like working here pays the bills mind my own do my job and go home.Never had any major problems.just disagreements on how work is done learned really quick to fix your problems do not wait or depend on help be quick on your feet always stay ahead of the game.
good,No comment - refreshment is no longer as it was brought out by CCBCC.  Very stressful to work for CCBCC.  It’s a very different culture to work for. Think twice
good,"I really enjoy working with the employee under me, I have built a very good working environment in all jobs I have had. I'm a people person. Also I care very much for the all employee and try to make the workplace an enjoyable setting."
good,I worked for this company as a forklift operator and if you are not doing it for the paycheck ..find another company..managment is horrible..they expect 100 percent production but give you faulty equipment as well as inadequate training to try to obtain it..in 12 hours you get one 30 minute break at my former location..the coworkers are brown-nosers..they promote a culture of step on the next to move a inch. I would never work for this company ever..first job i ever felt great about quitting
good,Some times unorganized  in management with information for employees pertaining things needed for work and needs. The people that I work with make great coming in but sometimes I feel like I'm being used and not appreciated.
good,coke is a fast paced job its not a job if you like to be relaxed at work you are constantly moving . its a job that you only have a start time you will never know when you are getting off
good,"After the recent purchase of Coca-Cola distributors, it was hoped that things would improve. Instead, a succession of demeaning policies, mandatory work on holidays and low pay ensued. It's a shame, this really had potential."
good,"High expectations with poor work/life understanding.  Every day you have to prioritize to find what mandatory objectives have to be left undone, unless you want to work 12-14 hour days. Very poor team work between departments with priorities at odds with each other.  Other departments have zero consequences for not completing their jobs witch falls to the Account Manager to pick up what they left on top of your function."
good,"The red tape and all the rules/regulations were ridiculous to me. They dinged you for every little thing. the QA process made it very difficult to get a passing 'grade' to earn the bonuses. The people at the center I worked in were absolutely great however. Some of the nicest and most helpful, friendly people I've ever worked with. They made it bearable for me."
good,over worked and under paid. they needed someone without a life outside their company to work for them and i have a family and a kid and at the time i was taking care of my aging mother
good,"The job itself wasn't difficult, but the frequent last minute overtime made have a healthy balance between the job and life very difficult or nonexistent."
good,"Main supervisor not in maintenance mind. works to keep production happy no matter what it does for maintenance  workers."
good,too stressful and kept loading more and more work onto employees. No work life balance because you were working 6 and 7 days a week so no time with your family.
good,"Represent the first stage of escalation for Incidents through SCCD and Standard Operating Procedures set by Amtrak policies. Monitor the workload per Tier 1 and 2 Analytics. Monitor the incidents to ensure that the Service Level Agreement and ITIL Principles are respected. Identify, initiate, schedule and conduct incident reviews basic on Amtrak SOP’s. Ensure the closure of all Resolved, SLAholds, Queued, Pending, New and IN-progress end-user confirmed Incident records"
good,Poor middle mgmt.  Ave benefit package. Lots of overtime. Constant restructuring. No job security.  Newly renovated business campus.  Reasonably priced food with variety of choices.
good,Compensation and benefits are average.  Too many re-organizations within the company in the past 13 years and more job losses to occur in the next couple of years.You never know if your job is on the chopping block next.
good,Very busy work schedule but exposure to extremely dynamic and challenging projects. Good place to work to learn new things. Overall total rewards could be better.
good,The company has been around for many years so job security is there.  It's very difficult to advance in the company if you're an employee.  The company hires outside candidates for positions as opposed to promoting within.   The leadership lacks solid leadership skills and communication is very null and void.
good,Management is disorganized and will not appreciate your efforts. They will not enforce rules for employees that do not fully complete their job but are strict on the employees that strive to complete assignments fully.
good,"It is a great company for name recognition, company is currently going through a reorganization and eliminating numerous departments. Company is selling off distribution to bottling companies."
good,"management did not care about anything except end of month counts. early days. late nights. if you get good sometimes you could get home on time or early, but very rarely."
good,Good job for a short timer. This really isn't a place to hope to advance anytime soon. This is a very stressful job for the little pay that it provides. The hours are not steady at all.
good,"Pros:  Decent benefits and good job security and opportunities for advancement.  Good people.  "
good,"Been there 3 years now and have seen many leadership changes. The job is Flexible, but constant changes in way to go to market and ultimately very little area for long term growth. If you are a woman and rub elbows with the right Managers you have an opportunity to get promoted."
good,"Start working at 5am around 15 stops 500 cases. Great benefits always busy, didn't like collecting cash in some dangerous neighborhoods."
good,The management at the job wasn't really appealing. Everyone seemed to be out for themselves it wasn't really a team orientated job. A typical day at work we had a meeting at the beginning of the schedule. We went and got our equipment and we began to work .
good,Its a great company to work for.  I have enjoyed working here and interacting with the customers and employees.I have learned a lot about this industry and after spending over 7 years in sales and happy to have been given the opportunity to learn the product supply side of the business.
good,i hated this job but due to more of a personal reason jus had a daughter you work every holiday not enough time in the day to do what the company wants you to do and if trucks are late your the one that has to pay for the lateness
good,"Na atual empresa pude desenvolver a parte de Controladoria Orçamentária, o que agrego-me bastante conhecimentos. Somando a minha grande experiência na área financeira."
good,start by driving to my first stop and clocking in on my work phone and calling to check in with my supervisor. management doesn't manage employees properly. the hardest part is when someone calls out.
good,Foi um emprego onde me motivei para ascenção profissional trabalhava muito e salário muito abaixo do esperado.
good,"It is not the same company it once was. A lot of politics. Less about the people, more about the money. On average, the company pays 20-30% less than most other major companies."
good,была компания отличная пока не начались массовые сокращения переход в аутссординг
good,"Low pay for Part time and no benefits,Built on the backs of Part Timers as a Merchandiser be prepared to run into all sorts of complications on a day to day basis with Store Managers, hourly employees, and deliveries. Remember to smile when a store manager comes up to you while your stocking a cooler and reminds you you that when your done to remember to shut the door or the drinks wont cool properly. It is what it is....... they are always hiring witch is refreshing!"
good,"Work was good. Learned few things in short duration of the project."
good,"There is some poor management in place, and not pratical application of EEO compliance.  There are also too may realignments and restructures to enable employees to have a sense of job security."
good,Once new union contract was enforced driver seniority went out the window which upset most drivers who had years on the job
good,"An average day is spent with customers and accounts discussing trends and goals, then encouraging them and showing them ways to better improve those trends and goals."
good,Most will lable as good company to stand by but seems like all their people are held to a standard which is expected but it seems as though they take as their loyal employees to be expendable and get by masses that comes thru as a revolving cycle
good,"Very fast paced environment."
good,"A typical day at work started at 3am and ended at 3pm and was always filled with high level logistic decisions to be made. I learned a lot with our new CONA operating system. Management of the operation was a challenge. Co-workers were very helpful and knowledgable. the hardest part of the job was staffing issues. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with a very motivated workforce that backed the brand 100 percent,"
good,"days are spent running from one account to the next fixing the same problem day in and day out."
good,this company will train you and advance you as much as you are willing to do. Not much of a work life balance. Company not quick to respond to requests for help or to supply materials needed to run an operation.
good,"A empresa Coca Cola de Simões Filho, do grupo Solar Refrigerantes S/A"
good,"The Coca Cola Canada organization is great to learn the ins & outs of a top tier consumer packaged goods.  The marketing department is likely the most value added group as they get to deal with the long term direction of great brands."
good,The building is up of mostly older individuals with 10+ years experience. High turnover rate in the merchandising and sales departments. Mainly due to low pay or a amount of work to wage ratio. Most management is solid with a couple weak areas. This facility is quite dated and the software is notably lacking. No IT department on site or facility maintenance. Imbalance of workload among staff.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is being able help resolve an issue for my customers.  I have learned more about being a leader in my current role.
good,"Being a multi billion dollar company I expected more.  More for the employees, more opportunity for advancement, better pay...."
good,I am currently working as a contractor but I do know that Coca-Cola offers great benefits to the permanent staff members.  Lots of room to learn and grow with this organization if you are a permanent member of the organization.  Work days are busy and co-workers are helpful and friendly.
good,This was an interesting job that I loved dearly at times and hated dreadfully at other times.  Work was fast paced and rewarding.
good,"Everyday I come into work, and I am very active for my entire shift. I am responsible for ensuring the quality of the products we produce at our facility. Since being employed here, I have learned how to openly communicate with higher management professionals, work independently, and I have become familiar with various computer programs. "
good,Results driven and complex workplace.  This organization is results driven and employees are tracked closely against scorecards which promotes friendly competition.
good,"Working for Coca Cola has been a learning experience. While they do take care of the customers needs very well, the employee side is a bit lacking."
good,Nice work environment and cool coworkers. supervisor is the best and part time hours make my ascheduke very flexible! There are some very bust times nd at other times it is very slow so it about evens out.
good,They don't value people in this company and care only for short term results
good,This job was cool most of the people who work there wee okay except management. if you have a wife stay away the girls most of them have no class they will try to ruin your home.
good,I deal with customers all day and sell new products on the phone..  I've leaned the way an extremely corporate company works along with the fact that I'd like to be with a more employee friendly atmosphere.  I’m willing to move for the right position.  I have numerous years in the beverage industry with outside sales though working for Coca-Cola now as an inside sales specialist due to various reasons.  I have excellent references from my previous employers and distributors. Please take the time to review my complete resume and contact me if you would like to discuss a position as I would very much like to get back into the adult beverge industry with which I’ve had a great deal of success in the past.
good,Horrible place to work management doesn't care that you have a family there is no balance between job and home life. To them work comes before anything they don't respect you as an individual and management refuses to come help on big projects.
good,"Always think and exercise safety at all times."
good,"Co-workers are wonderful.  Workload was excessive.  Other departments had time for fun activities, but not my department."
good,"Nos dois primeiros anos de empresa (Coca-Cola Guararapes), quando a mesma ainda tinha 100% de gestão da The Coca-Cola Company, posso dizer que estive numa empresa fantástica, apaixonante, onde o ritmo de aprendizado e aquisição de conhecimentos é muito intenso e leva qualquer profissional dedicado a um grande up grade no seu currículo."
good,"I see the potential with the company. The people that work here are phenomenal, and truly embody everything you want in a company. The structure is constantly changing, but employees seem to adapt well. The culture/morale has been low, but has been improving, and going in the right direction."
good,"we were required to get 15 new outlets per quarter, which was communicated to us last quarter of 2013. first quarter of 2014 we were required to acquire 15 new outlets. second quarter they changed the metrics to successful after acquiring 18 new outlets for new business."
good,Culture is of tenure above ability. I found myself reporting to senior management that spent decades but short of sharpness you would expect from leadership. Often can get frustrated with lack of career progression.
good,The overall workplace for Coca Cola has been on a continual downward slope for the past 5 years.  To advance you no longer feel secure in a position and you also have no support from management.  Your job is dependent upon others below you and they will often fail you because of the lack of supervision in departments.  Coke will continually change your bonus structure and keep the way you earn your bonuses in the gray area
good,"rotating product, stocking shelves, setting up displays, filling and rotating coolers, breaking down pallets, organizing the over flow in the receiving area, and assisting store employees and customers."
good,"Workin at coca-cola was very productive and fun,i enjoyed workin there and enjoyed my job as a truck driver,i got to travel alot and meet new people,see different places and build good customer relations.workin there over the years realy built a good character in me because i worked with many different people and had to treat each one as individualy.The responsibility of being a truck driver at coca-cola was humbling and taught me alot about responsibility and being the best you could be."
good,The people are great the company itself operates as if they are going out of business.
good,"Replaced a training development member in the middle of the development phase. Developed Quality management materials."
good,"I was only a seasonal worker here and my assignment ended."
good,Mirar envases ya que no desempeñaba mi cargo como tecnologo
good,My work day would start at 5 a.m Sunday- Thursday I had two main accounts to deal with Wal-Mart and Kroger. On a daily basis i would stock the shelves and coolers with soft drinks and make sure my area in the back room was cleaned before I left the store. I learned how to be more oraganized as a person and most of all patience with coustmers and employees. I became more of a people person because in that type enviornment everyday. Ive worked with some outstanding co-works and some I became great friends with. The hardest part of the job was being at work at five a.m every morning. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping my salesman make orders for the stores.
good,"nao  cumpriu  oq  foi  prometido  nao  é  sencivel  com  pob"
good,"Go to work at 4Am start driving by 4:15Am. Drive a loaded 53 foot trailer of cases to drop off and stock at stores, then get back to the before 6pm. Usually wouldn't make it until 7:30pm because of the amount of cases they give to one worker and expect them to be able to do everything within 6 hours. "

good,working at coke cola has been a learning experience both negative and positive.
good,"I feel like the Management team did not care for the hourly employees as far as: Shift changes, there are no set shift hours. All employees come in AM and most days would get off in the next AM."
good,"Depending on your position, will result in the jobs and amount of work you will have to input. Must have a reliable vehicle and travel. Mostly working longer than an 8 hour shift"
good,If you work in the Atlanta Corporate office expect to be laid off.  They let all the good workers go.  They extend some people and not other KEY people. The rules are applied inconsistently.
good,They worked you long hours and low wages if you didnt work long hours you didnt make any money there was always a big turn over  never had the same people there to work with
good,"Working in a union is not beneficial. Protection for lazy people doesn't agree with me. The company in a bigger aspect is great, the animosity created because of a union is not a comfortable work environment."
good,"Great pay, good benefits, long hours in a confined warehouse environment with many other employees. Fast-paced production at times doing mundane tasks, a lot of downtime spent cleaning other times.  Mandatory Saturdays with little notice.  Management changes frequently. Required safety meetings."

Was hoping to retire at TCCC, but unfortunately I am back within the job market. The management could be more transparent sooner rather than later with the employees about changes that could impact them."
good,"Coca-Cola Downey is the largest production facility in North America, My primary function as a Dispatcher is to set and monitor almost 60 Class A Drivers. I very much enjoy solving or suggesting logistic solutions to help the products move from location to location. I believe my work ethic and experience makes the work easier and more efficient."
good,"Empresa excelente , pagamento em dia."
good,Ser um funcionário terceirizado nesta empresa é sofrer todo tipo de rejeição e preconceito e descriminação
good,Management was unresponsive to issues in the company and not willing to take ideas of how to fix it. I work there for 17 years and only in the next few years after managers from lego took over the warehouse and new management was implemented that the company started to fail.
good,"I learned a lot at Coke, but the culture and management are not very good. The company is all about growth and people are not helped to advance in their careers based on merits."
good,this company is only for the people that dont have a future coca cola southwest beverages employs people with no skills the work life balance does not work
good,"I enjoyed my time with the company, but waves of layoffs where you are reduced to a number by the bean counters is horrible and can be devastating to those impacted.  I understand keeping shareholders happy, but the impact on the people affected is real..."
good,Have a meeting and the non stop work. When the team need you the most all the top pullers go home with no points added to them and the manager points and tells them good job while everyone has to stay later.
good,Job was ok they don’t really take care of the second n 3rd shifts  no real leaderships and everybody likes to point fingers when something goes wrong .
good,Company has no interest of employee advancement and growth no matter how well you perform. It's about who you know not what you know. Company has sold all locations nationwide as franchises which are now consolidating jobs.
good,"move very heavy loads of merchandise, work very early mornings, little to no help with completing work, very little time to complete task that were needed of you like moving crates from back of store to front of stores in order to restock shelves."
good,"I was excited to work for such an iconic organization when I started, but the company lost it's way and it didn't treat it's worker very well. Once you got to a certain age you were no longer considered for advancement."
good,"If you don't need continuous employment or have a secondary income  this job maybe hard for you. Pay is fair but definitely not consistent until after the first 5 years, safe side."
good,"make sure you have enough supervisors and staffing to handle the work load, many issues will arise that you cannot take on by yourself, you have to be good at delegating task."
good,"CCR is a great company to work for if your job lies in higher paid positions. Working in equipment services is high stress, with very little reward or recognition for personal accomplishments. No room for advancement, and moving into new positions within the company is difficult."
good,"Company is constantly changing managers and putting different people in charge, most people aren’t properly trained. Not enough people doing the job leading to us being overworked."
good,Plenty of opportunities to advance in many different field/areas within the company. The pay was horrible I'd milk the clock and could barely pull off a 40 hour work week.
good,There is a re-organization every couple of years and they spend 6 months 'gearing' up for it and work stops. 
good,Very fast paced job.Building displays takes time and a lot of know how.Management is fair.The hardest part of the job is pulling pallets and building displays correctly.
good,Empresa com poucas oportunidades de crescimento pessoal e profissional.
good,"Nothing special, it was a job. Their calling system was bad and had major issues. System would go down or make random calls that were not set up for or would allow you to change"
good,"No work/Life balance. Only Business. Non-Union employees (Supervisors) were not allowed Holidays off. Business was only focus. Very difficult culture, constant changing of operations caused Union issues, inturn made front line management jobs difficult. Supervisors held accountable for those changes they had no control of."
good,"Learned how to balance and manage different accounts.  Sold based on what was needed and who needed what.  I enjoyed my time with Coca Cola, but as time went on, the vision and goals truly changed to something that I did not truly stand for."
good,I worked shifts and I was a palletiser operator and my duties where to keep my my machine well maintained and clean.we worked a 12hour shift 6-6 we worked in teams in the production line
good,Overall it was a good career while I worked there they relocated I had 21 years there I became a leadman I helped in safety meetings so it was good to me while it was there
good,Shift regularly worked 12+ hours and overtime was mandated so we were working 6-7 days a week. no vacation for first year. and once offered due to blackouts around holidays and busy season you were at mercy of having to schedule when longer tenured people were not taking theirs. Around Holidays 7 days before and after we were able to be scheduled for 16 hour days.
good,no son capaces de responder la solicitudes del trabajador y cuando la toman piden algo a cambio
good,I split this job into two different jobs due to the roles I had while at the company. This would be the same as the previous information that I stated.
good,It was okay till we were told that the company was bought. A lot of benefits were scrapped out and the moral of the employees was shattered. And being kept in the dark about developments that affected the staff was not ok.
good,"A lot of travel for not a lot of pay. If you want the feeling of not accomplishing anything every day, then this is the job for you.  Hard work while racing a clock to make sure you get your orders in before the day ends is not for everyone."
good,"Nice company and it's my favourite company I am working with this company nice time spend in this I am working with Agra sales and marketing services ."
good,Not a good job. Pay is bad and so is management. Was not happy working here. Appreciated job skill development. Stressful admosphere.........................
good,Nothing to write home about. It was  heavy at times and a decent job. The people who work there are good. The culture is pretty good. Your typical day starts at around 5am.
good,"You might like this place if you are young, and caddy - too much drama.  "
good,"Management usually doesn't care what you have to say. Just go get the job done. Pay is pretty well, but hours worked are less than desirable because they are always short staffed."
good,"The factory was really hot so if you're not used to the heat you should get used to it. The biggest gripe about working there is that the factory workers had their own ""shift clans"" if you will. If you were on second shift you'd have people in the third shift purposely sabotage the other machines so the other shifts could do worse. That was the worst part. THe pay was nice though."
good,"See ""star"" rating above. A typical work day is consumed with responding to email from internal team member. The workplace has a diverse culture of employees. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with a great team."
good,"If you enjoy never knowing when you will be off this is the job for you."
good,"Don't care about giving you a work life balance. Understaffed, no set schedule. Don't work here if you plan on having time for extracurricular activities or hobbies. Average week is between 50 and 60 hours. Everything is based off seniority so new hires get screwed on everything."
good,This was a good place to start out your career. You get a great education on how the business is run but the main reason I stayed as long was due to my counterparts and relationships with them.
good,Great company to begin your career with. They hire people with no experience. Sadly Coca-Cola changed and now they are run by bad management that have created a horrible work environment. The amount of work required does not equate to the compensation.
good,"Was a great brand to represent and gave me a sense of pride to say whom I worked for. My latter years with the company were more challenging as new ownership brought on changes that were difficult in a large geography, small work force area."
good,"At first was not a bad place to work, usually pretty easy going. Holidays are very busy with lots of lifting. Management could be improved, I was scolded for getting a back injury and called out for work and was asked to resign before even being offered workers compensation."
good,"Nothing stays the same, Your direct departments are fine but people you never will meet have high expectations that most likely cant be met. Job security is always a worry"
good,Don't do it unless you absolutely have no choice. This job isn't for everyone they dont tell you the full scale of the job until you are hired. money is decent but definitely not worth the headache.
good,when I working I love to learn the craft or the trade in front of me so the when other new employee come ill teach them. In a professional way like I've learned
good,"I loved my job, my co-workers, however management was never around hard to track down. If you had a question, the training is non existent, and has absolutely no empathy, or grey area when it come to a employee having personal issues."
good,"Someone else summed it up perfectly, MICROMANAGEMENT IS INSANE. You will have your neck breathed down nonstop. You will be expected to work from home after you have already worked for the day. You will be expected to answer text messages regarding work whenever. I know people who spend probably 50 hours in the office a week and then take their laptops home and work all weekend. The benefits are ok, not as great as expected. Its a very stay in your lane place. You have to be in your current position for 18 mos before you can consider posting out for something else. And you will be frowned on for doing that by your current team."
good,long story short not for everybody the management was very UN organized had to drive your own vehicle to diffident locations paid small amount of mileage
good,La empresa coca cola era mas comprometida con la mejora continua.Se perdió eso
good,Fun traveling the metroplex to different grocery retailers and meeting new people. Enjoyable helping customers with products. Interesting creating creative displays.
good,The company is a good company good work i loved that job the problem was the people's thats in charged they all dont like to see young people do good n it was a big problem for me
good,They pay very good but what they lack to tell you is the overtime is mandatory and they do not tell you that until a week a two after hiring. They also do not tell you that you have to finish the pallets within a unreasonable amount of time if not you will get wriiten up for which is a problem because they also do not tell you that you have to get a certain amount of pallets done before the shift is complete if not you will once again get written up which could lead to termination. So there is a lot of things they leave out in the application details and the interview process as well because i was never told any of this until 2 weeks of after being hired.
good,Coca-cola is a great place to work and provides an employee with all the tools need to perform at their work. one is exposed to different cultures of people which makes one diverse.
good,"Hectic busy running around checking in drivers counting inventory receiving documents, answering calls scheduling deliveries of raw materials ordering raw materials posting inventory doing re-counts doing in house audits. How to deal with problems that are important to running production and how to handle doing 2 peoples positions. Management is awesome most work as a team and help out mostly everyone and some are just worried about their department and nobody else even though we are considered a team. Not being treated as equal to the men that I work with and being told "" I don't want you to get hurt"" hits a sore spot because even though im a female I can also preform most of the jobs the guys do if not better. I like the people I work with they are like family some customers I can consider friends after being here for 6 years you build a relationship with most of the people."
good,"The job itself is great.  However, the management and co-workers are horrible.  i was a closer and was constantly left with work first shift didnt want to do.  when this was brought up with management i was told to suck it up"
good,"Some Management is partial, and holds favorite. No easy real way to communicate such issues higher. They tend to be dismissed without further investigation when there is no hard evidence."
good,"worked in different markets at mardan city, rustam city as will as swabi road and shahbaz garhi."
good,This position is a easy one not to hard to catch on to but it gets very old quick. Turnover rate is very high for several reason. The hardest part of the job is not quitting everyday you are scheduled to work. Management definitely has favorites.
good,"Long hours."
good,I complained about favoritism and I ended up getting terminated later on down the line. I told that the lead on nights B shift was working some while his favorites sat in the office and had movie night and the lead on B shift emailed the supervisor and said i was stirring up rumors when it was 5 of us that reported him. Two of us was terminated because of it. We were the only two minority woman working with him. Everyone that worked with him wants to transfer or they end up quitting cause they did not want to work with him at all.
good,typical work day is answering calls back to back to back to back to back. 50% of the time you're getting cursed out. People threatening to call headquarters bc you're only authorize to do a limited number of things. Supervisors don't care about your well-being. They're constantly changing the attendance policy. Thats why im currently applying for a new job. Over all its alright. It's not worth getting paid 13.00 a hour. If they was paying 16+ maybeee it'll be toleratable.
good,por ser uma CIA multinacional deixa a desejar em diversos aspectos
good,"make sure the proper load and on the right trailer and make sure the loads are secure move trailers from docks and back new ones to the docks to get loaded,  I learn what each stop is getting and how much product is ordered"
good,"Coke is more concern about the brand than its people."
good,"Great brand, good folks. Quiet Office. Nice Location. Typical day is planning the distribution of product for multiple locations. The company uses SAP."
good,"Job sucks up most, if not all of your day and will leave you gasping for air if you allow it to do so. Days are long and pay is just OK."
good,"Currently working at the Bronx, NY branch. Toxic management, different department managers constantly bickering and working against each other. They don't communicate. This passes on to making jobs more difficult for all the employees under them. Will give instructions to perform a task one way, another manager will walk over and tell you that you're doing it wrong. Then the original manager will walk over and ask why you're not doing it their way."
good,"This is a repetitive job. Each day is very similar with little variance. I load my truck, run my route, turn in my money and then go home. Theres not much excitement here. I have learned my way around Northwest Arkansas pretty well. I only use my GPS for specific addresses I have never been to. Management is management. They are there to make sure we adhere to the day to day jobs we are assigned. The hardest part of my job would be keeping the monotonous work entertaining."
good,"Boa empresa para trabalhar, apesar da pressão de demissão por motivo de queda das vendas; os chefes fazem muita pressão, e falam o tempo todo em demissão."
good,"Great job until they took company cars and went to a reimbursement program."
good,Their training program could be better.  The route management could be better and the compensation could be better. Overall their is a lot of things that this company really needs to work on and improve.  Three years ago the company switched from a private company to a corporate. So this location is still kind of new and still working out its kinks.
good,"Terrible management , no job security, worst medical benefits I have encountered. We worked out of warehouses and not a nice clean office or conference rooms. Pay its ok."
good,Coca-Cola Refreshments can sometimes be a great company to work at; however room for advancements are extremely limited. Very demanding and at times can take away from your home life.
good,"It is a very fast pace work environment, that I do like. CCR has taught me a lot about being a Supervisor. The facility I am currently working at has no advancement and Management doesn't have any concerns about your outside life. My job duties are not hard or difficult. I do enjoy working with people, so that is the most enjoyable part of my job."
good,Ride on a truck and deliver drinks to gas stations. We would stock their coolers and displays. It gets very hot during the summer months.
good,"they're all about numbers so you have to keep a certain percentage throughout the day if you don't they are counted against you and you could get fired. also they count tardies as strikes and sometimes there is just traffic or bad weather but they don't care, or at least management doesn't. pay is good if you don't mind over working yourself 12-13 hr shifts"
good,"Its a nice job that you are on your own most of the day, but having to wait on trucks and heavy lifting puts a toll on your body."
good,"typical day 12 hour shifts.  Sleep then work all night 6 to 7 days a week.  Some of the management was outstanding and several were lacking in management skill.  Enjoyed most of my co-workers.  Most enjoyable part of the job was pay day, insurance, and days off."
good,long hours and the use of your own car is too much. can NEVER get in touch with management. alot of selfish people and all they care about is making mone not the employees
good,The role requires many hours of working past the typical 8 hour day for admin duties which usually have to get done before or after your regular day starts.  Great people at the ground level to work with.
good,"Long hours, great co-workers. Had time and tools to learn how effectively maintain constant growth of an ever-changing portfolio of products. Best part of the job is dealing with several different customers and not being stuck in an office. Actually developing how to become a sales specialist and customize a group of revenue generating products that will maximize profits for that individual customer was the best challenge. Executing this role of account manager is always challenging and creativity was always rewarding."
good,We only have a couple of supervisor trying to run a 24 hours 7 days a week operation.
good,"If you can't pick 1500 boxes an hour your gone."
good,But the job its self wasnt as great but work is work i never left they let us go
good,"I worked with coke company as sales man in the first time."
good,Great Company with Great benefits. Lots of opportunity to enhance self through courses  made available.
good,"Great place to work when starting your sales career.  Pre planning and preparation are key factors to being successful.  Territory management with some cold calling.  You will find that your co workers are the best rescource for trade information and a great support system.  Time management will be the biggest challenge in your day. There are daily time constraints that impose hurdles throughout the week.  However,  it is the customers and one on one interaction that is truly the most rewarding part of this job."
good,"Enjoyed working with customers and good bonus incentives. the hours were long."
good,"Everyday is difficult, this job requires a lot of physical work and the job is never complete. It is easy to work 10-12 hours a day. I learned to never let the job get to me mentally. The management is terrible! They are only management because of the people they know, they have no clue how to communicate effectively or how to resolve problems within our work sites. People quit left and right. They hire anyone it seems and they don't receive correct training which also falls on management. The hardest part of the job is waiting on deliveries and when they arrive 6,7,8 hours late. no one is willing to help you. the managers don't answer or return calls when you ask for help. Most of my coworkers are lazy and will leave plenty of work for the next person instead of doing it themselves. But the best part of the job is the relationships i have built within the stores with managers, the receivers, and the rest of the crews."
good,Supervising and reporting the main sales indicators to Regional Management with a view to identifying areas for sales growth across six key cities in central Venezuela.
good,"Although a very successful company to work for, in my opinion the culture is somewhat strained and it is becoming a stressful environment.  Work-Life balance is challenging, and at times the overall focus on their biggest commodity, their people, is an afterthought.  It is a great place to learn and master your craft, but once you hit a certain level, it seems to become stagnant.   The most difficult part of my job was to continue to have an inner struggle to put my innovative and creative mindset aside, and only focus on the current way of going to business.  I cannot accept that, and always looking to better a process and alternative ways of problem solving."
good,"I stock shelves, help sales people place orders, deal with rude customers, and store employees. Build displays. Work all holidays, while everyone else in the company gets them off."
good,"The calls were OK, some days you have a lot and some days were slow but it depends on which team your on...some team have back to back calls and management will overlook slack of work if you speak another language like Spanish. If you cant speak a second language you will have a hard time getting hired permanently. I loved the pay that was the best part.  Small opportunities for overtime on my team but on others it was unlimited.  It was a great place to work over all and i would apply again."
good,"You will be required to work long hours without help. No support from leaders, reprimanded if you do something out of the ordinary."
good,I learned a lot being that it was my first warehouse job however it would have been a lot more of an enjoyable work experience if the work was distributed more evenly and the progression of the work place was less biased.
good,"A typical day at worked involved reviewing productivity metrics and coaching the team on how to improve results.  Other duties consisted of developing daily staffing schedules, and massaging the production schedule in order to achieve the desired results.  The hardest part of the job was managing a large union hourly workforce with the benefit of having an on-site HR manager.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the relationships I developed while working there."
good,"A typical day at  work is when we do  stock taking on month end."
good,"Boa, empresa responsavel e dedicada a sempre fazer o melhor"
good,"Very competitive business to be in. Hard to advance."
good,Typical day of work for me is delivering the soda to supermarkets and deli's. Management was hard because there was no comunication between the 4 supervisors they all ran the department differently which was very hard to get use to. hardest part of the job was delivering soda upstairs and basements of the customers' location and they could easily get 150 cases which is about 10-15 trips each with a hand truck. the soda on the hand truck could easily weigh 250 lbs. Most enjoyable part of the day was driving the tractor trailer and meeting new customers and having a good friendly reputation with them.
good,"A typical day at work starts off with the calculation of WUR and report to Management and handling consumer complaints, follow up on the corrective actions, update the status to the manager, arranging and co-ordinating by sending samples to external lab for analysis."
good,"A empresa lhe da liberdade para aprender,só depende de vc,aprendi muita coisa da minha profissão nesta empresa,precisa melhorar em alguns pontos."
good,it was a pretty relaxed atmosphere with good coworkers but unfortunately circumstances beyond my control led to the closing of the facility
good,Great Place to work.  Usually worked four 10 hour shifts ( mostly Friday thru Monday) Basically a feast or Famine atmosphere.  Always working in the summer very slow in the winter.
good,The management can be disrespectful and does not take personal life into consideration. They want what you can do for the company and not what they can do for you. The pay and benefits are good but take away from personal time. Good for college students to pay for school.
good,A +/- 10 hour day traveling in a assigned area with plenty of exercise. A strong team of fellow account managers willing to assist at any time. Long days in the car during bad weather is a draw back for me while interacting with multiple people throughout the day is a hugh benifit for me.
good,"carrying daily direct sales, merchandizing, meeting both junior and senior clients and ensuring that targets are met, forwarding reports to area sales manager. i got to interact with customers and improved on my interpersonal and communication skills, problem solving techniques and fast delivery of services and goods. i also created harmonious working environment with co- workers, listening and learning from them."
good,"operate machine and driver forklift , keep my line running all day ,stock pallets on warehouse ."
good,"Preventa y Reposición en diversos supermercados."
good,"very long hrs, little to none raises, depending on other employees to end day early or not.. u will earn every penny you make."
good,Dont get me wrong coke is a great place to work at but when you management thinking that they are still in high school its a problem with me nothing gets done nor do things get resolve
good,Fun Place to work however trying to move forward is a big challenge here 
good,"Long hours , learned lots of useful things, coworkers were all good workers, hardest part was long hours"
good,They expect you to be empathetic and sympathetic tooooooo much... I guess thats hard if your not a good liar
good,It all depends on what department your in and your management. but not a lot of room for advancement. They are very sales driven so watch out if your not the pushy sales type.
good,"Apesar do pouco tempo,uma empresa boa,agradavel,so que paga pouco."
good,"I would clock in get on my pallet jack rider say hello to my co workers and hit the line. I would pick about five to six orders on a crew of six, four pickers and two loaders with about twenty six trucks total. The trucks had to be picked and loaded in a seven hour time frame."
good,"Worked hard & fast for coca cola.Drove electrical pallet jack all day, while the lady in my telecom ear piece told me what to pull next."
good,"While this is a well known company, they expect you to place them above all else, even to the detriment of your family. Their starting wages are well below comparable positions with other companies and when you advance within the company you are penalized on your salary with the excuse that they can not increase your salary more than a certain percentage even though some one hired from outside the company for the same position would be given a higher salary."
good,come in get your route and go some times after I finish my job I go help out co-workers.
good,"I like making te customers happy when i deliver and merchandise their stores,the smile i leave on their face is priceless.I train one employee per day,i take pride in what i do and at the end of the day to see what the assosiate learn is a accomplishment i feel great about.Each day i Manage over 18 different retail stores .Also in my day i have to balance the cash and charge accounts."
good,Dias corridos com ecxessiva quantidade de clientes a serem atendidos.
good,"always job is on the line, mgnment always put you down,other then that i like what i do ,working with stores makeing the numbers ,"
good,"lots of overtime required, often do not get weekends off, under utilize their employees, will not take advice to impliment systems that will decrease downtime, no training given, employees just sit around and call mechanic at any sign of trouble, only time i have ever recieved a one-time lump sum raise (a bonus really). I have only been here 5 months and I am currently looking for other positions and have been for the past 2 months. The only person that is above me that seems to have any sense is the plant manager. he is also new and only been there 6-8 months."
good,Very very excellent peolpe wish they wasn't on a hiring freeze great place to work.
good,"Great place to work at as an employee on the line. Only people that  get down on their knees will move forward in this company.  Bosom buddy workplace.  But just as a normal everyday operator, this is a great place  To work. They have the top of the line equipment"
good,"Wake up early, work in stores before customers arrive and stock shelves. Ensure the product you received from the truck is organized and maintained properly in the store."
good,can't reach a supervisor if one is desperately needed.  their workalike balance sucks. Did not like the culture of the people there. the pay is way too little for the amount of work
good,"the culture of the company is great and everyone i work with is amazing. I learned that team work is what keeps us productive, the hardest part is when we experiencing a break down and the most enjoyable part is when we reaching our daily target"
good,"I enjoy working for Coca-Cola  company. There are lot of people that work there and most of them are very friendly and easy to get along with. You have to have a very good driving record, because you drive a company car."
good,"The DC management lacks knowledge and discipline "
good,Job is stressful depending if everybody is working. Mgmt never disciplines. People always leaves early or doesn't show up. Mgmt doesn't care about your wellbeing sometimes. With being in the Union it does feel good having a security blanket in case something does happen. It is a job that you get a lot of hours but sometimes that isn't a good thing.
good,The company is an average large employer but is in a constant cycle of layoffs and scaling back comp and benefits.  Management's unwillingness to take risks with the business but need to deliver true change to achieve it's growth targets leads to constant underperformance and job impacts.
good,"manager par des personnes inhumaines et incompétente niveau plateforme logistique."
good,Since the changes it appears the new management is more concerned about the bottom dollar than the customer. Constantly changing policy makes it hard to focus on customer satisfaction
good,"It is a good place to work. I worked here for 16 years. The pay is good. The hours can get out of hand, but not too bad. Just watch your work life balance."
good,"In the time I was there, Coca-Cola was constantly reorganizing and, on occasion, moving people into positions for which they did not apply. Management, in general, is not personable."
good,Good place to work but the pay and benifits need to be more competitive. I don't feel they pay what your worth but that feeling could change should the pay and benefits become improved upon to be competitive with other companies.
good,"Good place to learn the ropes, hours are not great if you are on nights, you may be working 7-14 in a row.not the worst place I have worked but a company this size should be more streamlined."
good,"Worked for Coke for 11 years and was laid off due to my department closing. Tons of overtime pay which is nice but due to the amount of hours work, you don't have much of a life. Management was up and down but mostly bad."
good,"Come in clean my work station, answer the telephones, get loads ready for the drivers"
good,Coca Cola has great benefits.. Great company for a single person or if you have no children. Plenty of hours if needed. A lot of bending and lifting. stress free work place
good,"Management could be better, but every day is a new challenge. Hire a lot of contract workers. Be prepared for a challenge. Everybody keeps to themselves for the most part and very generous with help"
good,"The company was sold 4 times since the original owner died and each year the new owners changed the way of do things, Not knowing The affect of Profit and sales for the company ( Even some managers will say we make soda not sense) The starting salary is not competitive with other companies that’s why there is a high turnover of drivers"
good,"Pay is good at 21/hr. However, it will take years to get the Full time job. No Benefits nor discounts for Work Shoe and Seniority is being followed not the performance."
good,"North American management seems to have lost their way. Long time employee dedication is being completely discarded in lieu of ""new blood"". It's a cut throat culture that's extremely political right now. Certainly not the same place as it once was."
good,"While the continual organizational changes at CCNA make it hard to keep track of who is doing what work, I continually found the people to be dedicated to doing the right thing and very hard-working."
good,Meh.  Good pay but bad management.  Supervisors will want to know of any down time but can't comprehend reasons for it or understand how when one thing fails it effects the line further up.
good,Management didn't always assist when needed.  It was fast paced. The turnover rate was high.  It was difficult to trust anyone...pretty much cut throat.
good,great co workers...over the years management has changed immensely which is primarily due to Corporate America in general despite them trying to keep the culture great...it is not the same...
good,"This Company doesn’t respect or honour their employees, in their eyes we are all disposable, regardless of your job title.                            Advice to Management, Recognize hard working employees by telling them good job once in awhile, it doesn’t cost you any money to say those words, but it means a lot to hear them. Look for ways to help employees to do their job more efficient, instead of looking for ways to discipline them to justify your job. The Company and Customers pay the price for the supervisors unjustified actions. Remember this,  the sales team, and union works make the wheel turn.  Not unorganized Management."
good,"Company offers great benefits 13th cheque, provident fund that grows well and salaries competitive. Issue is work life balance, looking after a large area."
good,Good exchange of info and expertise exchange amongst peers. Established some long term friendships and professional relationships from some of my coworkers.
good,"Coca- Refreshment used to be good  not Liberty Coca-cola"
good,Earlier years were positive for career growth and networking but with restructuring and turnover in recent years the integrity of advancement opportunities have suffered.  Organizational instability and associate fears about losing job are the norm.    While I experienced some advancement opportunities there was an apparent glass ceiling.
good,This is a decent place to work.  I enjoyed working here.  The pay is decent.  They have benefits and vacation time.  If you are looking for a decent job this is the job for you.
good,"Get up and be at work at 5am leave at 5-7pm at night. Had to run routes when drivers did not report to work. It was hard work and very demanding. The people was great and benefits was ok, not the best."
good,"Aprendí a trabajar bajo presión, respetando horarios de entrega y cuidando siempre la calidad de mi trabajo para dar resultados de calidad."
good,"Coca-cola offers good benefit. But work environment is bad. They have different shifts and shifts range from 8 to 12 hours, sometimes longer. It's too hot in the summer and too cold in winter in the production areas. Management is the worst."
good,"supervisor was great, coworkers were great.  fast paced, physically demanding.  stressful.  pay was decent.  equipment was beaten up.  gets slow in the winter."
good,"Coca Cola is a really good company with good benefits, the only problem is the people you work with and the management that make you have a bad impression about the company."
good,"This is not a bad place to work especially if you are just starting out. From what l gathered, it used to be so much fun to work there back in the day; and although no one can say exactly what changed, theories abound that it can be attributed to the turnover in ownership and management over the years. In the 5 years that l was there we had 2 ownership changes and 3-4 changes in management. Now no matter how lucrative a company is, these many changes can affect productivity and morale on the floor. "
good,Just peachy.  Always focus on growth.  Collaboration is a must to survive in this  fast moving culture.   I can't say anymore then I have already.  We are always trying to transform bi-annually.
good,você pode ser o melhor mas se um dia deixou a desejar você e humilhado
good,"most days are enjoyable out in the trade, but when you have to go in for meetings it can be really frustrating. Most of the meetings are pointless, very repetitive, and very time consuming."
good,"I have learned about the analytical skills involved in a financial environment. I do believe this position should be paid as an analyst position, and aligned with other analyst positions with competitor companies. The workplace environment is enjoyable, but the lack of job security makes for a very stressful life, inside and outside of business hours."
good,"Have a safety meeting,inspect the equipment,Select order until they run out,then sit around for about hour an half,than about 7 O'clock then they would let you know how many case you would have for that day"
good,"Good experience. Good company to start your career, for freshers. Work environment needs improvisation. Overall learning of quality and production is immense."
good,Es una empresa muy solida con grandes oportunidades para hacer linea de carrera
good,"very stressful environ,ok sometimes,recognition for birthdays,lots of layoff for hourly paid during low volume season.,little scope for career advancement"
good,Era um lugar bom de trabalho mais veio a falecia a empresa g8 distribuidora distribuidora autorizada pra representar a coca cola
good,"While working for the company, I saw it go through many changes. I had the opportunity to work for multiple departments in the 7+ years I was employed there. They are a great company to work for until you get down to the call center level. Unfortunately, as do many call centers, the mentality is, anyone can do this, and we just need a body in the seat. There is little done to retain good employees. The management is more interested in call center politics than actually doing what is right for the business/customer. I would say that when I first began my career there, I saw it as a place I would enjoy working until retirement. The longer I was there, the more the place changed to the point it was no longer enjoyable. The hardest part of the job was having to deal with call center politics. The best part of the job was having such a diverse environment to work in. You really do get to meet and work with an incredible range of people."
good,"Within the distribution and warehouse departments, there is a lack of clear, defined direction given especially when major shifts in operations arise. A lack of coordinated, detailed training for both supervisors and hourly workers. Management goals often not achievable with the few resources given. Goals lack proper planning steps to achieve. In light of Coca-Cola being the size it is, has no formal training material available, shameful given the complexity of computer software used in day to day operations. Training done by word of mouth."
good,The office culture was difficult to adapt to due to circumstances that occurred prior to coming to the company.  Some staff welcomed the addition of additional staff others did not.
good,Muchas horas. Y un trabajo que se empieza temprano y se paga bien
good,"Offer training but required to work long hours."
good,"Good company , overall for  university Grads , then move on to other using your experience here . Current Sales Team Managers"
good,Great place to work with the opportunity to be autonomous. My entrepreneurial work style was embraced allowing me to be focused and creative. I get to work with great people from diverse backgrounds.
good,"Depending on your position and the role in which you participate this job can be stressful and very demanding.  Not a BAD job, just requires focus and attention to detail."
good,"fast paced and high expectations, can be stressful at times.  Must be good at multi tasking and managing several expectations at one time.  "
good,"Muita disparidade de tratamento com as pessoas, muitas pessoas promovidas sem qualificação."
good,daily meeting then job functions would be given. I typically worked alone. which makes for a long day. The management lets you work with little to no interruption.
good,"Very male dominant work place with no advancement opportunity.  Terrible if your a lady working in the warehouse, If you report any type of harassment they will get rid of you and not the person doing the harassing. They have a high turnover rate mostly because of the long hours and having to do other people's job and your own when someone decides to call in. The majority of trucks don't have air in them so be prepared to stay hydrated all day long. The best part of working for coke was the majority of the nice coworkers and some mangers."
good,stressful at times. very fast paced.. expeccted to work odd shifts weekends and holidays. it was enjoyable going to multiple locations and being self motivated
good,Job itself isnt all that bad.  Coke's communication could be better and the way the routes are set up you rarely get to work a store two days in a row which means you're all ways cleaning up after some one else or getting yelled at by the management of the stores for some one else not doing their job.
good,"Managed a unionized work force of mechanics and electricians. Learned a great deal in process improvement implementation as well as project management and commissioning.  Long hours, long commute."
good,"Overall a good job, especially for the younger crowd. Anybody over the ages of 35 might need to be in a higher position. They need more staff and more breaks. Maybe longer lunches. There are always changes that need to be made."
good,good flexible position but the stress and workload is hard to balance because the pay is okay. If they paid more it would balance the position with the workload.
good,"This company was a good place to work,but the salary was very low. It was a very physical job, so if you're looking to stay in shape its a good job. Worked very long hours,but had weekends off which is a plus for everyone. I thought the salary should've been much higher."
good,I have worked for the company for almost 20 years and I am ready for a change.  I appreciate the opportunities I have been given and have met a lot of good people along the way.
good,"Its an okay place to work. Fast-paced, good pay, good benefits. Some days can be really long some days can be really short. Never know what the next day will really look like."
good,"Too much to list. Work experience and company benefits are good; but the lack of available time off, low pay, and disconnected/ two-faced management are hard to navigate."
good,"Duplication of work efforts, unrealistic timelines, lack of management support, super casual dress code, open work area, consumer research, retailer focused"
good,"Dispatching is horrible,  could be more efficient. "
good,"I was a phone representative (I&CA), and enjoyed working there at first. Its very easy to get burned out doing this job. There are perks here and there but the greatest downfall is the extreme micromanagement. Its only good for 6 months or less."
good,you show up report for safety meeting and report to your station for work. nice workplace but the hardest thing to do is to figure out what is to be done to find work when machines having problems.
good,Tiene buen ambiente de trabajo   buen sueldo y orario flexible
good,"Live work balance is nice. "
good,"At this moment, the plant was bought out by a mexican bottler(Arca Continental. The transition has exposed many managers for who they really are. This has been quite the stressful time for the plant, but things are starting to level out. The hours are demanding and family time can be compromised greatly during high volume months. The moral of the plant is quite low and it seems to be getting worse. I'm sure this will get better as time passes. Only time will tell."
good,"Working for Coca-Cola as an order builder is a decent job. If i would've been there fresh out of high school then it would have been perfect for me, but because of the fact that I have an almost 9 month old daughter, breaking my body down pulling orders is doing way more harm than good. The benefits are great. Management is starting to improve, but still has a long way to go. As a company they are definitely nowhere near being as appreciative as they could be of order builders. Overall it's a decent job. I would definitely recommend working for them if you are fresh out of high school, but any older I recommend going somewhere else."
good,"I like the job it was fun but we still work hard. "
good,"Strong global company, growth opportunities, tend to be constantly restructuring, resulting in medium turn over. Has a long history of leader in the beverage sector, competitive and changing."
good,Overall a decent job loved my co workers Great schedule. Management was always around when needed. Monday Thru Friday work schedule weekly paycheck Coke is great
good,I enjoyed my time at coca cola very much as a casual. Although some permanant workers treated me bad and chaced me of my forklift saying its theirs.
good,"société mal située, mauvais management"
good,"Middle management needs improvement. I have learned through my course studies in my mba program that management is learned. The more one knows about management and supervising, the more effective they will be in their positions."
good,Es muy Desgastante trabajar Ai sales muy tarde y no valoran tu esfuerzo
good,This was my first maintenance job but I did get to advance in plc knoldge with Alan bradly (500&5000) logic. Also was very involved with conveyor rebuilds replacing bearings. Rebuilding pumps. Very fast pace.
good,"co-workers are great to work with.. enjoyed working mon-fri, management not to great. I had the pleasure of being able to operate an electric forklift nd pallet jack"
good,"Great company to work for depending on location. Poor management  ,I've seen people over exceed the requirements including myself and if you're not a yes-man then you'll probably be overlooked."
good,"Depending which dept you are in, you can either love it or hate it. Lots of favoritism and hard to move up. Free Coke products is a plus."
good,"Coca Cola pourrais être une cie extraordinaire. Il y a de bons employés, mais peu d'écoute de la part des hauts dirigeants, ce qui est très malheureux."
good,"work there for eight years. if you had a extra heavy load and you asked for help chances are you would not get it. pay raise never happened much, it took three years to get a 13cent raise last year. was hard to get your trucks fixed properly."
good,"money is good, but you slave hrs for it and not have no time to enjoy it. some delivery days you will get huge deliveries and no one to help. Long work days."
good,I worked with some great teams but due to lack of management the turnover was high which impacted the work we were required to implement.  Good for a short term gig
good,"Good company if you have a 4 year degree. This is NOT a company  for someone trying to move up, by learning within the company, and/or putting your time in. Either be a manager, or look into another company."
good,Good temporary job but no job opening staff outsourced no benefits hard labour friendly staff get paid R17.49c a hour double pay on a Sunday if you worked 7days double pay on weekend weekend working is compulsory good job for students
good,"Fast paced work enviroment. Long hours.You would think that working for such a well known and reputable company, would mean great job opportunities, but not so. They have good employee recognition days where they offer food, drinks, and games. Micro-managed and higher than standard quality assurance goals."
good,"The company provides great benefits, paid holiday and vacation time. The management team are easy to get along and supportive because they have all been in our position within the company for the most part. You get a chance to speak to a wide variety of customers across the U.S. and Canada. As long as you are used to a face paced environment in customer service and can remain confident in your business strategy than you will do fine."
good,A typical day at work is chaotic to say the least. I have learned that the utilization of time is very valuable. Management needs a lot of work and better communication. I enjoy my co-workers for the most part. The hardest part of the job is the machinery and its old age. The most enjoyable part of the job is working for a world-class brand and meeting interesting people.
good,I couldn't even enjoy the job due to the supervisor. I hated having conversation with her about anything. I loved the people who I worked with just had anxiety when speaking with her.
good,"The company has a great mission and the help the communities in whatever region they are in. The new company facility is very nice, a lot of conference rooms and office space"
good,"Benefits for work life balance.  Great vacation/ benefits.  Many locations throughout US, can transfer within the company."
good,"Fun teams and good place to work"
good,"Coca-Cola is a great benefit-oriented job. The work is mundane, and the processes old and there's no room for your ideas in changing them. Attendance/quality standards are rigid. It's very hard to get a supervisor to help with any kind of disputes, or any processes. So you're on your own, except you need supervisor authority and they won't give you the time or attention. Overall, not my favorite for a first experience in a call center. If you're ok with all logic going out the window, and someone subjectively grading all your calls against very rigid guidelines, no real guidance and no ""bonus"" guarantee, then you'll make it. Like I said, the benefits are nice, but the ones you can use like vacation/paid time off, you'll still be punished for in the end."
good,Supervisory staff great to work with. Management work diligently to ensure every issue was taken care of by meeting daily.
good,"Typical work consists of arriving at one of three to five stores(depending on route). Speaking with the store manager to confirm of any changes of building any displays or taking them down. Proceed to walk the entire store to assure all locations of products are accounted for. Next step, enter backroom and begin to load product onto U-boat(6-wheeler) or pallet."
good,"It was a productive place, but the work was not well managed . the staff was friendly and only few that were not cooperative."
good,"В компании в отделе продаж полный хаос. Мерчендайзеров за людей не считают. Есть правда и здесь хорошие руководители- это некоторые торговые представители. Но как правило хорошие там долго не работают. Их зажимают. К мерчам вообще отношения как к рабам. Т.е должны работать по полной. Если что не так или супервайзеру чем не понравился , то увольнение."
good,"After 25 years at Coke I have decided to move on.Sadly the culture there is one of laziness on the factory floor,people are more interested in playing with their phones and using non PAT devices than doing their jobs!"
good,Coca-Cola is a solid company to work for and your co-workers become family.  The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting customers and being able to work in the field.
good,"My two cents....Co-workers are the best i have experienced in my professional experience.  The people here have a vast amount of work knowledge and experience.  Yet, this is what I feel the company values the least.  The company seems to forget this is what made this company great.  Tons of waste here with multiple departments doing the same job.  Multiple directors with virtually no knowledge of what it takes to run the business.  It is probably good we were bought out by another company. Maybe they can cut out some of this waste that got our company into a dysfunctional contest of directors to see how many people they can add so they can justify their jobs."
good,"When I started working for Coke I worked day and afternoon shift. I learned how Coke is made, bottled, and packaged. I learned about the machines on the four production lines and a little about how to program them for the various products that are made at the plant. Later I switched to graveyard shift and I learned the importance of cleanliness within the production plant. The plant recently went through some upgrades and we all did some training on new computers for inventory control and tracking. "
good,"The customer service aspects and requirements of the job were not difficult and were actually fun. However, the lack of opportunity to advance was a major downfall of this position. Also, the management team was not supportive or well trained."
good,"Employer works well with college students, and is able to provide full-time work with benefits for non-students. As someone who has worked while as a student and graduate, this employer has worked well for me. However, there are VERY long shifts on certain occasions, and management seems to view its employees as raw labor without concern for your life outside of work. While there are opportunities to advance, they usually require one to move to another area. Furthermore, the job is very physical, and leaves one very tired following a shift."
good,"Os dias de trabalhos era bastante complicado no começo pois eu nao tinha entrosamento com a equipe mas depois que me enquadrei na rotina ficou tudo melhor , la na empresa nao tinha grandes problemas (pelo menos no meu setor) depois que mudou a direção da coca cola , e minha gestora foi mandada embora , fiquei de responsavel pelo meu setor no qual lá havia 2 jovens aprendizes , eu era responsavel por avaliar e conduzir-los foco que era a melhoria do setor , "
good,A learning environment with opportunities to learn new techniques and tactics of business world. Not many opportunities to grow and excel.
good,Great Brand to work for. If able to relocate may have various opportunities to advance. Will learn  a lot about the business if open to it.
good,"Working at Coke is very political, and it is WHO you know...not necessarily WHAT you know. A lot of lip service is paid to training and development, but is is minimal. Operating efficiency, training and development ranked at the bottom of every internal survey."
good,"As a merchandiser you arrive at the grocery store to stock products belonging to coke. Products consist of  sodas, various waters and energy drinks to be filled throughout the stores and displays. You are expected to wait at a store until they receive a delivery which may take several hours. The amount of labor you will have to do may not add up to what you deserve, being that this is a fortune 500 company. Merchandisers are considered the backbone of the company and receive the lowest wages. If you happen to work overtime it will be ten dollars an hours. You have co-workers who may do half the work you do but get paid the same amount. Management isn't so bad. The hardest part of the job would be working the delivery load which may be several pallets and getting there at 6:00am. The most enjoyable part is you get to leave when your done with the stores you have to service which is three or more."
good,"An all around fair job. good managers and team, lots of fun and challenging! Hardest part was the hours and pay, the enjoyable part was the team of assoiates and managers."
good,"madrugar, carreras de principio a fin, verificar cada proceso desde embalaje,carga,despacho,entrega final, chequeo total,aprendí,la excelencia del  seguimiento y contacto face to face diario con el cliente,excelente ambiente laboral, dinámico,honesto,abierto,franco,lo que mas me gusto de mi bello trabajo y aun recuerdo con muchísima nostalgia!!! aprendes desde como saludar hasta como ofrecer disculpas y reconocer cuando te equivocas,me encantaba de la compañía aquellas fiestas wow!! con todo y a todo dar, el gran salón, la orquesta gigante y los regalos para nuestros hijos,"
good,Overall not a bad company. They are always short staffed. I did learn the harder and faster you are the more they want you to do. Older trucks and never enough pallet jacks and hand dollies. Long hours but good pay.
good,nosotros tenemos que lograr puntos de venta los cuales luchamos para ganarlos y cuando ocupamos apoyo no lo ay y no podemos reclamar nada por ser por agencia cada año nos liquidan y  si decimos algo simplemente no nos renuevan el contrato asi uno no puede tener una estabilidad economica para su fam. por eso somos varias las personas de esta area que solo estamos esperando una oportunidad en otra empresa para salir y tener estabilidad
good,Working at Coca Cola was a unique experience where you can see what goes in to the soft drink and grocery industry. It is a union job that has great perks when you gain seniority.
good,Coca-Cola is faced with a changing market place and they would rather apply marketing and not science. R&D is very silo-based with much duplication of effort and little communication.
good,"Although Coca-Cola has a great repetition as a great company to work for, my experience differs. I can't comment on the entire company because my experience was only with a branch within Los Angeles. An average work day is about 10 hours and their is a possibility you will be blamed for other people's faults. You MUST always be sure to watch your back and take several, and I mean several photos of the area you're working in and the work you've completed. You will get contradicting orders to follow from different management. You aren't appreciated. If you go to school, management will make you feel guilty and put you in a predicament to have to choose between work and school. Again, this is my experience with one branch, I cannot comment of the entire company."
good,it was fun at times had a good support system because of the high volume of products that needed to be merchandised throughput the san jose etc. this job had great pay but needed better organization
good,"A typical day at work consisted of working on the production line waiting for the day to be over. I learned that this type of career for the rest of my life till retirement was not meant for me. Management was your usual work place environment, some you enjoyed talking to and having as a manager, and others not so much. The job was not all that hard but did take a little bit to catch on to."
good,"Ok Job, Ok pay, no place to start career."
good,The hardest part about the job is dealing with the immature management. The most enjoyable part of the job is that we get free coke product.
good,busy warehouse! can be fun at times working with the coworkers. management have their favorites! the hardest part of the job is when busy season comes around and you work all kinds or crazy hours with no understanding that you have or may have to attend something that's important once and a while.
good,"Coca-Cola is superior in its marketing and if you are in the branding/advertising industry there is no better company to work for. You will thoroughly enjoying being a part of this incredible branding experience. I did!  It was an amazing experience.  However, know they desperately need to continue the smoke and mirrors of old school marketing to cover a broken business model of selling high fructose concentrated syrup to bottlers if they want to grow in the US. The US portfolio of products rely too much products consumers are no longer gravitating to. Unfortunately, the margin of selling syrup to bottlers makes it extremely difficult to pull the needle out and still keep stock holders happy.  With that, I made less every year the last three years as they took benefits away.  The glory days are over."
good,"Working at Coca-Cola has been a great experience for me in regards to what I have learned and the experience I have acquired working for such a globally recognized company.  However, I have been disappointed to find that the company falls victims to many of the same issues in other industries today in regards to employee advancement and poor management structure.  Despite having many quality internal candidates management will routinely pass them for outside applicants, many of whom lack any relevant work experience in the field, simply because of personal relationships or biases.  The company requires people to ""buy in"" to everything that is told to them, without finding better solutions or better ways to reach other goals.  It is very much a ""my way or the highway"" attitude.  This attitude trickles down to the lower levels of the work force, the people who are actually tasked with making the biggest footprint on the consumer level and how it affects the business profits."
good,"Didn't mind the labor of the job, but management made it worse than it actually was."
good,I went to stores and stocked shelves with coke products.Work by yourself
good,"annual incentive news is a tpical day. "
good,"I have become a true ambassador for this company. The values and mission of this company are consistent with my own values. There has been constant re-org's in the past year and a half. Because of this, it has been hard to look towards advancement within the region that I currently support. It has also been difficult to find management support in my advancement efforts."
good,"I learned how to become an account coordinator through an awesome training process. I became very good at my position because I am able to organize and prioritize my workload efficiently and I am effective at communicating expectations to the customer. My day typically consisted of working with service providers to coordinate installs, handling all customer service issues via inbound and outbound calls. My accounts were Kroger Company, PNC Gaming, and many regional accounts like HoneyBaked Ham, Johnny's New York Style Pizza and Chicken Salad Chick."
good,"Managed employees in a union environment. Overall, good company to work for, when they are not doing a reorganization."
good,"I learned hard work in pressure from Coca Cola beverages. It,s workers are very supportive. Its management behave is not professional.  My hardest part of the job that when a person take a bill in hand and ask me the cheque receiving time. I tried to my best for their expectations."
good,"A typical day at work."
good,"A typical day can go from 6-14 hours. As a full time employee, I am paid by the day. I make the same if i work 6 hours or 14 hours. I receive ""Chinese"" over time which comes out to about $5.00/hour. The hardest part of the job is waking up at 3:00 a.m. every day."
good,"The work days can be very long, and there is a big learning curve. Not a very fun environment for the most part"
good,"A typical day would be around eight hours."
good,"Dia muita movimentação, meu primeiro trabalho foi como experiência, a convivência com colegas de trabalho era muito boa."
good,"I worked ten to twelve hours a day delivering product to customers. I learned how to stay focused on the task at hand even when you are tired. The management was poor, with no consideration in regards to the employee's wellbeing. The people I worked with were hard working and honest. The hardest part of the job was keeping a possitive attitude when dealing with mangement. The most enjoyable part of the job was enteracting with the customers."
good,"the company is great"
good,"Typical day at work consisted of 13-14 hour shifts whereas I worked overnight. Huge turnover regarding management hiring, therefore you could expect to work long hours and be held responsible for many duties. I learned to manage every one to the books and hold them accountable for their duties, etc. I learned that diversity within a corporation is a great thing and implements different opinions/views regarding workplace structure, etc."
good,They grind you. Nothing is handed to you for free. Everything has to be earned over time. Tough working culture
good,"Key Deliverables - Market Share, Trade Marketing, Brand Pack Pricing Promotion Channel Management, New Product Development, Unit Specific Acts, Direct Marketing Expenses Budget Control & Management, Unit Business Planning, Marketing Strategy"
good,Physically demanding and micro management outdated.. Great coworker..Hardest part dealing with rec dept at companies..Enjoyed driving
good,Good place to learn forklift and riding pallet jack. As a Selector theres plenty of over time and 6 months later you can go to a different dept. But Order selecting isn't a great job. Shipping is awesome but you have to share one little warehouse and deal with other departments in your way.
good,Great job I just had a bad supervisor that wasnt willing to work with me after being sick
good,"A Empresa possui uma cultura organizacional muito boa, ótimos benefícios, salário satisfatório, com equilíbrio entre o trabalho e a vida pessoal. A empresa programa certa  estabilidade, mas possibilidade promocional deixa a desejar, embora parte desta avaliação pelo menos no período que eu trabalhei deve-se ao fato da alta rotatividade entre os gerentes num período tão curto de tempo, cheguei a trabalhar com 6 gerentes num período de três a seis meses... No trabalho que exercia, ele estava diretamente ligado a alta gerência, fica claro que era quase impossível ser avaliado profissionalmente pelos Gerentes, aliás cuidei de toda parte administrativa, comercial e  operacional da companhia enquanto os gerentes pudessem se habilitar e quando isso acontecia, ele era promovido ou transferido de unidade."
good,It was close to my house and i needed to be home more. I previously had a job that traveled a-lot so I needed to be home more often
good,A great company with a lot on management changes. Not the company it use to be.. Great co-workers with a lot of knowledge.
good,"There is a great deal of flexibility with my current position.  My typical day will involve working with and servicing the needs of existing customer and prospecting new business.  "
good,"El trabajo era repetitivo y tedioso, aprendes lo que tu quieres, a nivel gerencial tienen muchos fallos por el trafico de influencias, el ambiente de trabajo es muy variado lo mas difícil de el trabajo era que si quieres alguna promoción tenias que arrastrarte y\o sobornar lo que mas me gusto es que te dejaba tiempo libre para tu familia"
good,"Typical day would put you going into work at 8am till 5pm Monday through Friday.  I learned how to manage my work day and week through chaos.  The management is very poor and not open to any ideas of how to better the company.  They want yes men.  There is no clear direction of how to get from here to there.  My coworkers are the greatest, salt of the earth type people.  The hardest part of the job is meeting every expectation put on you by management.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the ability to set your own schedule."
good,"A typical day at work is managing, rotating, placing, and moving 3x's more product instore than your competition. That might be any where between 6-14 pallets a store with 3-5stores on a route. I have learned a great deal during this process. I ve been well educated on product trend, marketing strategy to produce the best in store success, how to increase sales on new or smaller selling product. this position is a totally self-managed role. the hardest part of the job is having to constantly clean up the full timers neglect of their job. Plus my manager is not really into his job so I suffer behind it. What I like most about my job is the interacton, mobility, and learning situations I'm placed in."
good,"*um dia para se trabalhar seria todos os dias, pra mim todo dia é um dia para se trabalhar."
good,Empresa de grande porte mais era terceirizada por uma empresa que só visava seu lucro próprio e em momento nenhum nos seus funcionários 
good,Overall a good company to work for. Compensation was reasonable. Long work hours but good schedule.
good," Dia tipico não sei descrever bem sobre."
good,"A typical day was completing work orders such as sweeping,vacuuming,mopping etc. Ive Learned several things such as how to properly detail clean. The hardest part of my job was dealing with lazy team mmbers. The most enjoyable part of my job was when we received compliments how good of an job we did."
good,Management is very clickish and unfair to employees. Managment is against advancement or career moves.....very selfish.
good,A lot of work for a little pay. Other competitors receive higher pay for less work.
good,good work/life balance but there is little room for advancement. going through a trasitional phase with the merging of coca-cola refreshments. therefore leading to my position being relocated.
good,".tenho 3 anos e ainda nao recebir minha promocao fiz aprova passei mas nao veio.isso me deixou muito desmotivado pois eu sempre quis trabalhar nessa empresa consequir mas nao era o que eu imaginei mas tem otimas pessoas,meu encaregado e uma otima pessoa,mas quero mudar de empresa para tentar uma melhor colocação.sem mas bruno"
good,A parte mais agradável do trabalho era quando chegava ao final do mês e comemorava a conquista das minhas metas.
good,"A typical day at work for Coca-Cola was a 5am start everyday and you weren't guaranteed a time when you got off. Everyday consisted of lifting and pulling pounds and pounds of soda nonstop. I learned how to write orders and direct a work force while working for Coca-Cola. Management wasn't understandable, and didn't listen to what you had to say. Also they had there favorites. The hardest part of the job was trying not to think about when the day will be over. The nosy enjoyable part of the job was the paycheck."
good,get to travel around nearby cities and see how a lot of the stores in the area run.
good,"entras a las 7 de la mañana, no tienes hora de salida, he aprendido a tratar al cliente de forma personal. la atencion al cliente, mis compañeros son a todo dar apesar del estres, la parte mas dificil del trabajo es vender en malos tiempos y lo bueno son los descuentos que nos dan"
good,"I am given a assigned route each day of 3-6 Grocery Stores. I check in with a Manager and walk each store and make a list for service it needs. Then i walk fill the store. I travel to the next store and continue the same process until the end of the route. Hardest part of the Job is the Manual Labor. Lifting 12 pack sodas, 2 Liters. Constant lifting and bending. I rarely work with Co Workers since its a independent Job. Management has already in 5 months had 3 new ones. I have only seen my manager two times in 5 months. I can say management is fair though. I have learned a whole different side of the retail business. I used to work in grocery stores and now i have experience on the Vendor side. I have learned to have better communication skills, Planning out time management. Attention to detail and mental toughness."
good,Your day is what you make it if your a people person it makes for a great day.
good,Providing a much needed service for customers ans distributors
good,"I typically worked 12 hours per day, 5 days per week. I got along well with co-workers and management. The hardest part of the job was being layed off during slow periods. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people."
good,"Coke has been a fun a friendly place to work,but the disorganization and lack of hours has been frustarating."
good,"A typical day at work is getting up at 5am , arriving at the outlet checking in with the recievers. Work your backstock and your truck in a timely matter. After your finiush you check in with the store manager and if he ok's it, then you go to the next outlet. Typically get out around 5:30 6pm."
good,Very busy everyday that I worked. They expect alot and beyond as far as your job but they never appreciated the hard work that you have done.
good,"A typical work day is self driven, with long hours that makes it difficult to have a good work/home life balance. The salary is average for this type of job."
good,"Very laxed and no accountability to help drive positive numbers.  The union prevents certain things from changing to keep up with the competition leaving us behind. The new owners are making some changes for the better, but the problem is they have a lot a senior employees still stuck in the old way of doing things, and introducing change is very challenging.  Poor management styles lead to increased frustration and unhappiness coming to work"
good,"looking for a new job, things are just not as fun as they use to be.  to much bickering and back stabbing.  the job is just not enjoyable.  You feel like you are constantly being watched and waiting for you to make a mistake"
good,Worked at the World of Coca-Cola. This facility is very fast-paced and can get extremely busy. You must be okay with being on your feet for long periods of time. This job has a big micro-managing problem so be prepared to be nitpicked for things that don't matter.
good,"Like most retail jobs, it isn't great if you are family oriented.  If stores are open on holidays, you will be working.  Days last until the job is done. There is no set schedule."
good,This is a great company to start your career with. If you can make it past the typically burn-out timeline for an Account Manager (1-2yrs) there are opportunities to advance. This can be a very physical job1
good,Fast pace. Night shifts get most hours. The pay is ok u make money by doing massive overtime. It's a war zone cause it's based on how many cases u pull per hours so be all about self once u get there
good,Learned alot at Coke but only due to the fact that my boss was a real teacher and willing to develop me.  I recommend for entry level people to learn how a successful business operates.  Then leave and apply at other companies.
good,"I really enjoyed the work I did at Coke and was very good at my job, always meeting all my required stats etc. Unfortunately the middle management ranks more on favoritism than who does the best work. There are some good perks there like free drinks and good pay but the office politics overshadows everything even when you try to just keep to yourself.  The insurance is just so so, surprising for such a large company."
good,"This company pays well, however, they do expect you to be at work all of the time... 16 hours a day 6 days a week plus driving time. Will not work with you on time off that you need."
good,A lot of hours no time for family or friends.  They expect everything out of you with no job compliments. It’s always hot in production area. Company doesn’t care about you.
good,"Weekend hours were irractic. As a Merchandiser, the schedule contantly changed. The Supervisor was cold, hard, and intolerable to work with. Lacked structure and direction."
good,"Huge volume of products are being squeezed into a tiny warehouse, compromising the workers safety. The company keeps on adding more SKU's almost every month and needs to relocate to a larger facility that can keep up with the volume. Staffing is also an issue. Aside from that, and if management fixes these issues it'll be an okay workplace."
good,"Traditional and staid company culture with the typical hierarchies. Managers were supportive and there were lots of opportunities to learn more about the company, get involved in different projects and succeed."
good,"Fun and collaborative work environment. Friendly colleagues and Managers. Free sodas (needless to say). Considering the sheer size of the company, there is always potential to grow."
good,"With such a large organization, your career will depend moreso on you supervisor/manager rather than the company. "
good,"Very fast paced and productive work place, constantly moving building pallets for customers to get delivered management was ok, pay wasn’t all that and you would be numerous hours until the load was completed"
good,The downside of it it's very humid inside the factory no AC summertime is very humid and hot unhealthy uncomfortable competitive pay good benefits good people that you work with top management is horrible supervisors are respectful
good,Coca Cola is a good paying job but it is a very physical job that did not have any job advancement that I was interested in.  I would recommend this job to friends and family but I would tell them what they would be up against if they went for it.
good,"Day at work a hard days work building displays stocking account working with mangers,owner  one on one giving 💯 The company management team could be a little better trained"
good,"The typical day starts by checking your load and pre-tripping/loading your equipment, and is not over until your truck is empty. You will commonly find yourself unloading, delivering, stocking, and merchandising a full trailer by yourself. Some days you may only work 5 hours, 14 hours the next. There is no making plans around this job. Salary and benefits Are the best thing this job has going for it."
good,"Coca-Cola was a very disciplined place to work , great pay though which compensated you for the long hrs . Not a great situation for single parents and overtime scheadules could creat difficulty  , ideal for a family with a stay at home parent ."
good,Rotate and stock shelves. Physical work. Working in a timely manner.To communicate with team.Building relationships with customers.Being open to adjusting work schedule.
good,"Casual work up to 50 hours a week and you are expected to work every hour. Equipment does not work, they ""fixed"" equipment by giving it a fresh coat of paint and would sack anyone who damaged the fresh paint."
good,"After 10 successful years, I have been released from my position, as the new ownership needs to recoup the annual 45 million dollar lose the company was experiencing. Outside of that cruel fact, it was a pleasure to work from them while we were known as Coca Cola Refreshments, but the conversion to Liberty  Coca Cola has not gone well."
good,"The benefits at Coke are great. However, compensation is not as great and raises do not happen often. Job can be very stressful at times due to forced overtime on days off."
good,Need to improve on management. Reliable workplace. Fun coworkers. The  workloads per day varies. Some day you have it easy other days busy with optional overtime
good,Coca cola have the perks but can be very challenging managing your time and their time. Work life balance does not appear to exist. They are going through a transition so be careful what position you go after.
good,In the morning I would typically arrive to work 30 min prior to my shift  to make sure I'm prepared for my day. I go over all my emails and respond to whom ever sent them. Contact all the employees and or retirees from my calender to assist with certain Human Resources related issues.The hardest part of my job Is taking certain calls that are very sad reasons I can not disclose however it does have it's perks.
good,"Hot, Stressful, mangement wasn't trained, 24 hrs, 363 days a year.  not a very forgiving place.  Drives good personnel away.  advancement is not common."
good,"A typical day was 8 hours a day.  I learned a lot about the beverage industry. My manager was great.  Other managers, not so much.  The culture was cut throat. The hardest part about the job was the culture.  Some managers had their own agenda which made it hard on everyone. The benefits was the best part of the job."
good,"- Responsible for loading up the machine, filling out the proper paper work correctly, and using the proper codes and dates for the product."
good,not enough pay for the labor intense job that this is in the winter it gets slow and you have to collect unemployment for half the week that you have no hours for
good,There is no lack of hours to work here! It could be an amazing place to work but there is no urgency to aquiare new equipment. Most trucks don’t have AC here in Florida. Very difficult to obtain the necessary equipment for daily jobs.
good,"Market Execution + Market Execution + Market execution = Performance is the mantra so excellent platform to learn and develop sales, channel strategy and budget management"
good,It was ok it’s just a lot of stuff that change with new management taking over the warehouse is an on going battle with trucks being loaded or loaded right
good,Early morning meeting and late afternoon meeting. Team environment. Technology driven company. They do like to role play in there meetings. No company cars any more.
good,"Always restructuring, always focus on this or that so your priorities become very inconsistent. There is very little classroom training most of it is on the job as it comes. Management is very far removed from the employees and demand the impossible. Burn-out is common but they pay well so people tend to stay for decades."
good,"Prior experience should count for something but at this company everyone starts at the same rate and that's not really fair. I hear the health insurance is outrageous, so this probably wont be a long term job for me unless things change."
good,"Currently in MN Great Lakes/ Reyes Holdings is in charge of the Coca Cola plant operations and until they add more docks and fork drivers the place is quite in disarray.  We used to be top priority when coming back for our reloads, now we have to wait our turn, or flag down a fork lift driver as they zoom past you as they don't want to deal anything with you unless you grudgingly ask them as they roll their eyes"
good,Company offers competitive wages and great benefits for full time employees. Offers advancement if you are willing to put in the time and effort. Very fast paced.
good,"typical day: 9-10 hrs"
good,"i liked working for the company for the most part, but the company doesn't promote from within like I think they should.  The raises stopped and the stress level was pretty high."
good,"Service Operations 24/7"
good,"The team was great with which to work, however the company was bought out by other bottlers and  most team members were replaced or moved to other roles."
good,"empresa dinámica, estructurada, con gran claridad en estrategias de mercado e inteligencia comercial"
good,"Make sure machines are running properly and clean. I've learned how to operate several machines such as packers, fillers, palletizers, and depalletizers."
good,It was good but the work load will make up for all the time you haven't worked in life. The supervisors did what they could to make it the best experience and they treat you extremely well and always have your back due to the harsh nature of the clients. This job will help you with time management and efficiency. The work load can be brutal but you have the freedom to tackle it in the way you see fit and they send help a lot. The best part is that you usually won't have people breathing down your neck and you can work at a comfortable pace.
good,"Its a very competitive place to work.You have to know how to operate different machine witch include bottle filler,can filler and smart water line.You have to deal wiyh a lot of multitasking jobs.Im always on the computer while keeping my eyes on the machine.The greates filling about my job is that not everybody can do these jobs.It untitled maintenance,lab and computer skills.You also lifting 50lbs or more"
good,"Management was not good."
good,I did not have much problems working here. This job was a type of job that allowed you to go at your pace. I feel like management could have some improvement to work on.
good,Management is guarded and intrusive at the same time.  Controlled environment. Company has gotten so large that they have lost the minimal control in regards to knowing their client base.
good,Heartland Coca-Cola at this time is a company in Flux and just does not have the welfare of its employees or customers in mind.  Unfortunately upper management does not seem to know how middle management is managing.
good,"Based on my work experience, for the past 16 years I have been grown a lot. I have taken diferent roles at Coca - Cola. Good work place and they provide training  in diferent aspects, e.g. saft and health, sales methodology, technical aspects and other more. Mutual respect is put in place."
good,"Very fast pace business, the hardest part was working on a timer. There is alot of benefits as a full time employee. Also alot of growth within the company."
good,"I was in several departments when I worked at Coca Cola. I enjoyed being an Account Manger because of the fast pace and customer service. Unfortunately there was a high turn over rate with merchandising and call ins often. Which became a constant challenge. I would be working 12-14 hour days because of these challenges. It was mentally and physically draining. "
good,This has been a good company. Like most places it has some issues but the people make it worth while. The upper management has done a lot of change to acommudate the staff. Pay is excellent for every department but maintenance. Maintenance is very low pay.
good,"Coordination, direction and control of all phases of Warehouse, Distribution, Human Resources, Sales, Purchasing, Accounting, Customer Service, Quality Control and Transportation operations with oversight of Direct Store"
good,Great team culture that harbors constant mentoring for new employees. A typical day at work involves going around the territory for several sales calls. A lot can be learned from the job in terms of product and market knowledge.
good,This company was difficult to please. Every day they would add additional priorities which were seemingly unattainable without completing the first tasks assigned.
good,"warehouse work at coca cola was great! the only downside was not knowing when the shift would be over, most shifts exceeded 14/15 hrs and just took a real toll on me working everyday like that, with little time off."
good,"standard day consists of driving from store to store to ensure all stock is on shelves, displays are built and back stock is condensed. no guaranteed hours and not highly compensated. ensure you lift with your legs and not with your back.."
good,"A typical day.  Come in get your route and see that nothing is in the same area and you'll have 2-3 trucks in one parking lot at the same time for 2-3 different stores.  Very physical job moving 400-600 cases at least once if not 2xs a day the weigh roughly 20+ lbs a piece and merchandising product. "
good,It may have been just the team I was on but management was lacking. There were 5 different managers for that team during the time I was there. Long work hours and working over the weekend was the norm.
good,"It was not bad working for this company, you go to work and do the job and you will be fine.  You need to be independent in order to work here.  Self motivation is key as most times you are working alone. You need to be physically able to pull pallets of at least 3000 lbs, lift on average of 30 lbs and be able to bend and stretch."
good,"Its a fun place to work since the place is very diverse. I have learned a lot in many development assignments.  However, moving up in the company is very difficult."
good,"After 3 months working, I still didn't have a uniform. I received calls at 11 o'clock the night before work saying that I needed to show up by three in the morning."
good,The work environment is very comfortable and inviting and the pay and benefits are not great.  There are a lot of changes going on but work stability is here.
good,Good company but due to the current soda business environment in Philadelphia the position was eliminated. I am grateful for this employment where is has provided me with valuable training in fountain and refrigeration. This added to my other employment makes be a well-rounded HVAC/R technician.
good,it was ok very long hours and very litte pay but a good experience  management is not to bad I would not recommend anyone here to be honest crazy Chinese ot
good,"A typical day for me was very busy; assisting customers and team members with complex issues and inquiries. "
good,"Long hours, terrible management, no supervision or safety guidelines enforced, great pay, great benefits, and made many long time friends while working there."
good,"I worked for Coca-Cola Refreshments in Colorado and Texas for almost 4 years. While they provide wonderful benefits (401K AND pension plan), I could not handle the lack of work-life balance. Their operations require dedicated individuals who are willing to sacrifice their family and friends for the business. I worked in Production, Warehouse, and Distribution and I can vouch and say that each of these departments have crazy swings in work time - barely making 40 hours in the winter, to working over 60 hours in the summer. As a manager, I routinely worked 65-70 hours per week. My boss once told me that I was expected to work a minimum of 55 hours per week - salaried. So really not as great as it sounds. Cool company though and definitely recession-proof."
good,"Coke is really trying to attract new talent and offers great amenities, such as newly renovated HQ with huge gym.  Career growth is up to the individual and the culture is relationship-based.  Tendencies to be married to old policies and procedures which can low down progress.  Great opportunities for international travel."
good,"Typical workday includes loading out your handheld, picking up your route and getting your day started."
good,KPI's are clear and exciting. Managers are fun to report to. System letting down the company's productivity.Opportunities to make the brands teh first choice of the consumers allowed me to make other means to gain increamenta volume. Budget that we were given each allowed me to build solid relationships with the customers and their staff. Overall it is a c=good company to work for.
good,Handwork is one of the most important important traits you should have working at coca-cola. Straight duties are always expected due to line delayed and troubleshooting.
good,If you can keep up with all the changes you will learn a lot. Sometimes the constant changes can be frustrating but you are always learning something new.
good,I'd Say it was a good choice for starting here. Good environment and good people. Not good at salary but still not too bad either.
good,"Working in a call Centre, there is no advancement until someone resigns, retires or a new position is opened (that's pretty rare). There is rigidity in career movement. Benefit is good. Relationships are best kept on a professional, polite, friendly but distant manner. Call centre jobs are routine. Employees are trained to do a lot of projects and then are overloaded with such projects. Politics - although discreetly hidden - play a role and could affect your job performance. Under the guise of doing special projects, there are people who tend to gang-up on others to pass the work load to others - as much as they could. You are just a number in this company."
good,"After deciding to fold on the opportunity in being a ""Owner Operator"" as a semi-truck owner, I decided to apply as a Driver for CokeCola. "
good,good place to work will provide you with future job offers in the field. Worked there 8 years and had good experiences. will give you a opportunity to move up in company.
good,"Longer days with lots of expectations. This company is always in a stat of change however, trying to always achieve the best."
good,"1.Its really tough daily work."
good,Good work environment. I have learned to work within an organization. Management staff is cooperative. Co-workers are friendly. Contractual bondage is hardest part of the job.
good,"Some of the pallet jacks are dilapidated and get in a bind when you attempt to turn a corner. The ""voice pick"" computers that are used freeze up and crash often. The job is repetitive and simple, but the equipment problems can make quotas a hassle to meet."
good,Fellow warehouse employees are great! They have made my experience within the workplace enjoyable. Learn a lot of new warehouse skills and procedures.
good,It is a okay job. It is a good job to help you start driving tractor trailers but the Chinese overtime is absurd. You get paid half time instead of time and a half for every hour over 40 because you are considered salary.
good,"A typical day at work is we visit our accounts for the day. Make sure we give them excellent service and try to sell in new items. Plus find new displays in a store to gain space and extra cases. Management towards is ok but lately with the commission no one knows where the numbers are being pulled. Moral is a bit low at this moment but we work well as a team and are pushing through a low right now to make things better. The best part of this job is going out everyday and excepting something different everyday. Also meeting different owners and people on the trade. We have a great beneifts at this company. They do take care of their employees for retirement. My biggest downer for this company is the way the promote within the company,"
good,It is a good place to start a career. I learned how to work in a large system. It has been a good overall experience for me. Management is overworked.
good,"Don't Get me wrong It's a little challenging at first. But when you get the hang of it, It becomes easier. Management is ok I guess depends on which department you work in. Co-workers make work fun by racing to see who have the highest score and who build the most pallets."
good,Responsibilities consist of Building orders according to assigned ticket. Using industrial power equipment.Meeting daily goal requirements. Also traveling to store's to up sell product and make sure customers receive the right product.
good,In my 25 year tenure at Coca Cola I learned a lot about building and maintaining relationships with both my colleagues and my customers. I feel I have reached a point in my life where I want to persue a new company and new challenges.
good,"It is just that you have to deal with management that don't do there work, then you have to pay when push come to shuff,  allso co-workers makes it difficult for you as a driver to do your work.  Truck helpers have no sense of responsibilities, they will break or even steal the stock on truck, when you have to collect money from costomers."
good,you can make a living as a single person. wouldn't recommended if you have a family. long hours and back breaking working. make sure you have a reliable car. Have to base life around job.
good,"A  Coca-cola é uma empresa de excelência e extremamente competente no que faz."
good,Bonne socièté de renom internationale. travail plutot agréable et facilité par les moyens modernes mis en place
good,Great company to work for as far as benefits and work/life balance.  some of the problems are between upper management not knowing what the sales force does or objections that we run into in the trade.
good,"Make your own salary type position that keeps you  in shape. If you can come up with a mental system to be able to withstand any negative vibes that can cause you to be off with your work, it helps!"
good,"uma empresa que ensina a valorizar as oportunidades , e que faz enxergar o lado bom da conquista ."
good,shift roster change every couple of weeks wasn't my cup of tea although met some interesting people at that stage of my life. Did however enjoy operating twin tyne forklifts although found this role very repetitive with little reward!
good,"Multitasking at all times."
good,"Change is frequent.  Success is difficult to obtain because the metrics and measurements are a ""moving target"".  Employees must be flexible and set expectations of management low."
good,"The facility is very nice, plenty of food options in the mall and the company provides free Coca-Cola products for employees. They also have a pool table in the break area. The culture is very open and honest for the most part and generally positive. The job isn't very demanding but is repetitive and does not pay well. We just had a pay raise to bring our minimum pay up to $13 an hour, which is helpful but not enough. Interdepartmental communication is severely lacking and the opportunity for growth is non existent. Any specialty departments are linear moves with linear pay and the ability to move up shrinks by the day."
good,The pay was very low for the amount of work you have to complete. The management team was very mean and did not treat their employees with the respect the deserve.
good,"its a job! you have good and you have bad."
good,At first it was a very well ran and managed place then in the past year and a half nobody is accountable and everyone is irritable and out to get one another.
good,Long hours and company definitely about numbers and running very light on help. Co-workers are good to work with. Like the fact im on the road all day.
good,"A good place to work at with lots of opportunity to move within departments to rediscover yourself."
good,struggling to adjust to consumer trends regarding health and wellness. over-balanced portfolio of carbonated soft drinks in use
good,"I joined Coca-Cola as a refrigeration apprentice and during my training I have learnt a lot as I was the first Refrigeration guy and that taught me to be my own man in a way that I could be productive and solve problems on my own."
good,I've enjoyed my career finding creative solutions to problems and meeting new people everyday.  Its a nice feeling being somewhere different everyday.  I feel that I've accomplished everything I set out to accomplish in this position and now its time to move on and find the next challenge.
good,"Dinamik"
good,"It's okay place to work if you don't mind the good ol'e boy system. You don't get promoted based on your work performance especially since they give you a rating based on subjective objectives. "
good,"rotina de trabalho normal para o seguimento, onde aprendi muito na área de vendas externas, gerencia de boa qualidade e clima bem agradável entre os colegas de trabalho, tendo como uma das partes mais difíceis as mudanças de rota dificultando um trabalho mais exato, mais tendo como parte agradevel no mesmo arecompensa por metas batidas."
good,"I worked for CCR for 7 years and will tell you the brands and history speak for themselves. The company is an Amerincan staple! Long history of aggressive market place trend setting coupled with meeting the consumers desires......""To be with-in arms reach of the consumer's desire!"".....However, CCR is made up of the bottling division and then the really good jobs that are housed at Minute Maid Foods. The latter is where the expertise  and better paying jobs are housed..."
good,A typical I am in charge of up to 30 employees during any one shift. During my shift I am responsible for daily production  and inventory reports.
good,Coca-Cola FEMSA teaches us the importance of accountability. They always give trainings and seminars to ensure that employees are competent and suited for their job.
good,Good place to work with good benefits.  Long hours and high demand for execution.  Must adapt quickly to change on a daily basis
good,nice fun place to work but hard at the same time typical day of work is pulling product to the floor an working it to the shelf.making sure product get rotated
good,A Challenge everyday with communication and process improvement while going through leadership and hourly compensation issues
good,Typical day starts at 7am and you work at your own place until complete. I learned what it takes to keep a store stokced in certain merchandise. Managaement was readily avaliable and always there to help out. Hardest part was down stacking pallets but the easiest part was shel stock which was routine
good,aprendi muito na coca-cola sobre o comércio e a industria. ampliei minha visão sobre como o mercado é competitivo.
good,"Long hours and work mandatory 6 days a week. Management does nothing to support hourly workers. Production supervisors can be rude and verbally abusive when there junk equipment goes down. "
good,"A normal day starts with start-up of bottling production. As Quality Assurance Specialist, it is our duty that had many SOP's before the start-up, thus making us the busiest staff of the Production. Most of my colleagues are within my age range and that is the pretty part of job. Being friendly give me the advantage thus the seniors teaches me techniques in the working place. The hardest part of the job is having troubleshooting, though it is part of the job that l learned most."
good,"4 day work week was nice, long hours but that's trucking. they have good benefits to."
good,"previous management was great, now we are stuck with a lot of micro-managers. Used to be a great place to work."
good,"A great job if you don't want to be able to do anything else. Usually 10 hours or more a day. Lack of communication between account managers and merchandisers. Also, using your own vehicle, it is terrible with the cost of gas. The mileage reimbursement only plays a factor when you drive lots of miles, if it's a short route, you'll get low reimbursement. The physical part is not bad as long as you're willing to work. The pay is not too bad at the start."
good,"I worked all drivers money,, deposits, sales calls, keying in orders, took care of machines installed and taken out, signage, deposit reports."
good,"No work life balance"
good,You go to assigned stores in your area and merchandise/sell the products.

good,"Muitas viagem s bonificação.S horas extra e s taxa por KM."
good,"Met new people, established relationships with store management, learned efficiency of product organization, time constraints between stores."
good,"I would go in and have a pre shift meeting, then go to the floor and exchange info with previous operator. I would get all my paperwork in order, check all the customer info to make sure their needs were being met by the product i was making, make sure i had all the components i needed to finish the order, make quality checks every hour, break my packers out, keep check on my line to keep product in spec and make adjustments as needed to insure a quality product. exchange info with on coming operator and end my shift."
good,"Good place to learn P&L, has ability to balance work and personal life."
good,"A typical day consist of traveling from one customer outlet to another stocking shelves, building displays, and organizing back stock area. The hardest part of the job is having to deal with issues pertaining to my co-workers ineffectiveness to do there job fully and having management unable to correct it due to the demand for merchandisers.  The most enjoyable aspect of the job was the traveling and the paycheck."
good,"Grow the business and gain volume.  Corporate says focus on Customer Service but policies and procedures are not aligned with that concept. Loved my customers, and they loved me.  Loved the freedom of not having a boss directly behind me, mine was in another state and for over a year I did not have one.  Overall good company to work for.  Great benefits and one of the last companies to still offer an actual pension."
good,"At Coca Cola you can expect constant work due to deliberate inefficiency, and poor organization in the company. Expect to work mandatory overtime with little to no notice on any given day. Yes, that does mean more pay however. Coke is a great position for a single person with no other responsibilities in their life."
good,"Great people and work environment. Good pay and benefits. "
good,"Work was just work, overall a okay work environment, had to use your own personal vehicle, the hardest thing about the work was coke products where always selling so keeping up with the product could be overwhelming"
good,"Lots of fault finding and operating and logic's control on a daily basis."

good,"A typical work day included conference calls on sales objectives, traveling to visit clients (usually small business or key accounts), selling products that will drive profitability, renewing customer contracts, acquiring new accounts, and maintaining relationships with all clients.  I learned to use various software programs.  Through collaboration with other departments and coworkers, we were able to accomplish company objectives and increase overall productivity through teamwork. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my clients, being on the board of Executive Women as Charity Lead, and participating in classroom style training. I learned a lot as an employee and can say that I had an overall enjoyable experience. The most challenging part of the job is maintaining such large territories, it's doable but it can be difficult at times."
good,management at times dont know whats going on in their own bulding. no one has your back ..alot of back stabbing and not faithfull to long term employees
good,"Laboralmente fue una muy buena experiencia, ya que adquirí muchos conocimientos en el área de ventas, con una muy buena cartera de clientes y una muy buena relación con los clientes."

good,enter the store in stock up all of coke a cola products in clean the area in the back where we store of products.
good,"Working at a large warehouse in the summer is hard, no doubt about it, but you can make quite a bit of money if you're willing to put forth the effort.

good,"Responsible for $80k - $100k per day and required to log every penny.  Tracking people with NSF checks and cutting off credit if multiple offense.  Daily drivers were the best part of the job and kept me there for 20 years.  Hardest part of the job was never knowing when I was going home.  Being responsible for all that money meant waiting for the last truck to come off the road at night, even if it was 10pm.  What did I learn from this job?  Repairing my equipment, tracking people who bounced more than one check, armored truck pick ups, daily audits on 42 drivers and closing routine of deposits for the next day."
good,This job envolves many different activities but my main function was to set up coke displays in various stores. The hardest part was dealing with difficult store managers. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people.
good,bueno mi paso por coca cola fue breve ya que solo me contrataron para una promocion pero me diverti mucho al salir con mis compañeros a recorrer las calles para vender el producto.

I have learned to be very proficient with SAP. I have great co-workers and we all work to acheive the same goals. We also make the atmosphere as fun as we can. The hardest part of the job is getting up so early to go to work. I am usually at work around 3:30 a.m. It is not easy to get up that early and get ready for work. The most enjoyable part of the job are the co-workers.

good,"A Coca Cola é uma excelente empresa para trabalhar do ponto de vista de benefícios e qualidade de vida, no entanto, quando falamos de cultura o ambiente é muito estressante e pesado. Muito competitivo."
good,Management has a lot to learn as far as how to trat employees. They micro manage all employees and they are not fair with their processes. A little two faced for my taste.

good,"You are expected to work every legal hour they can ask you to work.  Bottom line is the focus in this environment."
good,Too much turnover in supervisors and management.  Some of them worked better with store managers than others.  There needed to be more hands on with the supervisor.
good,I do not like working here anymore due to the fact that they are now based ot of Mexico.  They also do not rally care about their employees very much and they really don't allow for good customer service anymore either.
good,Very fast paced work. Worked in many stores in one day to help refill shelves for customers. A lot of lifting as well. Worked with a lot of different store managers.

good,Enough is enough if you are working from 2 p.m. all the way to 5:30 a.m. you are only human day in Day Out so therefore the human body gets tired.

good,Very hard back breaking repetitive work . health benefits are very good . three weeks vacation after your first year uniforms are provided.  Free Powerade during the summer
good,It is what it is. Just work hard. Dont expect advnacment or praise just expect steady work and steady pay. The company will advance from within but most times they have someone in mind so applying for a promotion may not be a successful endeavor.
good,the job was good till you needed help from a superviser and when you asked for more traing i never got it and you would start at 6 in the morning and wont get off till 6 at night

good,I don't see how this is applies to uploading a resume and searching/applying for a job. My opinions towards and employer that I work/have worked for shouldn't matter to anyone searching for a career. Everyone should develop their own opinion based on their experience.
good,daily route having 8-16 stops a day. learned a lot about customer service. management can do a better job. hardest part of the day is getting out the warehouse. best part is finishing your last stop.

good,I had a wonderful working experience at Coca-Cola.  The brand is amazing and every day I felt as if I was a valuable part of the team.  There was also a great deal of room for growth and development.
good,"A typical day at work began with making an assessment of the day's priorities, consulting with my manager's calendar to assess the immediate priority and handling any and all unexpected incidents as they arise."
good,Worklife balance was not very good but management was always willing to help when needed. Sales goals unattainable at times. Great employee engagement events.
good,"Production was very fun and you learn something new every day but the warehouse is very stressful, the quota makes it hard to focus and I do not think the requirements are fair in the warehouse it is too stressful."
good,Coca Cola is one of 5 most recognized brands in the world. There is a great sense of pride that comes with working for THE Industry Leader as just about every person has used the products.
good,"Hard work, they could care less about your personal life, hard to get promoted, pay in below stardards for what you are expected to do.  Treated very bad if not proforming."

good,I like the people but the job was stressful to many stops and not enough time. What I did like about the job is I got to see new places I haven’t been the commute I don’t like.
good,"The job started out as challenging, but quickly became back breaking work.  The pay was not equal to the amount of work that went in to the job.  Overall, it was a good job, but they definitely need to increase the pay."
good,Coca-Cola  is a good company and has great benefits.  The people that work their a fun and enjoyable. Its a hard job.  Its a team work environment and they all work together to accomplish the same goals.
good,coke is very competitive with the other soda companies  we go in earlier than all the others and work later  long hours lots of traveling in your own vehicle mandatory holiday work
good,"Very mundane work, same thing just a different day."
good,"Management was great and the job was fun. I saw myself retiring from here...until. The restructure caused to much stress, almost all employees that were there when I started were let go. No matter how much you give they aren't happy."
good,"dealing with customers getting checked in"

good,"I enjoyed working in a fast  pace customer service environment learned a lot about retail Business, hard working and detail oriented coworkers and staff members"
good,A typical work day started at 8am. I learned how to structure my appointments within timeframe and appease even the most difficult customer. Management were very helpful albeit communication between management was not. The culture was not the best. Bullying was a problem within the lower ranks and was encouraged. The hardest part of the job was the constant appointment changes made by management. The most enjoyable part of the job was the fulfilment of a contract to finish
good,My experience with Coca-Cola was a brief experience with the company however in the time I was employed with the company I noticed a few things of note. There is opportunity for advance to management and I like the fact they mostly try to hire from within. I think upper management could be more involved in the operations but outside of that not a bad company to work for.
good,"Coca Cola was a great company to work for. "
good,"Lack of communication, competitive pay, long hours, positive is that your by yourself most of the time. More freedom than ud expect, good vacation length"
good,"Overall great place to work, Coworkers were great but management was not so friendly. A lot of upper management work was being delegated to lower level workers."

good,"If you want a happy environment, you have to be engaged with the company.  They offer many things for the employee to do, you just have to get involved."
good,Coca Cola is a face paced work enviroment with plenty of opportunities for advancement.The company has a very good benefits package with some of the best health insurance
good,"I was on call, pay was good, dead end unless you like warehouse jobs. Supervisors only cared about numbers and other than that no stress, just do your work."
good,"can sometimes be fun, has a great break rooms but for the rare breaks you get,  a lot of the customers get angry at you over problems that you did not cause but thats just part of it"
good,uma empresa boa de se trabalhar pagava em dia não atrasava salario.
good,"it's back to being coca-cola north america. i will always love coke but it's a scary time to be there."
good,When I was there I had 3 bosses in charge of 20 plus people and their qualifications were that they drove a truck for 20 plus years. They had zero social skills and didnt know how to manage people.
good,"The bottler side of Coca-"
good,"its a good temporary job. a young mans job, at the rock island plant there could be more color. Coca Cola forever praising diversity in their advertisement."
good,nice place to work at. Environment is very professional. The only cons are working very late and not getting home on time. Not knowing what time you get off each day
good,"High paced environment, collaborative with most other departments, I desire a more professional - team to team approach with best practices and troubleshooting environment to work in."
good,"There are lots of people who would like this job. I don't want to give you the wrong impression of this company. Everyone has an opinion so take this as one guys. I sucked at the job loved working with people and that's what I was sold on but it to me was hard to make store owners happy and get done in time to have much time to recover for the next day. Christmas, Thanksgiving will never be the same you will work twice as hard and get pretty much no time off. you can not take time off either them times. So the good things are benefits time off is good. I also hurt my knee and they helped me get better and did not give me any problems so there are great things to this job it just has to fit you and it did not me. Good people and glad I got a chance to give it a try"
good,Leadership change and frequent restructuring. Employee engagement spirit is low.  Benefit is fair. Salary is within market range. On-boarding process is poor.
good,"While this was a great place to work, and I learned a lot, I always felt like my job was at jeopardy because of the constant re-structuring. While I was there for 5 years, I went through 3 re-structures, one of which left me without a job."
good,Relaxing work environment. Easy work. Enjoyed working there. Coworkers were easy to get along with. Highly recommend place for employment. Would work here again if the opportunity comes.
good,my job consisted of making sure every order included the correct items and went to the right location. Assisted in finding products when they couldn't be located on the floor. Made sure products were entered into the data base correctly.
good,"All day you spend in storage room, working as hard as possible to make better sallary. So it's better for you to not make long pause, the best thing it's to receive more and more requests for supply and prepare them for one shift. Another thing is that you won't probably advance to some higher position, and your back will ache you after several years."
good,"coca cola is Great communication between managers and employees"
good,Started as an Sales Account Manager and was laid off due to company change. My role then changed to ORM where I would order and merchandise my truck that was delivered. It was an inconvenience to drive across town and my work life balance was being compromised.
good,No Review needed .  This is a great company.  They were very nice to me.  I would recommend this to everyone.  This company loves their employees and show it
good,es una empresa con necesidad de amplio disponibilidad de horario.
good,On your own for the most part. Can be very stressful at time and you never know what type of day your going to have. Its a toss up everyday. The workers are nasty and like to cover their own tracks while leaving other out to dry.
good,"Scheduling was one of their biggest downside."
good,"Coca-Cola is a great company and for the most part a good place to work. As a company they do strive to give their customer 110%, which is great for customers not always good for their employees."
good,Good company that offers great products with a dominate market share  worldwide. Competitive environment generally means the Market effort determines who gets advantage.
good,Buen ambiente de trabajo supervisar las lineas de produccion para que no pare por ningun motivo la produccion de botellas y tambien por las noches darle manteniminetos preventivos y correctivos a la maquinaria en general
good,management need more improvement and pay more attention to customers needs. This is a great company but they cut overtime and benefits without notice.
good,the work place is very friendly in my role you dont have set breaks or lunches as long as you reach out to your co-work to make sure someone is available to work your calls
good,great place to work to advance career opportunity. Gets a little stressfull for one person to perform a typical day of work.. The hardest part is being careful you dont injure yourself.
good,"I outgrew this company quickly.  bureaucratic, slow to react, difficult to move up and be recognized.  autonomy and training were benefits, but disjointed top-down structure."
good,"If you want to work hard with minimal advancement, Coca Cola is the place. You will make decent money but its a blue collar job for life. There is much better ways to make a living."
good,"hi reach forklift picking also receiving putaways and returns "
good,I delivered soda pops to vendors and enjoyed doing it because driving big coca cola trucks and get to drive out of town was really fun.Serving people and vendors was great.
good,GPCC/CCSWB was a great place to work. A lot of possibilities for advancement and a lot of people willing to assist in getting you to your desired position if you were willing to put forth the effort. Over time the focus was take off the associates and put more towards the business which caused a drop in morale and performance. Im grateful for all that I have learned and was able to attain during my time with the company. I wish that the company didn't change its focus and cause several of its associates to feel otherwise.
good,This was a good job with little to no expierence  needed it is hard back breaking work long hours but this job does compensate very well I’d say this position is for younger energetic ppl
good,"Days are minimally 10 hours in complex every changing environment.  Business is changing in recent years with health concerns, beverage taxes and economic conditions."
good,"Hard work, medium reward. A typical day is starting early in the morning, work back stock, work in-coming load if ordered and delivered on time, repeat at next store."
good,I was hired to merchandise products sold to our accounts. But now that this branch has switched to Coca-Cola United I have herd great things about the switch.
good,"it was a job to get through tough times growing up "
good,my experience working for the company was good. i enjoy working with the staff and had great hours. the pay was great. the trucks were safe and good to work with.

good,"good work environment, everyday a different story, new tasks and new challenges , must work hard to achieve results, great environment for building relationships"
good,The work was at the Coca-Cola was fast paced and requires a lot of hard work because there is a lot of product to be loaded. The work hours was from 4pm until the work was done which usually was about 6am the next morning.
good,"My POV of this maybe skewed because of my relationship with my immediate supervisor. We did not get along at all, and i rarely have said that about any job i have ever head. I liked the company, not working under her"
good,"A cocal was a very fun job to do, while I was there I developed some good relationships with other associates however the supervision over the actual drivers could be way better."
good,Warehouse very productive every day. I have learned to operate a forklift and hand jack. Management ok. Work place alright. The hardest part working hours. Enjoy the co works.
good,The benefits were good when I was here and I also have a pension set up here. You have to be able to keep a steady pace and make your deliveries and you don't have a set time when you are done
good,i was fresh out of high school and going straight into a factory the hour was to long i really didnt get alone with my supervisor the and work enviorment just did'nt fit me

good,It was a job that was good for the time. A stepping stone to better opportunities.i would recommend this as a place to work. It's a good starter job for people looking for work in a major company.
good,"Quick paced warehouse job. Long hours during the summer, short hours during the winter, famine or feast work environment. Cranky drivers, happy drivers, all in a days work."
good,"I had a temporary job as a Pricing Coordinator.  No career advancement, very mundane work. I could tell that no one actually liked their jobs.  it was pretty obvious that the position was not going to go anywhere"
good,would not recommend this job to my worst friend they pay was no good and the you were over worked its not an job that I would recommend to any one unless I didn't like them
good,I enjoyed working there but once they started having all their strucutural changes the job security was not there. Which is why i seeked for employment elsewhere
good,"Manager never asks more of his employees than than he is willing to do himself."

good,Working as a contractor was great and learned a great deal from management and team. The location was also convenient. We worked together as a team and assisted team members as necessary.
good,"You start your day in the morning but no two days seemed to be the same.  You could have a super easy day, hard day or think it'll be an easy day then become a terrible day.  I learned how to work as a team with competitors but also know when you want more than them.  It was nice to be able to work without having constant supervision and you usually work with some fun people but the hard part was not knowing when you might get off work.  They were pretty good about giving you a set schedule so you at least knew what days you'd have off but you could clock out at any time during the day."
good,ive been there a really long time and have seen a lot of good and bad. there are some really great marketers and a lot of best in class buisness practices on customer relationship management

good,"fast paced work environment, management was friendly and understanding,, we were always busy, learned how to build orders and stack pallets efficiently"
good,"Great place to work if you like early mornings or late evenings. You will learn alot about vendors displays inverntory managment. Supervisors you will hardly see weekly . Merchandiser are to get in store check, stock, reorder if needed then move to next store. Hardest part was doing supervisors jobs with the stores. Easiest part stocking and ordering."
good,Can be very stressful at time. Come in at 5:30 and sometimes wont get off until 7 or 8. Worst part of the job was spilling pop in the trailer while driving on the route.
good,I loved my job. Employees nice and friendly.  Got to meet lots of people from different background. I really enjoyed working for this company very much.
good,It used to be more relaxed and enjoyable but management has clamped under on every single thing that employees do. Feel like we are robots. There are games that employees can engage in but there's never anytime to do so. The morale has gone south and so are the employees. No job is perfect but this one was at up there.
good,very busy and fast paced. learned to work alone and with others. also learned to work in a managed time frame. The employees made the job a little more enjoyable.
good,"Good company to work for.Never had any issues"
good,I learned the process inside the coca cola plantation and also the treatment  of the supervisors to the crew. I realized how important the communication skills in your life to have a better conversation to the co-workers and even to the supervisors that has only short patience in their treatment to the workers.
good,"Au sein de cette entreprise je me suis focalisé sur l'aspect promotionnel et marketing des Boisson non alcoolisées ."

good,"very easy, great starter job, very low raises, has great work life balance. very poor management. you have no clue if you are doing anything write or wrong. no reviews or one on one meetings in the customer scheduling specialist department"
good,My current job is ending in a few months. Coca-Cola has changed their back office operations. I do the job of three people due to reorganization a few months ago.
good,"its a lot of lifting, very hot inside plant, not such a fun job, the hours are crazy you go in at 3pm and don't get off until all the orders are filled that might be 5 am"
good,Good place to learn the food production and distribution industry. Possible room for movement and enhancement. Not much variety of people that are in charge.
good,I was working in the high springs bottling plant that bottled water from ginn springs i would use the forklift to move the product to the warehouse to be stored
good,"Sr. Leadership was often unprepared and appeared to be inexperienced in their role.  This made it difficult to ""do things right"" and to complete tasks in a timely manner."
good,"At my time at Coca-Cola I was trained on many different the machines but with no compensation or incentive to actually have trained skill set. which at the time I thought was normal because it was my second Warehousing/Manufacturing job I've had. I had approachable management for all of my needs and worries for a time and had one really good mechanic that would be there to help if there where any mechanical issues that I myself could not fix. it's all team based work because you have various machines that would make the coca cola bottles enjoyed today, unfortunately the relief from duty for lunch was terrible because if you went to leave your station for lunch the person that's supposed to be relieving you is standing at your machine pretending there are numerous issues with it even though you have been running the machine perfectly for the last 5 hours. and theres nothing more irritating than when you punch out for lunch, you and your team is ahead, that theres the alarm from one of the machines that something is wrong."
good,"Daily duties include planning calls "
good,"Fast paced, Moderate hard labor factory work. Depends on your work ethic, this can be the right job. Compensated every week, and great benefits. Management cares about, its employees. The cons is that I hope you have a good union, and long hours."
good,"Its a place that is going through massive downsizing and is not commensurate with a large growth plan. Good salaries, but if not on the inside track, you may be always looking in."
good,"Lots of opportunities in many disciplines of a company. Culture has shifted to accommodate new work force, but still has many experienced workers. New CEO making changes."
good,I was only their for 6 months because I was covering for someone on maternity leave but work experience was fine.I learned a lot about the  business and employees were kind.
good,"It was a decent job and I was able to be promoted after working hard. The benefits were decent, the pay was okay. Overall it was a decent job. But it's a typical corporation, you have a bunch of hoops to jump through administratively and some of the senior managers could be difficult. But I believe many of them have been replaced since my time there."
good,Most enjoyable part of the job was my co workers.  I was able to work with an awesome group of guys. We would show up to work our mánager would usually tell us what he didnt like about what we did last night. We start by putting away extra cases from the load before.  Then we start  building  pallets and loading them onto the trucks.
good,Blood in or blood out.  Once you are in there they will work you to death there is no leaving this place.  The culture and the soda are outdated change your story.
good,It's a very fun place to work and company to work for. They have accceptable benifits and 401 plans. I have been with the company eight years so there I have it
good,There are areas of opportunity in the area of advancement and salary. This is not applicable to the Coca-Cola Company but only the Coca-Cola Refreshment Company.
good,ok during the many years i worked at the company.The company is a good benefit fit but has a high degree of poor middle management therefore making it difficult to progress.
good,"Always have to meet the daily challenges of a servicing, distributing and warehousing of non alcoholic beverages. Very fast paced and demanding environment. "
good,Develop embedded software for Freestyle soda fountain machine. The touch-screen machine dispenses more than 100 different Coca-Cola drink products and users' selected mixtures of flavors.
good,It's a typical warehouse job. There's no room for advancement but the work isn't hard. It's fairly easy if you're not a lazy person. Management was cool .
good,"Would start my  day at 5 or 6am, would arrive at my first outlet, fill store shelf, coolers, displays, and other store needs with Coca-Cola based products, rotate product to ensure code date will not expire, make sure back stock is organized and clean everyday. Check out with the store manger to inform the store is complete. Would then proceed to the next  store outlet  to repeat the same process. Would on average do 4  to 6 stores a day."
good,Was with Coca Cola for close to 5 years. Mixed bag of good days and bad days. Overall the experience was not bad. My location was being bought out by coke consolidated. I was not drinking the new flavor of pop so I gracefully stepped away. I am happy I left the company when I did. No regret.
good,"The work culture was stressful.  Employees had low morale due to yearly budget cuts, no management support, high sales goal and delivery expectations."
good,"Training was done on the spot with a senior merchandiser, and this can be overwhelming for a new employee with everything that has to be learned in terms of store layout, display building, product placement, deliveries, equipment usage, and organization. "
good,Coca Cola Beverage company is great to work at and everyone you work are amazing. The only issue I had was when you're running behind and no one come to help even if you notify them.
good,"Buena valoracion,para poder desarrollar habilidades laborales."
good,"I worked in distribution so I can't say this for Sales, but for anyone in distribution/warehouse at the plant level, expect long days. Support was limited to non existent."
good,"I learned all the basic training to get me going. Both road and customer service skills increased. I was provided with safe, quick, and efficient help as needed."
good,"Management had no structure and direction at times"
good,A typical day at work involved driving a pallet jack for material handling.  I learned how to pick customer orders from a headset for loading onto delivery trucks.
good,"n/a"
good,"very interesting very different from other jobs I have had in the past because, I was basically working on my own everyday which I enjoyed a lot but was different. overall coca cola is a great company."
good,"It was hard at first but got use to it, very helping workers. Management always stress so that you are on point. Experienced workers are always willing to help you. I learnt a lot during my time working there, would love going up the ranks maybe work as a HR, financial manager or an operations manager."
good,coke is nice but they are selling of a lot of there plants so time here might be short lived but you can make good money in the mean time. so don't pass it up
good,"No work life balance. High demand for being present when salary paid. Great benefits and pay though, just a lack of your personal time. Recommend to someone who doesn't mind being married to their job."
good,"Answered customer questions regarding store merchandise department information and pricing."
good,"Being part of the company was very enjoyable and interesting."
good,You never realize that Coca Cola has so many different products until you are employed by them.  It can be a little overwhelming at first.  It takes time to get in a routine so you can be more effective at your job.
good,"Fun environment.  Initiatives may be daunting with unrealistic timelines, however great base for a career in the CPG Industry.  Not a company meant for the faint of heart."
good,Typical day at coca cola involves a decent amount of work. Some days are easy most can be challenging. Hardest part of the job can be dealing with customers. Routes dispatched wrong a lot.
good,"It is a great place who want to learn new technologies."
good,not a great company. They claim to be family oriented but they are far from that. Pay is minimal with little room for growth. the type of work is wearing on your body.
good,Its an R & D center. I learned all the water and other beverages  related analysis. Many techniques and advance instruments. Good work culture. The most enjoyable part of the job was we can taste variety of beverages.
good,Demanding culture. You have the tools to do your job You have the help desk to handle problems that come up. Management teams give you support to be successful.
good,I am fortunate to have an easy job in Coca Cola as production operator. Very lucky to have an opportunity to work in this company even the salary is low.
good,"i did work for The coca cola company and was in help desk support "
good,"They do offer a lot of training classes, instructor and self led. Develop yourself no one can do it for you. Take advantage of the online classes. Management can be bias, so upward movement is still difficult. For the do your best to meet and exceed SLA's. Try to volunteer for anything to get your name out there."
good,"Adorava os meus colegas de trabalho, a empresa e a oportunidade."
good,"Good place to work! Great pay and benefits. "
good,great place to work eveiryone looks to help each other management will always give credit when do. nothing goes with out a thank you. best place i have worked in 20 yrs
good,I had a great lead who accommodated my semester schedules. The down side of this job is the labour aspect. You will visit 4-6 stores a day and have to merchandise their shelves. Moving skids of coke products is one of the harder things to do in a grocery store.
good,"Working for Coca-Cola Refreshments really helped me mature personally and find out what it means to actually work hard and be held accountable for my work. Management was excellent and always worked with me around my school schedule. "

good,It's hard work espescially during peak season though the pay and commission is reasonably good.Through this job i learn new skill and get to know more people.
good,"In HR, the employees are the customers.  I was there to help them with any problems that may have occurred.  Also, applications were a big part of the job."
good,It was good for learning but working culture is not as much good as name derive full of internal politics between the employee which decrease the moral of employee
good,"It's a trendy and nice place to work. Free beverages, clean and newly renovated makes it a pleasant. Bright, sunny and updated technology is also a plus. Remotely working from your home office is also a plus."
good,Scheduling is not the best. Constantly requiring all employees to be available to work 6 or 7 days a week but not notifying them until day 4 or 5 of the same week.
good,"Have a set route, on the road at all times."
good,working at coca cola was good. good pay hrs. we had partner days once a week and if need help we will help each other out. its a good environment to work with. hard working people n friends.
good,"Supervisors suck to be specific ""marty"" didnt know how to deal or interact with his new drivers. Specially if you a different race. The place is not diverse at all. Improper trainings they just wanna throw you on the road asap, The abuse of power. Horrible route schedules, old slow trucks with old lift gates. The favoritism that goes around with the supervisors. If was totally bad and sad experience that picked the very moment I got hired. But will admit, there's ""some"" good people there."
good,A decent place to work with good people and fast paced work that keeps you moving. Good benefits and decent pay. Hardest part is finding room for everything coming through the warehouse.
good,Coworkers were great helpers and explain how to do the job a little bit fast and showed me techniques. Managers were really helpful and understanding.
good,I worked very hard there. I was upset that I was not given a chance to improve or to go to another level in the company. I felt that I deserved a shot
good,Good money but hours are long. No family life outside of work. Would not recommend this to anyone who enjoys time at home. This job will give you the money but you put in a lot of time for it.
good,"a good place to work.learned different cultures. unionized company."
good,"fun place to work and get to know new people, we all try to help each other with whatever job task needs to be done. management is friendly and willing to help"

good,Don't see future growth no time soon with the company tried to apply for another position and my boss didn't seem to happy about it when she found out
good,If you are a business minded and sales driven this place is a great fit. You have to be diligent and willing to do a lot of self-teaching and able to network well. The pay is decent as well as the benefits.
good,Days can be short or they can be long.. Depends on how you want to work.. Some of the co workers are cool and some are not .. You will go to many many stores and see many different people .. The money isn't so bad and the benefits are great

good,"today was a good day"
good,coca cola is a top famous brand in beverages .it was goodness for me to worked in a very unique culture place. workers was really professional and cooperative. they always taught me the thing in which i felt difficulty
good,"This was a door to door and management training program. Lets just say if you can do this job, going to peoples homes, rain or shine, in every kind of neighborhood imaginable, and walk for 7+ hours 7days a week, you can do anything. Hardest part, every part. Most enjoyable, meeting new people and making new friends."
good,"Great Place For Young People"
good,"Getting paid every week helped me deal with the bad work atmosphere. Got a lot of overtime, I wouldn't mind going back. 401k provided and also insurance plans are offered."

good,"Every day is different at CCR, but I love how each day brings with it a new challenge and a new opportunity to overcome seemingly impossible odds to deliver some new innovative idea or solution. The hardest part of working at CCR right now is that the parent company, The Coca-Cola Company, is selling off all of its bottling operations around the world, so we are dismantling the company and selling off territories. I have the privilege of working with new and existing independent bottlers to help them implement learning and performance support strategies that help them as they grow and develop their talent."
good,"pay is not good but over time benefits and pay increase, free cdl courses available for those that have been there long enough."
good,"Always on call, good compensation. Management set very difficult stretch calls that were unattainable."
good,"A empresa oferece boas ferramentas de trabalho, mas o último escritório não condizia com o nível de uma multinacional, e os processos de trabalho não são bem definidos, o que dificultava um pouco o andamento do serviço. Por outro lado, os Diretores, Gerentes e colegas eram de fácil convívio e acessíveis, com formas de trabalho bem definidas e diretas. A empresa me proporcionou treinamentos e workshops, incentivando o trabalho em equipe."
good,its an ok place if your in need of employement  the benefits are good learned a few things  heret and there typical day late nights sucks getting out 5 to 6 in the morning
good,Its just a job really no room for advancement.  They may ask your opinion but don't do anything about it. If you can last a year you will make it there.
good,Great american brand that is known worldwide. Management seems very disconnected from the sales teams. Bonuses have recently been cut as well as vehicle allowances.
good,informations et détails transmis sur demande relativement au poste
good,"Coca-cola is the best, love the brand, love the company, love the image of happiness. Number 1 consumer goods company in the world."
good,"A productive day at Coca-Cola in Targeted Sale consisted in identifying potential customers, knowing that by working independently i was completely responsible for setting my own  goals,  aside from goals already given by my supervisor.

good,Took an order from a computer and ensured that the right products were loaded onto the semi truck in the correct order. Manangement was not good at all and the hours were very inconsistent and long.
good,"stacking pallets, picked product for shipment, process of making their products, management was okay, great co-worker,hardest part of this is was retrieving product from 15 feet high,free soda"
good,The main positive about this job is that it is a way to get into project management. You come in as a temp and it's a 18 month contract. You pretty much have to kiss up to management and hope you are liked enough to get chosen. Hard work plays it's part but in the end it's a personal decision as to who they pick to be permanent. My advice use that year or more of project management experience and get a job elsewhere.
good,Although it was my first professional work experience I believe that I have used my internship period quite effectively to understand the corporate communication and team work notions.
good,pra mim foi de muito praze trabalhar em uma empresa mundialmente conhecida não so aqui no brasil mas em todo mundo. aprendi muito

good,management turnover rate was too much supervisors lacked people skills and work skills the work was good co-workers were not team players but I enjoyed my job I lasted sixteen years.

good,We would pull tickets to be built on pallets with pallet jacks in a timely fashion.  Forklift drivers will pick up the pallets and load them on the trucks.
good,I didn't get the opportunity to review this company in the 7 months I was there.  I was told approximately 90% of the temps were hired on full time.  After I left I discovered out of 500 temps only one might get hired.
good,"good company over all but cannot advance in the company strong amount of favoritism."
good,It was a lot of fun and I got a lot of social media marketing experience but it was very difficult to communicate with headquarters. Overall it was okay though.
good,"A good place to work and build a career, but too much nepotism and political bereauocracy existed in the Chicago land area for others to advance."
good,"Iconic brands, but declining soft drink category"

good,"I enjoy working at Coca-Cola"
good,This is a warehouse environment with narrow aisles and the loading dock is small and sometimes cramped the work environment is production based.
good,pay is pretty good for the area compared to other jobs. Management tells you if you do not like the job to quit Walmart is always hiring. No true leadership do as I say and that's it mentality.

good,"start between 1-3pm end time when work is done usually 4am stretching as far as 7am. Utilizing an electric pallet jack, select various products to be shrink wrapped and loaded  on trucks. Safety, endurance, self-motivation are a few things i picked up from this company. Not being able to do much (family, appointments, rest) with the time of getting off to coming into work. Being around the workers who knew how to get the job done while having a good time within company guidelines."
good,"Worked until job was done on a daily basis."
good,"Productive and physically demanding.  Everyday job tasks keeps you in shape.  Co-workers were very helpful and hard workers.  I learned so much about safety, team work, and equipment.  The perfect place for hands on hard workers."
good,"Good Company to work, Bad Management, Co-Workers are great, there is no hard part of the job, the job and the coworkers. What I don't like about the company is that its too far. With the traffic it take me 45 mins to get to work and 1h to get home."
good,Management does a great job motivating their employees.  Most enjoyable part of the job is working with the other employees.

good,"Variety of people working there, friendly environment overall, not much innovation in technology so work there seemed pretty boring, cut and dry."
good,Go to my first store and clock in. Then i work the back-stock and wait on the delivery. Work the orders completely and then go onto my next stores for the day. The hardest part of my job would be the ache my body has after a day of working. I never really see any of my co-workers unless we have a meeting or were building a big display.
good,I got let go because of something that was totally unnecessary. Overall I liked the people I worked with as well as I loved being able to interact with other people throughout the day
good,"* A typical day at work was review clients Merchandising standing."
good,started out as a great job but the more you try to better yourself the less hours you get. No raise when going from part time to full time. normally a loss in hours going from part time to full time and only one yearly raise of only .10 cents!! I would not recommend this job for someone looking for ful time employment..
good,"Coca-cola has an unpredictable work schedule and unable to plan family events and if the machines would work all the time you can get out at a decent time, weekly pay is nice"
good,"The ultimate job experience for Corporate America marketing professionals. If you are willing to relocate, there is a lot of opportunity for advancement."
good,"The warehouse was rarely clean, dust and mold would contaminate the products. People would work while sick with the flue or other illnesses and they wouldn't take the necessary precautions to prevent the illness from spreading. Individuals were forced to work over the standard 5 days a week. Supervisors would harass and distract workers. There was little to no communication between management and staff. Progressing with this company was nearly impossible."
good,"The Coca-Cola Company:"

good,"Coca Cola is a fun and excitable place to work.  The ability to manipulate your own schedule, makes juggling life and work a much easier task."
good,Coca Cola is a strong company with a huge market share. They garner vast influence over many mediums related or not to the retail market. Management is strongly favorable to the corporate side of business and employees are secondary.

My job has always been busy because I have to keep the warehouse organize as I can so that no time is wasted upon locating products.  I think the hardest part of the job is when I run out of resources e.i. Space, Manpower, and Equipments.  Its always been a self achievement if I see my work is done well and organized and that is probably the most rewarding time of my day."
good,Lead global project teams deploying new SAP functionality that improve business operations and efficiency.

The hardest part of my job is making the delivery because i have to break down the product off a pallet and wheel them in with a dolly. the most enjoyable part of my job is when i work a full week as of late i have not work consistent for about 1 year i work on an on call basis this is why i have decided to look for work else where
good,"The Coca-Cola Company has always been the Company I wanted to work for. It is a good, strong, strategically-inclined company with strong leadership at the helm. I just think a little more thought can be given and done with regards to the work-life balance like younger, up and coming companies."
good,I advanced quickly but had to leave for more income. Truly enjoyed being a part of the company.
good,Flexible schedule - people can work from home if they like. Too much work as they are downsizing.
good,"I learned that you must document everything that is said and done.The customers for the most part is great i deliver and set up the product on the shelves and in the coolers,sometimes taking payment for the products. the hardest part of the job is finding a place to unload the product.overall my daily routine is great."

good,I was there for two months on a temp assignment...then moved on. Was nice!
good,"During my time with Coca Cola Truesdale, I had very good learning experiences. My biggest down fall with the Truesdale Plant was there lack of leniency on the employees that lived in rural areas, such as my self at the time. When our country roads iced over and or we had large amounts of snow. Some of the employees there had no choice but to miss work. Many of us were trapped in our homes for two or three days at a time. There are also issues that arise do to an illness and it is impossible to give a notice. I had 3 students in the home at my time there. I had 2 cases in which I had to take children to the hospital or pick them up from school."
good,A day would consist of sending out my staff daily customer support documents to review so that the customer can be assisted. I learn each day that you have to take you own career into you hands. People only give you want you demand. Management style and priorites vary from area to area. The hardest part of my job is dealing with a legacy staff. A staff that was inherited and mostly people that have been around for over 10 years. Most enjoyable part of my job is when I make a difference in my staff's world. When I feel that I have provided them with some type of tools to progress forward.
good,ok if you don't mind driving your own car. you have to know someone up top in order to get advancement.
good,Longs hours one day 14 or more the next day 7 hours. Not very organized. Very fast paced. Co-workers are great people.

good,Each day I approach my job as an opportunity to inspire and develop myself and all I come in contact will. I am always available to help all who ask me and work diligently to have them sucedd through my help. It can be challenging being out in a field sales office. In total I enjoy working for Area Sales Team.
good,• Stocked store shelves with various Coca-Cola products at varying locations all over Maryland.
good,Completed weekly inventory for local markets.Provided product consolidation in area displays.
good,Coca-Cola Dallas Syrup Plant is a outstanding job.  Company needs to improve on its culture to be more inclusive for employees.  Good company to work for

good,Heavy work load. Long hours. Minute reward compensation. So so management. Good pay. Unsteady work schedule. Easy check in and check out process. Great coworker environment. No real lunch break. CDL training program
good,"Boa empresa."
good,"Working in the Store was an everyday challenge. You worked in a fast pace environment. I've met new suppliers on a daily basis. I've learned a lot about engineering spare parts and sourcing of parts. I had a good working relationship with both my managers and my work colleagues. We did not always see eye to eye but we've always manage to keep the communication level open between us. I enjoyed my work especially when there was a breakdown and we had to source parts urgently. It was not always a hectic day and there was always time for laughter in the office. The hardest part of my job was that i have to leave unfinished projects that i couldn't get to on a busy day for the next day. I enjoyed everyday in my work especially the company outings and socializing with the other departments. I love the fact that the company really looks after their employees in so many ways. You get incentives, annual bonus, bursaries for your children and for yourself, you also get products when you get married and a monthly discount on products. They believe in educating their employees and making sure that both employee and employers are happy."
good,"Management holds everything together and for the most part, there's a lot of good people there. The great personalities of the people I worked with kept me going, and kept me there for a while."
good,Good starting position to get some experience right out of college. You will not make a lot of money here.  Decent family/life balance.  They hire a lot from the outside for advanced positions.
good,It is a union shop and have some great reps. Management was brutal. Shop is very small drivers not held accountable for abuse of equipment no rewards for hard work
good,great company with good benifts..can move up easly...if its acoca cola its self...current company bsna is lacking though in employee recontion with prober team meeting..would go without team meeting 2 months at a time..
good,It is what it is. A difficult job that doesnt really pay that well. Suited for people who dont like to be at an office all day long but it is tiring and demanding.
good,"A Day is mostly back to back calls for placing beverage orders, Checking on deliveries or escalating different inquiries to different departments outside the inside sales group."
good,Excelente empresa para trabalhar só deixa a desejar a questão de salário.
good,"I have become knowledgeable in negotiations with medium to high profile sales clients."
good,Very dynamic environment with high ops tempo. Not enough supervisors to manage large number of employees. Extremely demanding making it difficult to balance work/personal life.
good,"I work for the coroporate office. The company calls itself digitizing. Hence, The Coca-Cola Company is laying off again. The company can be fun. However, the way the company is now being structured does not make sense. The company laid an 30 year employee off who could not retire with full retirement benefits because the employee did not meet the age requirement by 2 months. She protested their decision but they still denied her retirement. "
good,"Flexibale job and can have a life outside of work."
good,Great culture.  Extremely long work hours including weekends and holidays.  Managers were allowed to scream at associates in public.  Very little opportunity for promotion.  Telework and flexibility were great.  Only management received a bonus.
good,CCR was a portion of The Coca-Cola Company and was a fun place to work until we had to start to break the company down.  The learnings were immense on how to stay focused on day to day but also looking ahead to a day when the company won't exist.  Management was more focused on the day to day then the realization of shut down.  The hardest part was that the Coca-Cola Company wasn't focused on acquiring top talent from CCR to come in and lead.
good,"Coca-Cola has been around what seems like forever and doesn't look to be going away, so in this ever changing world we live in a career at Coca-Cola we be there as long as you choose to be."
good,6 days of work and selling is what really I learned from the company.  The management is responsive to their employees.  The hardest part of the job is when the month ends and I did not hit the sales target.  The most enjoyable part is the personal relationship I have with my customers.
good,The benefits were great. No one stood over your shoulder as long as you did what you were supposed to and kept your area clean your okay. Some managers are terrible to work with though.
good,"Played key role in guiding team to achieve positive gross profit of +10% for (4) consecutive trimesters. "
good,"customer service job very enjoyable , nice and fair management just that my wife passed away was the reason for leaving other than that it was a nice learning experience and learned a lot and met some very nice people in my time there"
good,Good place to work at if you want to live in the Operating Unit. They care about their customers and employee's as well as how they can improve their company
good,"They don't pay well for the kind of job..."
good,"Solid and established company. Good job security but the job provides very little work-life balance. Incredibly fast paced  environment and you have to be organized, a good planner   and a quick thinker to maintain the pace."
good,"It's alright to work for, but management needs improved because they are not easy to talk to order work with always upset and rude. Hours are good but no overtime."
good,"Empresa boa de se trabalhar, rígida e bem focada aos  seus objetivos."
good,"fair good lots of overtime good typical day electric pallet jack picking product for next day customers, union duties for my co workers and members of."
good,"The entire Coca Cola Company culture is changing for the better, but it is ultimately up to the manager what culture they cultivate. Some jobs can be very cyclical, so there can be a lot of down time."
good,"A typical day at work is, for the most part, enjoyable. I really enjoy interacting with the customers and also with my coworkers. New management has most recently taken over and has made alot of changes unfortunately these changes have had a negative impact on several drivers. The hardest part of the day is the physical toll on your body. The most enjoyable part of my day is punching out to go home and spend time with my family."
good,"Other companies who do the same job pay much more and have better modern business practices. Job security is nice, but stress level is pretty high compared to the other brands and their practices."
good,start work at 5 am load and unload tractor trailers about 25 to 40 every day get off of work 5pm.  most days were stressful because supervisor did not know anything about shipping and receiving. i.e. how much weight  or how to load semi's . he showed favoritism to one employee on a daily basis which caused for it to turn into a hostile work environment. hardest part was putting up with someone who relied on you and never show respect toward you. the most enjoyable part of my job was I knew what I was doing and did not have to be baby set. I got ethics and integrity about me unlike a lot of people there
good,"Coca Cola North America is a good place to work, for as long as you can stick around.  The company has gone through several layoff cycles in recent years as the company reorganizes.  Until Coca Cola has a breakthrough product, the company will try to save its way towards profit growth, ultimately continuing to cut headcount."
good,Not really room to advance. Low pay easy days. The job is doable not really difficult. Culture was fun really all about the brand. Would work there again.
good,I quit coke because the salary is low and they don't pay commission but it's fun working with them there is too much politics too . Management is is not that great handling employee
good,Get to the store and check conditions of the shelves of merchandise.  Then go to the backroom to work on getting the truck worked out.  Check for dates and merchandise the store.
good,The company that I started with is very different from the place I work now. The company (and industry) is changing their path and it is difficult to know where you stand and where you will end up.
good,long hours bad management load never ready in morning. long routes and sometime never know where to go. also makes you work very very long hours and overtime
good,Empresa de renome de alta qualidade..e conhecido em te mundo
good,To many people think it’s a great job but for what we get paid is not worth it work you to your bone An don’t get paid enough only get recognized when you mess up if one of the favorites you’ll get a chance to move up if not they don’t even no your there would recomemd this job to be an experience
good,"The company continues to go through layoffs due to leadership changes in IT.  IT is a constant expand and contract culture.  There is always complaints about lack of effective  management.  Other than that, the benefits and pay at this company are awesome."
good,"Upper management changed frequently and they were influenced by Atlanta. This caused projects to be started and stopped, restarted and stopped again frequently."
good,"I learn a lot working at coca cola in my 20 years of experience I learn all the equipment's pick up new skills. coca cola give you opportunities to grow within the company is up to you to grow with it, "
good,"sales people are not valued for SALES, unrealistic duties, merchandise products...told to send in items that don't sell, then management gets angry when they are returned for being expired."
good,"A typical day for my role in the company was to juggle many different tasks and responsibilities. Management was fairly good to work for and the company was transparent when it came to communication about change and organization restructures. The hardest part of the job, at times, was dealing with all of the ""red tape"" or different levels of approval that would be needed in order to satisfy a customer request or need. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the great team that I did over my years of employment and also seeing our brand associated with happiness and enjoyment in the lives of others."
good,"Coke wasn't a bad job, but you do have to use your own vehicle and my route was an hour from the town in which I live. The pay is good and the potential for bonuses is also great. It is stressful and very competitive, but it is sales."
good,"The southwest regional group is interesting. Most were welcoming, but I do not think the male staff was as receptive to their female counterparts as they should have been."
good,"My experience was probably different than most. Sales in Miami is hard-core if you are not used to the culture. My customers consisted of grocery stores, gas station owners and workers, grocery managers, assistant managers, etc The vendor world can be difficult to experience. it's not for everyone."
good,I trained in QA testing.Learned about the beverages chemistry and the ingredients role while training.Its a great thing to be part in coke as trainee in my academics.
good,was a great place to work at first but the higher up you get the more problems you encounter.  could be a great career for some but not what i want to for the rest of my life
good,If you are looking to work long hours for low pay this is the place for you. I was just a contractor at this job so I cannot speak for the full time employees.
good,It could be a long day depending on your route and salesperson. You pretty much get to store and set up the sodas. Hardest par of the job is keeping your back stock down.
good,"Tons of Training and weekly development.  Online classes vs hand on were a challenge, preferred more hands on.  Overall a great company to work for if you can commit to the hours."
good,Each job has different responsibilities. It all comes down to customer service and sales. When the customers are happy and sales are up than everyone's job is easier and more enjoyable
good,"Started here because it was more money than my previous job and thought there was room to grow as long as you work hard. Its all about whether you buy into the ""Coke Life"" and you can do pretty well for having no degree or trade skills but it is not for the week spirited.  Some days can be very tough with long laborious hours especially on holidays and weekends.  Management tries to help sometimes but you are constantly understaffed and a lot of the people they hire are not ""stars"" resulting in your day being even more difficult.  Ask their better merchandisers to do much more than the weaker parts of the team but with no rewards.  Moving up is really based on timing on when positions ahead of you open up and management can and will play favoritism in the selection process.  Company also does not value their merchandisers and  lead merchandisers very much.  You are asked to sell in displays and product making your day much harder but no compensation or benefit from it until you advance to the Account Manager position.  If you like working alone and have patience to wait until you can advance it is not a bad job."
good,You set your fate working here. No one is going to hold your hand and guide you along. If you want to have a great career you have to create it. Many resources available if you are a go-getter type of person.
good,"The people there are wonderful. VERY GOOD AND GENUINE PEOPLE (THE EMPLOYEES THAT I WORK WITH), Very enjoyable to be around happy people who truly want  to help the customers. I loved actually being able to make a difference to the customers and I knew that I am such an asset to the company by the customers response."
good,coca cola treats their employees pretty good with great benefits. The most enjoyable part of the job is to make customer happy and building a stronger relationship between coca cola and our clients
good,My experience with Coke has been a harsh one out of all the vendors/merchandiser you get pay the least with the most work. Management over look you as a person because for coke you are just a number with a line of unknowing people willing to take your place.
good,"Typically go into stores, inventory, take orders, and upsell when appropriate. Long hours and difficult customers depending on your route. Work life balance is the hardest thing to manage. However, selling these products is easy because it is the most powerful beverage brand in the world."
good,"typical day at work was no red tape and planning own day.  management was very hands off which was a good thing and they were laid back except for upper management.  upper management was concerned about quality and more with saving money, hence the change to offshore."
good,easy work. after you finish your route you can go home or stay because you are guarantee 40 per week. good job overall and hope it gets better soon! peace
good,"Stayed busy,, I kept to myself,, I knew my job well, tough trying to get close to other workers,,not enough encouragement from management. Management only involved if there was a review coming, or had a complaint.  Labor laws were followed, but overtime was irregular, it some times felt like the employees were ""placed second"" in terms of being showed appreciation for hard work."
good,"visit accounts and write order for account, sell in displays. hardest part of job was following up on merchandisers completing their job and if they didn't you filled shelves and built the displays"
good,"Worked 10+ years at Coke. Good pay/ benefits. People on a local-level we're great. Management was terrible. You know; not what you know, it's who you know. "
good,When I first started with Coca-Cola I worked for Philadelphia Coca-Cola. I loved my job because it was all about taking care of the customers with 100% satisfaction. I have always prided myself on my exceptional customer service which has enabled me to build strong professional trusting relationships with all my customers. Philadelphia Coca-Cola was purchased by my current employer Coca-Cola Refreshments along with many other privately owned Coca-Cola companies. Since this transition my job has changed drastically. Customer service has declined and it has become very difficult to maintain my relationships with my customers because of all of the mistakes the company has made. I want to work for a company who cares about their employees and the customers. My goal is to continue to grow and advance with the company I work for. I am an extremely loyal employee who will always exceed expectations.
good,I was enjoying working there because I was meeting people of different cultures around the wold so I have to learn more from them. I also learn on how to cheese for soccer fan because it was that time of soccer world cup
good,"Great company culture, nice benefits, friendly co-workers. The wages could be better and the training could be more consistent. Overall a nice job and great for recent graduates looking to earn a decent wage with limited experience."
good,Excelente paquete salarial y beneficios. El ambiente laboral es excesivamente competitivo e individualista. Solo para algunos perfiles.
good,"A typical day consisted of arriving early at different stores to wait on truck to deliver stock so you can restock store.  Hardest part is having to deal with all the stock ordered by account managers and trying to consolidate to fit in the allotted space. Manager was good as long as you did your job,  "
good,"Day is spent on Outbound/Inbound calls. All is routine; No  advancement as people rarely retire/resign. Salary increases could be a ""carrot on stick."""
good,"The managemets of COCA COLA good sportive for me all time."
good,"i learned how to work in a face pace environment"
good,"Des journées souvent longues et très dur physiquement, pas beaucoup de chance de décroché un CDI, le plus dans ce travail, la liberté, seul sur sa route et quand possibilité d'allez aidé un collegue on y va... C'est un job tres dur pour le dos vu les charge porté/pousser/deplacer environs 4 tonnes de boissons par jours."
good,"This job has it's ups and downs, from the feeling of someone having your back when you need help the most to the times when you're out there doing it all yourself and it seems overwhelming. There is not enough communication between the Merchandisers and the Account Managers and having a solid team is a rarity. I beliveve the job would be much easier with associates who care how the store's front and backroom appearance is, and working hand in hand with the part-timers and Account Managers (if they are full-timers) all but determins the outcome of how the job is viewed. Sometimes it is great, Great environment, you're not in one place all the time, you travel to different stores all the time, meet new people, and that's wonderful. Micromanaging is minimal and that is a plus because we are all adults, and handholding is an aspect of any job that is unnecessary, especially when you know what is expected of you. I also believe the benefits could be better. Merchandisers should recieve just bonus' and car allowance as well as Account Managers. There should also be a backup plan for when you need to request help, and no one ever seems to have the answer..."
good,"A typical day at Coca-Cola as a Market Development Manager involves two main objectives: prospecting, account management/growth."
good,awesome company i loved it cause there was always something to do an room for advancement would recommend this company to anyone
good,Goal is to grow the business every day. I am in charge of a specific territory in Long Island. Keeping customers happy and hitting my quotas is extremely important to me.
good,"Not very challenging at all, but great for entry-level job with not experience needed. Great co-workers,management is ok if you are doing your job correctly"
good,Good pay. The Rancho location has several issues with hourly workers and management. High order pulling standard. Works off of senorita and extra list
good,"I have learned a lot in this position, but it is easy to out-grow and moving in the company is not as easy as they make it seem."
good,"- be prepared to work like a slave."
good,"Great co-workers , I would like to have seen management get more involved with stuggling employees or offer other positions if desired."
good,Muito agravel msms e obgd se vcs pode me ajuda com esse emprego
good,Will discuss further information on anything work related with my employment at Coca-Cola. I don't like to put opinions on public forums about companies I work for.
good,working independently from store to store stocking coca cola products onto the shelves of our customers. Learning how to manage my time wisely while working in a productive manner. Working with heavy products was tough but i manage to get thru my day with a positive attitude. Having a team i could communicate with helped me get through my days.
good,"Acercarme a las tiendas asignadas cada dia y venderles, aprendi mucho tambien a desenvolverme, osea en el sentido de como llegar al dueño de la tienda, para vender mis productos y las metas semanales."
good,"I was placed in the workplace for work-based experience then i gained interest to be in the field then that's where i applied for employment. The tasks i perfomed was to route delivers, stock counting and control, recieving and dispatch, data capturing, security check. i was given much opportunities to perform work-based experience. The hardest part was when resolving conflicts between our workers and our outlets."
good,"Great and well known company to work for with meek pay and benefits. The cultural environment is great with a neutral work/life balance, and opportunities to develop and advance are lacking."
good,"Great company to work for, but this company did not in my opinion provide a great opportunity for advancement. The daily expectations where a bit extreme, but the company overall had great potential."
good,Well organized Company. Management team is professional and supportive. Good Job / Life Balance. Excellent benefits. Most employees have longevity with company.
good,Can be a challenge to sell an incredible brand and product without the support (service/distribution/competitive price)...
good,"To be successful at this job you need to be self motivated and be able to work with minimal supervision. The days are long and the work is very physical. You will work in the weather good or bad. The more seniority you gain the better the routes you get to choose from. With little seniority you will likely be delivering in the city of St. Louis Mo.,which is sketchy even on a good day as far as personal security is concerned."
good,Muy pocas posibilidades de subir de puesto si no tienes conocidos dentro de la empresa
good,"Great company to work for. Pay and benefits are all great. Early mornings, long work hours. No life outside of work, wont have the time or energy for anything else."
good,"Managers are all about the numbers and the bottom line profit.  Too much red tape and politics, involved in getting authorizations to do anything.  Colleagues were nice and professional, as we all shared knowledge and often worked as a team to solve complex issues."
good,Coca-Cola Refreshments is in a constant state of change. Improving processes and project work are prevalent but being done by those with no formal training on each aspect. Overall good place to work but little room for growth.
good,"Checking payroll hours daily."
good,"I'm a team player, strong communicator even when not required."
good,Coke plant was a very good job I worked outside and inside doing all kinds of thing like maintenance and flipping pallets. The co-workers was very good to me.
good,"It was hot is summer and cold in winter. warehouse was a mess and supervisors were wanting. they did reward hard work, and tried to get you to learn different aspects of the warehouse."
good,"Work with manageable size crew."
good,"Their is no typical work day with Coca-Cola.  Something different everyday.  I learned how to be a leader in the toughest of times, and how to handle some pretty stressful situations.  The hardest part of my job is cleaning up after everybody because their is never enough time.  The most enjoyable part of my job is working with people, and the variety of challenges I get on a daily basis."
good,"A normal day at work would be the team getting together in the mornings to have a meeting with the managers. Managers would prep talk us on how to make our job easier so that we wouldn't have any injury's on the job. Once your out there in the work field doing your job and practicing safety tips there's a little pressure because your needed back at the plant at a certain time. If your not back at a certain time your in trouble even if your doing the job right ,and you needed extra time to get done. I have realized working with that job made me discover a certain speed I have about my self when it comes to getting the job done."
good,Typically I provide service to 3 or 4 stores a day. This consists of filling and rotating any product that Coca-Cola sells within the stores. I enjoy driving from location to location as it breaks up the day and prevents the job from being boring.
good,que es buena empresa solo que la paga esta mal para todo lo que hacemos ya que muchas veces nos pasamos de las cuotas y aun asi no . nos pagaban productividad y era constante tenias que estar diciendoles. pero en si el trabajo es divertido aunque es pesado pero te acostumbras a andar en friega y se te va el dia muy rapido y con una muy buena venta
good,"N/A - I can not legally review this company at this time."

good,Great place to develop your skills.  You do everything there.  Meet some wonderful people there and I am still connected to them both socially and work wise.
good,"Long hours, product sells itself. building relationships with many customers was great, Horribly mismanaged"
good,I love my co-workers and the most enjoyable part of my job is the flexibility it gives me with home and work life.  I also enjoy being in the field meeting new customers and building the loyalty of our brand.  A typical work day begins at 730 and ends about 330
good,"This is an excellent place to work.  The possibilities for advancement are great!  However, the work is very labor intensive, but management and co-workers were very supportive."
good,The company is very profitable and can offer many opportunities to employees.
good,"Monthly I plan Raw Materials needed according to the Forecast for the following month."
good,Learned a lot about driving tractor trailers and how to deal with customers
good,"sales driven "
good,I really had a good experience there at Coca-Cola. This job got you prepared for a long day of work but the management was really on your side and provided you with several tools and information to make the job much easier.
good,On a typical day at work I would build pallets to have ready for orders. I learned to have good customer service. The management was poor. The co-workers was okay. The hardest part of the job was building orders that came in late. The most enjoyable part about the job was when it was time to go home.
good,"salary increaments are not good  at executive level and good atmosphere  at shop floor.safety rules and standards also ok and for workmen there is no tension for job safety,if they want to do as life long there is no issue"
good,The most part of the Job my manger was not always breathing down my neck he let us do our job.
good,"Ótimo trabalho de merchandising,treinamentos na empresa periodicamente,prática de roteiros(visitar varias lojas no mesmo dia)"
good,"Long hours continental shifts"
good,"I would say as a company, it is great.  The culture is great and the work/life balance is great.  The only downside, is there are not a lot of advancement opportunities in the Brandon facility."
good,Constantly changing work environment. Has enough challenging jobs
good,The scenario is typical to that of Sayga Investment except that the products are different
good,"As Occupational Health Nurse (OHN), majority of the tasks lie on outlining  Health and Safety Programs which I had learned much especially that the Management is supportive at it. I have a smooth relationship with my co-worker, wherein trust was strongly established. The hardest part of the job prop up only when there is upgrading of service quality or ISO/EOSH accreditation wherein lots of paper works is expected. But the good thing is everybody worked as a team."
good,"O trabalho no dia a dia nos envolve, pois trabalhamos com pessoas maravilhosas onde a cultura é de pessoas simples mas que fazem a diferença. Onde  a parte mais agradável é sabermos que temos uma família no nosso trabalho e o mais difícil é saber que damos o sangue pela empresa mais não temos um reconhecimento."
good,I work in a fast pace Manufacturing Environment in the Food and Beverage industry.
good,"Attend to a lot of office visitors, management and research."

good,"learned alot of things,like using handheld computers and even improving my performance with a 2 wheeler,i also enjoyed my co-workers."
good,"Typical day at work is walking into a grocery store that's empty and needs a lot of work, but the satisfaction of leaving the store full and ready to be shopped was second to none."
good,A typical day at work would be punching in and gathering information from the day person.  After that I would look over the orders for the day and see what what needs to be ordered out for the night.  After all the materials are out I will scan them in to the SAP system for consumption and add the raw products in the either the chopper tank or high shear.  When the blender calls for the blend I will transfer my raw products to his/her blend tank to make the finished product.  Very team focused as either side of the process can destroy a blend.  Nothing real to hard with doing the job as blenders help choppers and choppers helps blenders.  
good,"Responsibilities that include the following:"
good,"a typical day at work consisted of communicating with recievers and managers to figure out the task at hand. in addition, i would stock shelves, consolidate back rooms, and rotate coke products. the hardest part of the job would be the workload given to each merchandise employ. the work was pretty much a two-man job every day"
good,"veel controles uitvoeren zowel de machine als het product tot in het detail nachecken,rationeel werken enig nadeel als nieuwe werkkracht je wordt getest en zijn de vele interims beu telkens opnieuw opleiden maar ik ben sociaal en werd goed opgevangen en ben vlug mee als er iets word uitgelegd veel informatie in ene keer vrijdag was er niet veel werk dus om het weekend in te gaan was dit wel een pluspunt."
good,"fui muito bom trabalhar na coca,era encarregado pela produção de refrigerantes,limpeza do ambiente de trabalho,com vivia diretamente com a empresa pois desempenhava muito bem meu trabalho."
good,"boa de trabalhar , aprendi muito com a mesma tem tudo que uma empresa tem que ter , mais o horario de saida e muito ruir não tem"
good,"Management was okay, could be better. Wake up really early and work til the job is done. You could work from 4hrs to 15hrs in one day. Benefits were nice and affordable. Couldn't hang due to the hours. Can't go home until you finish the job. Couldn't really get enough rest due to the hours and sleeping right after getting off work. Hurt my family life."
good,a typical day at work is busy delievering packages to coke employees
good,"Resolve complex employee and manager inquiries for United States and Canada by researching and utilizing case management tools. Provide guidance and recommendations for dismissals, corrective actions, COBC, attendance, and other employee relation issues.

Report trends and risk to Senior Leadership team with recommended actions."
good,"Depending on the facility, coke can be a very fun place to work."
good,Working for the coca-cola company i have learned alot from multi tasking to dealing with the customers all of the world that loves coke products. You always has to have a winning attitude and great personality around the clock which i enjoys. The hardest part about my job was accepting the pay and not able to move up in the comapny.
good,"I arrive to work at four a.m., check to make sure my inventory is stocked and ready to go. I will then drive to Western Montana to grocery stores, convenient stores, and bars to deliver their order. At some stops I will unload and stock the shelves, and others I only unload the order."
good,"I have been with them for the last 9 years. It used to be a good place to work, but after the transition/merger with the Coca Cola Company (KO) the pay compensation structure is bad (salaries start too low) and the opportunities for promotion are almost non -existent. They keep talking about moving laterally and gaining more experience in other areas, but salaries in most cases do not increase"
good,Its not easy to be trusted at the new work place but sometimes it's not easy to stay at same kind of job till we die. We oftenly tend to seek for experience else where and also discover ourselves that's why I want to work with DHL
good,"Coca-cola does not pay the drivers no where near enough money to deal with the dangers of driving in and out of tight narrow parking lots everyday , unloading all freight, merchandising products, and most and importantly  dealing with angry and sometimes aggressive customers because the AD has sent more than they had agreed to, or the AD didn’t send what the store actually needed and that’s the norm."
good,Forklift operator builder front Man getting product keeping machine full and running um working late hrs and over time.... getting. Paid every two weeks not plenty of hours not enough money great opportunity for me to to grow...
good,Gostava de trabalhar. Era uma empresa agradável com recursos e cumpria com todas as responsabilidades.
good,"Good company to work for and there is also a corporate side, where you have plenty of room to grow.  If you can get in on the corporate side it will be a great fit."
good,"Es un buen ambiente laboral, si ahy oportunidades de crecimiento, pero desafortunadamente aveces ahy prioridades por algunos elementos dejandonos a otro fuera de competencia"
good,This is a good job it’s just really fast paced. Real back breaking work. Perfect job for new cdl holder with good pay and benefits. Ok work equipment it gets the job done
good,Top notch sales training. Great benefits. You are just a number unless you are in with the club. Many tenured employees and managers. Marketing is phenomenal.
good,Networking and marketing skills are encouraged and rewarded above  your performance directly related to the job/tasks/projects that you are hired for.
good,"Trabalhei na área de programação de manutenção das linhas de produção de refrigerantes."
good,"En el ambito de tecnologia , solo permiten contratos a traves de consultoras y empresas externas, quitandote las prestaciones como trabajador y antiguedad."
good,"We had wonderful benefits, work/life balance and vacation, but upper management was lacking to give direction and be helpful in the growth of employees."
good,"It’s a good place to work for, but they really don’t have your back. If you have a family issue at home. Especially when you have worked for the company for about 20yrs. You’ll think they would be more helpful and understanding."
good,Working for Coca it was fast pace but it was good I liked the fact of being busy you also can move up an advance quickly and there's all different types of jobs you can do for the company
good,"Ide have to say before the transition from Coke to Reyes Coke, coke was great!!   Afterwards,. Coke took a dive with no direction or incentives complete kaos."
good,Trucks have no air conditions and are falling apart. Very unsafe. Management is terrible. Everyday there is not enough equipment to perform your futies and management doesn’t do anything about it.
good,"Clock in, check schedule, open all programs needed to assist customers, check internal emails."
good,Good place to work if your looking to accumulate hours. however when it comes to having a life outside of this job forget about it. you will not need a gym membership
good,The work at Coke was hard.  A lot of lifting and moving around.  However it was pleasant to be able to make a relationship with many of the managers  from your stores..  The people made it worth the work..  My supervisor from coke was very helpful and understanding when it came to helping me with displays and anything that I did not understand
good,I have no feedback at this time regarding TCCC. I will say that this company has great potential to inspire goodwill in people.  Best Mission ever wrote on paper.
good,A typical day was tolerable but the fustrating part was not knowing when the end time was. 8 hours were guranteed but you were expected MANDATORY OVERTIME daily.
good,"ok place to work..if you like fast pace work. good team work, management was great with communication. training was long, and all on computer, had some training on the job."
good,"The job is very physical, but it makes up for with good pay and mileage. Dont expect to have plans from 7-6 during the day because the loads and orders can get there at 7 am or 4 pm,"
good,"always work to be done, never a dull moment, some overtime granted, good benefits, good learning experience, the hardest place i ever worked , very demanding"
good,If you don’t mind restructures every 18 months then this is a good place to work.  Very fast paced environment with a ton of learning opportunities. Most people are friendly and middle management seems to care about the employees. It’s hard to say the same about the new senior leadership regime.
good,We were able to purchase juice at cost we got health Care dental vision. With perfect attendance we got a bonus. The people are easy to work with the hours are long but enjoyed the days off.
good,"Start off as contract hired on perm after some time. Distinct difference in how the company treats contractors versus permanent employees. "
good,"I learned more at Coca Cola than any other company I have ever worked for. A typical day at Coke was usually full of hard work with very long hours. I learned all aspects of how to run a warehouse. From heavy equipment to shipping and receiving, I learned it all. The people that I worked with is what I miss the most about that job. The hardest part about working at Coca Cola was the hours. Some days we would end up working sixteen or seventeen hours. The insurance when I first started there was fantastic but as the years went on it got worst and worst. But overall I loved working there and I have no regrets about my time there."
good,Each company is different by state I worked for Coca Cola in the state of Iowa as a merchandiser all locations in the state of Iowa were strict they did NOT allow any beards mustache  goatee only sales people varied from controlling rude to smile and your face everything is great to report you for missing the smallest items not getting stocked even if they don’t sell you won’t really know when your done you can work a 6hr day or if it’s not 8hrs it can be up to 14hrs  She is typically start at 6 AM but sometimes management will let you start at 6:30 AM they are always open to you starting early as 4 AM if it makes sense you will not be Guaranteed to have a route close to home so that means you can travel to far cities out of town just to stock the shelves with Coca-Cola products you must maintain a neat and organized backstock keep up with rotation on dates and clean up after people whether you made the mess or not also you must have a clean driving record with 2 or few Violations or accidents the pay where I lived was 17 dollars an hour you won’t always work 40hrs you could work up to 60 even 80hrs  also you will deal with Management at all the grocery stores which means a lot of different personalities some nice and some not so friendly your main job is to provide the best customer service for representing the company to the best of your abilities
good,"Training was more than thorough, tools in trade were sometimes lacking. Tech support available 24/7. Management truly cared about knowledge level of employees."
good,start at your first stop merchandise the store with the backstock or new deliveryand organize the backroom. Set up displays and P.O.S. (point of sales)at various locations in the store.do the same for the rest of the stores on the route.
good,I enjoyed working for this company as it requires attention to detail as well as time management on a daily basis. Being a merchandiser also kept me physically fit.
good,"Un lugar de trabajo agradable, con un sentido alto en seguridad personal y laboral"
good,A  normal day would consist of 25000 cases meaning products the crew has to pull for that day. Stack products in 8's or 6's depending on what truck it is. Pallet jacks are unstable at times but you will find out the hard way once you hit a sharp turn. The people have tons of energy and that is key because we work from 4 to whenever and we need each other so we can stay up. The hardest part of the job is staying in the green. The best part of the job is being in the green.
good,"I always enjoyed my work with every company where I was employed.  I enjoyed the teamwork within all aspects of the organizations.  Each job kept me on my feet and challenged me daily.  I enjoyed my customers and found it very easy to relate to them and earn their respect as their sales rep."
good,Oque mais deixa os funcionários desta empresa insatisfeito é que os funcionários não tem chance de crescer para um cargo melhor.
good,"Great benefits and perks. Work/life balance depends on the department. Friendly environment and co-workers. Changing culture to more Agile. Overall, a good place to work."
good,"CCR is no longer going to be a company after 12/31/2017, as Coca-Cola has re-franchised all of the bottling territories in North America. The company was great to work for previously"
good,Like any other corporations it has its pros and cons. The pros are great benefits. CCR cares about keeping their employees happy and healthy. Cons would be stress. That happens in any job though.
good,"Coca Cola is a great company!  I enjoy working for this company and I like the brands.  I like having the option to work from home as it helps bring balance.  I enjoy my role, however, I wish it was not being removed due to the re franchising of the business."
good,I had a flexible 10 hour a day 4 days a week position. My direct manager made the work/life balance easy and was always willing to work with us. I enjoyed working on a small team. The hardest part was working for such a large organization and often feeling my voice was not heard.
good,If you want to work for one of the largest companies in the world then this job is for you! A typical day starts with clocking in five minutes early to turn on and log in to your computer. then you just take calls from customers ( establish business who partner with Coca-Cola to buy product for the consumers that buy it from them. You will assist in the field sales reps and submit CST's for personalized attention to urgent matters with customers. pretty easy going job.
good,i wouldnt recomemd working here if your looking for a cruise job or if you get intimidated fast.  if your looking for long hours and semi good pay which is worth it
good,"while working there, the company provided excellent benefits. i was also given up to date equipment to make my job as easy as possible. the work/ life balance was less than ideal but due to company changes, it was being addressed."
good,"Great HR policies, aggressive operational style. The inability to get into newer categories in India has led to issues."
good,"I Just to come for management meetings after that, lab meeting shift change, every day a knew challenge, people just to call off frequently, we as Supervisors had to managed the the work load with lees people and start calling for replacment following union senority rules, I was challenged allot and enjoyed."
good,"On a regular day i would start my day off with my stores in buckhead. Fast paced, loudness, and fancy people shopping in a timely manner. I stock the shelves as they shop and its not bad."
good,"The pay is stable mostly, as a merchandiser they paid decent, have good benefits, some travel required, hardest part of the job was probably the days of high sales where you have to build several displays at one store but usually by yourself. But if you can handle hard work this Job is overall Great!  You usually don't answer to anyone on a normal basis if you're doing your job right.  So generally you only speak with store managers or the stores customers."
good,"Good pay."
good,"If you don't mind getting paid to work out, then this is the job for you. The pay was not as good as I thought it was going to be. I loved my manager and the people that I worked with."
good,"Grande empresa , bastante cobrança mas nada abusivo , espirito de equipe , boa gerência."
good,But i learn so much. There medical benefits were good. The most enjoyable part of my job was when me and my team(there were 80 plus people working under my supervision) achieve the target in a very best way.
good,A typical work day can start great route is loaded in the trailer and there are no problem. on the other hand when we do have a problem we are faced with situations such as waiting for a load to be loaded trailers that are incorrectly marked and a magament team that is unaware of anything wrong.
good,They work with you.So many different areas that you can work. They  also give you an opportunity to advance. Even that you have to wait a year to apply for other position.
good,"Over all experience was good . Here , product is produced by keeping in view all health parameters.I found workers very sincere to their job . The most admireable thing that number of tests are performed to maintain quality of the product."
good,Enjoyed the job all around. Enjoy physical labor and job was pretty required you to be physical decent hours enjoyed working with co workers
good,Enjoyed working there. Made decent money. But management was poor! Most enjoyable part of working there was meeting new people.
good,Great job hard work as a machine opp my job was to keep an eye on the product and keep the machine running and clean.Plus change the flim wrap and the bottole lable.
good,"Att producera läsk med hög kvalite, planera för graden av linjeutnyttjande, och en hög framförhållning."
good,"The company restructures by letting workers go if they max their salary cap and bring in new workers for less money. Its who you know in this company, not what you know. This experience can be used as a learning experience for workers just starting their career off. This is not career based company."
good,Aprendi muito nos sete anos que trabalhei na Intertransmar  foi de muita importância como trabalhador e como pessoa. Me sinto muito grato por ter feito parte da equipe e ter contribuído um pouquinho com a empresa.
good,"las reuniones,el mercado ,planogramacion ,skus el orden de nuestros productos,somos un  equipo,nada es difícil,conocer amis clientes saber atenderlos conocer lo que le falta y siempre sacarles mas venta"
good,i started out as a temp and i worked there for a very long while. i trained employees/Leads and never got full time or hired for the job. They would not change me to a different shift so i had to leave the job cause i did not feel appreciated and also they gave me the run around for a very long time saying they would hire me and never did. I know how to work all the machine lines and fix them myself if my line shutdown or any problems accrued. i had to train and show a few leads who worked there longer then me to work and fix them as well. i felt i could have grown if giving the opportunity but never was given the chance.
good,Es un poco pesado ya que el trabajo es todo el dia y los productos son pesados hay ratos libres porque el trabajo es en campo tu tomas tu tiempo
good,acho uma boa empresa que posso entra nela e ter uma oportunidade
good,Working a contract thru Randstad sucks tremendously. Benifits are horrible and the pay sucks. I am struggling to make ends meets and they rarely hire people on permanently.
good,"Really fun at work with fun colleagues,there are lot of red tape and politics and politics but it reallyis expected in a huge company like coca cola.the most enjoyable part of my job is to work alongside my colleagues and supportive management."
good,"Fast paced job with medium level of stress development. "
good,"I'm just looking to better my family's life. Coca-Cola have been good to me over the years, and i still would like to continue my growth with a Coke company."
good,"i use to sale the items "
good,"The faster you get done, the faster you get to go home. Not the case. If you go in there and work hard to get your work done, you get rewarded by getting handed someone else s work. The hard and fast workers get most all of the work every night."
good,it was a very interesting experience. most of the people were very nice and cool to work with. they did have rather strange training methods. it was a lot of just watch him for a sec and you should know what to do next. good pay but very poorly managed.
good,"Supervisors had a hard time issuing discipline because the HR department was not in the building, everything was done over the phone.  You had to jump through hoops just to get someone the discipline they required."
good,"Día típico: Llenar todos los enfriadores con los productos Coca-Cola, Surtir los anaqueles y mantener correctamente las exhibiciones de los pasillos."
good,Typical work day can consist up to 110 calls to customers. I've learn to work with a team. The managament and supervisors were always there to assist when needed. The co-workers are friendly and caring.

good,if you don't mind working long hours and breaking your back for an unimpressive pay check.
good,"steady pay, steady hours...training could be more in depth"
good,CCR engages you to develop several different skills.  The time demands are very high.
good,A typical day for me is coming in at 4a.m. and making sure all loads are properly dowloaded into proper handhelds. I then check out each indivual driver. I then make sure all warehouse or vehicle maintenance is taken care of. I feel the workers here are a great family and team. We team up to make sure everyone gets done with their job safely. The hardest part is delivery of product.The most enjoyable is getting out and meeting the customers face to face.
good,"a typical day at work:"
good,"A typical day would consist of servicing 2-4 stores a day. Co-workers were great, as to some account managers would be excessively demanding and unfair. Management can be fair for the most part. Long hours for the most part but the best part of it all, would work independently for the most part."
good,"starts the day early in the morning with daily meeting with my team.Rotien field work ."
good,"•Trained team members on retail company brands, services and marketing initiatives."
good,Great Job they enjoy having fun and show appreciation to their employees.
good,This is a great company to say the least. But the flexibility they promised at the beginning of the job was never followed through.
good,A typical day was to call customers and place their order for the coming week. Sold in new products or specials that were available. Learned all the products that we offer.Supervisor was always helpful.Loved everyone on my team. We helped each other out when needed. Hardest part of the day was not being able to get a hold of customers on the call list. The best part of the day we being a part of the the team.
good,"This is best company to start your career.  It gave me huge exposure in terms of channel management, bigger customer base handling, very fast moving goods distribution, to work in very competitive market."

good,great job time's where tough got laid off had to find a new job thinks got slow
good,"What I learned at Coca-Cola , everyone is friendly. Their management was good so far. The hardest part of the job was to clean the entire warehouse. my co-workers were great. the most enjoyable part about my position , long breaks, and free soda"
good,"I loved my five years at Coca Cola, I gain a lot of knowledge about sales and marketing, Retail and Distribution. And this job build my skills and prepared me for and Merchandiser job that might come in the near future."
good,el ambiente dentro del grupo de promotores es bueno pero no hay un reconocimiento de parte de la empresa para poder escalar de pocisoo
good,"a escola do varejo , lá se aprende a vender ,expor ,comunicar ,fazer ações de tabloide , é tudo muito intenso ,tudo o que se tem de melhor em tecnicas de venda ,acontece primeiro na coca-cola"
good,"We have a pre-shift meeting, then gather all required equipment, phone and pallet jack then get to work. We have to maintain an effieciency of %100 which i achieve and exceed daily. i load about 1700-2000 cases a night and have recieved builder of the month twice in the past eight months"
good,"An average work day @ coca-cola field for the most part was very tidious, especially from a cashiers prospective. I learned how to work the cash register and learned more tricks of the trade about cooking from the more experienced cooks. Management was fair, nothing to praise."
good,"Perform merchandising standards by displaying and rotating product, while managing product security with all accounts"
good,Chego pele manhã para pegar meu caminhão e começar a rota
good,it was a fun work atmisfear.i learned alot of skills such as operating different types of machines.co-workers were great to work with.the hardest part of the job would be not satisfying the customer.the most enjoyable for me was learning and bettering myself in different skills
good,It was enjoyable while challanging. Sales Management did not completely understand the unigue challanges pertaining to the Warehousing duties. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the Warehouse crew to insure the delivery trucks were properly loaded and ready for the following day.
good,"Passo as demandas para os promotores externos, atualizo as planilhas e controlo a entrada e saida dos materiais de merchandising e brindes."
good,"No much to say otherwise the pay would have to be more than what I used make it long hours and low paid for what we were going, the management need to improve"
good,"Coca Cola is a good job, it will be a better job if they compensated the right amount of pay for the specific job."
good,"For sure it was very classic to work their,the conditions were not bad their but the salary was not attractive as such."
good,"I work in the call center in Brampton, On and in all honesty, the work itself is very easy.  It can be challenging when dealing with irate customers. However, its the management there that make the work stressful. There is no spirit, very low morale. Management use fear instead of positive feedback, there is a lot of favourtism, so if youre not in your supervisors good books they will block you from moving on to a different role outside of the call center. We have a high turnover rate and it has been years since we had someone move out of the call center. "
good,if you like a flexible job this is the job for you. but this job typically starts at 6am until you finish which maybe after 4pm. this job was really physical. lack of communication if you have a late truck that makes more work for you to pack out product and a lot of traveling back and forth unless they give you a local route. I enjoyed the experience and the pay.
good,"Great Company to work for as far as pay/benefits, but be wary there is a culture to reorganize constantly.  you may be safe one day and gone the next simply to cut costs and send jobs overseas"
good,"Pay is good but few times a year, something wrong happens with payroll. Certain management have unnecessary attitude. Most coworkers show up and do their jobs just fine, but many over step their boundaries. The company as a whole,  doesn't have enough help for about half of the time working. Not just my current position. Company drags their feet when fixing equipment which could potentially be dangerous"
good,Driving long distance trips to various place in Ireland to Service Water Dispenser machines. Management very co operative and helpful to Staff needs.  Friendly work Culture.  The Hardest part was having to get up very early in the morning to set off on a long trip. The hard part was not that I had to get up early but that the weather conditions were often difficult with temperatures under 0 degrees. The best part of the job was to be able to drive around a very beautiful country and to see the sites.
good,Became very stressful when new management took over and couldn't make up their minds on how many hours we are allowed to work. Plus they couldn't keep a set course on how the day went
good,"The company was wonderful to me because that is were i managed to gain working experience. I learned how to communicate, how to work with computer. hardest part was night shift."
good,"I love working for coke, but I would love it if we had better pay and benefits. The stress and strain on your body doesn't match what they are paying you."
good,"You were expected to reach local grocery stores at early hours, and employees of those stores were never helpful or friendly. You would spend sometimes 12 hours plus working there daily, with hardly any days off and constant new hires coming in and out of the company due to the frustrating work schedule and atmosphere."
good,The experience at Coca Cola Fortune was an eyes opener especially in the field of marketing as a whole. I got to understand the importance of target market and how it is identified. I also get to implement the 4 marketing concepts.
good,"it is a nice company that is working 24 hours,having 3 shifts. it cares for its employees as they promote safety first awareness almost everyday. they provide their employees with right PPE for every specific departments."
good,"Buen ambiete laboral. Un producto d acorde al"
good,"My biggest issue with Coke is that they outsourced the Credit Dept. at one time to India after having a town hall meeting with the department and assuring everyone it wouldn't happen. Aside from that, the company is great. It's everything a big company like Coca-Cola should be. Tuition reimbursement, employees could purchase their products at a discount and just a great work environment."
good,"I love working with people,I am a hard worker with a great personality,the hardest part of the job was whereby you have to put the crates way up on the pellets."
good,"great place to work. . "
good,It's no the best place to work but it's a good start if you want to work in logistics or  machine operation. The pay is good but some of the managers make you wonder if they graduated high school.
good,"Just don't expect to move up in the warehouse. The only job advancements are in other positions, like driving trucks or sales. But they do have good benefits, no matter what position you're in....as long as you're full time."
good,"Coca Cola is competitive and a fun environment to work in. You need to be self-driven and motivated to get your work done. You also will need to deliver great customer service, be computer literate, have good time management and a great personality."
good,Im sure if i had a different supervisor i would have enjoyed my time at coke. My supervisor was really aggressive and unprofessional. Too many times he was able to get away with rearranging protocol to fit his personal goal.
good,Everyone is dedicated workers and very loyal. Good team spirit and assistance. Always ready to assist you in any way. Good moral towards everyone and keeps team spirit positive you will habe a daily laugh and every morning we started with a prayer
good,Very great company to be apart of learn alot from the company as come with the best benefit also a fast pace job to where it's more hands on could be a workout for u
good,"Job was great and fun, managers don't have your back. We were a dime a dozen. Job was very easy and people were great....great benefits, pay was good....but the senior drivers get the hours and the new drivers don't."
good,"This was a call center environment, but unlike most call centers the Coca Cola location made it as fun as possible.  Culture in building was ok, and the management tried hard to keep everyone happy."
good,"Entrar a las 6 y 30 de la mañana sin hora de salida entregar los productos a cada cliente ."
good,El trabajo es muy bueno solo que en lo económico ya no convenia
good,spent the day driving from store to store to replenish shelves that were depleted of Coca-Cola products. I also built displays on the sales floor of certain grocery stores.
good,"Management sucks at this company.   It is all about the mighty dollar that can be made.  No possibility of promotion. "
good,A great place to work.  Management is very open to feedbackon how to improve process.  Co-workers are willing to help accomplish tasks at hand and they go above and behond to get the work done.
good,het werk was heel leuk de mensen  waren  vriendelijk en  heel beleeft .het leukste was dat je met leuke mensen  werkte het minpunt was dat het niet optie vast was . ik heb  heel veel bij geleerd op het werk het was altijd leuk om te gaan  werken
good,I enjoyed working at Coca Cola..I had a lot of good co workers that help me along the way. I was able to get my certification for forklift and CDL..
good,"The typical day for me is to come in and get informed on how the day is going and if we have any pressing issues that I would need to know about.  Then I start with the Customer Support part of my job in contacting customers about issues that they may have. I would follow that with the driver debriefs that we do towards the end of the day followed by me getting the night drivers routes together and making sure they leave at the correct time and i finish my day up with end of day paperwork that must be completed everyday."
good,"- good as i learn new things daily"
good,"Every day, I would come into the office and say hello to all of my fellow workers. My manager would say good afternoon and see if I had any questions. Throughout the day, I either receive phone calls or make phone calls to place a beverage order. I would place orders for either restaurants, stores, schools, or other businesses. The hardest parts of the job is their attendance policy, the adherence to your shift, and the Sales target. You are on a point system, and once you hit a certain amount of points, you are subject to termination. the points can easily be obtained and are on your record for a year (Ex. not calling in and being 5 minutes late is 2 points). you have to be at 95% to your shift because of high call volume and company need. For an entire shift, aside from breaks and lunch, the time you can take off is just over 20 minutes, no exceptions. Sales numbers are possible to reach, but have many things that can hinder or hold you back from showing your true sales experience. Numbers are drawn up from last years volume and expected to be met, regardless of how many cases the company orders this year. some accounts have no minimum, but have a target that can be seen as unobtainable. The most enjoyable part of my job is that the managers help and support you in any case. While already busy throughout the day, they always find a way to be there for you. A very friendly work environment is plus."
good,good place to work if you think of work first.there's nothing more to say. than they are business minded.the environment do remind you of safety as a priority
good,I enjoyed working for Coca-Cola bu when I got a new boss my schedule changed where I was now working every weekend. I go to church and it's very important to me to go to church with my family. I had to use pto sometimes just so I could be at church. Also we had crazy routes for about three months so the supervisor could see who works best where. It went good once I got an established route but then about 7 months later they changed it again and my New route is so illogical and it seems like I'm being singled out with what I am stuck to deal with day to day. If the management would consider my input and make adjustments to my route and schedule I would stay but when I bring it up it gets put on the back burner. I come home physically and mentally exhausted to the point I don't wanna do anything even on my days off.
good,"I can easily say the distribution/warehouse at ccrc is a joke In brampton slows down the whole process in all works of the sales,merch and sales has to take the heat from the customers concently...things are confusing with no real answer and no clear solutions to the issues.....I respect everyone on my team and any other large volume merchandising teams...because boys and girls we all get paid like poo and bust our butt like Noone knows but us ( new pepsi hire makes 6 dollers more for the same job ) no Benifits ( rare they take you full time almost impossible ) turn over rate is riduilous liturally if 50 people get hired guarantee at years end you only have max 20 left.   direct supervisors and lead hands are hardworking....but everyone else is clueless....maybe the marketing team at ccrc ( who produce quality ) can take over and run trucks or forclifts in the plant.  or better bring your merchandiser teams from all over the gta and let them work your production,  I guarantee you they know the definition of hard work,time management, teamwork etc..."
good,"Coca Cola has gone through multiple restructures the past five years. During these changes, employee benefits have been consistently cut back. Health benefit costs continue to rise each year with minimal increases in pay. Most associates only get one raise per year. All raises are done on a scale basis, much like the grading scale present in some college classes. The front-line associates and managers are great, but the upper management is disconnected from the actual day-to-day operations of the company. There are always tons of projects going on, but with very few results. You are always expected to do more and more with less. There is no emphasis on work-life balance anymore. Instead of a balanced approach, Coke has adopted a 'work comes before everything else in your life' approach. The tuition reimbursement is not enough to even cover half of the cost of a university education, but yet you have to agree to work for the company for two years after completing any credit hours. There is no such thing as childcare and elder care reimbursement or assistance. All that is a way for you to put aside money from your check pre-tax. "
good,buena empresa para iniciar tu vida laboral y tener experiencia
good,O período em que trabalhei para a empresa aprendi muito com o trabalho em equipe.
good,A Empresa me deixou vários colegas de trabalho como amigos e adquiri experiências tanto como motorista e como Técnico em Segurança do Trabalho.
good,"Trabalhar por 7 anos na Coca-Cola/Femsa foi um grande aprendizado. Tive boas oportunidades de crescimento, mas para isso, precisei me especializar na área de marketing."
good,great work environment..friendly people. most enjoyable part for me was using the software to route the shipments for the next days delivery.
good,A typical day at work is making between 30-32 outbound calls to existing customers trying to secure a sale. What I have learnt is to be much more self efficient and to take responsibility with my accounts. The co-workers are great the atmosphere is very vibrant with a variety of cultures and interests.
good,"I use to work in the warehouse and pretty much had my job down pack. I was a pretty good forklift driver and had been doing it for 7 years. Everything was great. Then, I left the warehouse to get what is suppose to be some driving time cause I got my Class A CDL. I only drive on Saturdays, and when it comes to working in the stores for Coke, its always something. They just switched me over to what is called chinese overtime because I was getting to mush apparently. I felt like I should be getting enough overtime so I could get enough money to get by in life. A raise for my job change?! I went from making 14.57 to 15.00 dollars. Now, I'm making 15.23 because of a cost of living raise. It kills me how you work and you feel like its all for nothing. All in all.....I'm done with Coke. Could be good for somebody else....not for though. Going for a machine operator job in a factory, or the oilfield driving. Possibly even thinking about becoming a Floorhand offshore as soon as my TWIC card arrives."
good,"I work on hvac, and refrigeration, plumbing,lighting, painting etc.., I learned about safety, and how we make the soft drinks. the management keeps us up to date on safety, and priorities. we are three associates in our department and work good as a team. the hardest part of the job is when we have shjut downs. the most enjoyable part of the job is that we never get pressured."
good,Office politics is what a individual makes of it.  You can either prosper or fail depending on perspective/contacts/actions.
good,capacitacion contante divertido almuerzos cafe galletas y buen ambiente de trabajo con todo el personal
good,"Fijne werksfeer, uiteindelijk zelf in de hand, aan de hand van de klanten die je bezoekt."
good,"Decent pay, nice mileage pay. Careful if you are low man on the totem pole and business is slow, you will constantly be bumped off your shift. I didn't mind the work, but kept getting bumped off my shift by drivers who had no routes that day."
good,"local bom para realização dos trabalhos,aprendi vários valores pessoais e profissionais,um bom relacionamento,ótimo relacionamento e trabalhávamos em equipe,o horário,o trabalho em equipe."
good,"- Excelente"
good,Working for coca cola is pretty cool i get to see a lot of different people and visit a lot of different locations.
good,Arrive at different accounts to stock product and build displays to better promote product. management is typically on top of each job making sure we completed jobs to the best of our ability. Hardest part of the job is usually when thing happen days off. The flexibility of the job is the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,"trabajas bajo mucha presion ,aprendi a manejar personal la gerencia muy bien emprendedor ,mis colegas muy buen ambiente de trabajo , la parte mas dificil era controlar los inventarios en tiempos de mucha venta"
good,when i try to achieve my target any how.i learned how to manage the people in field. my co worker is very hard working. when i try to achive my target any how.when i achieve the target and take salary + incentive and do the party.
good,"Checking in and out trucks, Ive learned how to operate a forklift enjoyable part about working here are getting along with co-workers"
good,Manage and Implement NAtional accounts. Rotating deadlines. Intense Workload. High responsibility.
good,I loved working for coca cola. Some of the people they hired were not the best people. But the management overall was decent. We got raises after being there for a few months. They have benefits that are okay. And pto once your there for a year. You can move up if you try and you do your job well.
good,"Do your work, report on time, and not call out when you feel like it ; you not worry about losing your job. Pay needs to be better, Coca-Cola is the number one drink in the world we should be paid like it. Conversation is more limited from the higher management team. Mis alignment in the way the product leaves the warehouse to the customers. To many seperate divisions which doesnt blend well. If you entry level, it's going to be stressful until you decide to do the job right. Training time is not long enough. Benefits are very good when you gualify for them."
good,"It is unfortunate that the smaller plants are under-staffed and overworked."
good,"answering customer calls in regard to problems they were experiencing with coca cola equipment ex. cooler, fountain machines "
good,The company has a very diverse work culture. The opportunity for advancement is great through the entire company structure. The company is great at rewarding it' employees and giving back to the community.
good,"Bonne société dans l'ensemble"
good,"Empresa ética pra com os outros, adquirir profionalismo ao entrar mas responsabilidade pela oportunidade que adquirir e que me proporcionaram."
good,coca cola company is a fast paced job that requires you to have self motivation. Overall good benefits and compensation. friendly environment to work in with great people to work for.
good,Most be willing to work long hours and keep up with production. would have to be in great physical shape as job requires a ton of lifting and bending over. Must have reliable personal vehicle.
good,Coca Cola was a great place to work. I had morning meetings with my team going over new sales & products that we needed  to focus on that may increase our volume & took inventory of product to prepare for an organized & productive day of business
good,Fun place to work don't have to deal with your boss's much have to work fast and efficient also they pay pretty good but one of the cons is they demand a lot from you
good,Days were very physical. Usually started very early in huge stores. Definitely felt a sense of accomplishment after completing a store. Free breakfast at company meetings was nice. Management was appreciative of each worker which made it easier to stick to your goals. They would often drop by a store to see how you were personally. Account managers were a bit forward though.
good,I had a great time with coca cola. The only bad thing was trying to find a time with your family an kids because the hours and days were based off your seniority.
good,"I enjoyed working for Coca Cola, but the job itself is okay. Not a career for me, the work conditions and care for their drivers aren't acceptable. You are forced to drive in dangerous weather conditions, and customers are not forced to clean their parking lots when drivers arrive to deliver their order. Also customers can talk to drivers anyway they choose to. The company demands that you have their delivery there on time."
good,"Best time of my life!  Always have exciting events on the go.  Atmosphere is amazing and the leadership team and absolutely AWESOME!!!"
good,"Coca-Cola is a great company to work for. I have gained a lot of knowledge in terms of brand marketing, RED ""right execution daily"" selling to new outlets and maintaining existing outlets. I currently maintain a large territory and have developed an excellent relationship with my clients."
good,"Very flexible hours, more interaction with management would be effective. Spend a lot of time alone lifting and moving boxes. Don't really get to know your co workers."
good,Great group of people to work with. Very fast paced and heavy workload. Glitchy systems cause issues with service and job completion.
good,"during my work at coca cola I managed to learn the procedures of making soda, and learn t how to work, or behave in a group. The hardest part of the job was i was not provided with transport means in the morning when going to work. the most enjoyed part of the job is we were paid our salaries in time."
good,I work in the Sacramento ca location long hours and lots of reloads. Expect to be home late everyday ask alot of questions during interview.they will sell you a dream
good,"Great company but advancement is not based on performance. Great work life balance "
good,working for coke is a very hard job day in and day out. Coke is a job for people who dont have families and dpnt plan on having a family.
good,"empresa de grande porte , com ótimos benefícios, salario acima da media , , mais nenhum, plano de carreira , sendo muito difícil crescer na empresa."
good,"me sentia a gusto en esta empresa,el trabajo era bajo presion pero siempre lo entregaba en tiempo y forma,aprendi que en trabajo en equipo es mejor y la comunicacion es indispensable en todo departamento, la compania de los colegas fue productivo ,saludable y siempre me ayudaron  en el hecho de comunicacion de acuerdo a temas como: facturas,inventarios, materiales directos e indirectos,chequeo de materias."
good,"Is on Fridays whereby i have to receive stock at the storeroom and make sure the after that i have to take it to the fridge and im working alone."
good,Different type of environment and also work with different companies everyday. Great place to work at very professional with all team members. Learn how to deal with problems on every day basis.
good,"Created and maintain Accounts and rental contracts on vending machine."
good,"hard working job that, has lots of opportunity to make money due to very long work shifts"
good,"Usually i did all things about a warehouse such as downloading and loading drinks, preparing orders and something like that...and these are the most things that i do actually."
good,This information is obtainable in a conversation with me. I think it rather rude to discuss this online.
good,I have enjoyed working for CC. The company offers great benefits once hired as full time. Management takes good care of there employess
good,"Monday thru Friday, clock in by 530am. load route number in hand held, pending a entire todays load pending to verify cases. then I sign and transmit load number. inspect my truck and load all equipment need to complete route. route consist from 6 to 20 stops, 200 to 800 cases. have to be off clock in 14 hours"
good,"Cada dia é muito corrido, pois, temos hora para entrar (06:50hs) e também para sair (16:00hs). Temos que vender, fazer merchandising, negociações de markiting e várias estratégias."
good,Good hours except the weekend work. For the amount of work you had to do i felt the compensation was lacking.
good,enpresa nao re comhesi os motoristas que dao tudo de si pra zera suas vendas.
good,"Very Structured Organization,,, Its a Hard Working Job,, its Safety Hazards all ove,, the climate control is the worse, very uncomfortable work environment"
good,Benefits are great just needs improvement on pay and equipment.  Leadership and management is fine But needs improvement on an employee uniforms and equipment
good,Wish management was concerned With they’re employees and promote they’re growth .....company in itself is fun and above management always knows your name
good,Could be better if pay equal the work load and the company provided better equipment. The work can be stressful but with good work ethics and communication it can be doable.
good,"I loved working there however, the raises were based off performance and your metrics. It can be stressful if you do not meet your goals for each day per week. No downtime."
good,"typical union job. interactions with supervisors were great. the company taking over do not care about smaller businesses. for some reason, it is a waste of their time to deliver to these small companies."
good,Fue ua experiencia muy gratificante ya que fue mi primer trabajo en el cual yo me desempeñe y esforce para conseguiguir lo que mis empleadores esperaba de mi persona
good,it has its ups an downs but all jobs do its all up to you! great people working there lots of friends which makes the job easier an more friendly. overtime is everywhere so don't worry about that....
good,the coco cola company is world biggest bevarage company this drink help the people modurate the consuption that strat the redusing sugar creating carriers and i happy to do work in coco cola company
good,A typical day at work is a busy one with many tasks to complete. The atmosphere is great as people work and laugh at the same time. Management is fair in their daily assignment. They coach and support employees. The work culture is easy to adapt as people are friendly and evryone is treated with respect and supported. The hardest part of the job is when it's slow as you may be bored and you want to find things to do. The job is enjoyeable because everyone feels that they have opportunity for advancement. Management provides training that is related to your duties.
good,"I loved my job there, just had to move away. Management was always really nice, payed holidays 3 weeks of vacations after 3 months of work service . payed millage and descent lunch and breaks ."
good,"A typical day at Coca-Cola involves being there at 5 am and from there you start working very hard. You drive to stores, unload the trucks and go from there. It is a very hard-working job. This job offers great job security as they need many drivers each day to get all of their sales done."
good,Tem motivação e tem local agradável para se trabalhar.
good,Overall i liked the job. Some days easy some days not. Paid hourly so easy to get overtime pay which is where the money is at. My supervisors were really cool and helpful. 3 weeks vacation time plus sick and personal days were the best part of the job.
good,"A typical work day is to be flexible as demands change frequently during the day. I have learned to be emotionally strong in order to deal with changing pressures and environment.  Management is focused on both output and people to ensure an energized workforce and that everybody works toward goals to achieve their objectives. There is also a focus on work discipline and ethics ie ""doing the right thing"". Co-workers in HR are female dominated and ambitious. The hardest part of the job is to be flexible during a difficult pressurized day.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the interaction between departments and building relationships."
good,Great place to work great benefits and good culture.  Management does not train very well and only reaacts to things after they happen.
good,"Great work life balance. Philadelphia is a great market unit to work in. Everyone is very friendly, and cares about your well being."
good,"esto es solo en mi experiencia como promotor,. no hay tiempo xtra, bueno hay mucho pero no es pagado. los supermercados pueden pedirte que te quedes a trabajar mas de tu tiempo, y para quedar bien con ellos pues lo tienes que hacer, claro, de gratis. si no ganas comision no vale la pena, el sueldo es poco pa lo que se hace, se exige mucho ya que cada mes se evalua.  cuando entras no eres de la empresa sino que tienes contrato con otra que es solo para promotores, por lo que olvidate de una mega posada y con suerte te lleguen  menos de 500 de utilidades."
good,"a empresa coca cola e uma empresa de grande nível para se trabalhar , onde arca com todas suas obrigações com os funcionários e a politica da mesma ."
good,"Responsible for the accurate resolution of employee and manager inquiries and requests that are escalated via phone, email, the HR portal, or other access channels. "
good,"es una empresa que trabaja todo el dia en sus labores, se aprende a la responsabilidad, a la honestidad y tener honradez, cumplir con horarios y trabajos asignados. trabajar es aprender nuevas rutas direcciones y aprender a manejar clientes, mis colegas son buenos compañeros no ayudábamos unos a otros. la parte mas difícil es cuando lo clientes no aceptan pedidos y toca venderlo como sea,"
good,"Trabajo en ruta y en oficina, excelente escuela para trato con clientes y aprendizaje en ventas, gerencia muy humana, gran equipo de trabajo. Lo más difícil de este trabajo es enfrentarte día a día a diferentes problemas que necesitan rápida solución ya que la mayoría de estos nacen de necesidades urgentes de clientes que esperan una respuesta inmediata. Es un agrado trabajar en esta empresa, gran compañerismo."

good,empresa de alto nivel tecnico e que proporciona aprendizado aos funcionarios
good,"At Coca-Cola it was nearly impossible to feel as though I was getting paid for all the work that I was doing on a daily basis, As well as the hours were frantic."
good,working As A General Work is Cool coz You learn more Working at Coca Cola was Amazing coz I learnt how to work as A General work ...

good,Me dediquei na área que eu atuava mais o salario não me agradava
good,очень тяжелая работа за маленькую зарплата - плюс сокращение
good,Hard work. Education for advancement available. Not quite competitive wages. Not a long term place for a career. But a good way to make a check.........
good,the time I spent with coca cola was also a great experience. showed me how to be more organized and how to manage my time through out the day. The work was very physical but didn't mind that part. the hours were at all times of the day and the traveling took a toll on my car but the pay was good.
good,great place awesome give you plenty of hours and pays well. the management is great and encourages you o advance in the company
good,el ambiente de trabajo era bueno contabamos con bebidas refrescantes gratis en los momentos libres compartiamos con los compañeros lo mas dificil es la madrugada a las 3 am paea luego llegar a casa por las noches es poco lo que se comparte con los hijos lo que mas me gusto fue conocer mucho la ciudad
good,Place was awesome amazing people and it was really fun due to having a kid I needed my hours changed and they couldn’t do it and it was understanding so for that I chose to go somewhere else
good,"This is God Company And Job ,Because moving to Puerto Rico my is dead,the most enjoyable part of the job atipicalday at work ,the hardest part of the job"
good,"muito boa a empresa otimo ambiente de trabalho e facil comunicação , com todos os funcionarios e patroes , no meu ceto ,é muito bom de trabalhar boa comunicação com todos"
good,Nice Place to work discounts on soft drinks and management is very respectful.
good,Loved this job everything about it.  the only reason I left  was Mother was sick
good,Aprendi mucho sobre las ventas y lo mas importante fue aprender a saber administrarme y aplicarlo tanto en mi trabajo como en mi vida
good,"This is a job, be prepared for long hard days and short easy days.  Summer is hot and long, and winter is short and cold.  It really depends on what department you work in but be the best advice everyone says is great company to work for once you are out of the warehouse."
good,"Fast Paced, always changing, loved the unexpected, loved the business, loved my career.  Full of opportunity and challenges.  Kept life exciting!  Wouldn't change a thing."
good,aucun suivis sur ses employes nous somme lachés dans la nature
good,"Gran empresa, buenos beneficios pero con falta de implementaciones para contribuir en un grato ambiente laboral."
good,I am a temp here at Coca Cola in milesburg and it is very frustrating that i am not able to know if or when i am ever going to be hired in here full time or not.
good,"They don't call it FMCG for nothing it's either you step in or you step out, things change now and then must be able to be adaptive to all changes that are being made by General Managers."
good,Management doesn't communicate nor cares when you get off work. Corporate structure is a joke and poor leadership. Hardest part of the job is only being responsible for what you're given everyday because you start with 4 to 5 and end with 7 to 8 due to everyone wanting to call out sick.
good,"boa na pontualidade mas deixa de desejar no valor do salário , cobrança indevida , dificuldade em ajudar o funcionário"
good,"When I went to work a Coca Cola I thought that this Company would take me to the top. I am very well qualified but qualifications don't hold a candle stick to those who are in the buddy system. Unless your in a fishing club, a hunting party or related to someone then you dont get the choice jobs. yes, its sad."
good,"como profissional não obtive condições dignas de trabalho (sala, mesa, cadeira) horario complicado (diurno e noturno) pouca flexibilidade de horario, gerente rigido, pouco acessivel."
good,The world coca cola could be great but management in the sales area is not very supportive.  As a employee the smoke is blown to cover you wrong doing at the Lawrenceville sale center. Your told that you can advance if you have a degree which here you want. There is two managers with no degrees that cause alot of tramal within the sale center.
good,gosto de trabalhar temporada pq eles pagan sen cortes e sen desconto fora isso e muito trabalho e pouca renda
good,Good company to work for. You learn the line of distribution of materials from bottle and can delivery to fountain installation dispatch and follow up
good,The company has gone through many changes in the recent past and the focus of leadership has shifted away from managing the employees to comforting customers and figuring out the changes in job rolls.  Not a good shift to inspire confidence in job stability.
good,Two years ago Coca-Cola Refreshments was acquired  by a independent bottler CCBCC. Many changes over the past few years. Great brands and local leadership to work with.
good,This was a temporary job in my life with no possibility of future growth. I took the job to advance my flying career. There was no future working at this company.
good,"Though the business is very interesting, the environment is not collaborative or team-oriented.  Lack of job security and support from upper management made it hard to complete tasks.  Though the non-executive staff have a nice culture, influence from south of the border was weakening the bonds of colleagues daily."
good,"I actually worked for The Coca-Cola Company, rather than Coca-Cola refreshments."
good,"When I first became employed the company really cared for the people having interactive incentives, and great community moral. As time progressed there began a great divide between management, and employee."
good,"When I first began work for CCE, you had many chances for advancement.  Then it began to get tighter and tighter.  Closing ranks and inexperienced managers."
good,"Great advancement opportunities. Education repayment plans. good pension, good training.  Great opportunities with working in other DC's job shadowing potential roles that you may be interested in. Great Mentoring programs."
good,very productive work place friendly great company to work for family friendly various shifts i would work for this company again
good,Days at Coca Cola is so fast and full of energy. My co-workers are really very supportive and i love to work with them. The hardest part of the job is month ends primary sales targets and most enjoyable part is the achievements of that numbers.
good,"Panned allocation of site."
good,bad management. They don't the pick area in order it always a mess and unorganized. Supervision is not very professional on the job.
good,"Not the worst place to work, but be prepared to be a number & to fight to put any new ideas into place.  Nepatism abounds & Tallent Acquisition os over workeed to the point of failure."
good,The company is an overall great place. i learned to be stable and work around nonsense. The management is not great. the co-workers do not stick together. the hardest part of the job that you are over-worked. the most enjoyable part about the job is that you have a job.
good,"O Trabalho era muito acido mais gratificante pelo o relacionamento criado com os clientes que possibilitava uma venda mais agradável, atuação muito forte da gerencia mais uma colaboração muito grande de todos inclusive dos colegas de trabalho. Os pontos mais críticos era a entrega dos produtos e a disponibilidade de investimentos para os clientes que já estavam negociados. A parte mais legal era a concretização da venda e o batimento da meta proposta."
good,Good company to work for. Always hiring and loves new talent
good,I've been working there for over 13 yrs and I learned alot about warehouse operations and mangement.
good,Dont care much about people just sales. Not the most organized structure.
good,Coca Cola was a great place to be. Here too had a high managaement turnover rate so change was always a option. I enjoyed the experience and the challenges that Coca Cola has/had. It made me a strong minded and solid tech.
good,"not a bad job its physically demanding, work late hours if you have a full time job already. the pay is all right not top dollar but its okay. some weeks you could work 10 hours the next you work 20 hours."
good,They ask you to do too much and don’t pay you enough for what they are asking you for. They want you to use your car and put all that mileage on it when I think they should provide you transportation
good,"After 18 years it is time to look for other opportunities.  The company has been good to me, even through many reorganizations.  In the Finance fields, there is little opportunity for growth outside of Atlanta.  Cherish the people I have worked with and friends that I have made.  Only downside would be work/life balance but that seems to be the trend among Large companies."
good,"Con la mayoría de los compañeros se tiene buena relación, la mayoría se preocupa por los demás compañeros cuando nos pasa algo bueno o malo."
good,great people to work with just run poorly in the maintenance department. manager at the time didn't even know what a screwdriver was. No AC average day on production floor during the summer is about 110 deg.
good,The temporary job that I worked was very fast-paced and engaging. The leading supervisors were friendly and encouraging. The hardest part of the job was assisting customers that were making requests that we couldn't fulfill.
good,Bad management policy and indifferent management ma.kes it a bad place to work No proper lodging arrangement for staff. bad food facility makes it hard for a person to pull along
good,Overall this is a descent place to work...just not for me...due to scheduling and the amount of work requested for the amount of money! But overall not a bad place to work.
good,"I loved my job as a bulk merchandiser until Coca Cola got bought out by Mexico and things changed. In my last 2 weeks working for Coca Cola, I would receive 14+ pallets for just Walmart and 4+ pallets for Brookshire's (in ONE day) and was only allowed 5-6hrs to get everything finished by myself. I'm not sure if I lost my position due to the new owners or if it was because of my manager. Either way, you don't get rid of the people who bust their butt, especially without warning. I work for Coca Cola from Nov 2016 and was let go on April 1st, 2017. So in the 5 months I worked for Coke, I called off one time and reason being, I had flu like symptoms, ran fever for 4 days, couldn't get out of bed and function much less work tons of pallets. But apparently, Coke expects you to work REGARDLESS of what's wrong with you."
good,People are great to work with. Only down side is no accountability or consistency in upper Management. Recently bought by a franchisee and many modernization upgrades are just now coming in.
good,A empresa foi uma escola! Aprendi muito! apesar de ser dificil conciliar o trabalho com a vida pessoal.
good,Great exposure to wide variety of selling/marketing/customer management situations.  Provided self started goal oriented culture.  Overall great role for the aspiring sales executive.
good,"I would go in and do what I was told to do. I did not sit and talk around, or be lazy on the job. I tried to get to my number to pick at my hourly rate, because they wanted a certain percentage each night."
good,"los dias suelen ser de execivas cargas de trabajo entramos a las 7am y regularmente salimos a las 10 u 11 pm."
good,I will provide detailed information upon interview if this is a requirement. I am pursuing career advancement opportunities.
good,Coca Cola is a great company. There are some facilities that are better operated than others. The poorly run facilities are not however representative of the company as a hold. Great opportunity but low wages.
good,I was a merchandiser with the company and was wanting to move into sales.  Because there was an availability with Pepsi is why I left Coke
good,"12 hour days for minimum wage & not much appreciation for your hard work,often working away from home and staying in cheap B&B's."
good,"In azienda dal 1980 . Azienda di caratura superiore alla norma dovuto anche alla reputazione del nome che si porta dietro."
good,"- A typical day was at least 12 hours. Stressing about if your order will get there on time or not."
good,"I really learned a lot from working for Coca-Cola."
good,"Sometimes very fun company to work for."
good,typical day is going to clock in and get ready for our briefing and then go to our stations that we need to be in. I love working at the coca cola store because I loved working with my co-workers. They really made the store a much more fun place to work. The hardest part is some guests are stubborn.
good,Played a key role in managing distribution operations within the assigned geographic location.
good,"Recebimento de notas fiscais de todos os caminhões que tinham no pátio para descarregar, verificar a origem e destino de cada carga, identificar o pagador do frete, realizar negociação de fretes, empresa de transportes de mercadorias é algo que fortaleceu minha tese em vendas, bons colegas."
good,"While working at coca cola I was very privileged but the hours and work load was not fairly compensated. I have learn how to conduct my self in a professional manner, the hardest part of the job was working over nights. I have learned to operate a forklift and pallet jack and how to perform various duties in a warehouse"
good,great place to work in general never had enough product to fully sustain route
good,A typical day at work was working very long hours and not knowing what time I will get off.  I learned how to verify the products and making sure that the orders were correct.  I had good time management skills because I was able to manage my work load with the amount of hours I was working per day. My coworkers were easy to get along with. Coca-Cola's employees were team oriented and was willing to help others.  The hardest  part of the job was to work over 12 hours consistently.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the pay check.  
good,"In this job you learned a lot about how to do the business, how you handle the pressure of work,how you deal with the customer in tense situation.You learn about time management, descion making."
good,"Na ocasião que trabalhei nesta empresa , não pareceram nenhum instrutor, gerente ou coisa parecida. Fiquei informada de meu trabalho por um colega local, todos eram muito alheios ao acontecimentos e pouca fiscalização nos gastos, riscos e desempenho de empregados. Senti solta e sem liame com os sentimentos da empresa, apenas fazia meu trabalho da melhor forma possível."
good,"Uma empresa bastante rigorosa,com seu funcionário.Até porque tem um nome a zelar,por se a marca mais consumida no Brasil.Tinha bons colegas de trabalhos,apesar de nos termos dificuldade diariamente para que nosso caminhão fosse descarregado,por motivo de nossa mercadoria demora pra se conferida,mas tirando isso ,depois era prazeroso para todos nós vermos juntos a realização do bom trabalho que tínhamos feito,prateleiras impecáveis.Aprendi muito na empresa,pois elas deu cursos de como sabe usa os pontos extras,como conquistar,como manter o mesmo.A limpeza certa dos produtos,nessa empresa aprendi realmente a função de um promotor de vendas."
good,"As a planner your biggest challenge is keeping organized and knowing what your priorities are.  Understanding your market, equipment, how long an activity will take to complete, and how long it takes to get from one place to another.  Management is very supportive, though not always as knowledgeable about processes and equipment.  Planners are fairly independent in their markets but there is an element of teamwork.  The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to identify issues and help sales or your teammates resolve them as early as possible."
good,"Started there as a part time employee and was promised to become full time when the probation period was over. Kept me on part time for seven months and brought in two new guys as full time before me. Fast paced and no time for clowning around. Decent pay, great people to work with."
good,"Too much politics.  Warehouse manager was a control freak. Only promoted the people that played a long with him. Was passed over for a supervisor job for a person that had a felony that the warehouse manager hid from corporate "
good,Enjoyed various experiences and the people but its underlying culture leaves something to be desired. Company lost its way in recent years. The work is challenging in a good way but poor decision and communication discipline cultivates negative employee engagement.
good,"This was a temporary position.  Generally, I was filing or doing data entry for payroll and commissions.  I also assisted with employee orientation.  Coca Cola products were the best part of the job."
good,"Extremely excessive work hours, sometimes work up to 80 hours a week. Night shift the days vary on what time you will be leaving work that day. Hard to find time to spend with family"
good,"Trop de changement, et perte des grands patrons au profit de jeunes sortis de l'école."
good,"Coke is nationwide - I currently work from home. "
good,"Well executed machine.  If you like to execute the play, this is the place to work.  If you want autonomy and creativity this would not suit you.  Good brand and company.  People work hard here."
good,"Paga conforme o mercado."
good,I learn a lot at ABI especially warehouse jobs. I learn to drive forklift there to load and offload. I even learn production jobs. Is too busy during pickup time good Friday and christmas
good,"Not a bad place, wish they would have stayed in Michigan and not sold out to GLCC went down hill fast. Actually felt ok walking in to a store with your uniform on"
good,"CCR (formerly CCE) concluded a decent era of the Coca-Cola bottling franchise system. CCR was owned by Coca-Cola, so, all of the policies and practices were pretty consistent if you were familiar with how the Coca-Cola Company operated. There was always plenty of opportunity for advancement because the company was so big (largest bottler in the US at the time, and, again, they were company owned). The downside to being such a big company... there is ALWAYS a chance they will downsize in some form, just about every 12-15 months. So, you had to keep one step ahead with your career planning. Problem is, it's eventually going to catch up with you."
good,"I loved the position at Coca-Coal which included full SAP training.  However, they employed many contract employees, all of which were in competition to retain their positions.  I was disappointed when they lost funding and eliminated my position after the amount of training I had.  If I were offered a position again I would accept.  Overall the job was easy to manage and required only minimal amount of Planning skills."
good,"As with any Corporation, Politics unfortunately plays a major role in decision making.  A lot of time is wasted talking about what to do instead of actually getting stuff done."
good,Too many finger pointing .............. The work is strenuous and there is a lot of continuous training. Also retaliation is always in the air. Great company so leaders
good,"Working a 5 day work week and developing a sales territory for the Cold Drink & Fountain business for Coca Cola.  The work place was a good place to work with people and also show customers that we care about them and their business.  We helped out the customer with their business in the community by helping them to expand & help to grow their business by sales, marketing for their community."
good,It was a good place to work but I wasn't given the opportunity to advance my career. Good benefits except for the medical insurance. Management doesn't focus on individual goals and aspirations.
good,Como vendedor eu era responsável por visitas e abertura de novos clientes e acompanhamento de metas.
good,Infelizmente sem carreira profissional.Era muito difícil trabalhar no nosso setor carente de estrutura e carente de um bom gerente.
good,"fast and competitive pace working environment. I have learned and enhanced a lot during my journey at Coca cola company. Customer service (satisfaction) is one of the main point, in order to achieve your goal and meet your given target."
good,"empresa boa para se trabalhar, ensina muito sobre o mercado em que atua."
good,I liked working here.  It's hard work so don't expect it not to be.  The biggest problem with this company is communication.  Your boss is in a different city entirely.  Great hours but long.  Weekends off but sometimes during the week you won't get home until late at night.
good,Great Company to work for. Lots of opportunities to get depth and depth of experience. Supportive Management. Great work life balance. Most enjjoyable part is the people and culture. Hardest part is continuous changes and no succession planning.
good,"A typical day would include unloading returns from route trucks and bulk transport trucks and then consolidating returns. Then, I would ship returns at end of the day. Also, I would load the route trucks for the next day."
good,The company was great to work for because it had all the relevant and difficult challenges i could rate myself to endure. Its management taught me a lot interms of being a team player and a conflict resolver  and not to be biased.I was truly blessed to have worked with the colleges i had because they were most team players.In terms of salaries they had not payed attention to and that made the working environment not fun to be around as i could not deal with life financial challenges.But i did enjoy the job as i was part of the admin and it came with a lot of challenges.
good,My experience representing Coca-Cola throughout the community was very rewarding.  The company stands behind it's employees as it relates to sustainability and community involvement.
good,The company is well structure but the department don't have  any support of each other. Most communications were lost and employees didn't know what was going on
good,"Sometimes i had to travel for business purpose, to long distant areas, once i was on the way back from District Kasur to Lahore, unfortunately my vehicle broke down, it was 7pm, dark evening and no one was there to help me, after a couple of hours i saw a truck, which later on pulled my car up to lahore, it was one of the memorable days in my career."
good,The Coke company has the desire to grow and refresh. The ideas are great but with the lack of communication and leadership to truly expand and motivate current and future expansions. This is not indicated to all of coca-cola. Just my experience with the West Plains devision.
good,"i learned how to us a forklift and how to inventory carpets, vinyls and other carpet and vinyl materials its a good and dedicated company to work for."
good,"Depending on your manager, some of the manager are easy going and some just don't know how to deal with stress. This company is too big and can be more organize and better communication flow of the company."
good,"Great job with decent pay and benefits, but the job requires a lot of your time which can get in the way of personal and family life"
good,"Start as early as 4 am, all about seniority, long days so you get home and go straight to sleep get ready for next day. Management is not good, need to train their management side."
good,"dinâmico, e dentro do padrão"
good,CCR is a very fun place to work but your very limited to moving up. Management is very unprofessional. The benefits arent that good either. They are very expensive with very little return.
good,Definitivamente esa empresa e pionera en hacer cosas que nadie más puede hacer y los proyectos son espectaculares. La carga laboral es bastante y se complica porque lastimosamente no hay mucho orden ni estructura y la gente se preocupa demasiado por sobresalir personalmente y no en equipos.
good,I enjoyed my time working with Coca-Cola and the territory I had to cover.  Unfortunately I was laid-off.  There were many changes to the company structure and within management and then with staffing.
good,"saiu para as entregas, aprendi muito e estou aprendendo cada dia mais, tem muitas pessoas muito boa, os colegas do trabalho graças a DEUS só tenho que soma, eu acho que não tem a parte difícil e o ambiente é muito agradável por lá."
good,"Aprendi a ter calma e pensar 2 vezes antes de tomar uma decisão, A ouvir sempre o que os outros tem a dizer dependendo de quem se trata   e que enquanto vivo aprendemos sempre ."
good,A typical day is waiting to see who calls off and what route you are going to run. You never get a sense of accomplishment and the union gets away with whatever they want.
good,Wages were good coworkers were even better. Facility and equipment too old to be efficient.  Family life suffered tremendously due to ridiculous amounts of overtime only to miss daily quotas.  All in all good company to work for just picked the wrong plant.
good,Enjoyed my fellow employees and supervisors. I learned a lot about different types of plastics and molding operations.
good,"Boa empresa de se trabalhar, bastante amigável o clima. Aprendi a saber os momentos certos de defesa e ataque no mundo comercial."
good,Valore mucho y aprendí que mas allá del compromiso y
good,Loading of supply chain trucks and building skids for every chain grocery store in 90 mile radius.
good,"over all working at Coca cola the company is not bad at, its just the management sometime that don't have a clue about what they are teaching."
good,Start work around 4:45am. Get off work when the last drink has been delivered and paid for. Heavy hours on duty daily.
good,"A typical day of work herer was pretty much the genreal cleaning and lots of labor. Always had something to do even when finish with duties.Management was pour, Co-workers were polite and didnt mind lending a hand or doing there share or work. The hardest part of this job would have to be working in the heat for hours at a time, but being that we were paid well made it worth the labor."
good,"You are expected to work unscheduled overtime, most times very last minute. Management does not seem to care about what you have going on outside of the company."
good,I enjoyed working for this company. They are very organized and decisive in how they handle things. They were also open to suggestions and ideas from employees.
good,"In coca cola company for whom i worked the management was very good and employee supportive, i quit the organisation to enrich my qualifications and build a good position in the society."
good,"Como qualquer Empresa Tem Seus Pos e Contra, mas é uma Empresa que Também pode Ensinar Muito, podendo somente Melhorar os Valores Decorrentes e dando mais Chances ao Funcionário de Crescimento num Prazo Menos Demorado."
good,Working at coca cola was a great learning experince; the work was challenging and enriching. The people were kind and encouraging; and a good working environment.
good,"I drove to locations on a daily basis and delivered products to the venue. I safely drove to every location without a incident. I liked working for the company however. The management was based out of st cloud. So there was never a sense of direction, and that's the reason I moved on"
good,"Yes During my work with one of the MNC's I had got a team to work with from various kinds of functional departments. The people in the team were anxious and pretty much awkward to work with the people who they don't know. I initiated a plan so that all could work together on the project with coordination and teamwork. All was going well when suddenly one member was taken away for another project by the firm that was a priority. It was time for us to discuss and solve the problem of work to be done by him. Finally, we all agreed on the decision that his work must be divided that will help us gain new skills and become multi-diverse."
good,Ottima azienda che però non rispetta la vita privata del dipendente
good,The job itself can sometimes become overwhelming. It is very convenient to be able to work from home. I work M-Friday which is always a plus.  I think there can be some changes with the managers.
good,"A typical day at work was packing bottles into boxes everyday, fixing the box machine maker when it broke, and cleaning up our work area before left to go home."
good,"Good compensation and benefits . The culture is not as great as it used to be but overall, I had a wonderful experience with the company. I was very fortunate to have a wonderful manager for most of my career."
good,"Never stop learning. The business is very unpredictable, problems always arise. Customer service based. Culture needs improvement. Hours are flexible but not much work life balance. Management needs more leadership training."
good,Boa empresa com possibilidade de promoção de carreira
good,"Good company, good benefits with a pension plan, and decent pay. No union at Coke. They need one bad. The work is demanding and the work environment is stressful"
good,coca cola had great benefits and they try to treat employees good at the warehouse i worked in. it was very tiring but the pay was good. trying to get a day off was like pulling teeth though.
good,"I worked as a production engineer for the company and that helped me learn a lot about the technology used for bottling the beverage."
good,Manage politics for job satisfaction. Ensure you focus on relationships at all times. Compensation and benefits are very good. Promotion from within encouraged.
good,"Coke is a decent place to work in Atlanta, while you have some job security, you are required to work very long hours in my role and because I was salary, The compensation didnt match the hard work required of me."
good,"The culture of Coca Cola company was not so good, low salaries, no job security, no work life balance e.t.c. there was burden of fake and paper work on employees ."
good,hard continuing work. I would compare it to a weight loss camp. A lot of great people and knowledge to learn but straight to the point. I would say that its a great place if you like hard work.
good,"Typical day at work is deal with rude customers. I learned to work with corporate american people.  I was in management as well, management there was okay. I had no problems with the culture of the work place.  I didn't experience any hard part of my job.  I was able to master whatever I set out to do. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting along with people and co workers, it was a fun day everyday."
good,"The company is going through a lot of changes currently. Unless you work in payroll, the recognition is lacking. It seems as if the company is more focused on pleasing their clients than their associates which is reflected daily. Seems like more people are trying to find new opportunities, both inside and outside the company, than those that are trying to stay; this goes for both management and associates. The daily work is challenging which is nice however the lack of recognition will help lead to the burnout."
good,it has to be when you are finally rewarded for your hard work and deication to the job that you continue to go out and do each and every day in all types of weather
good,"long hours but great experience. hardest part of the Job is keeping on task with your goals with so many moving parts. Not Much Room for Growth, people have been working there for 15 - 30 years"
good,Job started off as a good place to work. But coming from a previous company where there was nothing but team work and coming here there is no team work at all. Everyone is in it for themselves and doesnt want to help or lend anyone else a hand.
good,"gained training in pellet jack and forklift operating and inventory scanning. This job in warehouse was through a staffing agency so when there was no need for temps, we were all let go."
good,"Coca-Cola is a good place to work for. The hours can be long at the holidays. The culture their is great, the hardest part of my job is managing some of the different personalities. The best part is the same. The upper management needs help as they do not in my opinion make the best decisions."
good,"nice environment plenty of various tasks to do  never a duel moment"
good,"Pros"
good,"Long hours which cut into your family and personal time, but that's the nature of the business. Hours vary on the associates speed building orders. Compensation is on line with other companies in this industry. Good benefits and paid time off. Overall a good experience."
good,It was a easy and a nice work place. It wasn't quick pace but you will always be moving. Lost of lifting but the items aren't heavy and the pay is fair.
good,A place where a young employee can learn the easy and hard way on how to be successful.  The heart of any role at this business is the drive to shine above others.
good,"Day starts by stretches then start our long day of production. I learned teamwork. The management is very poor, zero communication between workers and management."
good,"Great work/life balance, however there was little room for advancement. The compensation was comparable to other jobs, but the lack of bonus and the poor pay raises made it hard to take pride in your job when you're not recognized appropriately."
good,"Bons benefícios, chances reais de promoção e mudança de cargo."
good,"Amazing Company to work for.Environment is strict and target based.Very strenuous,and minimum on hands input from management."

Die Arbeitskollegen waren nett. Wenn an der Linie Störung  war man ganz schön zu am rennen. Gut ist das man die Produktionslinie selbständig führen konnte.

good,"I enjoy working as an account manager for coke, every day is something new, something different. they challenge us to the max and that's great, give us a competitive edge. the hardest part is the push back we get from our customers."
good,"Very diverse job with many different skills applied on a daily basis."
good,"Work loads are scheduled and committed to customers. Employee  evaluation is based on performance goals that are coached and are obtainable. Management, and supervisor positions are not only flat, but have also been reduced. This company has employee appreciation, week and an excellent benefit package to new employees."
good,"Coca-Cola is a large company with incredible branding. The job is physical and has variety. The distribution center has been going through a change in ownership this past year which has been very challenging. I had anticipated one thing when I began employment, but quickly realized the company was not what I thought. My first passion is fitness and the basic premise of the the products I deliver to vendors goes against that passion. I went to work for Coca-Cola in order to have a steady paycheck and benefits. However, the feeling that I have that I am not living up to my potential is overwhelming. I feel the need to go back into the fitness world."
good,OK place to work.  IT is very short staffed with many departments being outsourced several years back hence in house IT staff are expected to perform many tasks from 2nd line support to project management to eyes and ears (hands and feet) for servers and networks so days can be very hectic and things can change in a whisker.
good,A really great company to work for but badly managed. Management needs to be reevaluated and have a set drive and focus. Business model needs to reevaluated and make sure Management follows though.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Coca Cola, just needed more money for a better living. I supervised a 11 man crew on the shipping docks"

good,long days no family time decent pay. good starter job for someone that just got their license. Poor management team. Sometimes expected to be a miracle worker.
good,"A typical day at work was answering phones, balancing/settling drivers (6) daily intake from their routes.  Extensive paperwork involved which required organizational skills."
good,Management levels are many with lots of opportunity to grow if you network within and apply yourself to learn.  This is one job that allows ample time to work outside the walls interacting within the community you serve.
good,Great company to work for if a person has no education because of the great pay however the company has no problem firing people when they have something personal against you. The company is also very double standard with the way the decipline their employees. No personal life is available due to the long hours being forced to work. The company does not take care of their employees as they did before 10 years ago.
good,This job has thought  me many things about production and maintain products coming out of production  also the know how of producing in a timely  manner to keep up with work lord safely ..
good,"Long exhausting work days with little paid or benefits. Hard work is appreciated, but appreciation isn't shown."
good,my day consist of hard work a typical day is hard work i have learned that hard work pays off. My management staff is awsome trying to get in a higher position myself. i could not ask for better co-workers the hardest part about my job is leaving at night when my shift is over. my most enjoyable part of the day is being productive and helping others.

good,"Good experience with coca cola."
good,"The job was seasonal work from the month of May to September. My typical day at work was pulling and staging orders for the customers and then cleaning at the end of the day. Most of the my co-workers were good to work with, ""really"" no problems. The hardest part of the job was spilling a pallet over and having to clean it up, ""talk about a mess"". The most enjoyable part of the job was the incentives, for those who pull the most cases in a month, and I was among the one that got to achieve it several times, not to brag but ""yeah"""
good,"Equipped "
good,"This location is no longer in business. The management was not qualified and all were given the job because they knew someone within the business. This is why the location no longer exists. Top manager was good, but departmental managers did not know much about management."
good,"Great company to work for, benefits are great, and culture is one of a kind. But there is a tendency to have years longs contract assignment, with no PTO, no vacation time, and minimal compensation. Meanwhile the contracting firm sits back collects a third of your check and does nothing, while you have another third taken out for insurance. Leaving one to figure out if there is a holiday whether they can eat that week or not."
good,never know whats going on every day is different.  but everyones nice and good money but you really have to work for them.
good,"my work day started around 5:30 am mon -fri and would end around 6:30 pm. after making it to my first i would unload the merchandise and dolly it inside of the store, do an inventory of merchandise and began to stock the shelves and coolers. i learned to deal with different attitudes from the customers who sometimes made your job harder than what it shouldve been. that was about the hardest part of the job."
good,"managing work and normal life is difficult"
good,"They were not paying anywhere near industry standard for forklift driving when I left the company. Pay raises were (possibly still are) pitifully small for one of the largest companies in the world. Required employees to purchase drinks, instead of providing them free but at reduced prices. They do provide company uniforms for free (when I worked there). Management turnover was very high for some reason."
good,"l'agent de prodution travaille en 3x8 par vacations de 8 heures."
good,My over all work day is good I've learned what it takes to operate a machine that produces a big part of company sales. My management for the most part is very understanding my co-workers are my co-workers people that I'm cordial with but my main goal is my job. There's really nothing hard about my job I enjoy doing it. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that I help the company put of a product America loves.

good,"Sete horas da manha reunião, ir pra rota e desempenhar o papel de liderança que me foi concedido pela empresa, 18:00 reunião de encerramento. Aprendi dentro dessa empresa a ser um profissional serio e competente infelizmente houveram mudanças no gerenciamento local as quais levou a empresa a me trocar por outro profissional. deixo para traz vários amigos de trabalho e ficam agora vários irmãos na vida. A parte que nunca me agradou no trabalho foi a falta de comprometimento de alguns profissionais e em contrapartida a parte boa era o contrario , os bons profissionais com quem atuei."
good,"Empresa permite estabilidade, boa remuneração, liberdade para criação de projetos de melhorias."

good,"Coke seems to always be changing something in an effort to modernize, undo that also includes their staff. I’ve seen new hires to old guards get canned (impacted is their term) with very little pre notice m, just a tap on the shoulder and you find out that from on high you’ve been deemed unnecessary. I didn’t leave under these circumstances, but it always lingered in the back of my mind, like a wraith tolling that I Gould easily be next."

good,"Fast paced, high stress, but rewarding place to work. Working for the number one beverage company in the world allows you the opportunity to grow in your sales expertise."
good,"The days are long, and the work almost seems never ending. You always start you day before the sun comes up and you almost always work more than eight hours a day, but they pay you overtime based on the day. You end up running around the store that your assigned and lifting a million boxes, so you'll end up in pretty good shape. If you keep you head down and stay focus its not a bad job to make some decent money."
good,I started as temp employee doing rework had the most awesome manager cordinator once moved up to production there where a lack with person doing the training and new manager didnt held situations correctly and there where several people who new that manager was not performing its duties correctly but myself couldn't talk to superior because temp employees are not herd.

good,Professional workplace with good workplace culture and organized process to meet with co-workers and direct manager.   Communication regarding company's performance is very good.
good,"Fast paced, had to cover a lot of equipment, machinery brook down often, 12 hour work schedule was hard to get use to, facility needs more supervisors and management support."
good,Company reorganized every few years. On the positive side I was promoted almost every time. Worked in silos which lead to looking good on paper but costing other departments and total company downhill.
good,I had a really good sales team and manager while I was there. They were thorough in offering sales training and teaching the systems. Was just offered a better opportunity.
good,"Merchandising/being a vendor is a thankless job, and, in turn, it's a no-news-is-good-news industry. Little to no supervision, you will go weeks without seeing your supervisor which helps you hone self management abilities. "
good,Coke is a wonderful place to work.  The only problem is that everyone is on edge because there is always a restricting going on.  If the people have been there for many years are on their way out what are the chances of you becoming permanent...?
good,"While each day started with general cleanup. Which included cleaning up with isles of product. Straightening and leveling off the can isle, then the same to the others isles I was assigned to. Then using the floor sweeping machine and scrubber to make the floors clean and neat. Then after that helping with anything else that was needed."

good,A good company with nice benefits.A good place work. A good management succession plan in place. Work/life balance is encouraged. A lot of training materials to help you to excel
good,It’s a good job but it can be hard and tiring at times and in certain departments you don’t get the respect you deserve for your hard work the hardest part is working behind people who don’t work
good,Coca-Cola Refreshments is a fast-paced work environment and schedule driven.The hardest part of the job is getting used to is being on your feet the entire shift or sitting in a fork-lift the entire shift. I cannot disclose the most enjoyable part of the job because it may be deemed proprietary information
good,"Start and end your days throwing pallets of drink product, stayed busy so i never worried about time. Ordered product on days that needed ordering. Got to learn the ins and outs of most grocery/retail receiving. Most managers i got along with especially my own. Other vendors also worked around me everyday such as Frito-Lay, Capitol dist., Pepsi co., etc. Everyone got along, never seen any real conflict among these employees. Hardest part of the job I would say is coming back to my route after my days off I would have more product than I needed and my back stock would be messy, leaving me to re-organize it. The best part would be having holidays off, four day work weeks, and getting paid every Friday."
good,I work in a very fast paced environment at Coca-Cola. I work in a bottling beverage plant where the profit margins per case are low and so the end product must move out the door as quickly as possible. There are five product lines at our plant. I am responsible for supervising union mechanics who perform preventative and corrective maintenance on the equipment installed on those production lines. I assist in developing personnel and in trying to bring more efficiency and standardization to the plant by writing SOPs and following up on the mechanics work.

good,"Good company but management needs training, people skills, and information on handling FMLA issues or escalating them to the proper personnel. Overall company is ok"
good,"I worked here for a short period of time."
good,"The job is very seasonal. You work a lot of overtime during the hot summer months and the work will slow down in the winter. First three years of working there expect to work a lot of overtime thursdays, fridays and maybe saturdays."
good,Hard /fast pace work with excellent pay. Heavy work load and need to be a self starter. During your shift you have to deal with angry receiving people and each store has different rules and coming in to a new store can be a little changeling . The back stock area for your product can be small and when a truck delivers your load you have to be creative in putting it away. Overall loved the job .
good,An average day as a driver was easy to manage. it required extensive labor to work. your day wasnt over until your route was completed meaning the truck was empty. Some days are worse than others.
good,Coca-Cola is a decent company to work for. The only thing I took issue with is the warehouse hours. It’s location is in an easily accessible bus area and yet their warehouse operation shifts are either too early or too late for transit.
good,"Fast Paced. Need to analyze problems quickly and make decisions even quicker. Non stop work flow, which requires you to be open that is thrown your way, adapt and overcome."
good,"The job was very challenging but rewarding. You had be motivated, flexible, detail oriented, and willing to travel a lot. The company was generally fair on your performance reviews."
good,everyday was fast paced and stressful beginning in the wee morning hours and extending sometimes into nights. the equipment was lacking and that  made doing work stressful and difficult.
good,"Support is given to every sales team, family oriented management, learning is continuos in this company, management expectations are very high, but rewarding."
good,"Check in your employees and make sure all show up to work on time, spend the day in the trade working with or following behind your merchandisers, make sure ads are executed properly, POG's are set correctly, product is rotated, backrooms are clean, customers are satisfied, and sales team is happy with the service levels we are providing."
good,A fasted paced enviroment great working experiences you learn new strengths great for a workout very competitive great career path for hands on people
good,the job is great it can be very arduous and repetitive sometimes but as long as your organized it makes it easier the hardest part is waiting for the deliveries or not knowing the delivery schedule
good,"The company offers flexible work arrangements, 401k with a matching percentage, an annual Six Flags night, and five flowing holidays. The Company works very hard to stay on top of the industry."
good,Great place to work! I love the culture and diversity of Coca-Cola. Everyone works together as a team to meet the common goal. I could not ask for a better team of co workers and managers alike. I recommend Coca-Cola as a place t learn and grow.
good,"Great benefits with company car and fuel scheme. "
good,start at 5am and may not finish until 6pm. on holidays you could be getting as much as 7 pallets that you by yourself have to take down and get no compensation from.
good,Great pay but work a lot of hours. Ability to advance and relocate to anywhere in the country. Ability to work all shifts. Training not the best. Great company to start your career.
good,its been awhile since i worked here my review would not be very accurate so i am just trying to get threw this. Boss wasn't very good and his boss was even worse.
good,Coca Cola is a great company the supervisors are great to you the managers take time to get to know you they make sure you are ready before they give you an assignment.
good,"Longer work days, lots of stops. Hardest part is getting to all the daily stops before order deadline and being there to meet the needs of the store contacts."
good,"A great place to work.  "
good,Competitive corporate culture in one the largest companies in the world.  Working in manufacturing gave me a sense of pride in helping to make a brand that is recognized around the world.
good,Early morning and very faced paced environment. Paid fairly. Good company with good benefits. Wasn't good fit for me however. Very hard on the body. Lots of bending over.
good,"Working at the Coca-Cola Company has been a great experience for me.  I have learned many things in my 18yrs that I will take with me on to my new journey.  I learned how to balance life and work when the work got hectic.  Sometimes I had to deal with difficult managers but you quickly learn how to adjust.  You must learn to network while there because your network helps you when moving up and on within the company.  The hardest part of the job was probably being tied down to pager and being on call even during the holidays.  However, not every position has this issue.  The most enjoyable part of my job is that friendships you make and also the fact when you can help the client.  I feel great knowing that I was able to solve an issue for a client or was able to give knowledge.  I feel great when I feel like I'm contributing to the company's growth.  I truly have nothing bad to say about this company.  This has been the only place I have worked since graduating college in 1999.  It is a great company to work for and be associated with.  Thanks Coca-Cola for 18 great years."
good,C'est important de connaître le milieu de vie ouvrier

good,okay place to work. great pay with great benefits. management was poor. very strict company with strict rules. company takes sales seriously. they give you free coke products
good,"Overall, it was somewhat pleasant to work there but, the culture was not a super positive one.  The management was mostly friendly but, there is really no place or room for advancement."
good,Great Company to work for but they will be totally Liquidated by the end of 2017. End of an era. Work balance is not on the good side. If you work at Coke you are going to spend a lot of hours at work to get ahead. But they had great opportunities and were respectful of their workforce.
good,"Coca-Cola is a great company full of diversity and the most brilliant minds! It is a very difficult company to get into, but the push is worth it if you can get in. Days tend to be very demanding and quite stressful, but you have to remember that you got in for a reason. If you are looking for an easy career where you can sit on social media all day and get by by the seam of your pants, this is NOT the career for you! Brand loyalty runs deep in our family, therefore performance expectations are high. Do not expect anyone to hand you your next position. In order to move around, you have to NETWORK, NETWORK, NETWORK! People are overall very nice and very approachable, but they themselves are always looking for their next step. Finding a mentor is the best thing that you can do early on in your career at Coca-Cola. Depending on your department, management is not always quick to show appreciation or look for ways to promote within. With competition so high, you must look for ways to set yourself apart and stand out!"
good,uma empresa do ramo de bebidas com produção industrial com troca de turnos excelente empresa
good,Would recommend coke to almost anyone..good co. With ok benefits..could you some better management in certain areas..need a better union non union relationship..to much gets bogged down in problems.
good,Really enjoyed most of my time with Coca-Cola until a change in management then things really took a turn for the worst. Individuals were promoted without enough experience in the company and were unable to provide assistance. Also you do work long hours and are on call pretty much 24 hours a day. Pay is great but very difficult to swing the hours if your territory is far away from your home and you have a family.
good,"Working for Coca-Cola allowed me learn sales, supply chain management, IT integration, M&A practices and financial management and forecasting. It was fast paced, customer centered environment that demanded growth."
good,This was my first exposure to industrial experience and I enjoyed every bit of it most especially the installation of the production line for the production of Coca Cola.

good,Working for a brand as large as Coca-Cola is prestigious so they only accept the highest quality of employees. To succeed you must be a fast learner and a hard worker.

good,In the beginning it was a very hard job and was pretty much a call center and routing to other help desks. After the project leader banded with the few of us that were extremely good with computers we turned it to a help desk that resolved more calls and issues than any other help desk in their system. After showing my skills I was able to open up more and be apart of process reviews and other stuff like program testing and roll outs. I loved the job for the most part but the only issues was 90% of their help desk was through other companies and working on the account I was already 2 companies in so being a contractor did make it hard in some areas to get your point across to the full time hired ones. We fought to the bitter end for our jobs during a change of power in their corporate offices and me and only a few other stayed till the contract was outsourced to a company over seas.

good,"I was able to learn management skills. I was able to be creative and build displays, and place bins in area's most travelled by customers. The hardest part of this job was keeping everyone happy. You never know what product is going to sell week to week, so there was a lot of guessing involved. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers."
good,"we start with a pre shift meeting. Atfer the meeting we start working either building pallets, loading trucks doing transports, we even have tygard. Management is good. my co- worker are just that co workers. I go there to do my job and go home. I would say there is no hard part about my job.

With that being said you have to keep in mind that you are responsible for your safety and no one else. The employee has to be disciplined and well trained to obtain that day of work. Management was ok sometimes but that's every job you have to have that state of mind that it is a business and a friendship has to be set to the side and forgot about at times. The hardest part of my job was staying fo us through out the day and managing  the task at hand no matter how lazy the shift is before you.

Try to get a good pass down from previous shift and what the rest of the day will entail. Go to pre-shift meeting to explain how the equipment is running and where each line is- whether running good or having problems to what needs to finish for the day. Head to the floor. As a Manufacturing Supervisor we are required to spend 90% of our day on the floor running the crews for each line. Total number of lines: 5. With that said, does not leave us much time for paper work duties or computer time. Working with the associates on the floor is the best part of the job. Dealing with management at this coke facility is the hardest part of the job along with getting the paper work and computer work finished without being there for 20 hours. I learn new things everyday, from dealing with associate issues to working a timeline that will allow me to go home at a reasonable hour."

good,merchandise stores or deliver product the people are nice but demanding the physical part and not knowing one day to next what i am doing. being out with the general public
good,I have learned a lot about lean manufacturing and continuous improvement. Everyday is different than the day before so I have learned how to be extremely flexible but yet remain focused on the task at hand. My co-workers are very hard workers and results oriented. I think we work well together and we have been able to perform well as a facility. I really enjoy the job I have but a personal situation is forcing me to make a geographical change.
good,"Flexible work envoirnment,got polished,two way communicating management,professionals,career growth,compensation"
good,A normal day is coming in talking with the crew. Management is ok as long as you do your job.
good,I was always on the run to get the product filled on shelves. Not many co-workers to have to work with. Very independent position. Hardest part of job was keeping up with demand.
good,"Typical day at work. start time 5:00 A.M at my first store on route, communicate with manager,service store with product and condense pallets in the back. backroom management"
good,My job requires alot of overtime. Sometimes I can work a 10 hour or 12 hour day. My job is very productive with getting the merchandise out.My supervisors can be very helpful with the work load. I have learned how to voice pick and exceeded daily goals.
good,"The work week went by faster than most jobs I've experienced, it was always fun and something new every day. The management team was laid back and trustworthy."
good,I worked in bulk sales at the Philadelphia Coca-Cola bottling company. Bulk sales included accounts ranging from Walmarts to Wegman's Supermarkets.
good,"Trabalho rotineiro, repetitivo, metas e horários a cumprir."
good,Full of customer traffic and variety of tasks. The job has a wide range of mangers and styles. It is an entertaining work enviroment. The hardest part about the job is that it lacks any further advancement or opportunity to excell are hard to come by. I had hoped to advance and learn as much as possible within a stable company but Coca-Cola does not offer this. I enjoy all of the people I work with and enjoy coming to work every day for the reason I am good at what I do and the people are great
good,"Coke has provided an amazing opportunity to experience brand management, customer development, strategic business planning and much more."
good,It's a great company to work for with good managment. They also have great benefits.
good,Coca-cola company se posiciona como una de las mejores empresas para trabajar en el mundo.
good,"Your pace and work ethic are what make or break you. A typical day will consist of visiting 4-6 locations. Always greet store employees, a quick ""hello"" will do. Meet with store or area managers to find out what they want and how it relates to your assignment. You are timed for each location, though some locations may be longer to replenish due to product sell out or monthly sales. The hardest part of the job is determining when to call it a day at locations because you are restocking among customers pulling products of the shelves to purchase them. If you like non-supervisory work, this offers freedom, but does not promote fraternization so remain professional. Check expiration dates constantly. Make sure back stock is always organized. Answer customer questions. May often be compelled to help customer reach a product."
good,"I was an order picker at Allied Fittings. I picked orders, loaded and unloaded products from trucks with forklifts."
good,I personally love physical work and staying busy. At Coca Cola this was an everyday task. Id love to work for them again or any other vending/merchandising company at that.
good,This was a great place to work also and to learn about the drink business.
good,"The enjoyment of being part of a family, a team and a growing company."
good,"Coca- Cola was a great company to work for.  Fast paced, good environment and co- workers, great pay.  Down side was i had to call to to find out if there was work, and it was casual"
good,You work on your own with no one to bother you. You pick cases of soda and load them on a pallet. Then move it with a electric pallet jack. Then you load it into the truck.
good,Be ready to work 60+ hours in a week. Some managers do play favorites. otherwise decent people to work with though had long hours sometimes 15 hours a day.
good,I absolutely loved my time at Coca Cola. I would still be there if I had not had medical issues that limited my work load. The management was always there to support you if your need made sense and it wasn't out of sorts.
good,Нормальная компания. Достойный вариант для работы.
good,Start at 6 in the morning do some checks and repairs on tucks for pre-trip inspections. Start up meeting. Service trucks by km intervals. do repairs on trailers and truck
good,"In my experience at Coca Cola Ent. At Maspeth, there was a lack of good distric sales managers that would take the time to teach their sales staff on handling the sales challenges of sales rep.  Too often managers gave promotions to people they felt comfortable with because they would not challenge their views.  There were good managers that were very involved iin"
good,It's ok because it pays the bills because staying at home doesn't.I love my job with them because you get to meet different people from different places.
good,I enjoyed working for Coca-Cola time and hours were decent good working environment Rolla merchandisers are extra friendly I did not have a problem getting ready
good,Work and personal life overlap. Required to be on call many times. Needs a bit more balance. Benefits are confusing as well as bonuses for salary employees.
good,"One of the best companies out there but employees remain unsettled due to ongoing tremendous change in the US business.  Frequent reorganizations, layoffs, combinations of new departments, etc. is badly needed to improve business speed but results in risk for employees if the job you're in ends up being restructured.  A lot of good people have been released in recent years simply because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time."
good,"paga en su plazo, ningún problema en el tiempo la cual trabaje"
good,The job at Coke was good. However I was only a contractor and when the project ended so did my contract.  I did learn some new skills there. But I wanted to stay longer than the project allowed.
good,The role not bad but the culture was not suitable for a long term career. Working with targets that were unrealistic created a stressful work environment. The fix would be setting better targets and pushing for better work life balance.
good,"Desafiador, empresa em crescimento, necessita ainda de melhorias internas."
good,"Enjoyable, love the people.  Upper managment doesnt communicate well with workers.  More communication would solve a lot of petty issues.  The hours are great, the pay is fine but still living minimum if you have to live on your own...but its doable."
good,"Worked for coca cola for 5 years, was fun but yet had some rough and hard days, you work unsupervised , the work is not hard but came become stressful without the right equipment."
good,"les journées de travails commence tôt, 6h généralement mais permet de terminer vers 14h, le travail est très physique: déplacement de nombreuses palettes. la qualité des rapports humains est très variables en fonction des magasins visités. le management du chef de secteur et du manager de région est bon, il est possible d'échanger de manière constructive."
good,"The hours are good for balancing a family and work, but you often get moved around a lot from store to store which can be difficult to balance your hours. The management is not actually present but usually available by phone within a day or two of contacting them. The hardest part of the job was dealing with store managers (grocery stores where our product was sold) rather than your own actual manager because there was always conflict about product placement. I enjoyed being home fairly early every day though."
good,Coke has a beautiful headquarters. My department has wonderful people and wonderful leadership. The company culture as a whole is negative as their are always  re-orgs.
good,"I enjoyed working at Coca Cola for many years.  I miss the wonderful"
good,Enjoyed the culture and my team. Geography made it difficult to build relationships in this current climate. Engagement was increasingly dependent on technology in recent years.
good,By myself throughout the day and on hands and knees almost 24/7 hard work and sometimes can get you annoyed very quickly must have own car and you get paid 53 cents every mile you drive no pay for wear and tear
good,The company is big and has opotunity for growth. The work culture is fresh and exciting. Working hours starts as early as 2a.m and end late as a driver. More
good,Definitely had me on my feet at all times I loved the fact that I was always out doing something amazing expirience something i’d definitely keep doing if the job was not seasonal.
good,"- Develop my leadership skills and learn how to successfully manage unionized employees in operations environment."
good,My time at Coca-Cola was a positive experience. The people I worked with were outstanding and very talented. The management was great but the advancement potential was not what I was looking for.
good,"Som person er jeg initiativrik og målrettet, og det er viktig for meg å bidra både til positiv utvikling og godt samarbeid på arbeid plassen. Jeg tror at jeg kan bli en bra ansatt og ressurs i denne stillingen, og har fokus på at oppgavene er på plass og fokusere på å bygge en sterkere arbeidsmiljø."
good,"I enjoyed working at Coca-Cola because of the flexibility of the hours, good team members both inside the facility and in the regions I was responsible for in assisting field service technicians and supervisors.  I gained a greater understanding and appreciation in the fact that much work is involved behind the scenes in order to just to go to the store and get a coke from the store, or a fountain drink at McDonalds.  My overall experience was positive and I would consider working there again if given the opportunity."
good,"Excelente para quem busca aprendizado."
good,70-90 hours per week always understaffed. I was injured doing another employees job due to understaffing. Local branch now under new ownership and appears to have improved.
good,"Unfortunately, Coca-Cola has sold off all of it's manufacturing and distribution centers nationwide, which are now operated by numerous bottlers.  This has lead to a decimalization of purpose."
good,"It’s a good place to work, sometimes long psychically demanding days especially during season, plenty of overtime if you want it.  It’s a good way to See how the retail business works if that’s what your interested in.  One of the things I like most is being able to go to different stores and see how different they operate from one another.  Also flexibility on your start times is useful if you have important appointments you must attend to, 3am being the earliest for merchandisers . The hardest part in the beginning is learning all the different products Coca Cola has to offer as its gone beyond just soda and the other part is building displays out of 12 packs and 2 liter bottles, this can be nerve racking if you’ve never done so."
good,Early starts to the day and its fast paced so days go by fairly quickly. management is pretty good at keeping you updated on certain policies. Time off is really hard to get
good,"The market is busy. The people are friendly. A bit difficult to move up regardless of your education or credentials. Overall, a good company to work for."
good,"It is a job where you learn a lot thanks to the variety of automation equipment."
good,"It's the affinity of the brands and the people you work with that bring the passion.  The relationships you build will help you succeed not only in your job, but in your career as well."
good,"great resume builder. Opens doors. Hard work, long hours, great learning opportunities. Will work with amazing people, vendors, franchisees and agencies."
good,"only the problem was i never had Sunday's off I wanted to go to church but no Sunday's off and also I moved in Virginia but the Management them care  "
good,"Empresa organizada e bem estruturada,mais com falta de equilibrio entre trabalho e vida pessoal  para com os vendedores"
good,Started off the day by getting a walkie rider then going up front to the shift meeting for our goals. While logging on to our wireless earpieces...Then stretching after our shift meeting.. Built orders leveled and neatly in a timely manner. While maintaining a 185 pick rate with accuracy and using safety precautions....After i was done building orders loaded and strapped product on truck then called for my next order on my earpiece.Did that for bout year then went to production were i ran palletizer machine..
good,Working at cocacola was good and interesting and I have learned to be careful because loading the bottled product is not so easy. I experienced and learned a lot in beverages
good,I don’t have anything negative to say but you have to work steady to keep up with the orders. The sooner you start the sooner your day will end. You just have to stay focus on the task. And to make sure you stay in the correct time windows. That’s very important so you will know how to plan your route and you wouldn’t have to travel back and forwards.
good,"Like many companies working for Coke is what you make it.   There are many fun, engaging and innovative projects to participate in and lead.   There is an excitement about it.    You can see real results of your actions.     "
good,"20 stops daily. If you're good they will over work you. Most people get 10-14 stops if that.  supervisors don't have your back if a customer gets nasty and unprofessional with you. Example: in order to make a sale, we all know on a clear day  the sky is blue. Well with coke if they tell you its yellow today to make the customer happy you have to go with that. Meaning the company rules and guidelines changes to make customers happy. But other than that the company was great to earn experience. Great co workers to call and help with locations, entries, and etc. great benefits until company sold and poof there went the 401k and etc. Who wants to work for a large company breaking their backs for no retirement plan and etc.  Trucks are old . no a/c inside trucks, old trailers with broken lift-gates.  Turnover rate is high ."
good,"Highly competitive with Pepsi Cola, 40 to 60 hours per week and weekends depending on the position. Driving all over the western slope of Colorado, from Telluride to Gunnison."
good,"I was hired on the last day of August and am still there today. I am living with my parents so I had a little extra pressure on me to keep this job. "
good,Loved my employees. There was a lot of transition and flavor of the month.  Very little consistent direction from different levels of the organization.
good,Coca-Cola is a good company to work.  You can enjoy fun events in the workplace from time to time which helped when working long hours to complete a task.
good,You don't have a manager breathing down your neck.  They allow you to run your day the way you see fit to get the job done.  They could pay their employees a little bit more but overall pretty fair.
good,"Based on personal reasons, I am not interested in providing a work summary based on my responsibilities and or experiences at Coca-Cola; thank you...."
good,O setor que eu trabalhei não oferecia possibilidades de crescimento.
good,The job was non-stop from start to finish would have to skip breaks or lunch to complete tasks that were set on short time lines and under staffed. Could be on one shift one day and asked to turn around and work the next shift in the same day and this would happen constantly due to the under staffing. Very draining.
good,"Coke is a place that seems to flow with the economy, but never has to layoff at this point.  The summer months can be tough, but once you get used to things you can fall into a groove."
good,"Merchandising for Coca-cola is not for the faint of heart. Be prepared for long days and hard work, but it leaves you satisfied and fulfilled when you are finished."
good,Coca-Cola is a global brand and in this highly competitive market they are constantly evolving & changing as per the market demand. The systems are well integrated but old & they are in the process of major upgrade. Work culture is similar to any unionized environment.
good,"A empresa coca cola é uma boa escola,nos ensina a ter disciplina e como trabalhar em equipe,porem o salario nao é muito satisfatorio..."
good,Ambiance sympa et bon cadre de travail malgré la pression
good,"Attending to trucks and making sure they deliver the Products and reload with crates."

good,Days can be repetitive. Been working for coca cola for almost 12 years now and just ready to be involved in something new. Good company to work for though.
good,"Long working hours, less growth. The is no work balance among associates. less productive due to long travelling within UAE. Company do not give importance to employee's suggestions."

good,"I loved my job and what I did for the company. I was tired of being treated like I was an expendable manager and I couldn't do anything correct. Its a great brand and strong company, but need better MUVP's..."
good,"Sem restrições, ótima empresa para trabalhar, recomendo."
good,The office campus is interesting and provides many facilities for working area. The management was understanding and willing to work with the situations. The most enjoyable part of the job was the type of the work I was assigned and traveling to gather requirements.

good,"i started professional work with coca cola company,"
good,"I was a very good employee. After 2 years, I was injured on the job as a driver/route sales. I soon learned that the company would soon turn their back on me as soon as I felt better to work. I was let go for other reasons only days of returning to full duty."
good,Although my time with Coca Cola Refreshments was brief the condition ere satisfactory. The only reason I left was because My studies took priority and the hours didn't mesh well with my class schedule
good,"there i have experience of 10 km areas for working in retailing shop. i was located there as a post of market developer in under of sales executive. my work was for managing to retail holders."
good,"This is a great place to work if you enjoy working in a corporate setting.  Free soft drinks all day if you bring your own cup.  Opportunities for overtime are abundant if you are an hourly employee.  Good benefits, but is a stifling environment."

good,"Environnement très agréable, esprit d'équipe, Et normes d'hygiène et de sécurité tres respectés."
good,"A empresa Coca-Cola me oferecia diversas função, na onde eu aprendia cada dia mais. "
good,"I enjoyed working for Coca-Cola! Although, training and accountability can use some attention. When folks, with no experience, get placed at stores to cover for route merchandisers often do what they want and leave nothing but a mess and rework to be done. Otherwise, great company to work for!"
good,"good co.to work for before they switch from concentrating on the quality of the work to the costumer, to putting out as much product as they could .  OK  until i got injured and my recover was slow to come back."

good,"The hardest part of my job was balancing the inbound inventory with the available space. The warehouse held 65,000 cases and we would average 67,000 cases per week. there were times the floor inventory was as high as 90,000 cases."
good,"Unfortunately, there are a lot of changes happening, so no job is really secure. Prior to all the changes, it was a great company to work for.  I would still be there if I had the choice."
good,Most adapt to extreme temperatures of the working environment while maintaining professionalism and common courtesy to fellow order builders and other employees of the working environment.
good,"It was amazing experience personally and professionally. Started as an intern and move up the order. My manager showed confidence in me, allowing me to make my own identity. Atmosphere inside office was exceptional, positive vibes all over the place. It was not the hardest part, but learning part was to deal costumers and vendors and also work life balance. I enjoyed every single day of my work."

good,"I would have loved to excel to the next level - a very fun environment , and I really enjoyed my job here :-) A typical day involved several meetings with teammates either in person or via virtual meetings, and lots of emails. I got to exercise my writing skills a great deal. I learned a great deal about how to work with IT folks as well as how to teach people how to best utilize my skills. We rarely saw our managers because everyone was so busy. It was nice to not feel micro-managed, and at the same time, it seemed that the managers didn't really have the chance to get to know their people enough to ""promote"" or give out good feedback about them. Co-workers were wonderful to work with! I would say the toughest part of my job was earning the trust and respect of the people I was there to support, however, once they understood how I was helping them, they loved it and we had a great time. The best part of the job was constantly receiving positive feedback from clients and students from my training seminars. I really enjoyed my job here and would work for them again in a heartbeat if they had a need for me :-)"

good,loved my job and those I worked with awesome....company is very conscious of social factors and contributes to local charities and encourages employees to participate...
good,"I know what is expected of me in my job, I have learned to deal with different personalities and making sure that I understand my reps work. The hardest part of the job would be to discipline non performing employees and the enjoyable part is being able to get the job done."
good,"start time generally between 7 and 8 am"
good,A typical day at work consisted of scheduling inside and out side carriers to the dock according to the priority of the stock transfer order or bill lading generated by the stock movement planners. While working for Coca cola I had the opportunity to learn two new software programs. One was called oracle and the other was an internal program called S.A.P. The management at Coca-cola was not the best they did not communicate with each other well. Which in turn made it difficult to learn the position of shipping and receiving clerk. Learning the software and how to use there programs was easy. The dock scheduling and how the invoices where supposed to be distributed was a bit confusing at first. That was because each supervisor had there own way of doing it. The most enjoyable part of the job besides the pay was the perks. Such as deeply discounted tickets for Six Flags and to Phillies games. Also all Coke products was pretty much next to nothing to purchase.
good,"We start the day off making calls to customers."
good,"A typical day at work included clocking in and getting right to work. "
good,Working at Coke is a challenging and interesting place to work.

good,"Early start to a long hard Route, Learned to deal with all different kinds of people. Met a lot of people."
good,"A typical day is planned but many times large customer needs come up during the course of the day that need to be addressed ASAP.  This is because there are several large and high profile accounts in my sales territory.  "
good,"The best part of this job is the management of your day is based on your schedule. You set the tone of how your day will go with visits to existing business and new business. As for the cons of the job, the compensation is sub par for most but there is a pension."
good,"Good Co Worker."
good,"Foi muito proveitoso todo o tempo em que passei nesta empresa, pois mim possibilitou muita experiencia tanto para minha vida profissional como pessoal."
good,"A typical day at work is a physical and mental challenge but to see your work at the end of a job is rewarding, knowing that I’m the last person to touch my companies product before a consumer buys the product makes me feel proud to say I work for coca-cola, this job has taught me the insides of working in a warehouse environment, how to build relationships with others, and most of all how to merch. It’s a fun job I enjoy the people I work with, I get to see new things everyday by traveling to different areas. The hardest part is the physical part it’s not an easy job but I get it done."
good,Patrao muito bom pagamnto e mdia muito exigente ate dimais tem veiculos muito bons
good,"Possibilidade de aprendizado, princialmente sobre pensamento estratégico, bom acesso a direção. Troca constante de gerência e pessoas chaves, dificultando a finalização de projetos."
good,we clean all prod. dorve forklift load and unload truck all work is fun to me
good,i must say i learn  a lot during the period which i worked with the Coca Cola company Benin. One of those things i learn is dedication and commitment towards my work and as a fresh graduate i also learn to be obedient and hardworking
good,"Very fast paced, wonderful co workers, love the telecommute option"
good,It was fun working at coke . Job culture has to be improved . Salary/benefits are not upto the mark .
good,They do a lot of restructuring and reorganizing.  The company has made a lot of changes and let go of thousands of employees over the years.
good,fun work place with many opportunities to learn new job positions. the hardest part may be lifting cases for long periods of time which you will get used to in a hurry.
good,"A equipe boa e comprometida, mas a parti mais difícil com  certeza e falta de tempo com a família isso faz falta."
good,Very physical job. There is great pay but the job takes up so much of your time with all the 10 to 12 hours shifts that on your off days all you have time for is rest.
good,"I have learned over the years the in and outs of the SAP system, how it affects the employee's profile, benefits and pay.  I have developed great working relationships all over the US and Canada.  Worked closely with Employee Relations and Labor Relations over the years gained their respect.  Earned several Kudos awards by Peer Recognition."
good,"c'est moi qui organisais mon emplois du temps."
good,Enjoyed working at this company. Learned a lot from my team. Very family focused company.
good,My day starts at 6 am and I normally finish around 6 pm. I work in all weather conditions. I enjoy the challenge of balancing my time restraints with my required sales. The day to day interaction with my customers/clients is the highlight of my position. 
good,"Decent job. Learned how operate an electric pallet jack. Enjoyable part was we had a great team. Hardest part of the day would be alot of sweat,m I actually lost a good amount of weight there. Worked the graveyard shift."
good,Coca Cola is a great company to work for. They have a great work life balance for its employees. It sometimes however can be very bureaucratic.
good,"Dias de trabalho cansativos todos temos mais quando o dia foi cansativo foi por que a empresa esta se dando bem e a gente ta podendo contribuir com a empresa, mais e nesses dias que a gente aprende com os colegas de trabalho, trabalhando juntos conversando sobre o dia-a dia de trabalho e quando a gerencia contribui com a empresa, contribuindo com quem esta trabalhando na empresa tudo fica mais fácil, quando a gente se da bem com os colegas de trabalho fica um ambiente agradável de trabalhar a pessoa trabalha com mais vontade e assim era comigo me dava super bem com meus colegas dentro e fora da empresa, uma das partes mais difíceis quando se está trabalhando e saber li da com situações inesperadas, coisas que não estão nos planos nem da empresa e muito menos da gente que se esforça ao máximo pra da tudo certo, mais quando chega o fim do mês e a gente vê que pode contribuir com a empresa e vê que da tudo certo não tem nada mais gratificante."
good,"Coca-Cola is a fun and exciting place to work. Each day brings new challenges that can be overcome with proper focus and dedication. The company has taught me the various aspects of business dealing specifically with operations, sales, and marketing to name a few. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the customers and creating strategies that can positively impact their lives."
good,Great product line-up. Managers who do not micro-manage are a plus. Benefits not that great. Systems are slow.
good,"Destaque para treinamentos e promoções, com oportunidades para colaboradores com experiência..."
good,A small unknown department of Coca Cola which is highly underappreciated.
good,No advancement within the company. A lot of responsability with little pay.
good,A typical work day requires handling mutiple projects with very different diciplines.
good,"Everyday going into work we were assigned to a different driver everyday. We will assist the drivers in the truck with daily routes to various stores throughout the City of Memphis. The assigned truck driver was pretty nice, talkative, and friendly overall."
good,boa empresa mais as remuneracoes sao inferior as outras empresas do ramo.
good,"Empresa muito boa de trabalhar,adiquiri muitos conhecimentos de mercado e varejo, relacionamento com o publico, visão de e,preededorismo. Pena que tem algumas falhas gerenciais que deixão a desejar, mas nada contra, apesar de estar trabalhando nela a quatro anos."
good,Nadelige is het vroege opstaan maar dan heb je natuurlijk ook wel weer in de vroege namiddag gedaan.
good,The work day starts at 5am. I have leaned how to manage time to complete all work task. Management is not very helpful. I don't see my co workers because I am out in the field. The hardest part of my job is is fixing the account managers mistakes. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with customers.
good,Coca Cola asked a lot of their employees but did well to compensate and support employees. They are willing to invest in their people and communities.
good,Am do all my responsibilty At defined time and work as group with my department also i has ability to work under any pressure also am help my friend in department to solve our problem together.
good,"En términos generales, buena empresa para desarrollar y/o poner en práctica los conocimientos teóricos y crecer profesionalmente...."
good,"Working as a Creative Director for Coca-Cola can be fun and exciting at times, but also has its challenges.  As with any corporation, it can be difficult to navigate the bureaucracy, but the work itself can be rewarding."
good,"Very fast paced large expectations, management was good and willing to listen to you.  Big changes in tech was very hard to learn and not user friendly."
good,"Coke is an Iconic brand and feels a great pleasure to work for. "
good,Great place to work and grow as an employee and a person. Great benefits and co workers are very helpful. Managers are cool calm and respectful. Compensation is decent.
good,"Working environment was ok, you have to fit into with certain group of people. I’m not sure if all Coca Cola team are like that. But other then my experience with Coca Cola was great, I would love to work for the company again, but not with the team that I was with."
good,"A typical day consists of unloading a transport truck, taking stock of what was shipped, then reloading the product in order onto the delivery trucks. Then taking the product out to the stores, organizing, rotating, and merchandising. The company has taught me many skills including, Forklift operation, Class B vehicle driving and product placement and marketing. The hardest part of the job would be the manual labor involved, but is to be expected in a role such as this."
good,"Can be enjoyable place to work, depending on where and who you work for. Usually fast pace jobs with deadlines to be completed in all areas of company. They are result driven by the day, week, month and quarter, some management shouldn't be there as they don't know how to properly treat staff."
good,"Buen trabajo  en equipo "
good,Many great people employed at Coca-Cola for extended periods of time.  I was able to get promoted and learned a great deal during my many years employed there.
good,The environment was very relaxed and flexible.  They are not afraid of cutting edge technology.  The work environment is very collaborative.  Regular code reviews.
good,A company with a magnificent history who treats it's employees well with a good work life balance. It's size allows for significant growth and advancement opportunities.
good,"Good opportunities but there is definitely a “ monkey bars” issue with trying to move up per immense competition factor.  I believe that the benefits are still good and there are ample resources available to help with your mental, physical, and family health."
good,"Benefits are great and you know this company will be around forever.  However, their policies make it almost impossible for anyone that is not on the Executive level to have longevity with them."
good,"Good people and good opportunities to learn and grow. Management should be willing to upgrade financial system for better efficiency. Unfortunately, many jobs in Atlanta (North Avenue location) are being outsourced to India."
good,"Loved working here, job is physical and kept me in shape.. GREAT AWESOME coworkers great teamwork...  As for my manager he does and say what he wants ( two face manager ). As being a permanent route driver, he would take me off my route and schedule the recent new hired driver on my route and keep me in the warehouse/ haul containers just because I have my TWIC card...  Anyways I’ll end here, just sooooo upsetting to think about already...  Glad I left!!!!"
good,it was a hard day lifting all the bottles and cans to make sure the isles in the store were stocked properly
good,A great company with wonderful learning opportunities - you are always challenged and encouraged to provide your best.  There are always great career learning and advancement opportunities
good,"Coca-Cola was a great place to work and if you want to learn the nuts and bolts of a manufacturing operation all you need to do was ask to be involved.  Much to learn, training that was provided was adequate but if you ask questions and want to know more than the average employee, the resources were available to do whatever you wanted to do.  The people and culture were great and add to the family atmosphere that was there, although accountability was less than desired it was becoming more a thing than in the past."
good,Production. Fast paced. Lots of stress. Deal with it or go somewhere else   Hardly any time off in summer time. If you ever worked production you know the deal
good,Various departments worked closely together to get product and equipment the customers in a timely manner.  Our team was very interactive with one another which made the work environment more enjoyable.
good,"muchas áreas de oportunidad "
good,"The brand is everything. All about product, productivity and customers. Love this company philosophy. Good Benefits and competitive salaries. Consider this company good to work for long term"
good,Empresa geradora de grandes oportunidade de crescimento profissional interno; suporte e excelentes profissionais em departamentos distintos.
good,Ok place to work would not leave for just any job. Like most places it's easier to come in as a position then to advance. They do love pieces of paper over experience.  So come with a degree.
good,Union oriented company with plenty of benefits. Hours can be challenging for a family man.The company is good for the first shift. Night shift is hard.
good,With a good place to work management teams from the upper management to the local management understood and had clear direction on what to do and what did goals and objectives were of the company and the values of the company
good,Very fast place to work but kept it interesting also very true to their employees and taking care of them for example when my wife got very ill I needed to take a step back from my role and they add up that had another position available and I was allowed to move into that even though it was a lower grade level from when I was in there very loyal to their loyal employees
good,Very entrepreneurial workplace. Hours are long with 6-7 day mandatory work week during some seasons. Safety conscious work culture. Lots of automation on the production floor.
good,My experience at Coca- Cola prior to the transition into Reyes Coca-Cola Bottling was a positive one overall. The work/life balance was a huge plus and the job security was great. The cons were that I was expected to perform the job as an Account Manager as well as my job as District Sales Manager while I was short staffed and was not compensated enough for it. And after the transition into Reyes Coca-Cola Bottling a large number of staff were laid off.
good,"staff member are great , benefits are great job security not so much coca-cola has a pretty large turn over rate and a lot of people are thrown under the bus professionally"
good,"CCR over all is a great company to work for.  The facility that I was assigned to had many challenging problems due to neglect caused by anticipation of permanent shutdown of the plant.  Those plans by CCR where put off and turn-a-round began.  One year after my arrival, new maintenance management began to make many improvements.  New manufacturing food laws created new challenges and were achieved get the newly required ISO certification.  CCR sold the plant in 2017 to SWB.  The new owner is currently engaged in the construction of a state of the art plant with the start up date in January 2020.  Under the maintenance management, I have developed my range of experience in manufacturing, technical writing and training.  SWB has been moving forward with improvements in the culture and working environment of the plant.  I have developed a good working relationship with SWB."
good,"Coke is a dynamic environment which is constantly evolving to stay competitive.  If you master change management and ownership of your career, professionals will do well navigating through the system."
good,Productive place to work with numerous opportunities for growth as long as your reside near the headquarters in the atlanta Georgia area.  Vast array of opportunities
good,"Can do Better though"
good,"Senior employees had a lot of knowledge, some union practices use to bring the place down but at the same time those associates excelled when it was needed. Sad the place was close, good friends from there."
good,"Sometimes you have to know the right person to get ahead in the company.  Very rarely do you get into a new role on merit. "
good,Currently I work in Quality Audit.  My job is being eliminated as of 12/31/2018.  I love my job. Coca-Cola is a great company to work for.  I am able to work from home.  I love this benefit. I am able to be productive. I enjoy what I do.  Previously I was in Credit Investigations and Loved that job as well.
good,CCR is working hard to be a profitable business.  Sometimes that means making tough decisions that impact morale.  They have great products are a part of the larger Coca-Cola family of companies.
good,"Empresa com ótimos benefícios para o colaborador, bom plano de carreira profissional. "
good,"This is my review in Coca Cola company. The production machines Is always inspect and making the normal mentainace  on it at any mentainace day. but no matter how problem is at any machine during the production time, they can't stop and do the problem on till end off production and this given operator man problems."
good,Ωραίο εργασιακό περιβάλλον αλλά υπάρχει μεγάλη αβεβαιότητα στην εργασία.
good,Overall a good place to work for. They had a good scheduling system allowing a balance of work and home; with decent pay. Worked at the Odwalla Plant in Dinuba that closed.
good,I was a technician for 15+ years and was terminated for an incident that happened with my van at home( on a Saturday) which I turned in on Monday and was told I waited to late.
good,my time at Coca-Cola was a great experience good management
good,My time spent here with Coca-Cola has been very beneficial for my experience in the future of the business of the beverage business. I can say I've learned many skills to do my job in the tight way.
good,"Se trabaja bastante bien en la empresa,  el ambiente es agradable."
good,Se trabaja comodo y con prisa cosa que me hace estar bien.
good,Fast-paced industry with lots of available overtime opportunities in the warmer months of the year.  Steady work and opportunity learn different aspects of the company.
good,"Daily morning starts with a team meeting to share and communicate information or expectations not only for the day but for the week."
good,"A typical day at coca cola was good, it was a very good enviroment."
good,Enjoyable place to work.  Winning culture with updated equipment and great benefits.  Usually 10 hour days that required great attention to detail and follow through.
good,"Work days depends on your work pace. i learned how to merchandise and stock product. Management was laid back and cool. The place was nice, friendly, and understandable. The hardest part for me was; getting off at a decent time. Meeting new people and making the best out of an long day."
good,Good Place to work. Pay and Benefits were ok. Working hours were good. It was a fun place to work if you like to out an about in the city all day long delivering to different locations.
good,good place to work with some nice benefits. sales force is small but close and always willing to help each other out. Good sales incentives if you are willing to push hard
good,"Great place to work. Free drinks, benefits are good. Strong team environment.  I would recommend this as place to work. Nice cafeteria and store. Great perks."
good,"Overall it was a positive experience. I learned a lot about sales and merchandising. Also how to keep your customer accounts happy and how to effectively manage your time. The only downsides were the use of your personal vehicle, heavy lifting, and long summer days."
good,"Great place to work, the people who work here are great and the location is very good downtown.  Free drinks whenever you want but the pay could be a little bit better."
good,"This is a great company with a very bright future.   That said, I don't know that I have ever experienced another company that was so incredibly biased between divisions.  The headquarters has every privilege and flexibility imaginable.  Outside of the HQ, treatment of employees is poor and dramatically different."
good,It’s a good job I recommend it the hoyrs are great and pays well but I wouldn’t stay there to long and the management needs to be worked on but other the. That’s it’s a good job 👍🏾
good,Great place to work. The work Varied and interesting. The whole operation was very professional. Benefits and pay were good. I had lots of time off every week was never exhausted.
good,I would get in at around 2am to work up hospitals then drive to numerous locations to delivery drinks bibs I got my CDL class A from here my boss was a great guy understanding and was a route man his self the hardest part of the job was the thousands of pounds of drinks you rolled around the most enjoyable part of the job was the harder you worked the quicker you got done with your day you were for the most part solo with little supervision
good,No major complaints with the company.  Good place to work.  Compensation and benefits are very fair.  Pay for performance merit increase program rewards those that contribute.
good,"Great Company to work for, it provided a variety of work experiences.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you get to work with in the company and its customers."
good,"Plenty of work to be done, the pay is less than expected and other HR companies in the area paid more. Team environment was fair management is swamped with work and daily meeting with timelines. Constant changing environment with rotating personal. Great benefits including time-off and sick time."
good,"A typical day at work is pretty laid back, when we're on ad  it can be crazy at work and can work close to a 10 hour day, very hard labored work pulling pallets that are around 3,000 pounds."
good,"Coca-Cola Refreshments no longer exists; this role was with Coca-Cola North America. "
good,Great opportunity to learn the bottling system and help build new bottlers or expand existing bottlers as they purchased territories from Coca-Cola Refreshments.  Job ended when all CCR assets were refranchised.
good,Nothing to say here as I am being laid off from the company and do care to discuss at this time. Thanks for the option to write a review. No further comments.
good,"I loved working at coca cola company, the work environment is favourable, there's inclusivity of employees in decision making. Good management and lower staff relationship."
good,"CCR was a great place to work but for a few problems.  There were numerous reorgs, so many that a VP referred to corporate reorg as a Core Competency.  Upper management constantly gave mixed or contradictory messages or completely changed strategy with little explanation.  On the other hand, the Pay and Benefits were very good and the quality of people you worked with were top notch."
good,"I had this job when i was 20 years and was there for four years and could never get a full time driving job. No one was going to move or ouit anytime soon, and i had a new opportune come my way, so i went for it."
good,Getting to each store and doing a count of what is needed on the floor then going to the back room of the store and pulling the product that was needed in order to make the shelves look good
good,"this job is a very active job and for full time employees they have solid hours, summers are fast paced and lots of work, winter is slower and more focused on details"
good,Very good job to have if u are not a lazy person. If I have children the ppartime hours are perfect only for first shift if u have children I recommend u to take 1 shift
good,Une bonne autonomie mais un salaire trop faible en vue du travail demandé
good,the day started out early about 4:00 am you got to the plant clocked in got your truck and headed out for the day. You were by yourself and usually had 10 to 14 deliveries to get done . but it was fun.
good,"Trabalhei por dois anos na empresa, a qual não tive oportunidades para efetuar um melhor serviço, devido ao local de trabalho onde fui designado. Mesmo assim, foi um bom aprendizado para o meu começo de carreira."
good,Typical day at work is to working with cross functional teams. Managing and working with warehouses to assist in reverse supply chain solutions. Providing donations to communities that are impacted by disasters.
good,"The Coca Cola Company is by far the best job I had the chance to experience, working with wonderful people of all ages and sharing ideas on all our projects making this job more fun than actual work."
good,"Fast paced, not meant for lazy people. Management some are great others should not be in that position. Pay is good. Schedule is the best Monday thru Friday."
good,"A new day a new Targets"
good,"32 years at Coca-Cola allowed me the privilege to learn many different aspects of getting consumer goods to market.I started out in the warehouse loading trucks and moved through several positions in the warehouse and into sales and sales management. The company, in the last few years,  seems to have moved more to persons with college degrees in most management positions. Persons with many years of experience with their brand, their products and with their people did not seem to be a quality that was appreciated."
good,Am humbled to work here. I appreciate the efforts of everyone working with me especially management. I will always be grateful for getting opportunity to work here
good,"Coca Cola Company is an exciting place to work.  I worked downtown at the head quarters, which was a complex of seven buildings.  There are many areas of advancement to pursue."
good,Overall a good company to work for. Since transitioning many opportunities in my department have dwindled down so career advancement is minimal currently.
good,You can manage as many hours as you can handle and if you're able to handle the work you'll have a easier time managing. Always on your feet a good cardio workout.
good,"É uma multi-nacional de grande porte. solida. muito boa para se trabalhar."
good,A typical work day with Coca Cola would include selling and keeping inventory for multiple accounts. The management is fair and very demanding on making quotas.
good,"Overall it is a good place to work.  However, it appears that a new culture is emerging due to new leadership and some are questioning if the culture will remain as good as the old culture."
good,Very organized entity with strong support for staff and management.  Plants are unionized so it is critical to be alert when dealing with staff.  Long term plan in view with flexibility to adapt to quick market changes.
good,"It a great place to wok.. They provide job security and stability"
good,Great company to work for. Communication can be better among departments to provide the best and most up to date information to our customer. Will be nice if we had a better relationship with all the other Coca Cola company's when it comes to transferring or job relocation.
good,My supervisor is amazing and made my work area fun most all of the time. The over all culture is very stressful and not fair. The benefits are really good at CCR. The sitting down all day part of the job is difficult.
good,"fast pace job, really good pay 4 day work weeks, good managers, employee are really cool. if u get behind thy will help u out. coke discounts on products. overall a very good job, no job is perfect but no layoffs with drivers."
good,A typical day at work can be from home or in the office except for Mondays. Management has very little respect for individual contributors and would rather communicate with other managers.
good,"On the Food Service On Premise (FSOP) side you typically start around 7:30 to 8:30am at home, checking email, paperwork, reports. Most of the Business Development Managers (BDM) or Market Development Managers (MDM) don't leave their house until 9am, unless they have an early appointment, or need to visit a customer to key in an order for delivery."
good,Fun but fast pace work environment! The culture and atmosphere at Coke is great. Time management for some colleges can be difficult making it hard to get things you may need.
good,I was employed by the company for 7 years and didn't have any real complaints.  Management is supportive but is 3 hours away at a different distribution center which was tough because management would be sometimes difficult to contact.
good,Lots of change over with this company. You work hard and the people are nice. The salary starts off low but work your way up to management and you start making money.
good,"Order builder position in the summertime is rough. You get a ticket that tells you what you need, you hop on a riding pallet jack, you stack up all the items on the ticket, wrap it up, load it onto a pallet. If you are working during the thirstiest times of year, you will be working long days. 8 hours is rare, 16 hours is rare but it happens, 12 hours is about average. You get ten minute breaks every two hours, and a half hour for lunch. It takes a bit of time before you get down the right order and arrangement to get good stable stacks. Mistakes happen, occasionally you take a turn too hard and you drop some items, a 2 liter might explode in a fountain of sticky soda, but management understands that people are human, and so long as your not screwing up regularly, it's fine. You might occasionally get grief if you're not moving fast enough, but overall, it's fair treatment."
good,"Good company to work with. MNC and world known brand. "
good,Trabajo eventual donde habia un buen ambiente de trabajo
good,I worked as an external consultant for Coca-Cola in Brazil. It's a great company but very political.
good,"Great for people who seek employment. Given its a production company, work is 7 days a week which helps individuals who are looking for hours. Management wants everyone to succeed however, they can be short-staffed at times."
good,Coca-Cola is a great place to work.  The flexible work schedule and the low stress atmosphere have been great.  The culture is very laid back and easy going.
good,Early start and end times. High stress levels with constant on the spot changes. Customers challenge you on a daily basis. Supervisors are hard to communicate with.
good,I would start at 5 or 6 in the morning and not get home until 6 at night if I was lucky. Benefits was great. The management does not understand that people are health conscience now.
good,Otma empreza e espero fazer parte por que uma experiencia a mais e otmo
good,Coca-Cola is a great place to make a career. There are numerous opportunities for advancement for those who work hard and build their own brand. The ability to be able to network pays tremendously.
good,"Good to work for, very difficult to apply on line for any position."
good,"Sizi değerli hissettiriyor, ve güzel bir firmada çalışıyorsunuz"
good,"Group meetings everyday before shift"
good,"Learned a ton of small format details."
good,"Great place to work!!! Long hours on feet. temperatures vary, people are great. Great benefits, and location. World's largest juice manufacturing plant in world. Best brands and products."
good,"As a merchandiser you drive your own vehicle and are in charge of building and maintaining all displays and product on the shelf. You generally have between 3 and 7 stores a day. Must have good people skills and work directly with store managment. Need to have organizational skills, and good communication."
good,"Long working hours- seeing a lot of client-tele."
good,"Uma boa empresa, porem deixa sobre o motorista muita responsabilidade, sobre mercadoria e recebimento da mesma, independente da forma de pagamento."
good,Great place to work. Management need to trust employees more and stop micromanaging. Employees should not be forced into positions they donnot desire and be allowed to contribute at whatever level they choose.
good,The hardest part of the job is the overtime it is mandatory everyday. On the day to day basis you load trucks using a standing riding pallet jack.some jobs are required to use forklifts
good,enjoyed working for coca -cola as a casual always busy 12hr shifts and early morning starts. got learn how to use the machines and change parts when the next size bottles were ready to process. Team was always helpful and the lunch room was good had some good flavors to drink.
good,Empresa com um bom ambiente de trabalho e diversos setores de atuação. Valorizam o profissional e oferecem boas oportunidades de crescimento.
good,on the phone all day and on the computer helping customers get the info the need on there account and also send them out techs when they need to have one of there equipment checked
good,"Great Place to work , hard to find full time employment as a contractor. Great work life balance, at times politics is a factor when it comes down to posting for new roles"
good,"Like Coca-Cola, not enough staff to cover collections, working hours were great. Being salary you able arrange doctors appointments with taking time off."
good,"Allowed Supervisors and manager to run the business, and challenged them to deliver on KBI, with rewards of bonuses of up to 6K per year. Recently started selling off to independent franchises again."
good,The position that I fulfilled for this company was merchandising. I made sure that all product advertisement displays where built and that the stores in my area where filled with Coca-Cola product. This was done to the Coca-Cola standards for display and to fulfill sales quotas for the region. The experience of working at this company enforced an individual goal oriented work ethic that was based on standard operation procedures that left no room for error.
good,"A truly global organisation that lives their brand promise internally and externally.

The work culture is good, with a good amount of teamwork and camaraderie. Management is what you would expect management to be.

Making plans with the family needs to be done only for vacations, because any weekend can be cut into due to business needs."

The hardest part of the job is completing a big truck delivery.  This does not happen everyday but it does happen often in Atlanta,Ga.

As our department has taken on a ton of change in the past 3 years it has been a pleasure to aid and assist everyone in developing the new skill sets and playing a huge part in sustain that growth. One of the toughest challenges I do face on a day to day basis is that there are several employees within our department that are not as willing to except the change, and having to refocus individuals in a positive way has to be one of the most difficult task I face daily. I would proudly say that over the past few years it has been a continuous learning environment, something NEW daily. This is also exciting."

good,"I was on a team of 8 other help desk employees. problems and issues were addressed by first notating them into a ticket form.  Then teams were assigned cue and each team would handle their cues tickets.  I learned to work with a team to accomplish goals.  members really relied on each other for support and completion of problems.  The hardest part of my job was the new technology at the time was ever changing.  we had to constantly update our knowledge to stay ahead..  the most enjoyable part was working, communicating, and calaborating till the issue was addressed."
good,I enjoyed my time there but there is room for improvement in my opinion. There are no set times for you to get off work and for people with children like me that can be an inconvenience.

I maintain proper inventory levels and align their profit and sales strategy with the products we offer to mutually benefit both companies.

Sales itself is hard and tough job.  Most enjoyable moment, when you achieve targets and get appreciated from management and other fellows."
good,"Dagelijkse verwerking van binnenkomende facturen en voorbereiden van de wekelijkse betaling waren de voornaamste taken binnen deze functie. Ook moesten er analyses gemaakt worden, waar je zeer secuur voor te werk moest gaan."
good,Liked working for Coke although it was a short time. Would have stayed if the supervisor/branch/company were willing to accommodate their merchandisers by assigning them to territories closer to home. The company needs to revise their mileage reimbursement policy if they want to continue to have people drive 85+ miles per day from home to work and back again.

good,"Third shift. To oversee 18-21 associates in the timely building of multiple-product pallets in order to achieve on time in full delivery to the customer. I have learned much abut the warehouse environment and inventory control. The management team is professional though does not always follow through with newly established policies and practices. My co-workers are courteous but do not seem to work as a team from one shift to another. The lack of cohesiveness from one shift to the next is my largest concern. My fellow supervisors seem more concerned about themselves and their duties rather than to look at the big picture and working together as a team. "

good,"A day at work would involve me reading invoices and using a hand lift to package CoCa Cola products. The management team was very fair to all employees. There wasn't much time to get to know my co-workers, we stayed moving and busy.The hardest part of my job was the hours. We didn't have a set schedule and at the time my son was just recently born. The enjoyable part was the pay and the benefits."
good,"Grande aprendizado, oportunidade de crescimento demorado, chefia conservadora, elaboração e pratica de programas de melhorias continuas entre areas."
good,"The day and life within a customer care center is pretty interesting. It involves constant interactions both face to face and over the phone. Being able to assist with impacting change and growth has been one of the many benefits with holding the Customer Care Center Lead position. Working with management has been interesting as well, because for the most part things are constantly changing. Yet, being able to pick up different learning techniques has been a huge benefit. Being able to work for a company that you enjoy is an awesome feeling. It somewhat feels as if I am not working since it is something that I enjoy doing... Leading and impacting others to perform on a high level! Go Coke!"

good,"Preparing and serving foods. I LEARNED GOOD PEOPLE SKILLS IS A MUST WHEN DEALING WITH THE PUBLIC. The mamagement was great, coworkers were enjoyable to be around. The hardest part of the job was changing to third shift ,Im not a night person. I enjoyed my time of employment with coca cola especially when learning new recipies to prepare."
good,Throwing the soda trays down the machine and letting the soda bottles drop into them them. I learned that they are about the community. Managment nwasmt very informative was never around didnt explain job duties at all and didnt communicate effictivley. Hardest part was throwing the trays down the line into the machine to keep it full. i enjoyed the people there most of all especially the plant managers they were very sweet and caring.
good,Call center is very busy. The people that I work with make every day enjoyable
good,Great place to begin career. Long days are the normal protocol.

good,Even though Coca Cola has strange work hours- I usually come to work around 1-2 am and leave around 10-11 am there are a lot of good benefits. Insurance- 3 wks Vacation in 2 years and 7 paid holidays plus sick time and floating holidays provides a good balance of work and life. I just wish there was another shift for me.

good,Me parece una gran empresa que brinda muchas oportunidades
good,"Could use a little more organization, but besides that it was a pleasure. Parted ways with Coked because I felt like my hard work was going unnoticed, not to mention my PTO was denied."
good,"(People manager perspective) A typical day at KO involves meetings, too many meetings usually.  Best to arrive early to plan your work, and work your plan - regularly.  This also means staying late, or working from home in the evenings in order to keep your true tasks and objectives on track, time and budget.  Workplace culture has taken a downturn over the past few years, mainly due to continued and consistent reorganizations and restructuring of teams, groups and associates - globally. No matter what job function/role (sales, finance, HR, marketing, IT, etc.) you are in, be prepared to be ""in the pool"" for a restructure on a 2 to 3 year cycle - this has been the case since the year 2000 or 2001 (again, depending on your job function at that time).  This means many good and some extremely talented associates have left the company.  However, even if you do end up leaving, you will be treated with dignity and respect.  (Yes, I do still love MY company even though I left in 2018 - with a 28 year career behind me.)  But the best part of the job is the people, your work colleagues will be (80/20 rule) bright, insightful, driven, focused, with a ""work-hard, play-hard"" type attitude - probably similar to you!  Those colleagues will become your friends, and a few may even become your extended family.  They will keep you grounded when you get your head too far up in the stars, or convince you to go to the stars when appropriate - and vice versa!  If you are lucky enough to get in, no matter how long you stay or what you do - you will remember that chapter, always!  (queue music jingle,"

good,"There are countless opportunities at Coca-Cola, they're just hard to find unless you've networked well or know what you're looking for. Education can be valued over experience or skills. Your experience will depend heavily on your manager and team. The culture is varied."

The caller may ask for something I know or may have to learn how to do it, but there is always management by my side to help f it needed also. It's important to have a security feeling at your job at all times. The hardest part of my job is getting up out of bed, and the best part is getting paid."

good,"The management changed multiple times within the past 2 years at the Alexandria branch, work place was fair and pay was great but management was atrocious and full of favoritism. They used blurry company lines and fake remarks to attempt to confuse employee instead being fair by accounting qualification and skill for a promotion, they rather use favoritism and those who stay past their 6-8 hour shifts to account for promotions and advancement opportunity."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is just being there learning more and doing my job to the best of my abilities. Sometimes the days are long but when it's done  it feels good!
good,Overall good company to work with.  Provide good benefits and salary. Requires a lot of working hours that sometimes making job and life imbalance.   Most employees are nice and helpful.
good,"coca cola as we all know is a massive fortune 500 company, so its understandable that you'll possibly get lost in the shuffle and the work can at time feel demanding. But I've seen from friends that still work there if you just stay on the right path you can move up and your future will be stable with the company."
good,"The senior management is from all over the world, attracting the best talent. The work environment is quite vibrant."
good,The head quarters in Atlanta is a great place to work. The people her are very nice and the environment is conducive to career growth. It really feels like you aren't doing work while you are here.
good,"Coca-Cola is a large company with a huge focus on making sure the brand is recognized and respected. There was always an emphasis to show that we were the top dog in the business and there was no reason for us to step back. The job was only difficult if you did not want to pay attention and do the work involved. The actual difficultly in the job was burn out, you are pushed to achieve by very little supervision and the strain of dealing with customer relations and employee satisfaction is a difficult line. Overall being happy at the job is a strange concept as the environment of dealing with so many people can leave you with resentment."
good,It was a pleasure working for Coke.  I learned a lot from their sales training programs.  Proud of the products we sold. The opportunity to attend very fun events.
good,"start early in the morning arrive at the first store work the delivery and organize your back stock, once done you go to your next stop and work exactly the same until you finish your last assigned store."
good,built orders for next day delivery. Used forklift to load and unload trucks. hardest part was repeated lifting. Best part was interacting with other employees.
good,I enjoyed working for Coca Cola for the first few years but I eventually burned out. It can be a very stressful place most days. I learned a lot there and it has helped me move forward.
good,"This was my first full time job and I stayed with the company for 11 years. Sometimes stressful, I enjoyed my stay here and would recommend as an entry level with career opportunities. They also offer part time so it’s good if you’re going to school also. They have tuition reimbursement"
good,Face paced environment with great people to work with. Work/Life balance with competitive pay. Each day brings new challenges and great rewards. Great place to work.
good,Great place to get your foot in the door in sales and merchandising.  It will take a great ideal of time before thinking of advancement but once in motion things get going.
good,"Coca-Cola Refreshments was a great company to work for over the last 12 years. Whether working in the Warehouse Operations environment or in my latest role as a Business Process Improvement Manager, I feel that I was treated fairly, paid fairly, and was able to use the available tools to reach my potential."
good,"I worked at Coca Cola Corporate head quarter (more than 10 years)"

good,"I enjoyed my daily routine. I started at 5 a.m. everyday. My day started with checking in through my mobile phone once I made it to my first stop. I met with management to go over any requests or special changes other than my standard duties. I would survey all the products that were needing to be restocked and verified what product I had available in the back storage to refill the shelves. I would then check with management to verify if my job was completed to satisfaction. I would then repeat this for 3-4 more stores daily. I learned from management to be thorough, to be punctual and to complete the task to satisfaction. The hardest part of the job was the workload at some stores. The most enjoyable part of the job was completing the tasks that were given. Working with coworkers to complete a job and the fast paced environment."
good,"Entreprise agréable "
good,"Productive work place. "

good,"There have been multiple reorganizations since I joined Coca-Cola.  Approximately, 4 in 7 years.  The company is ever changing which makes it difficult to get comfortable in any new role before changing again."
good,"Coke isn't going anywhere and unless you are super ambitious, obnoxious or a law breaker you will have a steady pay check every 2 weeks.  Two things to remember is 1. the further away from a truck you are the less safe your job is and 2 always remember that Coke was here long before you came along and it'll be here long after."
good,I have learned everything I can with Coca-Cola. The company has taught me many wonderful things in regards to communication with customers and meeting many new people
good,A typical work day is getting to work by 6 and working either by yourself or with a helper.  You would have any where between 3 to 6 stores to complete.  Some stores will have a truck order that you will have to do.  Stocking the shelves and condensing the storage area is your main job.  Overall if you are good with working with yourself the majority of the time this job is for you.  It is a relaxed and fun atmosphere.
good,Coke was a great place to work.  There were a lot of programs that were offered to help employees be more productive and have a good work/life balance.  I would probably still be there had I not been laid off.

good,I think its a good job fun and relaxed good people works there only thing was wish it offered more hours if it could be at least 30 hours a week I think we could live a little bit more comfortable
good,"Coke was more of a life lesson for me. I enjoyed my time for what it was even though I probably ended off on a bad note. Anyhow it has pushed me to continue on. I have a new appreciation for the work I can do, and to the things I cant do, well its OK. No one can do everything. Overall Coke is a community, its solid, and the managers really care about the emotional heath of the employees. Salute to good times."
good,Not as organized as I thought it would be for a company this size.  Didn't feel like they prepared new staff appropriately which leads to people leaving or not working to full potentail
good,"Excellent place to work. Very professional. Great company. Great people with a very deep understanding of what they do, specially the technical people."
good,"Good to work in a global company that everyone knows. Business under pressure due to negative feedback about ""unhealthy"" products."
good,"As a union member the job security is very good, fast passed work environment with opportunity to move around inside the company if desired. As a employee at coca-cola i have been able to gain a lot of experience in Health and Safety. I started off at coca-cola as a production worker and applied for a project job which worked out very well for me- my project job turned into safety job almost full time which is very desirable for me as this is the career i am pursuing."
good,"Not a bad place to work. Job is not easy, but not terrible either. management seemed to have a handle on things, Not enough hours during slow times. I would reccomend"
good,I was hired on as a temp driver since they don't hire drivers on full time.  Got laid off after 6 months.  Impossible to get full time permenant; you have to work as a on call temp for several years to be considered.
good,"Coca cola is overall a good company, there just wasn't many avenues for advancement for me. Being on the road all the time allowed you to work at your own pace without the micro managing bit the routes were always at least 13hours long"

good,Fast paced and can be stressful.  Not much room for advancement in my organization.  We tend to take on more and more work but no additional help.  This creates stress and tension.
good,"Good place to work for a career and benefits."
good,"I enjoy my job, duties and the customers I deal with every day. My fellow workers show treat friendship and support. We are a family environment.

good,"Always looking forward to go to wok "
good,Working for Coca-Cola is a unique experience. Everyday offered the chance to interact with Coca-Cola customers and consumers. Loved coming to work to find gifts.
good,"Coca-Cola is a pretty good company to work for if one is a seasoned veteran.  There is really no training to speak of and one is expected to learn as they go or already know.  Life in the field is very different from corporate.  In the field management employees are lone wolfs with little to no tie ins to corporate.  That is cool for some and difficult for others.  Also, being as big a company as Coke is, don't expect to be on the latest and greatest technology as things move slowly there.  If could be while before you see ""updated"" equipment.  Lastly, Coke has expanded and contracted so many times over the years.  If one is looking for stability, one should look somewhere else."
good,"Good company, however currently under going new business model and laying off associates and various departments."
good,Working for Coca-Cola was a very rewarding job -- very well known worldwide and great work-life balance.  Opportunities for advancement and education.

good,"Trabalho com atendimento ao cliente, no qual tenho interação diretamente com ele, como esse foi meu primeiro emprego aprendi diversas coisas como interação com o publico,moda e também conhecimentos básicos como estoque da loja e o caixa, também tive uma boa gestão,a gerente uma pessoa super compreensiva e que sabia lidar com diversos problemas,só tive a aprender com ela . A cultura do ambiente é agradável a qual todo mundo trabalha em equipe,a parte que mais tive dificuldades foi no começo, com a cultura diferenciada de cada cliente. E a agradável é que a gente vai aprendendo com cada pessoa que atendemos."
good,"I liked my position at Coca Cola, lack of advancement for me there. I never wanted to leave my position. New management was not talented as original staff. New management staff wanted to reduce pay and benefits."

good,I loved working for Coca-Cola refreshment. It was one of the best kind o ever had since I moved to Moline. The management fired me because I had an altercation with one of my co-workers. That same co-worker later told me they gave him a raise so he can lie and they can find a way to fire me.

good,It is a nice place to work.. Some opportunities for improvement. close to home at the time. Very polite coworkers. Coworkers are very much team players.
good,The only thing i would say that i don't agree with in the job is how easy the sales associates get off. Unfortunately the merchandisers are the one doing the heavy lifting and hard work while the sales reap most of the benefits such as bonuses etc.  Other than that the management has been very well and easy to work with.
good,Coca Cola pretty much sold itself.  It was a great opportunity to get started in the area of sales and working with different types of businesses to prepare for future challenges.

good,Coca Cola's Merchandisers travel from store to store stocking & building displays to represent the company. Ive learned about marketing in different aspects through building displays & how to attract customers or clients.

After this will then organise how to implement our plan for the day.This included writing detailed reports,monitoring equipment to check if its working properly, followed by cleaning laboratory equipment and then beginning to assrss quality of products.The most enjoyable part of the job is the interaction you have with both fellow workers and management, and also with the sophisticated equipment"

It was there that I actually learned that work ""should"" be fun.  Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them.  Also being allowed to take stretch assignments added a little excitement to the monotonous tasks.  A part of my annual review was to meet/collaborate with new departments.  Loved it!"
good,love this job and always looking to move up and bosses willing to work with you as they jump in and help when possible where most bosses would leave you to figure it out for yourself

good,"A typical day at work involved interacting with the Operations Management teams to review KBI's with a focus on Quality and Food Safety. Opportunities for process improvement were discussed in an effort to improve KBI's. I led the effort of creating a list of actions that will be required to accomplish the improvement goals. Timelines were established with assigned personnel to complete the identified tasks/actions. Routine meetings were held to track performance progress and to ensure the appropriate resources are made available to accomplish the set goals. I was the POC when any Quality or Food Safety issue arise at any of my 8 to 10 assigned facilities. I was responsible to lead the Quality Escalation process and work with the facility to develop the CAP to prevent a recurrence. I worked with the facility's management teams to resolve Quality and Food Safety issues. During these activities, I have learned to work with associates who have different skill sets and through the process of coaching enable these associates to improve their skills. Seeing associates grow and improve their level of competency is the most gratifying aspect of being a Regional Technical Manager for CCR."
good,"Signing a new contract with a new client was one of the best moment for all,achieving the sales and collection target was our daily bread in order to to enhance the company products availability and distribution and to make sure that the sales team will get enhanced when they received more commission and recognition."
good,A typical day involved scheduling and problem solving.  I learned that although a different company the procedures we somewhat the same.  Management and co-workers worked together.  The hardest part of the job was to remember new product codes.  The most enjoyable part of the job was doing what I was used to doing.

good,Working with my Co-worker were like working with close friends. We all work together like a team and watch out for each other’s.
good,"I thoroughly enjoy my time at Coca Cola."
good,"Coca Cola is one of the best companies to work for, been with them for fifteen years, worked in three market units and six facilities including two corporate offices. My overall view of the company never falters', but do not admire much of the leaders here. I'm sure you know a company's integrity is strongly defined by the people who leads, so I'm thankful the leaders I have encountered are not the people making the bottom line decisions on the future of the company."
good,"As a merchandiser you put in hard, long days especially during holidays. Working 10 -12 hours is not uncommon for full time. That being said, overtime is where you make the majority of your money. The supervisors are absolutely amazing, they will listen to your concerns and actually do something about them. They try really hard to do right by their employees."
good,"I would start my day at my first store. I would count the inventory and restock the shelves as needed. I would do the same at the other two stores and then go back if needed to the first. The hardest part of this job was that sometimes the carts were not available for use in a particular store, so the product would have to be carried to the location in needed set out or if there was much needed I would have to wait for another merchandiser to finish with the cart they were using so that I could use it. The best part of my job was the independence to come up with how to do my job as and efficient way for me personally, within company guidelines."
good,"The best place to start a career because show you a vision of how the world works, it is a huge company, market leader and going to give a unique knowledge for your life."

good,"É um empresa multi-nacional de grande representação em todo o planeta, na qual trabalha com produtos topo de linha de alta qualidade, que é reconhecido mundialmente."
good,A fast paced ever changing environment.  Everyday was a new learning experience.  A very competitive business.  Coca-Cola is a leader in diversity and inclusiveness.  Outstanding Executive Level Management.  Local Management is often much more complex and significantly less driven to develop team members.
good,The hours and flexibility of the company were good.  The management was friendly and helpful.  The job was beneficial to my health with good exercise.  My co-workers were nice and helpful creating a good atmosphere that kept good morale.  Overall a great place to work.

You see how our products are featured in the trade and how the consumer really likes the Coca-Cola brand and products.
good,"hardest part was that there was lot of heavy stuff to move."
good,"Each store is different. There isn't a typical at this job. Management works to attempt placing you close to your house if you're in the field to allow for short morning and evening drive time, but sometimes you have to drive a bit out of the way because stores and customers want their shelves to look pretty and full. Working hours vary based on numerous factors such as drive time between stores, your own work ethic/habits, deliveries to the store, if the product is on sale and the type of back room that a store has and what they have in the back in addition to your product. "
good,"Work as a merchandiser usually starts around 4am at your first store so hopefully it's near your home. Deliveries are between 3-8 pallets depending on the holiday or sale. Pulling 1500 lbs of product seems daunting but gets easier over time. I learned to not skip breakfast or lunch. "

good,"flexible work schedule"
good,A typical day consist of conference calls and trade rides with members of my sales team. Once a week I host a standard sale meeting with apprx. 45 attendees. Direct management is very hands on with coaching but is often time stretched too thin. Employees of other channels of the business work cohesively together to reach one common goal. The most enjoyable part of this job is helping my team to grow and develop as sales professionals.
good,I liked the job until they switched my route over to presell and cut into my income.
good,"I showed up for work at 6am daily. I operated the filler machine that produces Dasani water. Towards the end of my time there, management wasn't that good, my co-workers were the same as a typical production environment. The hardest part of the jobs were the early mornings and the most enjoyable part was the friendships that I made over the years"
good,"Enjoy my job and the people I work with. Some of the management needs a little people skills. Other than that, it's a great place to work."
good,"We made 90-150 calls per day to business that are currently established with us to sell in new products and take beverage orders. I learned to tailor my conversations to meet every customers unique need while maintaining a high level of professionalism. Not only that, but learned about what tools you will need in the sales to succeed. I love all of my coworkers and majority of the managers are kind, knowledgeable, and fair. The hardest part of my job was actually the rough days where sales were pretty hard to come by but the easiest was building rapport with the customers so that the next time I did talk to them, selling in new products would be easier"
good,"Working for Coca-Cola is a slight challenge because there are many pros and cons. They have great benefits, and great bonus incentives. I get along very well with all my co-workers, and I can present any issues or concerns I may have to my supervisor with confidence. However, the work hours can be a little long at times, and some of the processes put in place to resolve customer issues can take more time than they should. Also, as an account manager, the tasks we are responsible can be overwhelming."
good,"Drive to the store find a phone clock in then enter the store start writing what you need to stock, then get with store manager to what need to be done. Then when I'm done with the store call supervisor to see what co-worker need help with stores. The hardest part of the job is pulling out the pallets to build a big display. The enjoyable part of the job is finishing in a timely manner."
good,"My day starts before I can even log onto my computer. It is a very,  very fast paced job you have to be able multi task answering the phones, communicating on the radio utilizing the computer, facilitating the work crew maintaining the docks and the employees to keep things operating. I also schedule appointments throughout my day. I inspect loads before they are loaded onto the trailers. I have to make necessary adjustments to paperwork that needs changes. I am involved in all shipping, receiving, and processing duties. I also file, make copies and interact with inventory on a daily basis. I learn something new everyday I report to work."
good,I call on over 40 accounts throughout the work week.  I am responsible for maintaining and selling in new product and placing product in high traffic areas in stores.  I also check prices and inventory levels and write orders to supply product until next delivery day.  I have direct access to all store managers and need to respond quickly and accurately to their specific needs and adapt to market trends.  I must also maintain a profit level for each customer that is satisfactory to their business needs in order for them to be profitable each quarter/year.  I do this without direst supervision of my delivery drivers and merchandisers who place products in each store.  The relationship is essential with these fellow employees as they are a vital component.
good,Love the atmosphere and the people.. I don't like the contracting part where you are renewed every three months
good,"Good people , and company wise it is getting better lots of new management . New projects to look forward to this year."
good,"First off, I was always pleased with the compensation I received. Salary was fair and the bonuses were pretty great (although, I hear that this is changing). My direct supervisors were pretty great, but the higher up you get, the less impressive  management was."
good,"A Coca - Cola ou Sorocaba Refrescos é uma empresa na qual trabalhei por 10 anos. Acredito que houve uma troca de profissionalismos. Minha saída foi por incompatibilidade pessoal com  o gerente Comercial, pois com o meu gerente direto eu não tinha nenhum tipo de problemas. Um dia ele fez uma brincadeira, que eu não gostei perto de outros pares meus. Fui conversar com ele e o mesmo se sentiu ofendido, mas em nenhum momento o desrespeitei  , não posso dizer o mesmo da parte dele no dia da brincadeira. Tenho comigo que sou um profissional para cumprir metas e gosto de ser respeitado e dou o respeito também. Essa foi a segunda passagem na Coca - Cola, pois a primeira foi em 1999 a 2005. Em 2005 recebi uma proposta para ir trabalhar na Sadia S/A. Fiquei 5 anos na Sadia."
good,Personal interaction with people and accounts on a daily basis. Not in office environment all the time.
good,"Great atmosphere to work in, the people are great, however there are not a lot of opportunities for growth."

good,"Exigencia muiito forte de dedicacao dos colaboradores. Dificuldade e excesso de burocracia na adminsitracao de budget e recursos, dificuldade de aprovacao de investimentos."
good,I typically made 200+ calls a day to businesses. I collected company beverage orders and sold in new products. My data-entry skills became strong as I keyed in orders day by day. Management was very professional at this job and equal opportunity was heavily exercised. My co-workers were professional and we all took on close relationships as a team. The hardest part of my job would have been the times system malfunctions when we had to call explain not being able to process orders to customers. The most enjoyable part of my job was my job itself. I was very successful at processing orders and the consumers looked forward to hearing from me every week.

good,Coke is great company to work for.
good,"Aprendi muito nesta empresa, por ser o único na minha área, tive contato e aprendi o serviço de muitas áreas, como RH, Financeiro e Chefia. Tive contato direto com funcionários da área mais operacional, que me fazia um intermediário entre eles e a chefia. Dei treinamento também referente a minha área em outras filiais. A parte mais difícil é se adaptar no primeiro momento que se começa na empresa, a parte mais agradável é quando a empresa te passa confiança em seu trabalho e capacidade para se adaptar e então exercer as funções solicitadas."
good,"A typical day at work was very tiring. There is alot of lifting and alot pushing, but work can be fun when you work with the right co-worker. Some co-workers would teach me what to do like pack the hand truck and how to look for the product on the truck. The part I enjoyed the most was that i got to go different places in Queens and Brooklyn."
good,I was reporting any of the emergency and safety issues to the Head Office
good,"As a delivery driver you are to finish your route, management are decent people that have moved up the ranks. Physically demanding, You do get to meet a lot of different people and you are always in a different area of the city"
good,You're seated at one of many cubicals at their Dunwoody Place call center. Calls consist of unhappy and unfriendly fast-food patrons. Management can be cool at times. Your co-workers will be your best friends if you're lucky enough.
good,Great company to work for. Not as much upward mobility as you might think.
good,"Deligation of work, Team builiding, IR,Budget checks,comunication between internal and external customers,equipment control, stock control."
good,"I would drive to different cities, depending on the schedule, ranging from Belleville to Brockville. I would go to different stores that sold Coca-Cola products such as Wal-Mart and Metro and restock all of Coca-Cola's product while keeping the back tidy. I would travel alone and work alone while keeping track of the time I spent at each store and the mileage I drove. I would deal with the store managers to get a signature or approval that my duties were complete. The hardest part of the job is to start my day near the same time as a truck arrival. This is because if I came in too early I would not have much to do until the truck came and if I came too late I would have to work extra fast due to the fact that other trucks for different companies were also arriving. The most enjoyable part of this job is that I got to meet and work with different managers from different stores. Also I enjoyed driving to different cities which always kept me busy."
good,"18 hours of driving each day from Cape Town to George. We have very little correspondence with management. We as co- workers have a good understanding with each other. I get very little sleep and communication between office staff and the drivers is most of the time very bad. I suppose I could say the benefits, such as medical aid etc and the fact that enjoy my job."
good,split shift 1pm until the job is done usually 12-14 hours 6 days a week. 8 hours driving 4-6 hours getting trailers ready and planning for the next day. (i dont get paid by the hour). co-workers and management are nice and we joke around alot. I never know exactly what im going to be doing until the last minute. which means sometimes the day off or doing my job then another persons job.

good,"One of the best places to work.  It comes with normal pros and cons. Professional atmosphere and vibrant diversity make it an enjoyable place to work. Individual experience depends on your specific project, department, manager, and people you work with."
good,"The job itself is quite draining some days but if you're someone like me who always needs to be moving it's perfect for making the day fly by. You spend the day traveling around town going to various grocery stores filling the coke products then leaving. The hardest part of the job is each grocery store is different, some can be quite the challenge due to poor management , lack of space or bad equipment but given that they have to cater to you in the end, you tend to not care because your job is to make Coca-Cola happy. The best part of the job is that your entire team is generally supportive, they're flexible in terms of your ability to work (they don't overwork you) , you can work for as long as you want as long as the jobs done which includes lots of OT if you want it!"

good,"I worked for Coca-Cola USA 30 years ago. At the time it was an amazing job. Challenging but achievable goals with great rewards. But then they started hiring from the outside, placed more control in the local bottler's hands, and lost some of the specialness of the job. I have heard that the culture has changed some in recent years. It seems they have a good product mix and have retained the attention to key accounts."
good,"It is great working for a company with global brand recognition and such a long, rich history. TCCC provided a stable work environment, team focus on improvement and innovation, exceptional company pride and loyalty to the brands, and an excellent salary with benefits."

good,The company underwent a lot of org and department changes that demanded employees to work a lot of over time and some weekends to complete projects. I have to say the best thing that I liked about working here is when we were allowed to work remotely from home some days out of the week. Some managers were more knowledgeable and understanding of work/life balance.
good,From a high pressured working environment you get a truck load of cool drinks for free and also the management personnel are hard workers who go an extra mile into making sure that the company succeeds they always yearn for growth and they assist you and make you feel at ease. I don't remember a single day I went home angry or hurt the people there are loving from cleaners to top management they are very kind but that doesn't mean you can take an advantage of that you must be respectful and remember that you are at work .There is a time for fun and games and there is also a time to work and push beyond boundaries and meet dead lines .

good,I immensely enjoyed my years at Coca-Cola.  The changes in management was challenging and I found myself questioning my future there.  I would certainly consider the right opportunity to return.
good,"My day would begin with receiving information from the previous shift regarding any activity and or alerts.  Logging into all security  and registration systems.  Tour the building(s) and record any issues, reporting them to the responsible department(s).  Monitor activity throughout the shift and generate reports.  During the shift we would issue access to registered guest or assisting if the guest wasn't registered.  In case of any emergency we would need to assess the situation providing any assistance and calling 9-1-1 if necessary.  Shift would end with distributing reports to managers and passing information onto the next shift."
good,buen ambiente en el trabajo con los compañeros y los dirigentes
good,"- Good environment "
good,Fue una gran enseñanza estar laborando con uds y aun seguiria solo que hubo reestructura de prestaciones y fue por lo cual so tomo la decisión de terminar la relación de trabajo.
good,"I worked 12 hour shifts, not allowed to shift, and the management showed favortism. The pay was not that great for the types of labor I was put to do. I was never offered opportunities to advance in the franchise and was discriminated against many times."
good,empresa de grande porte com beneficios otimos e com ampla treinamento na area
good,"Vendre & Marketing sont très important."
good,It was a decent job while i was there the only reason i didn't stay was because they would not give me the full-time position while i was a seasonal employee. Instead they hired 2 part-time employees.
good,"hard work and hard on your body."
good,Provided me a strong foundation of training and seminars for the consumer products industry.  I held several management positions and was given the opportunity to work in many different classes of trade.
good,"definitely a great place to start your operations career.  There are often opportunities in distribution and warehousing, as well as opportunities in sales and inside the office."
good,I really like working as a Merchandiser for Coca-Cola because I work alone at my own pace and do what needs to be done. This job has a lot of trust given my management because there is no personnel watching over.
good,"The management was very fair during most of the time i was employed there. The work was fun, exciting and gave you a good work out. Warehouse organization was great and location of products to pull for an order was well maintained."
good,"stay on task, you get done in a good amount of time.  Get distracted, your day can be 12 hours.  The supervisor I have is awesome and works well with your availability.  Store employees and managers can be jerks but you dont work for them so, let it roll of your back, do your job, get paid and go home.."
good,"Once a year there's an offsite event held for the employees and the family. Last year, the offsite meeting event was held at six flags. The entire park was closed down for the entire day for the employees and our families. I thought that was pretty cool."
good,"sehr professionell, organisiert und ordentlich....."
good,"I worked as a contractor, enjoyed the working environment."
good,"Fast paced friendly work environment good pay regular overtime in the busy season, in the slow season it can be really slow with alot of hours being cut."
good,"Avaliação conforme a função do grupo simões, pois trata-se da mesma empresa"
good,"The work is a little challenging , but the pay is good. The only downsides that I can think of the hours that you have to work (5-1:30), and the fact that you need to work holidays and weekends."
good,"Coca-Cola was a fun job to have; however, their was a lot of micro managing going on and lack of communication from manager to account rep. You also don't get a company car, which places a lot of miles on your personal vehicle."
good,its a pleasure to go to work everyday with a purpose.   I like to personally see my fruits of labor by watching individuals grow into better employees.
good,Es un trabajo sin duda pesado pero bueno hay muchas cosas q podrian mejorar
good,"Basically, it’s an honest days work type of deal here. Management is management. There are good days and bad. Overall, if you do what you’re supposed to, you can stay under the radar and work in peace. Plenty of characters here but that’s at any job. Pay is good, benefits are good, and it’s a Monday-Friday job. Only bad thing I can say is that if you are new, expect to be on a layoff list. Don’t make purchases based on what you might get paid."
good,I enjoyed working with VEB and the Coke system.  I have been in the system for almost 9 years and have much respect for my co-workers.  It has been challenging but fun and i hate that my position was eliminated.
good,"Every day in Coke comes with a challenge of target completion.A day  of a sales supervisor starts with sales followup and target completion plan for the day of sales team.Market visits and market visibility checks."
good,"A typical work day consist of working loads that arrive at the stores that I am assigned and keeping product nice, neat, organized and rotated.I also build displays and other point of sales to help promote whatever sales or new materials we have out at the time."
good,"Ir de tienda en tienda a colocar las promociones de coca cola ,la parte difícil era para encontrar la dirección de la tienda poraye algunas quedan lejos ."
good,"My work in sales, marketing, and business development was very fast paced and hectic. If an employee in account management or sales management is the sort of individual who thrives on moving quickly, interacting with many people, and not being in the office all day, that employee will be very happy working in sales at Coke."
good,"Coca- cola was an excellent employer. Offering excellent wages, raises, and employee benefits. Job could be stressful at times, but overall I looked forward to coming to work. Good work environment."
good,Love the culture and the atmosphere. Management very helpful with training supervisors on there expectations. Very competitive atmosphere and family oriented.
good,"review current flavor schedule. ph water testing. sugar trucks get unloaded. Loading and unloading shipment trucks. constant forklift driving for trash, loading/unloading tasks, and flavor prepping. Make flavors to serve on lines for production. Constant filing of paperwork and computer work of production daily. Picking up on everything took patience to learn how to work certain stations including ph water treatment testing. Normal quality control work. Pressure and reminders is a constant to be patient with coming from multiple supervisors. Learned to plan my workflow by keeping a personal journal with me just to have an upkeep on all my daily tasks. usually plan by the minute. Loss time here meant loss money. ( Thats anywhere though). i have to work with a planned schedule, unless we were short handed and needed to figure out how to make sure production was done on schedule. I actually enjoyed the big role. Only few worked as a QC Blending Technician at a time, so i knew how huge my role was. No flavor, meant a big loss, a big no no especially during promotional scheduling. and as long as my relief stayed in communication, i went home a happy man."
good,If you want to get in shape this the job for you. Fast paced and you get to keep to your self because their is always more to do.Try to keep your numbers on top.
good,"Good place to begin my career. An ultimate leader in the CSD category and the product almost sells itself. Management was great, and everyone around me was willing to help me grow."
good,Coca Cola Refreshments is now defunct and is owned by a local bottler.  Can't comment on new company that is now really 12 + new companies.  Each is a separate entity that brought in their new leaders
good,There are times of outdoor and indoor activities that randomly come up from time to time. Coca Cola organizes summer events all over the word. I once participated in a company soccer event...
good,É um ambiente dinâmico e com prazos a cumprir. Foi uma experiência ótima.
good,I really enjoyed my self working as a supervisor over the cleaning and things.. theres really not a whole lot to sy I enjoyed it until the contract ended
good,I really loved to work at this amazing company.   Benefits and pay were awesome.  I wish i could continue working here and could developed many more skills.
good,being a Merchandiser with this company was probably one of my favorite jobs ive ever had. you get to work alone don't know anyone over your shoulder. but at the same time you don't have no help so some days get pretty long
good,"Start early at 5am at whatever store has a load dropped off on the schedule. "
good,Typical day starts at 7 am and finished around 3:30 pm but could go as late as 5 pm depending on the workload.Learned a lot about inventory management and demand forecasting. Good managers that are very willing to work with your personal schedule.
good,very fast pace..I had a chance to work with a lot of hardworking people..very long hours day in and day out...the work is very easy all you have to do is listen to a headset
good,Had to deliver coca cola products cdl class a 34/48ft trailers. Keep ya in shape. Drove 100 mile radius. Good boss. Meet new people everyday. Gave you plenty of work attire to wear.
good,"foi uma empresa,que aprendi muito, profissionalmente,tive oportunidadesde mostra minha capacidade,e semprempre , buscando aprender mas."
good,"A typical day at work was actually very hard and tiring.  We learned to work as a team and get the job done.  Although it was hardwork, because of the great camaraderie among co-workers, it made a typical day much easier."
good,I would like to see Coca-cola be more aggressive with customers and not allow them to take advantage of cokes costumer service.  Coke strives to take care of the customers and they tend to take advantage of that.
good,"Ótimo ambiente de trabalho, empresa que se preocupa com o desenvolvimento profissional do funcionário, proporciona cursos e treinamentos profissionalizantes"
good,"Coca-Cola is a place where you can learn not only about your function but be exposed to other functions all while doing it in a fun, relaxing culture."
good,"Great place to work strong brand very demanding"
good,"Great company, good team but dynamic nature of business is prompting leadership and strategy changes that are resulting in challenges. Hardest part is to align to new advancements while keeping status quo."
good,"a company that is not limited to provide security and provide equipment to the worker, market leader of easy sale, with a portfolio of clients already established by the company."
good,"Overall, I found this job to be pretty cool.  Management was not bad and the people were friendly.  I felt the compensation was fair.  Typical day on the job was steady, but not excessive."
good,"El puesto constaba con innumerables tareas , que seguìan los lineamientos de la Empresa."
good,Not a real stressful job but physical demanding. Decent pay for the work you do. You do work holidays and weekends with exception of Christmas. This is a job for a younger person.
good,Great managers.great vacation.Not very stressful. Work life balance.Encouragement to advance in career.Great vacation given to employees but vacation does not roll over.
good,Now this is a good job as a matter fact one of the best I've had. Goid pay giid off day good benefits nand all. You can even buy into stock. If it wasn't for relocation I would probably still tjere
good,"Competitive work environment including customers. Keeping current customers happy with pricing wars , while trying to gain competitor brands customers using perks to entice them to switch."
good,Being around that environment helped to understand the need of producing good beverages for customers and client that company had. And I was promoted twice.
good,The contact center in Tulsa is a vibrant and diverse workforce.  Some of the most talented people I have ever worked with are employed there.  Leadership creates a environment that you feel free to express opinions and open to bringing new ideas to the table.  The company is reorganizing CCR and that has led to lay offs.  The current state of the business has little job security which makes for a stressful environment.
good,"Uma empresa que abril as portas e mim deu oportunidade de crescimento profissional e pessoal."
good,"Dinâmico, boa eloquente, muito inteligente, pro ativo"
good,"Its a great work experience and pays very well, however there a lot of changes in the sparklyn soda industry and its shuffling a lot of decisions and  departments."
good,"its a great place to work at but it is badly managed."
good,"Empresa com grande nome no cenario nacional ,boaa de se trabalhar mas que precisa de alguns ajustes tecnicos, mas uma empresa cumpridora de seus deveres"
good,"During my internship there was many opportunities to learn various tasks involved with the company. This allowed for my skills that I had acquired during school to be sharpened. Overall, the job was a great experience builder."
good,Great all arounfd love the employee engagement week got to experience the full range of coke products. The boss were more engaged with employees always out on the floor helping
good,"It was nice to work a same company almost for 7 years"
good,"Mostly work to yourself.  Expected to maintain a decent work pace no matter what circumstances you run into.  Not an extremely hard job, but definitely takes its toll on your body over an extended period of time.  Good pay, vacation, and benefits.  Decent hours in terms of quantity, although time of day isn't my cup of tea.  Start at 4 a.m. at your first account which may or may not be near your home.  Get paid mileage between stops, but not to and from home.  Done when job is complete average 8 hrs/day, but not very consistent.  One day I may work 12 hrs and only 5 or 6 the next.  Days off depend on seniority (bid for days off generally start with Tues/Wed or Wed/Thurs) as well as vacation time, overtime, etc.  Pay is same for new hire as it is for a 15 year veteran.  Working environment depends on your route and whether or not you can get along with management and employees at each account.  Coca-Cola management can sometimes seem harsh, but mostly leave you alone if you are doing your job with the exception of regular required surveys."
good,"Coca Cola was an interesting and challenging place to work at. A lot was asked of the sales team ,but a lot of tools were given as well. I spent my days driving from account to account making replenishment orders, pushing new products and displays. The management team was engaging and had high expectations of their team. The hardest part of being a sales representative was hitting quotas during tight economic times, but I enjoyed working with my customers to help them grow their business despite a trendline of decline."
good,"Merchandisers work alone. There is often more work to do than time to do it. You are required to stay until your workload is complete, which can often take 10-12 hours."
good,Coca Cola is a great company to start a career with. They have several different departments which gives you great opportunities for advancement. Good benefits as well.
good,Mangers dont keep people responsible and on task and let others pick up peoples slack with no consequences. You have to stay after your off time to finish everything for multiple hours.
good,Although it can be competitive the company is fair and balanced when opportunities become available to the employees. The benefits are exceptional. overall good company
good,"This place is very good to work "
good,"it is friendly working company, i have learn a lot from working for this company, management team is  great, most enjoyable part of the job is to work on different project."
good,"This was a great part-time job experience and it allows you to interact with people, but the work can be very strenuous on the body. Management was great and very helpful as well"
good,Fast paced environment that needed to have newer automation for machine improvements. Employees worked well together and wanted to do a good job but were limited by their old equipment.

good,"the job is good and you can make it a career, when you low person on the list you get the worst job that nobody likes. people come and go so if you low person you might be the low person for awhile."
good,"A typical day normally involved me having a meeting in the morning with a brief catch up as to what we're doing today (SCRUM). Then mostly code and or troubleshoot plant problems. Further improved my Java skills in my position, learned VB, improved on SQL by managing the production database, learned a bit about Java android development. The people were great and so was the environment in which you learned and the company culture lives to its name."
good,"great place to work and learn, great people to work with, work culture is awesome, i interned for supply chain management optimization the HOD for this department was for sure the coolest guy in the company. he taught the very nuances of the supply chain management in aa very good way, questions were always welcomed followed with detailed answers. overall a great experience."
good,"Na realidade fui estagiario durante o curso de almoxarifado, durante o curso de 12 meses aprendi grande parte sobre EPI's, lojistica, compra vendas, emissao de notas, amazenamentos de mercadorias,  a direçao sempre pontual com os funcionarios, otimos companheiros de trabalho, a parte que tive alguma dificuldade foi como aplicar o diagrama de ishikawa, a parte pratica do estagio era a mais agradavel"
good,"Es una empresa enfocada al cliente, aprendi que el trabajo en equipo es fundamental, ya que los objetivos y metas de la organizacion se logran mediante la interrelacion de todas las areas, las personas se preocupan por los demas, la parte complicada de esta empresa es que no esta equilibrado el tiempo laborar y el personal, la mayoria de las personas laboran entre 10 y 12 hrs, diarias."

good,I was given a lot of freedom at this company to make my own decisions.  The management team was always there to help and brought us together as a cohesive unit.
good,"The days are long but everything gets done.The people were team players and always met our goals each work day.Supervisors work with you and with family matters, it was nice to have that support."

good,"It is a virtual team job with a lot of learning opportunity. chance of leading on virtual environment. A lot of data analysis, good time management skills required."
good,"The Coca Cola Company has many challenges to meet our customers needs, but that is what makes the daily grind so much fun.  Great support system at the corporate level."
good,"as an intern, the typical day was the day I was selected to lead the team of student to do time study on a new installed equipment, during that time I learned to be strong and assertive, manage to defend the purpose of the study as a result I was requested to assist another branch for a week on the same study after the completion of the contract. most enjoyable part of the job was the exposure to all areas of manufacturing and planning"

good,This was a fun job to have that paid well. It was a productive job as well as we were always working to achieve one main goal and that was to build our certain amount of tickets or cases. Sometimes we would have 12 hour days but most of the time was our normal 10.

Thursday we have to build up drink loads for 2 Walmarts & a Food Lion.  The most enjoyable part is the times I travel out of the warehouse and the coworkers I work with"
good,"i delivered 5 to 6 hundred cases daily to various costumers,challenges included weather conditions,traffic,and a complicated time sensitive schedule"
good,While working at Coca-Cola Refreshments you are able to work cross-functionally with many different facets of the business. With this type of access and encouraged collaboration the EEO is able to have a more clearly defined and nontraditional career path. The more facets of the business you are exposed to the more valuable you are as an asset to CCR.
good,I am thankful for the opportunities I had while at the company and for the privilege of working with so many talented individuals.
good,Company treats it employees well and has great benefits. Hard to advance though and they often pass up internal candidates for external.
good,Your day starts at an early 5:30 am and ends whenever you finish your designated stores. This job taught me the importance of being prompt and very well organized as management continuously was pressing for product rotation and quickness and quality in every outlet. The most difficult part of this job would have to be the early start time and the inconsistency of a end time. The best part of the job would have to be the freedom of working on my own.

good,Making sure the invoices are accurate and the correct amount of product was distributed to our stores and other locations
good,"Great place to start you Career in the Beverage Industry. Coca-Cola provides great benefits and compensation. It strives itself on beverage innovations, sales, and new technology to grow the brands."

good,Dan muchos cursos y la cultura hacia un buen resultado el desarrollo personal y laboral hacen de ti un mejor supervisor que refleja su preparación en su área de trabajo y en su personal a cargo
good,Empresa de grande porte e com qualidade de vida dos colaboradores
good,I have worked with Coca Cola for almost 8 years and have only good memories to share with anyone. It is a great place to work for . What I personally learnt was if you love what you do and believe in yourself you can achieve your goals no matter how hard it is. Management supported flex work hours and encouraged staff to have a work/life balance. I still keep in touch with my co-workers which means they were great to work with.
good,"In my job function everyday was, ""never a dull moment"". I learned that with initiative one could expand opportunities on the job and more latitude given.Upper Management was a revolving door so one gets used to new bosses with ""NEW IDEAS"" regularly instituting their plan of action.

The warehouse is extremly large with hundreds of  different types of beverages so, every day was a learning experienceas far as remembering and locating different types beverages that you need to build and complete your orders properly. Management was a crucial element as far letting you no if we were out of stock or, if we were working overtime that day or, if the product was out dated and things of that nature. All of my co-workers got along well with each other and most deffinetly worked as a team. The hardest part of the job was the constant bending and lifting because liquids are very heavy and they came in many different sizes and packages.

My job gave me the skills to operate heavy machinery also I got to meet a lot of different people who gave me respect to know who I am. The hardest part of my job was to keep up with everybody else's pace because of the way the system worked, for example if I had a pallet that was to go in third in the truck and people had pallets that had to go in first or second I would have to wait for the other people to be done with their order before I could set it in there. It made it difficult because the docks were small and people would move fast picking their orders so the dock would pile up with pallets full of product, and can't put it in your because someone else was moving to slow. The most enjoyable part of my job was that no one bothered me unless they were asking a question or they wanted to know how I  was doing."

During this talk the individual would be made aware of the deals that are in place, what products they should be ordering, and if any new products the company is selling they should be purchasing.

The pay was good and the benefits were just as good, even for a part time employee like myself."
good,"Typically day for me was to receive my daily work schedule on my blackberry. Reaching the first location was usually closed so I clocked in on my blackberry and then went to locate a manager or someone to let me in. I then walked the store taking notes on what was needed and where it was needed as far as coke products. I then proceeded to the backroom where our merchandise was located and gather what I needed to fill the shelves, while in the backroom I would check in with the receiving clerk so that they knew that there was a Coca-Cola representative in the building and that products were being moved.

good,"I would wake up and drive to my first store and clock in there, i would then walk the store to see if there is and displays of product and coolers and anything that needs to be filled. I would walk to the back room and see what i have for product, make a list of what i need and fill the shelves with it. After i am done filling and rotating all the product i will clean the back room and condense pallets, keep all product organized and easy to work the next day. I have learned responsibility and organization skills and helping customers with anything they need, if they need something off the shelves i will get it for them or if there is something that we don't have product wise i will contact my account manager and ask them to send some in for the customer. I get along great with my co-workers we help each other out if we need it. The hardest part of my job is all the lifting and pulling pallets because some of the pallets can weigh up to at least 200 lbs and that puts a lot of ware and tear and your back and legs and then lifting the cases of pop can put ware and tear on your shoulders and sometimes the days can be pretty long especially during the holidays.

I learned to manage my time when I am doing the tasks, to start with the most important to less important. I experienced that you don't need to be harsh  in order to be a good manager/leader you only need to have good listening skills. You must think on your feet and must be able to solve problems without favoritism.The hardest part of the work is when you have to speak with the person who don't understand the languages that you can be able to speak, like the other day there was a guy who entered at the resource centre and he was a Venda speaking guy and there was no Venda speaking person in my colleagues it was very difficult the guy could not speak nor understand English language, he needed help desperately and I was unable give help and I ended up blaming my self for not being able to speak all South African languages and foreign languages. The most enjoyable part is when you see some one you helped succeed."

good,great company to work for and training was provided and team work and you get support and they review you performance and offer medical aid to all employees
good,"Coca Cola started off bad in my experience. They hired me part-time and worked me more than the full timers. So that means I didn't get all the things that comes with full time, so that meant 2-3$ less, no health of dental, did get 401k though. When your part time, you don't get your own route, so that means you have to fill in on other routes, which means you don't know where you will have to work until the week of, and no week is ever the same. I didn't mind because I use to make tons on mileage reimbursement, but It felt more like I was being taken advantage of when I had to drive 2 hours cross state. In Louisville KY, they have no Union which means seniority doesn't factor in to promotions, but it means they can hire you part time at a lower rate with out insurances and still work you 50+ hours, so you can be promoted easily if you work hard but they really take advantage of the fact that they're are no Unions behind the workers and they also treat you horribly sometimes because of it. My advice is to work under the Union rather than not because you have job security and fairness, and without the Union there is no job security and they just outright take advantage of you even though the pay is still good in my opinion. Then secondly is your route location. Some routes are slower paced than others, cleaner than others, tougher than others when it comes to sales. Like some routes could have stores where your putting 600-800 cases out at each stop, then another you might only put 300-400 out at each stop, so just hope your route isn't near malls, or extremely popular areas"

Enquanto aos meus colegas de trabalho, sempre me relacionei super bem, tenho as amizades até hoje.

good,No Family time no life and Back breaking work! Oh ya and no Respect from upper management!
good,"Working for Coca-Cola you'd think as an industry leader in beverage the work culture and attitude would match it's unrivaled reputation for delivering one of the best products in the world. Unfortunately that was not the case. I was shocked and dismayed by how management treated successful professionals like high school dropouts and trash. I was in the Military with a strict set of skills to prepare me for civilian life. I graduated from a top notch school and brought years of experience working in the technical industry. I would definitely not recommend Coke to anyone. The break room is loud and distasteful with foul language and a very low quality of human resources that I would be very scared to be around if it weren't under strict surveillance. Speaking of which using the bathroom always brought fearful thoughts of a mugging or worse. Absolute slave work, as you attempt to navigate your professional up bringing you are brought downward quickly by work issued to you that is insulting as a professional in your field. Everyone is scared to sit, rest, or even breath for a minute due to Managements power and grasp on all who walk the floor. Any manager at any time can fire for no reason. Union job so you do have say but we all know the Union works close knit with Management to ensure they are happy too. Oh and don't think you will have time for family as weekend work isn't optional although they skirt tail it to be, management will warn and threaten about not showing up for overtime."

good,Typical day starts with punching in.   Once your on the clock you are on the move.  Most things are repetitive and once you learn each step its like riding a bike.  Management is all over the map.  The hardest part is also the most enjoyable.  Most positions at the company you have little supervision.  Your manager is who will make this enjoyable if he/she trust you its a great place to work.  If they don't you are constantly explaining what you are doing and have to document your every step.

good,"Part of the reason I love this job so much…there’s no such thing as a typical day! One day, I could be spending half the day arranging meetings and the other half producing a report for my boss. The next day I could be working with global team members on a digital workshop conference agenda and arrangements. Everyday is different and a new learning experience... also if my boss is busy - i am busy with on demand jobs /if he is travelling - i take care of routine jobs like approvals / if he is on PTO - then i take care of prioritizing jobs to be completed on hour by hour basis once he resumes office..."

good,"the people that work here are awesome. however, the company lacks strategic planning and too many unknowns. there is no job security and that's the reason why people come here and just want to move on to another company where they have job security."
good,The company takes care of it's employees. Benefits are above average. Plenty of opportunities to advance. They have programs to train you for specific areas of the company to transfer to.
good,"Everyone is goal oriented."
good,"I'm just sad to see that many jobs had to be impacted to start operating under a new model and focus on other brands besides Coca-Cola.  I believe that we could have done the new work, with the same people but my opinion doesn't matter.  I believe they needed more money for marketing efforts for the other beverages.  It's a great place to work though."
good,Coca-Cola is a fantastic place to work. The Marketing aspect and enviroment is ever changing and keeps work exciting and challenging. If you love and believe in a Brand it is not exhausting work…it is a rewarding feeling to watch all aspects of a program you work on come to life and engage consumers.
good,Great place to work a lot of caring individuals with the passion to help and push people to succeed in work and life. On the production side you learn how to operate and trouble shoot complex machines. The machines can be troublesome at times but with a fast acting maintenance team they usually run smoothly. Management is always available to help with concerns. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was that though the production line worked as a team you still had room to be your own boss in away; provided you performed your job in a professional manner.

The ability to meet new people with all form of diversity such as character ,culture and work ethics broadened the way to meet new goals, handle new challenges and become a better person therefore improving in the objectives of the company and self life as a whole. The management board was helpful to new recruits and to anyone who needed help in any way such as during difficult moments when the targets had to be met and the possible seemed very impossible."

good,"a day as a MDM at Coke requires you to visit upwards of 12-15 customers per day to sell in innovation packages as well as increase the total volume and gross profit of Coca-Cola products in outlet.  You work almost solely out of your car and are alone most days.  Co-workers are great, and managers are usually tied up with conference calls or meetings that they are rarely available to meet or help with much without a long wait.  The hardest part of the job is trying to sell in a program or product without any point of sale materials or samples to use.  The best part of the job is the flexibility and the co-workers/customers i get to work with every day."
good,There was good opportunities and I was quickly promoted and given more responsibility. Co- workers were supportive of each other. I enjoyed working for this company.
good,"A typical day at work at Coca-Cola Refreshments is very quiet.  Due to the demanding high call volume, all staff have their own office with head phone sets where you can talk without disturbance and background noise. Phone calls and email contacts are around-the-clock services that are provided to customer until service is completed and customer is 100% satisfied.   Co-workers are courteous and very helpful in assisting with training. The hardest part of the job is utilizing  the stairs from first floor to the second floor.  The most enjoyable part of the job is that I have a wonderful supervisor who is professional but has an exceptionally down to earth personality. My supervisor separates business meetings from social assembly. I have NEVER had a supervisor that was pleasant and yet professional without looking down or judging the staff."
good,"Diariamente aprendia muitas coisas,desde o primeiro dia de trabalho até o último. Com certeza a melhor experiência de trabalho da minha vida.Todos os funcionários,desde a faxineira ao gerente,são extremamente agradáveis e amigos.

good,"I enjoyed very much my job duties managers were fair "
good,"Great company to work for, but the beverage industry appears to be in the decline. The Management seems stagnant and it is not the easiest process to move ahead in the company. Many people stay comfortable in their position and you must wait for them to die, retire, or move somewhere else."

Management was great for the most part, but as with any corporate job, there is always a few bad seeds. Loved the people I worked with, as we had a team work environment. Hardest part of the job was losing to Pepsi! Most enjoyable part of the job was winning over all competitors."

You know your responsibilities as an employee and your work load is pretty consistent with the exception of a few other duties. I learned how to pack cases, process orders as well as run multiple machines. The type of environment Coke offers makes the learning experience fun and well to work with others. The hardest part about the job job is staying on top of the machines, and keep them running smoothly throughout the shift. The most enjoyable part of working at Coke was the respect coworkers had for one another.

good,"Es hermoso, porque solo se trabaja fines de semanas, con una hora de almuerzo"

good,I enjoyed my time with Coca~Cola.  I moved and the distance was too great to be beneficial.  The only issue I experienced was in the department I started in.  It was operated by former Marines and they only wanted to promote former Marines.  College education meant nothing to these guys.

good,As an account manager you're in charge of a sales route of about 75-100 stores that you see weekly.

good,"I would travel around Brown county to various stores such as festival foods, Wal-Mart, and others. Once there I would walk around the store and make a list of what needs to be stocked. I would then organize the product to stock the shelves efficiently. I would typically go to three stores a day, visiting each twice. I greatly improved my organizational skills, as well as my overall health (stocking soda for 10-12 hrs a day was quite the workout). Although I only saw management once a week at most, we were constantly communicating via email and phone calls, and were able to assist me whenever I needed it. The same goes for my co-workers, as most of the time you were stocking by yourself, however you knew who everyone was and would easily get along. The hardest part of the job was to be up before dawn in order to stock shelves before the stores opened (or started their regular business). However, this was only an issue to begin with and after a while it was weird not to be up that early! The most enjoyable part was going from store to store and meeting the different people. After stocking at a store for a couple weeks you would build a relationship with some of the stores employees and would look forward to seeing them."

I meet with smaller groups of my staff during the middle of the week to troubleshoot any issues. For example, during a recent mid-week meeting, I noticed one team was a few days behind on a long-term project. I met with the team and, together, we came up with a strategy for increasing efficiency among the team. Along with constant interaction with my team, I also attend a weekly board meeting where I present my department’s progress to the executive board.

I was trained as a Field Service Technician, working on EVERY piece of Fountain; including all valves, carbonators, vending, ice-machine, merchandizing, refrigeration/repair and replace; just every piece of equipment Coca Cola had as an asset...Some of the best people I ever worked with, or under, including Management. Always went out of their way to help if a question arose about a piece of new equipment. I left there to go back to Oklahoma where I  was from, but found out that getting another job for Coca-Cola, with my skills and training, was a very hard thing to do.  It seemed the old adage, ""We're all Brothers at Coca-Cola"" was just that, an old saying.  I finally was hired by a Dr. Pepper Co, and was instantly made Service Supervisor.  Utilizing the working knowledge of how Coca-Cola U.S.A  and how they are ""picky"" about paperwork and all else I need not explain, I was able to use all my training to train all my Service Techs to CCUSA Standards and Practices.  That in itself was very fulfilling. Next, thru no fault of my own, I was made a Salesman. I was happy to make ""Salesman of the Year"" my second year, but, my heart was meant to be in the Service end of it all, and soon had my fill of the Sales end of the spectrum of the ""Mom and Pop Family owned"" part, so I  tried to go somewhere else and try to be another Service Tech for Coca-Cola, in the Okla. area.  I haven't succeeded in finding any Coca-Cola Franchise who needs me yet, but, I still bleed Red, and miss the excitement at 60 yrs. old...Anyone need"

good,This was a company founded on an excellent product that has grown at leaps and bounds for decades.  I enjoyed my time there and more importantly enjoyed the product we were all paid so well to produce and distribute.  This is a good company to retire from and one in which you will be able to be proud of you time being employed there and will have been able to perform a good job without being stifled due to some insecure brown nose boss thinking he can run the show for his own benefit until retirement.  There are avenues of ways to correct an injustice and allow an employee to do his/her job to the best of their ability.
good,Just do your part and everything will be fine the job was really laid back and comfortable if I ever went back I would love to come back and work with the company.

good,"I loved my job, my bosses, and the hours and pay. But when the company went through a buy out and was purchased by Coca-Cola Consolidated, everything went down hill. Lies were told from the higher ups and trickled down to the dirty workers that made hourly. Benefits and PTOs were slashed, full change of uniform regulations, less worry about the employee and more worry about the daily dollar lead to a fallout between myself and my passion for the position. I miss my friends but I fortunately didn’t have the time vested as others had and that let me to be able to “exit without injury” for lack of better metaphor."

Participativos e interessados em torna-lo cada vez melhor. Aprendizado diário com colegas que se tornam parceiros diários para que o trabalho em conjunto flua com maior presteza, cuidado e paixão pelo que se faz. Lidar com pessoas porém é entender que a solução não se encaixa da mesma maneira para todos. Por isso o uso de protocolos exige uma acuidade maior na atenção ao cliente, visto de uma forma abrangente. Dessa forma, sentir que o trabalho está sendo feito de forma qualitativa e com resultados inerente a proposta de trabalho, nos fornece a maior satisfação em trabalhar numa grande CIA.

good,"Worked at this company for 9 years. Started out at the bottom with this company as a summer helper. The company helped me obtain my Class B CDL and offered me a full time position. I held various positions with this company that ranged from Route Delivery Driver, Bulk Merchandiser, Bulk Delivery Driver and finally a Foutain Install Technician. My Co-Workers were great. I did have one manager that had some integrity issues and questionable leadership. This was not a reflection of the company but of the individual that I worked under. I learned after I moved on that the company has replaced this person so they do take action and follow a professional process for addressing these issues. The hardest part of my job was that for all the great things the company had, there were areas that seemed like you needed to be a part of the certain crowd to get promoted. Again, this is my perception of what I felt but I have known a few of my former co-workers who have moved onto bigger roles with the company!"
