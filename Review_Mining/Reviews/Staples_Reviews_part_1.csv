rating,review
bad,"typical day is only sales driven "
bad,"If you aren't putting your hand on the staples code and swearing by it every morning, then you aren't a fit for the company. The workload is much MUCH too high for the pay, and management is almost inconsolably dysfunctional."
bad,"I hated working there the hours were outlandish, no one cared what your health was, I always had to stay late on nights I had college classes , we were always understaffed"
bad,Staples demands employees do many things that are not typically required of minimum wage jobs.  The culture is one of punishment not praise and the pay is very low.
bad,This job made it so hard for me to wake up and want to go. people who worked then were Spanish and treated blacks like we were worth nothing. But they was very organized with the materials.
bad,Don’t work here they don’t care about you and only numbers. Pay sucks and benefits are ok. Lots of hours and no recognition for doing a good job. Loss proven toon tries to find anything to fire u.
bad,"Managers dont care about you. You're just a number to them. They play favorites. If you dont kiss butt, they treat you bad. They're very disorganized, sloppy,hire idiots."
bad,"Hast‘n Blüs‘chen offen, steht die Türe offen! "
bad,This place was very bad ☹️ they didn't care for their employees they had bad management and horrible support staff they blamed the employees for everything even if it was a high level management task
bad,"The management is unfair to sales associates , very understaff but not enough hours to give . They have told other people to quit there second jobs and promise hours which was fail to be given . They play this role of favoritism. I’m pregnant and I recently quit because the manager failed to understand what was needed. I felt like I was being bullied by the gm but there are people that are related to the operation supervisor which is nepotism because they could do whatever they want without getting in trouble"
bad,Company is geared towards milking customers for all that they've got. High turnover rate amongst overworked and underpaid employees. Not given the hours I was promised. No shifts for two weeks and am on the verge of quitting.
bad,"i worked there for over 6 months and ended up getting terminated unfairly due to poor management and corporate favoritism. i had more stress working for this company than it was worth. save yourself, work ANYWHERE else."
bad,"Since I started at Staples, they have followed my availability once. I am a full time student with a long drive, and they are aware of this. However, I always end up punching out at 11 pm or 12 am. My shift ends at 10 pm (even though I asked them to change in to 9:30 pm). I can never find a manager when I need one, and some of the managers don't do all their work. Closing the store is a disaster. I will finish my work an hour after the store closes while my managers take 2-3 hours. I am struggling between my school and work life. I have brought this up to them several times but they never schedule enough people to close the store properly. This job has defiantly been a challenge for me."
bad,Managers don't care if you have a family the only one that did no longer works there they do not value there employees. Very horrible place to work. Didn't get breaks till the end of it
bad,"District manager was one of the most horrible people I have ever met. There was so much turmoil and turnover at the store I was at, it made everyone stressed out and all the DM could worry about is numbers"
bad,"When I first started working at Staples I enjoyed the first month or two, but after a while I was over worked, underpaid, and taken advance of in different departments and by managers. Don’t get me wrong, some managers were okay (2 of 6) but the rest treated the job as if it was a high school social job. Not treating employees with respect or dignity. Frequently talking bad about employees. They are not sympathetic towards employees who were having either a hard time at work or at home and had to take time off work. Very hard to take days off work, and when you requested they were usually taking weeks if not months to either approve you or tell you at the last second you cannot. I do NOT recommend working here! I left Staples because of the inappropriate actions of the managers, specifically two. They caused me to leave the work feeling useless and upset. If you wish to work here I wish you luck."
bad,"A toxic workplace overall. The company practices bullying and is condescending to all. Concepts of team are discouraged, patronage through fear is encouraged."
bad,This was a very them against us clique. Them as the 10 managers. Us as the 6 associates.  No training. No chance for advancement. Not many people make it 90 days there.
bad,I liked my fellow associates but the manager I worked under made life a living nightmare. She had a superiority complex concerning the girls she was in charge of and she lacked general empathy when it came to anyone who was sick or had children.
bad,short breaks if you ask. Must sell company credit card or they make note of it. Management will only intervene if you can track them down. constant calls that are not for your department.
bad,"Lack of care for associates, very poor management and lack of training. Long hours, no work like balance, poor communication. Mediocre pay for the pressure and work you do......"
bad,"Worst management ever!!!! Unrealistic sales goals, they micromanage hardcore, each week they think of new tasks and goals that are now “top priority”. With unemployment so low, you really shouldn’t have to settle on such a bad company."
bad,"Staples had been difficult for all the jobs I have worked for. Although there was support from managers, supervisors of the copy centre not approachable. They always had problems understanding a person. They do not treat employees properly. Staples needs to switch its copy centre supervisors and hire better people with empathy. People working there deserve respect. This is on top of all the filth people have to take from the annoying customers because they hire less production team to produce work, which means people at the front are answerable to the customers, and not the production team that had to get work done because they are always short-staffed. This is because of the way people are treated at the copy centre at Staples. Many people just quit their jobs due to lack of respect, lack of pay and lack of appreciation for the amount of work there is."
bad,The management is very unprofessional. Other than that the work is very fast paced and very easy to achieve goals needed to be met by the company but to move or it to advance is like pulling teeth they preach on how seniority is the most important but in yet do not go off their own rules and or slash policies. management is very unorganized and don't even know what is going on in their own facility. Call ins are on the daily because people do not want to be there and or slash hate the work environment.
bad,If you love yourself don’t work here. Very unprofessional and very rude managers. No matter how bad you need employment do yourself a favor and don’t choose this place.
bad,"The environment is not fun just people fighting. The sales manager thinks he controls everything and could care less about you. He’s a rude and the reason many people have quit. If your a woman don’t expect him to listen to you, because he’s a man and he’s right. If it wasn’t for my own supervisor in the department I worked in I don’t think I would have lasted as long, she was one of my favorite person to work with. But I still had to watch her deal with his “woman are low class” attitude. As for the general manager we have had 3 in the last 2 years. All of them just let everything go on. Then when it hits a peak acted like it was a surprise. Don’t waste your time at Staples they just keep hurting their own business."
bad,Badplace to work. You'll work your but off for years and get nothing in return. Staples is stingy on their raises and who they give promotions to. Their morals are all sorts of wack. The managers don't know what their doing. They let customers walk out with free print orders just because their upset about one small thing. Don't even bother
bad,"Even though Staples gives you opportunity to grow, Staples does not care about employee needs and HR works with company needs not employee. Its a very stressful and hostile environment and would not recommend to anyone."
bad,Instead of saying job well done . They pick and pick until they can find anything to focus negativity on. No matter how well you do it is never good enough.
bad,"DM didn't have an idea of how to maintain #-4 stores within his district and lost many managers at my specific location within my 13 months time there. With the Current General Manager routinely cussing at me over text messages and coercing me to try to work unscheduled hours, dis agreed upon hours, and constant thought I owed him my whole life and was there to work for everyone since the staffing was depleted due to the poor wages in the region and poor management structure from the DM and Store GM."
bad,I commute two and a half hours round trip to work and and seeking work closer to home. My manager is one of my best friends and makes the day go by very quick but every other day is daunting and stressful with unattainable sales goals.
bad,Never received proper training for my role. I was forced to learn from scratch with no prior knowledge with no help from management after repeatedly asking and begging so i could properly do my job. While not being trained and doing my weekly/daily duties i was reprimanded severely for not doing things properly after i begged to be trained. Sometimes i would be forced to juggle between all 5 departments with very little prior knowledge
bad,Awful work environment. No Stability in job. The wrongful are praised and management turns a blind eye if sales are up. Overall a bad experience and would not recommend.
bad,"The company is all numbers oriented has no care about family and work life balance "
bad,Extremely stressful situations arise during back to school time that are not worth the pay at all. Poor management made all the difference in my experience.
bad,"Immature management team. If you work hard you will be abused. If you show up and do nothing. You are favored.  There is no accountability for jobs done wrong. Too many people on drugs, and a lot of employee theft."
bad,"I experienced discrimination and hatred from Staples. The store I was at was disorganized and OSHA violations out the wazoo. Unprofessional and open hostility between coworkers and management. I also was never more then 2 days off. Other workers of a different group would get 3 days...hmmm??? Also why do I have to be a cashier when I have made it very clear I do not want to be in that position and will not do it to the best of my ability? Makes no dang sense to me. Also we would work 9 hours but only get a 30 minute lunch and a 15 minute break. That's OSHA violation my friend. Other than that, we were not allowed off the floor."
bad,"People gossip about you right where you can hear them.  Poor management and they don't train you to their procedures and they have worst attitudes than the customers.  The locations I work both were smelly in the employee lounge and in the Print section paper all over the place and dirty trash buckets.  People smelling like weed, underarms and bad breathe."
bad,"the managers are not very skilled. they belittle their employees. do not give breaks according to state laws. gossip to employees about other employees and yell at each other in front of employees. their hr is useless and switches every few months, so they never know how to handle situations."
bad,"Everything about this job sucked. The pay, the coworkers it was slow and I hated the bosses. Literally fired over the shoes I was wearing. Waste of my time"
bad,"This job is very demanding and your superiors expect the most from you and don't even say thank you, or good job. I can say I learned a lot about the Print & Marketing industry, but I could've did without all the stress from management, coworkers, and customers. Staple's customers are the WORST."
bad,"days were slow, the management was a joke, "
bad,"Customer service was not a priority. "
bad,"Less than slave wages,but lots of work.Alot of lifting,but no back braces,etc."
bad,This place is horrible to work at. Threatened to fire me every other day. I was forced to take stress leave after 4 months of working tghere and that was for 18 months. These people dont care about their employees. Absolutely horrible experience.
bad,Great hold over job but no future in this company. Management gives impression that company won't exist long. Great place for those in college needing flexibility.
bad,"A typical day for me was coming in at 4-5 PM, finishing any work that needed to be done on computers and then helping customers find what they needed."
bad,I worked at staples for almost 5 years then a new Gm Came and Turnt Everything Around He got rid of the sales manager because he was jealous of him he wanted to be in control that job was a great place to work til he Came then everyone left he treated you very cruel and don’t try calling Hr because they don’t care be aware he been with staples for 20 years
bad,"staples has the unfortunate placement of being right off the interstate and also being in a space too small to accommodate an adequate number of staff. hired to be a tech sales associate my duties should have been selling computers and printers and taking in customers who had problems with existing hardware, but i often found myself doing the job of three other people, stoking the shelves, helping other customers find something in the store as well as unload pallets of new merchandise. the atmosphere was not pleasant the management ""team"" was largely inconsistent and sometimes fired people for their mistake (I.E. scheduling someone outside their availability and getting upset when said person didnt show up.) as a supplement for income staples is not a good part time job, unless you like being overworked and underpaid."
bad,"DO NOT waste your time. Company will go under within the next 2 years. Starting fiscal year 2020 they will be closing a minimum 50% of their locations."
bad,"Management is terrified Sycamore, the private equity firm that bought Staples, is going to close down various departments so they put incredible pressure on workers to produce. The fear is palpable at HQ and it makes it very, very stressful."
bad,there is no food they all for them self. not enough workers. someone always late or calling out. no one does the work properly. the staff thinks they all managers. awful.
bad,"As a manager at Staples for the last few years, I realized I make far less money than the competition. The company changes it's mind on direction every few weeks. Little to no benefits, with the exception of those you choose to pay for, and it costs more than it's worth. Earning PTO is okay, using PTO is near impossible with the amount of turnover, and it is not paid out if not used."
bad,"Poor management the store is hot all summer, cold all winter the bathrooms are dirty. The customer service is bad. Employees are lazy and racist. Dirty"
bad,They sucks no professional very not organized horrible managers not good environment to work for and not go anywhere pick this company and if u live no
bad,"All I can say is, they drive sales metrics, don't provide you with the tools to succeed,  don't have adequate stock or competitive products (computers, cell phones), and don't want to pay or promote you. I did more work than my GM, who consistently found fault w me."
bad,Intense; Stressful; Requires keen knowledge of computer processes. Excellent training program. High employee turnover. Tethered to rigid time clock management.
bad,Unsanitary working conditions with poor management and even worse work life balance on top of that schedules are inconstant with a small 14 hour a week maximum
bad,I just started last week. I recently hurt my back. I tolerated the pain and still went to work. GM told me I'm fired to protect the company. Jerk!!!!!
bad,"worst company ever, corporate doesn’t care about employees, management can’t support employees without corporates help. not enough staff to run the store."
bad,Working at Staples is an OK job. You don't want to stay here for the long run. To be promoted you'll have to be shady with pitching reward accounts and more accounts. Some stores have horrid management. Not all. Just some. No incentives to go for more sales of protections places and credit cards.
bad,"If I could give someone advice on working at Staples, primarily Print and Marketing, I would tell you to run the other way! I was there for 4 months and hated it. They are disrespectful, rude, and unappreciative. It was said about me that I didn't know how to do my job because I called for backup in my department. I never had a second person on my shift. You are expected to make work you life, and not granted time off. I told them I couldn't work Sundays and I maybe got off 5 in the entirety of working for the company. The only thing keeping me coming back were the other associates. Nothing else was worth my time, effort, or tears."
bad,No backbone in management staff.  They would rather see you go before defending any positive attributes to colleagues.  Doesn't matter the department you work at.  it's all the same.  I highly recommend not working here
bad,"Some stinky manager came do do things ""right"" in IDAHO FALLS.  He was very abusive and get  you fired over gossiping from  snakes and lies from those snakes.  The do NOT let u go to the bathroom because u waste too much time or drink water..  STAY AWAY from this abusive  slavery place.."
bad,So you have to hit your goal every two weeks for able to have the job. The job is easy but is har when you have to hit your goal the carts can be bad. And they have favoritism there people that been there for a year a never hit they goal but I was there for not even a Year and close to my goal. They hella petty you have to be a snitch to have favoritism
bad,"too much drama"
bad,Worked for the company for almost 2 years. Went thru 2 general managers 3 district managers. I started in the print department and then got moved to inventory specialist when the current one went on leave. Spent the next year doing manager duties not my job. Was responsible for cash office being the onlyopener every day.
bad,"Worst place ever , clicks , Manager is a back stabber. Throws everyone under the bus . Has a Mean Woman’s Club . President, Vice , Secretary, and they will bad mouth and throw people under the bus . Let President tries to get people in trouble every day.Really tired of games ."
bad,"Coworkers were great, but one member of management would give you a long list of things to do and just leave you to it. The list would frequently be filled with difficult tasks and he hated to be asked for any kind of help. Another manager stole from me."
bad,this is a job you get just to start off and gain experience. it is not a place where you want to stay and make a career out of this place. staples is a faced paced environment and you need to have next level patience to work here.
bad,"My Sales manager conducts personal business during his shifts he takes multiple breaks a day and often shows up hours late to work with absolutely no repercussions I am overly pressured to sell and sign people up for rewards on a daily basis to the point I fear losing my job if I fall short of the overly high expectations I have been verbally harassed by my general manager that has said things to me that I rather not repeat she's made people cry honestly The survey system is broken if "
bad,"I’ve been at staples for 3 years and I’m so tired of it. Management is a mess, associates never stay. There is no organization, the whole store is constantly falling apart. I never get a break since I’m the only print and marketing associate available."
bad,"Just all-around not a great environment to work in. I went there for production experience but my education seem to threaten my supervisor. I would do what I could to help the customers and be friendly and professional, I was told by my manager to stop being nice to those people. She had a few negative comments to make about certain customers. It was time to move on cuz I just was not learning what I expected to learn."
bad,i worked staples FC and they treated not fair for everyone employer. Manager was not professor role to us employers. also boss gave more pressure to employee
bad,"Toen ik bij Staples in Tilburg solliciteerde had ik aangegeven dat ik lichamelijke klachten had. Toen de dag daar was dat ik niet kon werken vanwege deze klachten, hebben ze me op staande voet ontslagen. Ik zal nooit meer vergeten dat ik zo aan de kant ben gezet door Staples in Tilburg. Nu heet de vestiging Office Center met hetzelfde personeel. 1 tip, NIET SOLLICITEREN!"
bad,"It wasnt bad when I started, but I quickly learned that upper management was terrible, ridiculous demands, no support in tough situations. My managers were always stressed because the people above them never cared to offer any assistance. WIll never go back."
bad,A typical day at work is stocking paper and paper related products and then selling it to people.  I learned how the Staples team tricks people into buying unnecessary products/warranties.  Management is completely checked out. The job is not hard and also not enjoyable.  Staples cultivates dishonest practices through deceitful methods of sales antics.
bad,"Horrible hours. Horrible management. Horrible pay. You will only get gold hours and be treated with respect IF the managers like you. If they do not like you they will disrespect you and treat you like garbage. They pick and chose who they like. The company cares about nothing but profit. They do not care for their employees. If you have a choice, don’t chose staples"
bad,"If you want to be overworked with minimum pay then this is the place for you. They will bully you until you quit if they have no reason to fire you and if you make a complaint, they will tell you to quit if you are that unhappy rather than deal with the issue at hand.  In addition one of the managers always snaps their figures at you, puts their hands in your face mid conversation and screams at you from across the store. They are the most selfish management team and they don't care about the well being of the workers but only how good they look on paper."
bad,Was promised 6 - 12 month contract with possibility of extension or full-time.  Accounting bureaucrats at Staples don't give a rip about people.  I was fired with no reason given after less than 4 weeks time and walked to the door.
bad,"The company is not managed properly, and the store manager was even hiring people based on personal intimate relations. It was disturbing. Never mind the fact that the supervisors weren't monitored by the GM and they're allowed to basically treat the employees with any disrespect they so as much desire. I could go on and on about how horrible the job was. If you're gonna apply and looking for a job, don't apply to this one."
bad,"I imagine that Staples as a whole, and stores in other towns, may function well and be a welcoming work enviorment. The Staples in Waycross is not somewhere I would suggest working. The managment is not cordinated and the goals they ask of Sales Associates are unachievable. Not one of my coworkers were enthusiastic about their jobs. It was a frustraiting environment that I would not recamend."
bad,"I was a Sales Manager for 2 years and it was not a great experience. You will be held to sales metrics that are unrealistic and be forced to sell products that are literally snake oil. I watched people get fired manipulating sales numbers. They were good people that felt obligated to do it to help out their store, the company and avoid being fired. The culture is beyond toxic and I would avoid it at all costs. The threat of your store being closed is real and it is used as a scare tactic that results in unethical behavior at all levels. "
bad,"this job does not pay well! Managers talk to you like trash , short of staff , sometimes no lunch break! Worked here for two years , gave them my all , just for them to mess up my W2 for the year 2018 and received a $31 income tax check due to an ""issue."" I decided to quite because I never received a check that was more than $250 here."
bad,The Print/ Marketing department at the Staples in Morehead City is a stressful enviroment and a terible place to work.  The Supervisor creates caos and then gets mad at her associates when they can't clean up her mess as quickly and she would like.
bad,"I worked here from June till November during that time all the tech staff quit along with most of the cashiers and 2 out of 3 of the managers. I was over worked, underpaid, and unappreciated. They promised me a flexible schedule for my kids which they did not uphold. They refused to help me with time off requests no matter how much I asked."
bad,"I wound not recommend Savannah area Staples for anyone that has to provide for a family. Particularly, the Abercorn St. location... Management is horrible with a very high turnover rate. Horrible hours and sales goals are unrealistic to say the least..."
bad,Sometimes you get overworked. A typical day includes always restocking and cashiering. They let you work on your own. The hardest part of the job would be standing all day but you get used to it.
bad,This has been the only organization I've ever worked for to blatantly lie to me in an interview.  Work life balance was disregarded and the pressure to hit targets was absurd.
bad,Worst job I ever had. The higher ups could care less about you. Salaries employees were slaves until they were sued. Lots of unethical practices went on with management.
bad,The jobs I held at Staples were of vital importance to my career development and really helped me advance my career and helped me move on to better things. I had a great manager that really cared and helped me. The company isn't that great though and benefits and pay aren't optimal. You also get very over worked and a lot is expected from you.
bad,This is a dying company grasping at whatever it can to stay open. That is why there is only 1 in Austin. The sales metrics are always changing and what they have you push is ridiculous. The pay is not good and they refuse to change but still have overly high expectations of you. I wouldn't work here again and I don't advise it.
bad,"The worst management I have ever experienced. "
bad,very stressful. management was very mean and rude. customers were very rude and talked down to you as if they are better than you i would never recommend this job to anyone!
bad,"I really don't have time to relate the travesty that has been my last two years working for this establishment. Sorry. As well, since I do not have anything positive to add for this establishment, I will withhold the rest."
bad,"Management was very strict, provided little freedom, had strict sales goals with no benefit for the employee to reach, and would push as much work as they could on employees as a cost savings method to avoid hiring more employees. Taking time off for school (even final exams) was almost impossible."
bad,"They make unrealistic sale goals, you have a hard time getting help when needed from management. Very short staffed. Get promised 1 job opportunity then watch as new hires get the opportunities that are better then people already there are given. Favoritism."
bad,"I was head hunted by talent acquisition and accepted a position for services supervisor. "
bad,"other workers ignorant to work with. People would show up late for their shift, and the day workers had to stay til they showed up. Steady work every day. Managers didn't care if there were problems among the workers."
bad,"Es wird first class gefordert, aber nur Frachtraum bezahlt. Vereinbarungen werden nicht eingehalten, es wird absolute Flexibilität erwartet, jeder soll alles können (was auch OK wäre, wenn jeder etwas erklärt bekäme). Das ganze wird dann mit einem niedrigen Lohn gedankt."
bad,A great place to work. A typical day at work. Work place culture is normal. Never a dull day. There's nothing good or bad to tell. Management has change through-out the years
bad,The work environment at Staples had gone from bad to worse in recent times.This is mostly due to clueless people hired at all levels of management. I would not recommend Staples for any prospective employees.
bad,Since Sycamore acquired Staples it has been utterly a disaster.  Lost all customer service characteristics.  All is just a drive for worthless extended warranties .  Managers come and go very frequently   Would trust Walmart before shopping at Staples.  Overpriced on just about everything and the company doesn't even care.  Hourly employees are used till they quit.  Would highly recommend staying away from this company!
bad,All management cared about was how much you made in tech services and insurance plans.  Also they wanted  you to push the more high ticket items when a lower one would do the job.
bad,"I worked at my local Staples for 1 year. Let me break down to you how it went from a decent part time job to one of the most stressful times of my life. When I started we had 3 managers, 4 cashiers, 4 tech works, 5 copy and print people, and 4 people helping on the floor. Skip ahead a few months, 2 managers, 3 techs, 4 copy and print, 3 people on the floor. Skip to a few more months in from then to recently, we now have 0 managers, 2 tech, 4 copy and print, and 1 person on the floor. Tried to get Staples to send more workers and they sent no one for the last 3 months of my time here. Two of the techs are acting as managers but are not managers and Staples has done nothing about it. Heck, even I have been MoD for several days and it was a nightmare cause I cant do anything cause I am not a real manager. Two of the techs have worked 60 to 70 hour work weeks for two or more weeks to make up for the understaffing crisis. Everyone is giving their two weeks, me included, and I feel bad for those I am leaving but I do not deserve the stress and honestly they do not either. Do not work for Staples unless you know your Staples is staffed and running. Make sure for any interview you ask how many current workers are there. Be aware how many people are working in your store before taking the job. DO NOT BE GUILTED into working the long hard hours cause they do not have the people. The money is nice but your health is 100% priority. If they try to entice you with employee discounts, do not bother. 10% discount takes hardly anything off your purchase."
bad,"When i first started working here everything was great, Soon after everything changed and people would come and go, Anyway unless you want to be over worked and cross trained for very little pay. Management does not care about you they just want you to make money and sell things no one would want or need. Management shows favoritism for the one's they like and move them up and over work and yell at the one's they don't. you might think i am just saying this to make them look bad but everything i am saying is true. you will be overworked and under payed and will be crossed trained and lied to that they are going to move you up the chain and not moved at all"
bad,Would not recommend working for this company. During my time there towards the end we changed managers 3 times. Each manager ended up being worse than the previous one. Also they did not respect your request for off days.
bad,Management doesn’t care about employees. They only want to please themselves. Managers yell at employees in front of customers and blame them for the things that go wrong.
bad,"The mission, the Goal or the company views was never clear everyone had their own personal goal and would put 100 things to do or look over, From Copy Center, To sales and customer service"
bad,"One of the worst places to work....poorly managed, discriminate towards employees, no real benefits, no communication and no structure.  Terrible place to work!!!"
bad,"horrible manager and supervisor."
bad,Staples is a terrible depressing place to work . Management is horrible. They harass you daily. Overall hated working there for the year and a half I worked there.
bad,"The pay was well below competitive compared to jobs of the same calibur. Some day are extremely long, 14+ and others are less than 8. Management doesn't really pay attention to the floor."
bad,"Stay away."
bad,"Pressure, pressure, pressure. Toxic environment to work in.  Management has gone down. They don’t do what they say they would.  Long hours, little pay. They pay their tech guys min. Wage and expect the world from their people."
bad,"I was hired to be the lead of the Easy Tech department, meaning that I would have all the training of the Easy Tech staff, including diagnostics and repairs for electronics, a key to the locked room where we kept high priced items, and delegation of my staff underneath me. Of those examples, the only one I was ever given was delegation. The other options promised to me at the interview were then dismissed as ""not necessary"" even when there were days I was the only tech in the store with multiple computers needing to be worked on. This company does not understand management."
bad,"Staples management is more concerned with, forcing the customer to purchase Liquid armor, Square trade, and getting a staples credit card, then actually helping the customer. They constantly harass employees to push these products, to the point that you get sick of hearing these words."
bad,"Very unprofessional place to work and generally displeased, the management is known for switching shifts the night before and acting as if you missed a shift you should have had. The associates you work with are under-trained and no one understands the system or stock, constantly have to read off a script and up-sell things or risk scolding regardless of if the customer needs it, (EX. Premium Paper). You learn how to sell well, and attach items that someone may need, catagorize people or their jobs and items they shop for. Never had stock for anything regardless."
bad,job pays very little for what the work is cant live off these checks job is very full of drama and the managers are not that great they dont care about the well being of there employees
bad,Don't work for this company. You will not get far. The management changes every so often and the hours of work can change right in front of you without your acknowledgement .
bad,"Worked at Staples for a few months while I was in college. Even with a ""friendly, can-do"" attitude the pay was minimum wage and I only got 1 or 2 shifts per week at 3 hours each. Simply wasn't enough to keep gas in the car and ramen on the table even though it was a second job. It was just one of those jobs that wasn't worth the trouble. Buy a lawn mower and mow some yards, you'll make more money and be more successful in life."
bad,"Staples was a tough job and you never knew from day to day if you would still have a job. The leadership staff very political and you had to learn to ""play the game"" or be overly friendly to get ahead. They rewarded people who never came to work and didn't do any work while there."
bad,you cant go up in this company. management changes rapidly and nothing you do is appreciated. wages are low - stores in the area are hiring at 12 dollars an hour and they start at 9.20
bad,"Company is in need of complete leadership overhaul. Leadership does not support the growth of employees. I have worked with some great people, however."
bad,People dont know what they are doing from manger to new coworkers they only worry about the drivers not the load team shipping and receiving kkkkkktuh
bad,Would not recommend this place to anyone.. if you did your job and they had to send someone home I was the one.. then I would see most of them just sitting there and talking..I also was asked to come in and work on my day off and I wouldn’t even get my break until the person that Was going home had there’s.. when they were coming back from break when I was clocking in..  I was expected to do more work than others.. they would have product for mark down and if I didn’t get it done it would be put in the backroom for me until the morning.. the night person didn’t have to do it.. only thing is that if I was working the shift I would have to get it done..
bad,"After working at Staples for only a few weeks, I was asked to train new employees while simultaneously maintaining the expectations of the job. This alone made it not worth the time as the new employees had little interaction with other employees and managers, and ultimately lacked information due to an absence of training materials. It became quite obvious that the company does not care about its employees after multiple coworkers were threatened or fired for not meeting unrealistic sales goals."
bad,"I learned how to do good things for customers in customer service. I did a lot for the company, and was promised a lot of things, but was never followed thru with any of them."
bad,"worked there for 5 years, there is no bonus for selling - you have to fight to get breaks, and the managers were a joke. defiantly would NOT recommend anyone applying here!"
bad,"Don't work here. Not worth it.Management bad. High employee turn around. No matter how little hours you get, you are still expected to make sales quotas."
bad,It’s very understaffed and it’s hard to work there as a student. Even though it was discussed over and over I still find it to be a constant battle getting time to work on school work.
bad,"Manager would tell me how to do something, then when he wasn't around, Leads and co-workers said not to listen to him, cause he didn't know what he was doing."
bad,Poor managers with terrible incentives and no training other than sitting in a room with a computer.  Customers are not bad but the set -up and managers make it difficult to get through the day.
bad,"Well at this position I was supposed to be working 20 hours a week and they were giving all the hours to the new girl I wasn't trained fully, and the managers are not professional."
bad,A typical day at staples was horrible. the management was horrible and treated some of the employees unfairly. i learned more about sales through a different employee.
bad,"Very stressful work environment. As a manager, I was encouraged to push the associates to meet unrealistic goals. Brick and mortar stores similar to Staples are dying with online shopping and Staples is pushing its associates too hard to keep it afloat."
bad,IF YOU KNOW YOUR WORTH AND YOU ARE A HARD WOKER DO NOT APPLY AT THIS PLACE. They will work the soul out of u while others ride the bench. Dont waste your time.
bad,the staples in quakertown is poorly managed and understaffed. They have people who have worked there for 20+ years who have only gotten 1 dollar raises. The management does not follow protocol when it comes to breaks and scheduled time off. They will throw you into circumstances unfit for your particular training and penalize you if you don't excel.  don't bother wasting your time looking for upward mobility in any position.
bad,this company is so far out of date. they should just succumb to amazon and not torture the people within the organization any longer.  put a bullet in this old pig
bad,I started working for staples and it was okay. They were very customer oriented. We were supposed to help the customer and involve ourselves with the customers. But after I worked there for about a year the whole company changed. They got rid of almost all the full time positions so the laid many people off. The only full time positions left were for management or the inventory specialist. Most other people did not work more than 20 hours a week. And if you got 20 hours a week you were very lucky. They expected you to meet unrealistic goals especially given the hours we worked. And because they cut down on hours and staff the customer experience really suffered. When I started you would have 2-3 people at the easy tech counter 2-3 people in the print area and 1-2 people on the floor and 2 cashiers. They cut it down to 1 person at the easy tech bench. 1 person at the copy center. No one on the floor besides the inventory specialist who was always busy running all over. And 1 cashier.  It is very hard to help customers on the floor when there are so few people. The company is clearly not doing well as they have had to close several stores. I would discourage anyone from working here unless you have no other options. The company does not care about you and will treat you poorly.
bad,"""Work life balance culture of the company"" "
bad,Trabaje en el área de break pack área cuya tarea es echar los productos de los clientes de forma online
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of handling customers questions and concerns, leading them to the product he/she is looking to buy. From my personal experience at Staples, I learned that retail is not the greatest job there is out there to offer. The management at this job was absolutely horrible, if I had a comment or concern, there was never action or concern based upon my concern or needs. When I put in for my two weeks for this job, I did not get paid for my last week that I worked there, I had to touch base with corporate and I had to wait a week to even be paid. The workplace atmosphere for this job was very drama filled, no one wanted to help each other on the job. if I even asked the manager for help while I was working, he basically threw a fit and acted as if he were mad about me wanting the help. The hardest part of the job I would say for me was dealing with the people that I worked with. None of them wanted to help me threw any part of my shift, they all acted as if it was such a huge problem to take some time out of their time to help me. The most enjoyable part of the job for me I have to say is, being able to go home at the end of the day. I give this job at Staples a very poor review, and I wouldn't recommend working in this job to anyone."
bad,The store manager and assistant manager are the laziest people I've ever worked for. The assistant literally can't do a thing in the copy and print center and will guaranteed freak out if he has to cover a 30 minute lunch(he'll go get the off the clock copy center associate if anything happens during this 30 minutes). This is an absolute soul crushing job
bad,"The managers are either indifferent or downright hostile, uncaring about any safety concerns employees may have. I was injured on the job while unloading a truck by hand, placed on light duty. They waited until I was off light duty two weeks later to fire me. Take as a last resort and look for something better."
bad,"The only thing good I liked about this job were the co-workers.  They were great people.  The call volume was steady to busy but the training for the job was poor.  Employees were encouraged to seek out assistance with issues, but criticized for asking questions."
bad,"The Chicopee Store treats there employees terribly, the district manager acts likes hes gods gift and treats the employees at all stores terribly. The management is not steady changes frequently."
bad,"Minimum wage, no chance for advancement. Clock in, work, clock out, repeat. Customers are old and entitled, management is eager to bend to their will."
bad,"Way too much personal back biting and involvement so much it inhibits the ability to work. Never enough help present to be able to fulfill the need of the customers, their bottom dollar was always more important than the customer, I just don't see how they are still open"
bad,"The typical workday begins with time sensitive reporting out to the field on prior day and prior week performance, there is a small window with which to complete the whole process and management is highly critical of meeting deadlines for their senior leadership discussions. Long nights are the norm, especially on the closing periods, and everyone is expected to remain for the duration with little to no flexibility on travel arrangements and alternative work schedules. By the end of the day/week/month (depending on your work responsibilities) you are so tired that driving home itself becomes a chore because you know that the process repeats the following morning."
bad,"All locations have different management teams, but all still require you to handle toxic toner cartridges. Heavy lifting required. Unattainable sales goals with no wage increase."
bad,"Despite my ten years of experience in digital printing and customer service this job proved to be too much for me. If you are looking for a job that requires little to no thinking, has flexible hours and gives a 10% employee discount then this is a great temporary or seasonal job."
bad,"The store I worked in wouldn't be a bad place to work in at all if it weren't for the managers and supervisors. On a daily basis other employees and myself experienced constant put-downs, racism, sexism, and much more from mean-spirited upper management. Treatment from management was the only reason I left."
bad,"My experience working for Staples was negative due to bad management. The manager in question was fired for incompetence after I left, but personally my time time spent at Staples was horrible."
bad,"My time at Staples was stressful, the management was terrible and those who worked above store level we're terrible. I wasn't paid enough, not enough help, the benefits were not great. The people who were hired were most of the time minors or kids straight out of highschool who didn't care."
bad,the bosses were ok depended who you had they were really strict on meetings that were on a sunday and did not care if you did not work that day or had another job you had to go
bad,The managers are all about liquid armorer. and this product causes so much stress one of the managers where often crying because numbers where not meet and DM made store manager buy liquid armorer before letting her go home or on a vacation… so that stress got pushed to the employee's.. overall a vial environment.
bad,"I was at staples for three years. The managers make you hate working there, they treat you poorly, make you lie to customers, Make you take your own surveys so the store numbers go up, give their favorite people hours because they kiss their butts, I could go on and on .All around horrible company."
bad,"staples need more orginization , only reason why i left because needed more money for the amount of work that i was doing each day , also needed more hours"
bad,Associates let go as soon as volume dips. Termination and rehires due to spikes is not a good way to keep long term associates. Management needs to take a step back and look at this practice.
bad,I do not want to talk about how this store made me promise after promise and failed to keep and of them. it is easier to just say it is a bad place to have to work.
bad,"Gros manque de communication. Pas de possibilité d'évolution. La direction change régulièrement. Ils ne laisse aucune chance aux nouveaux.  "
bad,Horrible place to work.  Ageism is alive and well at Staples contract side.  Consistently cut commissions and if you made too much you were on the chopping block.  No regard for their hard working sales people.
bad,"•	Actively manage lists of customers to outbound dial in an effort to understand why a customer left Staples."
bad,"something to do in college, you will never amount to anything in the company however, they play favorites in the leadership, they didn't respect my education or consider me for senior management...I was a worker who they wanted to do it all but not reward"
bad,"working with a staff in the copy and print department was a very pleasant experience, however, the management staff was not very eager to assist or staff enough people to be able to help the employees so that they could assist customers in the most efficient time"
bad,"Depending on the department you are in, the managers will expect you to do not only the job you were hired for, but other departments jobs too with little pay. Now don't get me wrong, I am not a lazy worker, but when you, one person, are expected to do a 6 person job and get in trouble when you can't get it done, it really kills your spirit. They also do not like giving second chances for mistakes. What I mean is, if you are unaware you are supposed to do something (or not do something) they do not give you another chance, they instantly write you up."
bad,Has extremely high turnover. Very poor management team makes it extremely difficult to be a supervisor.  Expect supervisors to work a minimum of 10 hours.  Company policy are unreasonable hard to enforce. Management only allowes policies to be enforced when it is good for there egenda.
bad,When I started it was a great place to work. Now very bad. They have eliminated a lot of personal days making it impossible to take a day off. Employee Morale has degraded due to all of the new managers taking over. Very low pay raises. Would not recommend.
bad,Very cut throat.  It was who you knew and not what you knew that helped you exceed.  very high turnover rate with the threat of union walkouts.  Glad to be
bad,"The Staples I worked at had very poor management. They would not help you, would not properly train you, and would not support you in any way. They expected you to work over time and stay late without first discussing it with you. I worked there an entire year before FINALLY another associate told me I should be getting a thirty minute lunch at the very least. Before that I had not been taking a lunch, because none of the management or training videos ever covered lunch in training. They took advantage of a seventeen year old associate who had never worked in the retail industry before."
bad,"Between management being rude and unhelpful to their employees and corporate having unrealistic expectations for their employees, Staples was an awful place to work at."
bad,"I worked in helping customers find what office supplies needed.  "
bad,"horrible morale"
bad,They have a horrible management set up and their sales requirements pushed on the employees are way out of line with a feasible workload per employee to customer service and sales standards. They have a extremely high sales quota and even if you make those sales there is still no job security.
bad,"I hated working at Staples. The management was terrible, and so was the pay. The hours were long and I didn't ever get along with any of my coworkers or my Supervisor."
bad,"I'm mostly going to keep my mouth shut, but I will say, if you work for staples, remember that none of the higher ups will have your back... that includes managers, GM's, DM's, HR, and ETC. Its a dog eat dog company..."
bad,"It was terrible, no a/c for the hot summers. Theres no end time so you can be there for moroe than 8+ hours a night!!!! Terrible management, hr lady was a drunk!!!!! Drinking on the job."
bad,"falta de motivação aos colaboradores, pouca entreajuda"
bad,The management has no idea what they are doing. They would all have meetings everyday and discuss what their superiors where telling them to do and then try to convey it to their staff.
bad,"worked for staples for 5 years.  no advancement oppertunity, you were basicly stuck in whatever position you were hired for.  long hours, no flexaniliy in schedule."
bad,A lot of favoritism going on especially in Memphis. Certain people get away with certain things. Don't appreciate the good workers. Need to clean house with management.
bad,I worked at Staples throughout college. The managers sucked. The customers sucked. I would always give the managers my school schedule a month before the semester started but they would always schedule me during my classes. There were 2 managers that worked at the Folsom Store that would harass women. The Managers  would not do anything about the complaints.
bad,this was temp job but I did learn a lot of computer knowledge from working in the easy tech department and great sales techniques from my other co-workers
bad,Wouldn't recommend anyone to apply for employment at staples. I worked as a driver for 26 years and ln the end was laid off for the companies decision to use 3rd party del. Service. Turns out that didn't work out to good for them!
bad,Staples is going out of business due to Amazon and other competing dot com businesses. Staples refuses to pay their employees adequately or offer better employee discounts and incentives.
bad,This place is awful place to work. Pay is low too low to survive in the State of California. Management is so so. There is no room for advancement here.
bad,Was expected to run the busy department alone every day because they wouldn’t hire anyone else. No management backup whatsoever when being screamed at by customers because I wouldn’t break the law for them.
bad,"Staples was probably the worst job I have ever had, I was under valued and under paid for the work I put in. The managers were all bad people to work for and corporate didn't care about anything they did. A bad manager at Staples is like a priest that touches little kids, they don't get rid of them, they just move them from location to location."
bad,"This place was your bad, this place was my bad, from California, to the New York Islands. From the Red Tree Forest, to the bright white waters, this place is bad, for you and me."
bad,"Poor work environment,  management doesn't give lunch breaks to copy print assocates because they do not know how to cover that deparment. Too many associates and not enough hours for each."
bad,The pay was a joke. You get worked like a dog for nothing. Management will blame you for their mistakes. Payroll was never on time. The manager was a creepy guy.
bad,"When I worked there I did not receive the hours I was told, they also would change my hours and not tell me. I was supposed to be an easy tech which I did not do! they would only let me sell computers to customers and allow only if they would get a software deal with it my manager refused to sell computers even when we had them. Unprofessional would not work there again."
bad,"Supervisors were ill prepared and lacked knowledge of management, and supervision.  There was no encouragement of teamwork and schedules were eradication,"
bad,"It was awful to work here. No management, no teamwork, the hardest part was dealing with your coworkers not showing up for their shifts. Being called in on your days off"
bad,fast paced and training wasn't paid. training was really bad nothing was actually facilitated. I didnt work for them directly but for Arise. and we had to pay to train with them. and they took money out of our checks to use the vpn because we used our own computer
bad,"I hated this job, they fired me after I came back from.maternity leave, because I didn't hit my set goal. I was forced 9n maternity leave at 4 month because they couldn't""accommodate"" but they accommodated the Philippine race (no pun intended) just telling it like it is. They were able to do pack size and scan carts, but not me I had to pick orders"
bad,Working there wasn't good at all. I didn't enjoy the tech side of things or how selling items wasn't profitable unless you got attachments. Being a tech was stressful and the people there were meh.
bad,"All around poorly ran company, new untrained & unskilled store manager's every 3 months. Blame it on someone else culture, lazy middle management & employees."
bad,"Mount Airy staples is the absolute worst place of business in mount airy. The store manager is lazy and never does anything he promises other managers are two faced, will be a best friend to your face but go and complain about you every day behind your back. At this job you have no room for advancement or pay raises simply because of the store manager being to lazy to enter anything in on the computer."
bad,"I was only working at Staples for 3-4 months, my manager wasn't the easiest or nicest guy to talk too. And he had unrealistic expectations, my experience includes being a cashier, and shelves stocker."
bad,Most of the time no matter where you will be yelled at for not selling something the customer does't want. I get it it's sales and I was one of the top sellers in the Edmonton/Northern Alberta district and only rewards we would get it a $25 Gift card to STAPLES. Very unfair company you won't be moving up and Staples is dying a lot.
bad,"If you enjoy being talked down to by your managers on a daily basis then this job is for you, if you like being scheduled without consent, its for you. I'm sure there is worse jobs out there, but to be paid as little as you are, the mistreatment that is received makes the job not worth it."
bad,"The print and marketing department is where I worked and let me tell you this, it’s not worth it! I worked at 91-30 van Wyck Expressway and my coworkers were such disgusting fake people . Manager was racist and had his favorites. I hated it honestly even the customers were cursing you out"
bad,The manger can speak to you in any disrespectful way and no one does anything about it. You will only be able to get 25 hours a week. They start you at 9 and you can not be moved up for advancement.
bad,"My manager refused to pay me for a tech worker but had me do all the tech work, even had me train new tech associates. This caused me to leave, along with several workplace safety issues. A friend of mine had a severe back injury because they would not fix their ladder."
bad,A good place for a transition phase in your life. It is a not a place you'd like to stay for a long period of time. I went to apply and the older women was extremely rude and told me good luck getting the job which I obviously got then management sabotaged me into getting to the point where I had to quit with no notice. Horrible place to be in....
bad,Poor management very unprofessional customer service and no team player never took responsibility for their own actions and let associates do what they wanted to do staples need better managers
bad,"There are some people who are cool, some who I enjoyed working with, then there were the rest who either treated you like a total idiot, gave you very little breathing room and barely did their job as it was."
bad,after years of working for staples in multiple locations and job titles I figured out that there what have you done for me today mentality was toxic and unhealthy
bad,"All the stores smell like wet dog. Poorly trained management. No real incentive to work for them, a lot of turnover for lack of job security you feel looming over you at all times."
bad,"Low pay, poor management. Very stressful. The type of job that takes everything you have, sucks your soul away and leaves you with nothing. Was told I was going to be doing other things and was basically a salesperson."
bad,Not a welcoming or friendly place to work. Mismanaged and inefficient.  Equipment is old.  Shifts are endless!  NEVER know when the work day will be OVER!
bad,its not a place to work if you want in the technology work its just a retail job with bad management who aren't friendly or helpful i dont recommend it to no one
bad,staples was not the job that i thought it was going to be. The management there was inexperienced and unmotivated. It was hard to find the desire to come into work everyday and represent Staples in a way that one should do when the management cant even tie there shoes on right.
bad,"Underpaid, overworked. Managers working well over 40 hours per week but salaried. Low morale and head office are very abusive. Unrealistic targets set you up to constantly fail. Staples was great, this company, not so much. New ideas introduced which are good, but the prices and management from the upper bosses is shocking. Finally have a good store team and now they're forcing the manager to move. Abysmal"
bad,"Unless your a manager,  this job is terrible, bad wage, fast pace, you don't get paid your worth, people constantly coming and going, the management doesn't care about you they care about numbers."
bad,This wasp itched as an Inside Sales gig.. but they eventually require you to make hundreds of calls a day regardless of whether you have quality conversations or not...
bad,"A very slow paced job that had very little benefits, the pay was at the very minimum, the managers were really corrupt, and the employees would steal from the store. That place was not a good job for me."
bad,"Poor management, coworkers were fine, the wat they defined working was very competitive and made it hard for people working there to do their job without trying to sell add-ons or warranties"
bad,My hours would constantly be switched on top of a manager who really couldn't manage drastically increasing the amount of work i would have to take care of. The employees were lazy due to the lack of leadership at the store. Overall a terrible experience i wouldn't recommend it too anyone.
bad,"terrible people and leadership. people are mean and do NOT support each other. no one cares about common curtesy or teamwork. new leadership is not helping, only shuffling same bad people around"
bad,Worst place to work. Negative culture. Promotions not based on experience but given to friends. Abusive management practices allowed and defended. Layoffs frequent and ongoing.
bad,Worst company i have ever worked for.  Awful benefits and worse pay.  District management have no idea whats going on and no clue how to properly run the stores
bad,"No Thank you! lack of upper management communication, cut throat, lies about status and quotes required, training is horrible. Promise never delivered."
bad,A terrible place to work if you have a family.  You never know what time you will be out of work.  Managers are all new as they have a difficult time keeping qualified supervisors.  Managers are very bonus driven putting your safety at risk.  Equipment is not maintained properly.  Dangerous and unsafe place to work
bad,"Not a good place for growth. W0rked 8-5 dealing with accounts that messed up due to other not being train. Management was a job, They would leave and have team leaders cover for them. They would be working on there personal business and not there for there team."
bad,"Staples isn't managed well at all. There is a lot of gossip and favoritisim which calls for a very stressful work place. When I first started I enjoyed my job and the manager gave me hope to excel, got new manager and the store went down hill."
bad,"I worked for Staples when I was in High School and it was a horrible job. The management was very Poor. The products were lame. And the customers were the worse. After working at a Staples, I didn't step foot in another staples for years."
bad,work schedule is communication for employee there is no respect for employee and a lot employee they quit because the manager is not good and they keep changing people schedule with saying on it
bad,"A typical day working here involved stocking shelves, woking the cash register, and then cleaning at the end of the day.  These were the only things you did as a sales associate. I did not enjoy this job too much due to the lack of creativity it takes to do the job. All I would do is mindlessly stock shelves or ring up customers, I never had any sort of challenge to try and creatively find a solution to a problem."
bad,"Corporate is obsessed with sales goals that will never be met."
bad,"I would recommend this company to people I didn't like. This job wasn't worth the gas money. Management was rude and disrespectful, especially the females who abused their power."
bad,Management in my store was very negative and slanted toward favored persons. certain people seemed to be frowned upon because of background or personal preferences and had an effect on how general manager treated them
bad,"No structured training program"
bad,"really shady place to work. people just wanted to get thier job down, but it was ridiculous expectations for an office supply store. the hours sucked, and you never knew wat position you were working"
bad,"As a new worker , you expect people to treat you with respect and as equal with everyone. But youbget treated like the new person . Nobody cares and they pay you what they want . And when the store don't need you anymore because the back to school crowd is over they let you go"
bad,"Management yells at you in front of customers. Very demeaning environment. No positive feedback, only negative comments and constantly pushing you for more. Not worth it considering the low pay."
bad,Pretty much had to teach yourself - stressful and really lousy hours - customers are rude and arrogant - only people with accommodating hours are few and far between- messed up my entire sleeping and meal schedule - couldn't stand it anymore - health insurance not available for partime employees(which is about 95% of the employees)
bad,"Depending on the location Staples is a very cutthroat retail giant, it's always about profits, getting the most money out of each customer: creating bigger "" tech baskets"" with items customers do not need, also bullying customers into thinking they need useless tech services which are very very over priced! Need a few things transferred if the computer? 69.99, need someone to help setup a printer in home? 150.00.. management treats associates, very harshly for not being able to sell ""protection plans"" for hundreds of dollars."
bad,"Worst place to work. Low pay, horrible hours, managers don't care and most don't even know the job. Overall, the worst job I ever had. Will never work there again."
bad,"the higher up management at corperate does not give a dang about the stores. All they do is look at numbers and complain, leading to highly stressed out store managers. If numbers are bad they will not help find a solution, rather they will begin firing managers. My store is down to 1 manager and he is going insane from working open to close non stop while constantly getting emails and phone calls from the district manager about how nothing is getting done... well duh we have 1 manager and our part timers are dropping like flies. In 3 years we have gone through 4 district managers and 3 general managers. The pay is junk so the associates hired are bottom of the barrel but they expect high class sales person from them , the entire business model is unreasonable and unstable. Constantly told how terrible you are doing by people who have never been to your store yet when you go to the website you will see some CEO type person blabbing about how great everything is going to the stock holders?? What the  is going on here??"
bad,I did not have a good experience with nesco. Took almost 4 weeks to get my first paycheck and did not get raises that i was supposed to get. Also did not get my weekly scorecards to tell how i was doing at my job.
bad,Constant layoffs. They will lay people off then set up a pool table for people to play pool in a working area. People are always on edge never knowing if they will have a job. They restructure all the time and make people reapply for their own jobs.
bad,company never admits they r wrong always have negative feed back to employees if they had there way they would fire all black folks people fight all the time in parking lot cars r often stolen on daily basis just a bad place to b employed and I always cry
bad,Poor management sloppy work environment bad hours lack of customers service no room for advisement fast paste short breaks short lunches favoritism no customer service
bad,"Management was very poor.  Days at work were extremely stressful and long.  This particular warehouse had a very sad work culture.  While coworkers were great and fun to work with, management made the days long and exhausting."
bad,I couldn't wait to work for Staples...the people were great and the work was also until they started changing into a call center. The supervisors were very unprofessional and the company ended up laying off about 75% of their workers.355
bad,The managers at the santa monica store I work for were horrible. Not only racist but bias. They bullied everyone at the store. Do not apply here. Bad!
bad,I enjoyed working at this organization. I enjoy meeting the local State of Maine people and all the U.S Military personnel of naval Air station Brunswick and bath iron works shipyard. The Company provided me with 40 hours before my daughter was born. I achieved all my goals and achievements. I would recommend this company to anyone whom is seeking help.
bad,"Even going by the low standards of retail, the Augusta Maine Staples is unquestionably the worst place I have ever worked. I also feel comfortable in calling it the worst place I will EVER work. Because there is no excuse for any store to be run this badly."
bad,"This company has no connection with it's customers. There is no chance for advancement. It was more like working on the set of a soap opera. The last general manager was abusive in that he would ask you to get on your knees and thank him for your job and when reported to HR  the company did nothing to support the employees."
bad,"Extremely fast paced. Little to no training other than vague videos. I was told that hourly rate of 8.50 would quickly be raised.  No raise in one year, despite excellent performance reviews. Unrealistic sales goals. Abusive management."
bad,"Company refuses to accommodate anyone when it comes to any issues regarding children, or schooling . The supervisors  bully employees on a daily basis and expect you to work your life away for the company."
bad,Not sure how this company is still in business. Worked there for a long time and is almost impossible to get promoted from within. 9/10 times they hire from outside sources. Seem to have a new GM about every other year. Not good for employee morale.
bad,"very slow, very understaffed, very unpleasant customers, no patience at all, and are asked to do extra work on your own personal time. may have gotten better since the previous manager is gone."
bad,"The job was my first job and I was new in having a job and I didn't like it much the hours sucked, and I started as a part time, the employees there weren't helpful when I needed it."
bad,"Staples as a store is a great place to have things done and completed whether it be a computer fixed or business cards made. However working there is a complete and utter nightmare. the management never had a clue as to what needed to be done around the store or when trucks were to be delivered. Half the time I worked there I never got a break and when confronting my GM about it, he said "" we really need all hands on deck so sacrifices need to be made"". I worked several departments and was quite underpaid to do all the duties that I had to perform in a day. upon asking to become a full time employee I was told "" there just isn't enough in our budget to give you full time pay nor benefits."""
bad,Hardest part of job was dealing with the toxic work environment. They expect long hours with no reward or gratitude. Not well managed and they do not know who they are.
bad,"The place just sucks, you don't have a stablished schedule. The place is going down so they won't give you more than 19 hours. They don't even have a system going on."
bad,"Lack of support where the management are advised to stand around and tell associates what to do while standing around doing nothing themselves!"
bad,Job is very unorganized. The staff management is very unorganized. if you hurt on on the job will not get an workers compensation this was one of the worst jobs ever. very very hot in the summer very very cold in the winter
bad,"This is hands down the worst job I have ever had. Management is disrespectful, pay isn't equal to work, hours are skimmed on constantly, and you would go hope with a headache every single day. I HATED this job and use this as encouragement to work hard in life and never return."
bad,Was here for a few months as a temp and the job was not good. The hours were ok but lack training and you ask for help you don't hardly get it. I left this place.
bad,"Was a copy center expert - they pay is so-so but for the amount of work you do, you should be paid twice that. The copy center is always poorly staffed and they have insane goals."
bad,I came from another state as a copy center lead with a set salary ...I transfer with my salary.... the manager didn't appreciate it because it was affecting the store budget..... made it miserable and difficult to be happy doing my job....basically forced me to quit
bad,"Not too many great things to say about this company. No competitiveness for better wages. Everyone is stuck in their own little circle when it comes to work. They come in, clock in, work and clock out."
bad,"I used to admire Staples. When I started working in the copy and print department, my life and my job became stressful. The production supervisor had no experience.  They were all rude and they were all liars. Customers were being disrespected left and right. My advice... stay away from Staples Copy and Print. It is not worth it."
bad,"Horrible reporting, never know how you get paid.  All reports that are given to figure it out never add up to what you get.  Management in technology line of business have no communication and have never done our role before.  They say whatever they need to, to get ahead.  Whole department is ran from headquarters basing everything of off reports instead of what an 8 hour day looks like.  Changed comp plan 5 times in 9 months.  Every time we have gotten paid considerably less.  If you speak up to help fix a broken system or procedure, retaliation will happen.  Horrible place to work.  Tell you that you will make $65k when barely making 45k and fighting for every last bit."
bad,"Badly run work place, poor leadership and poor work spirit. Marked sense of incompetence and mismanagement of easy tasks. Not ideal for students or part timers."
bad,"Staffing was horrible, they don't do drug screening. Not enough hours and no order in the store. Didn't feel like my work was appreciated at Staples.."
bad,Awful management and scheduling. Always last minute management and no room for career growth. Constantly hiring from outside when there are plenty of able applicants within.
bad,Management was horrible didnt know how to manage employees hours were not good  work environment was lousy managnent was not responcable for actions and treated you unfairly
bad,"After failing to buy office Depot they closed 400 stores mine being one of them. Only the day before we had all just been told it wasn't happening and we altered closing. Bad company for businesses, individuals, and employees."
bad,I received my forklift certification and that was my first job. this job hours are very long and hard on your feet. they are strict and want u to finish at a certain time
bad,"In the beginning it was great. Then I learned the favoritism that went on within the coworkers and management. When I had room for advancement it was not given. I was forced into a department I did not like, and when we lost the department supervisor, I was not given the position even though I had already been doing her responsibilities. Instead the manager gave the job to a current shift lead who I had to train as supervisor. Not fun when you have to train your own supervisor."
bad,Manager does nothing but sit in the office and write write ups all day. Yells at everybody for the mistakes that she had made cuz it's what she wants us to do we do it exactly the way she wants the next day she comes in and tells us we did it all wrong and that she didn't tell us to do it that way a very stressful environment . There's at least one employee that cries everyday complaining about how she being treated by management
bad,"Not one promotion, since I've been here has been based on any of the usual criteria used in upward movement. Tenure - doesn't matter. Performance - doesn't matter. Even profitability hasn't mattered. The driving force here seems to be who kisses the GM's behind the most or what makes her feel most ""comfortable"". A prime example of why women in authoritative positions normally turns into an emotional disaster. And no that's not me being a sexist because I am a woman."
bad,I really don't know how to sum this up working for staples was a decision that I regretted almost immediately nothing about it would ever make me want to go back stay away.
bad,Bad upper management and going out of business poor raises buying wrong products no structure and bad planning not enough stock expect customers to be happy with ordering products
bad,"Wouldn't wish this on anyone.  Management is determined to ""clone"" every employee and make them a ""selling robot"".  Cannot do anything right.  All input is negative."
bad,"Fair, but with this location its hard to receive help from higher up to maintain store readiness for many challenges. Many challenges are ahead for this location, unless they received proper guiding and or better management. If you need a summer job, this store is not the location for you. Too many johns and janes put little to no effort once hired."
bad,"If you are hired as a temp. They pay is good, but you do not get any benefits. The temp service will schedule you to work 6 hours, but this specific location over staffs their staff and leaves you only able to work 4 hours. They hire permanent people after they hire temps which cuts into the temp's hours."
bad,Compensation and promotions are not based on dependability or your work ethic. Business is strictly run from a corporate level. They could do some real good if they changed their business structure to resemble franchises. It would bring more power to the store level to better accommodate the customer's needs.
bad,il y a du favoritisme avec une des directrice et une employer qui sont de la même famille si vous ne vous laisser pas humilier et vous laissez donner des ordres par la fille et bien la directrice qui est sont ex belle-mère vous congedie
bad,They do not care about their employees.  They do not give proper raises to their employees that actually do the real work.  Then there are is favoritism within the company were people get moved up when they do not deserve it or know how to do the job.
bad,"This place will consume you. If you have a family or life outside of work well this is no job for you. You never know when you are starting you shift or going home. Everything changes and it's "" based on customer needs"" you will work 12 hours for a couple days and 5 hours the next few days to avoid getting paid overtime. Management team is a collection of rejects from surrounding companies that were fired from their job and Staples hires them. Snowstorms? Don't worry they will be open and yes you are expected to come to work. You are even told when to take your breaks and lunch because daily they are never the same.  Human resource department is useless and friends with management so good luck getting anything resolved. If you need this until something else comes up I would take it only if last resort. Trust me you won't like it."
bad,"This company is SO disorganised and middle management heavy. They chase their tails and do not care for their clients or employees at all. "
bad,"The people were great but the company as a whole put way too much on their employees. Even the store manager was always stressed on every little aspect of the store because we had monthly check ins. "
bad,One of the worst jobs in retail I have ever had. The management was both highly disrespectful and incompetent. Employees are treated poorly.  Management would not work with me and give me enough hours to live off of while going to college. The only good thing about this job was that there was a few nice employees that were fun to work with. But overall this was the worst retail job I have ever had.
bad,"The hours are terrible, the management is terrible. The only reason I would walk into the store in Newton, NJ is to buy products, otherwise, it's terrible."
bad,"Managers only look at employees as expendable and you either do what they want or quit. Don't let the higher pay fool you because they will short you hours to make sure you don't work 40 even working mandatory 10 hour overtime. You'll know when you're working too much because they will basically force you out the door before your shift ends so you're short 8 hours. They work you (3) 10 hour days and then work you (2) 6 hour days or less so you don't get overtime. "
bad,This was the worst company i've ever worked for. Hostile work environment everyday and not a shred of positive reinforcement or compliments.
bad,Hate this company. It is a company that doesn't care about its employees just the fact that they arent good enough and the customer is always right. That is not the as as they are mostly wrong.
bad,"I wouldn't ever return here if my life depended on it. "
bad,"I can't begin to describe how much stress this job put on my life. Every management employee was extremely degrading towards every associate, even in front of customers."
bad,"inflexible company, not resourceful the company just cares about the money it is making and not its workers. forces employees to sign up every customer for staples card"
bad,"Management is absolutely ineffectual, coworkers are relatively useless, the work is droning and soul sucking and everyone who ever leaves staples can confirm that working there is not enjoyable."
bad,I loved working for them at first but as the years went on the company took a turn for the worse.i will never apply there again.. not a good place to be.
bad,Don't work at this place they make u work like crazy for nothing and associates don't get enough credit or a knowledgment for it.i worked for this place for 3 years and I never gotten a good raise or pay for it.thry make u work for a little bit of pay and they expect so much from the associates on sales that they threaten the employees if they don't make certain sales or reward sign ups they get fired for it which is dum cause u can't force ppl to sign up for stuff u can't force ppl to apply for a credit card and u can't force ppl to buy anything in staples cause they prices are too high that's y everybody goes to bestbuy I would never work for this place again and they are threatening to close the company down in 7 years so this job is not a guaranteed stable job please please don't work at this company .they make u work like crazy but then they taking priveledges away and accentives away from the associates
bad,"This company is a joke period. Their print department, not only cant generate revenue, but they cant train their employees properly. "
bad,They cut hours. The co-workers are cool. The managment is horrible. They would only hire you for seasonal then fire you without warning.
bad,The sraff at Staples are not properly trained and yet there is no hesitation to throw us into the thick of things. It's always trial by fire. The Edgewater NJ Staples has a GM that is hopelessly inept. The pay is atrocious; everyone is hired as part time.
bad,Don't apply if you value your health and sanity. They use you awful and stab you in the back. Had to go on stress leave because they bullied me about my health problems.
bad,"they say full time but unless you are one of the managers, you get anywhere from 10 to 20 hours a week. no formal training goes down, basically got to learn on your own. put you in charge of stuff you have no idea how to do or how to work things."
bad,Lots of fun great cause for children. Of course some abuse the system but nonetheless its really great to give a helping hand.
bad,I worked so many hours with no help and I had no GM in the store all the time. I was getting paid a lot less then what I should have been getting as an acting GM for the company.
bad,"I don't recommend working with this company,in the interview they let you feel that one day you will be the ceo of the company but after the end of the busy season which is October to december,they start giving you an other face which is,if you like it OK  if not you can  go."
bad,"All they care about is number and sales, they don't show there employees any respect. You will be lucky if you even get a break unless your a manager."
bad,I worked here for four years because my manager was like a second mom to me. She helped and taught me things no one ever did. She took a chance on me and showed me how to step my game up and move up the corporate ladder.
bad,"Managers are very biased, not very multi-cultural at all. You can cut the tension with a knife as the workplace is mostly dominated by women. Worst place i have ever worked."
bad,"Customer is always right even if they're jerks.  Employees treated like garbage and made to take mean awful treatment of management and customers.  Busy day in Copy & Print and it takes a long time to learn ""the ropes.""  I learned a ton about letting some things go and how to make the customer happy.  Great experience with technology and equipment.  Most of the co-workers are awesome, fun, and hard-working.  Unfortunately a lot of lazy employees are drawn there and the rest of us suffer.  Really enjoyed all the new things I learned and how work with people and their budget needs.  Loved having authority to lower Copy & Print prices or give things away."
bad,"I have actually worked in the Basildon Store and leaving was the best thing i done.  The new Management team are a complete joke.  Who allow bullying on the shop floor, as long as all targets are met they don't care, The Weekend staff are lazy and the week staff are overworked."
bad,"boss is always smart mouthing off, very pushy , changes schedule all the time go from 30-40 hours a week to 6 hours a week :("
bad,"I worked at my location for 4 years. I got promised the Inventory Specialist position and took it. I was informed a few days after I accepted it and was told that the person I was going to be taking over ""changed his mind and didn't want to leave"" so I didn't get the job. I worked long days, and felt as though I was getting nothing out of it. The company would make us degrade ourselves on a daily basis. Last back to school season they made us walk around the store, doing our normal job but with a backpack on, to try to sell more backpacks. What company allows this, let alone wants us to do something like that? Management is the worst part of this company. They're just there to yell at you and try to make their quotas. My general manager would lock himself in the office for hours, and claim that he was on a ""conference call."" I was then fired from the job because I had gotten into a horrible car accident. I had sprained my ankle and I came into the store to let my manager know what had happened, and she told me that I had given up my job and that I was being terminated for a no call, no show."
bad,"Most days at Staples were hard and long. The store always seemed to be understaffed. As a copy center associate, you were always working alone. There are multiple occasions where there would be a long line for customers who needed your assistance. It was hard to get customers out in a timely manner by yourself because most tasks were time consuming and daunting. Summer was the worst time of year to work because of the longer hours, greater demands, and the unreasonable work load. The management team always seemed to be overwhelmed by their understaffed stores.Most customers were unreasonable. Frequent customers were often kind and understanding. The store seemed unable to keep any manager or any employee. The surviving co-workers were kind and we often bonded on the terrible work life. There was nothing enjoyable about this job and I do not want to return."
bad,"terrible, the managers only care about themselves and what benefits them. They are very unorganized and if you go to school they do not work with your school schedule and refuse to show respect. I worked for one who was very disrespectful towards females and now only wants males to work for him. Its beyond degrading and sucks.Out of any of my other jobs I did I will NEVER NEVER return to this place of business."
bad,"The managers are lazy, rude and abuse their power. They don't care about the company or their employees. I felt very unwelcome and uncomfortable most of the time."
bad,Very difficult to move forward in the company and pay to work ratio was way off. I was doing ten thousand dollar print orders and making 10.48/hour.
bad,"Staples typically hires only 1 full-time associate, and 2 part-time associates for the Printing/Marketing Department. No more than 2 associates working at 1 time. Overstressed and underpaid. Rarely are these associates professionally trained in any prepress courses. The department turns away to much business because of understaffing and lacked training."
bad,"When you are managed by a person that isn't even qualified to do your job it makes you wonder about the future of your position. I'm glad I got out early after being hired into such a messy situation. Basically, an Administrative Assistant is in charge of a group of admins divided by regions.  That Admin is given a ""Admin Manager"" title and delegates work that he/she doesn't comprehend or know where to begin to tackle.  Sits in an empty office and stares at the timekeeping system to track down who was minutes late or has a half a second of overtime and writes people up.  "
bad,"If you are looking for a Temporary Job with room for improvement and benefits look somewhere else, inequality is practiced and not a rewarding place to work."
bad,"Staples is one of the worst companies to work for on Earth. I was an inventory specialist there and they expected me to perform miracles with a poverty level salary and no support from upper management. They work you to the bone, don't show any gratitude, and kick you out the revolving door at the whim of the district manager so that he can hire his homeboy buddies. Stay away from Staples!"
bad,"Horrible store to work for, has a dumb assistant manager with a garbage attitude that likes to play stupid with you. He is not flexible with your schedule and makes you work on days you requested off months in advance. i wouldn't recommend anyone work here, nor shop here either. and if you have a family emergency nobody will even call your family to let them know something happened to you.it has happened to me."
bad,"Management strives to make easy tasks a very difficult one. Mgt generally doesn't know what is really going on because they generate tasks from reports and don't ever get involved in the physical labor portion of the job, and that's what really matters as it's a physical job! Ideas and efficient workflow recommendations fell on deaf ears and were never implemented. There were far too many egos involved to make a common sense initiative in workflow procedures. There was also a lot of favoritism towards particular ethnic groups of people that was very unfair; probably due to the majority employment of that ethnic group. And finally whenever the FC ""figure head"" spoke to the masses, he made it clear that employment at Staples was a 'choice' and you could choose to stay or go; which really meant that he doesn't really care if you stay or go not matter how good an employee you are. Because of this attitude and belief is probably why Staples is picked as one of the top five companies to go out of business in the next five years."
bad,"Put 3 Years in to that company only to be forced out when Manager #5 Wanted her friend to have my job, Short sighted lazy people unwilling to do the bar minimum of their jobs instead force people like myself to pickup the slack."
bad,"Case in point, it was more important to give a customer back their computer on time than it was to fix it, or more important to do training in the backroom away from customers than to help them. "
bad,"management is horrible, ive learned a lot from working here for over 3 years and am ready to find better work experiences."
bad,a typical day at staples for me was to make sure when checking out my customers they were happy with the items they were purchasing
bad,"I worked for staples for a brief period, however, I did not receive full training so constantly caught myself trying to figure things out, management at the time was always inappropriate with the young female cashiers."
bad,Is a good place if your a tech person or have the skills in office supplies. wasn't there long to know the store but it was ok.
bad,Do not work here. They will suck your soul and overwork you. The team completely depended on me to run my department and I was NOT compensated reasonably for it.
bad,Raises and job promotion was determined by personal feelings. Social settings and not work product were considered in making managerial decisions.
bad,i wouldnt recommend working here it was a very dull work place. my work gets done at any job i go to but it was very boring at the location where i was.
bad,I hated working here. I was new and taken advantage of because I did not know my full job duties. Was forced to do others jobs without knowledge.  Did not stay here long.
bad,From day 1 its been road block after road block. The store manger on my first shift expected me to stay an extra hour without asking me. He just said so your finishing 9pm today and i said no you told me 8pm over the phone oh well that not flexible now wheres you flexibility? He told me in my interview we'll give you proper notice of extra hours if we need people in but yet he just expects me to stay and hour without asking me first. The management don't communicate proper never knowing if the rota is lying because different managers are telling me something competently different to the rota. The rota is often changed without warning. Management have no sympathy if your ill or have a medical condition they will threaten your job when you come back to work from being sick(Severe flu or injury that stops you from standing up ect...). I was told i would be trained up for business machines after i'd learn't the other areas i wasn't and someone told me i never will they always turn down females for business area. The managers will shout at you on the shop floor or reprimand for the smallest thing in front of customers for something  you'd never even been told about or told the wrong thing by another manager. I would not recommenced this place to work if you still choose to work there because you need money look for another job at the same time as you will be miserable within few weeks.
bad,Soul crushing. A day there was hearing customers complain hearing managers complain not enough time do to anything correctly just terrible.
bad,"Staples is a company stuck in the 1980's, run by elderly white men who are out of touch with modern culture and innovative business ideas.  There is no advancement and no company culture."
bad,I was overlooked via promotion with all my excellent services and skills that I rendered unto that store and they fired me not giving me a good reason for firing me
bad,Company is going downhill. the health insurance is horrible. the coworkers are in cliques. the pay is alright for Florida.
bad,"This is quite possibly the most poorly run,  negative, unsupportive environment you could possibly work in. The head of the department has nothing but utter contempt for everyone working for her, and her method of ruling by intimidation leaves most of her staff sat at their desks often frightened of her reaction should your work not impress her."
bad,Staples is ran like a union or employee driven company. If you work for staples it will be the biggest mistake you ever made if you are a manager.
bad,I would not recommend Staples as a place to work.  They stores are extremely understaffed and have no idea on how to hire.  They do not treat they associates well
bad,"Working here is a bit of a joke. The management in Tracy needs help because they start drama. I hate going into work now. The co-workers are fun to work with but the environment isn't that great. No one stays at this job, only thing I can say it is an okay job for part time."
bad,"Staples has no real desire to help its lower end employees. That is why there is such an extremely high turnover rate. Especially at our local one. No help from management, and especially nothing from those above them."
bad,"Worked for 20 years, Since staples took over, the place has changed beyond belief, From a place people used to enjoy going to work, To a miserable place to be.Hence such a high turnover of staff. People in very well paid jobs are leaving, purely because they have had enough of the Staples way.Life is so much better, Not having to go there every day."
bad,"Since they took over Corporate Express. Staples ran there company of employees like sweat shop. I mean they took away bonus for the drivers, there were more than one on the job injuries to count. they hounded you all the time while you trying to do your job."
bad,This place is terrible for everyone who isn't management. Unrealistic expectations with borderline minimum wage is not conducive.
bad,"i try my hardest at work to give good customer service to individuals who need it my day consist of packaging, unpacking, stocking, and cleaning."
bad,"The management at Staples Inc. is not only unfair, but careless towards employees. It was not a comfortable environment to be in, however everyone is entitled to their own opinion."
bad,"I left within a year but learned new skills that helped me in my next "
bad,"I have never had so many issues with a company that I have worked with. Managers don't want to listen to the employees, they never had morning shift openings full time, part time hours were not good and the pay was ridiculous."
bad,"Upwards mobility and any work incentives continuously missed the mark at almost every level from what I witnessed. It was my understanding that they had to change the company moto from ""That was Easy"" to ""Make more Happen"" because of the high level of complaints about many of the stores services and procedures being frustratingly difficult for customers."
bad,Turn over was tremendous.  No one stayed long at all.  The new management is not trained well in the benefit of their employees.  They are unorganized and desperate for knowledge. They fire all that do not agree with them.  They do not wish to listen to experienced people who have been there for years  They think they are trained in the company's vision but do not know what that all entails.  They degrade their employees instead of helping them to their full potential.
bad,wasent provided with enough hours. Management was argumentative and rude towards me. wasent much training. glad i left the job when i did.
bad,"A great place if you only want part-time with little or no chance for advancement. The boss played favorites and actively pushed to remove the people she didn't like, even after multiple years of good service to the company."
bad,I worked at the call center in Halifax for over a year and has never seen a place where they all think they are doctors and make you feel like nothing. I had to go on leave because the stress they put me under to the point where my doctor permently put me off from there.  Run away and find a different job. ..don't apply
bad,"management did not care about the concerns of employees. took credit for others work, cut hours, did not promote with in the store."
bad,Everything sucked the store the management and the people who worked there were only out for themselves worst experiance and group of people ive ever had the displeasure of working with.
bad,"great work environment, with good management. start off with a daily review of the day before and set up belts and pallets to be broken down"
bad,"Most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with the customers.  I"
bad,"This review is based solely on the one store I have worked with for 3 years."
bad,"it was a decent place to work but the managers were terrible, and there was no room for advancement and i did not enjoy my time there."
bad,"Was alright for a while but the quality of work only relies on the managers there. Very numbers focused, very little pay and recognition for a lot of hard work."
bad,"Everyone is replaceable. You will be constantly berated for performance metrics you have no control over, Customers will be yelling at you because the ad is wrong or you were never sent the big sale items. You will have no control over any of this."
bad,As a cashier a typical day consists of assisting customers with purchases and inquiries.  Not a very exciting environment to work in.
bad,I was a part time sales associate there did not get any hours at all could not make a living off of it and there wasnt any spot for advancement no matter how hard you tried
bad,"Staples is an Ok place to work, the company will not allow you more then twenty five hours overall i dont really like it. i would love a new place of employment."
bad,If you are a computer technician looking for work then stay far away from this place. You will get hired for one thing then they put you somewhere else with no training then complain about your numbers.
bad,extremely unhappy at this company. It had nothing to do with the role just the company itself. and and and and.absolute rubbish.
bad,Not a good place to work if you are looking for a career.  Extremely high rate of employee turnover.  Most departments are run like fiefdoms.
bad,"If you have no other choice then sure, apply and work here.  The company is notorious for turn and burn."
bad,Worked there and hated it.  The managers only gives there favorite worker's the good schedule and gives them a growing opportunity. Manager lie and break promises of offering new position. If u want your life to be a waste of time and miserable work there.
bad,"Horrible management, very unorganized, 100% unprofessional."
bad,Worst Management ever!!!!! Worst Job ever!!!! steer clear of Staples DCS in Irving Texas!!!!!
bad,Not a welcoming work environment. I work in the copy and print center and they expect a lot out of me for the amount that i get paid.
bad,very bad management. no training. they would throw you on the sales floor and expect you to sell everything without any type of training or basic knowledge.
bad,"I worked at staples for 6 months. My manager and assistant manager would always give me more work then I could do. They originally hired me as an easy tech associate and they said i sucked at that so i was switched to cashier. Job was really stressful and they made you do three people's jobs when you were only hired to do one job."
bad,"Upper management very difficult to express concerns, and scheduling in rough"
bad,"Did the copy center position, mostly alone.  was only working part time needed more hrs, not available so left."
bad,"Management only cares about sales, not their associates. my experience was that if you don't hit your numbers, you are slowly driven out by having your schedule cut back so that you are forced to find something else to survive."
bad,"A typical day at work consists of large work load, with managers adding stress by constant berating, and keeping customers satisfied. I learned how to maintain machines, keep up productivity, quality versus quantity. Management didn't care about the employees but only about the customer. All of the co-workers felt like family. Hardest part of the job was having to keep up the high demands from the General Manager. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with great co-workers."
bad,"Management is horrible, pay was basically nothing, would not want to work here ever again."
bad,Glad I am gone! With a manager gnawing on tobacco all day and knowing WAY less than you about computers the fact that he gets paid double what you do makes you lose faith in a company that gave me a decent start.
bad,Very unorganized company. Constant changes last minute. Job life work balance did not exist
bad,"My overall review of Staples turned out to be very poor. When I began working for Staples in 2004 it was a great place to work with many perks. Advancement was encouraged and promote from within was Staples policy. "
bad,"I worked here 9 years and saw the company go through the changes.  The company is ran by old school retail people who are afraid of change.  They like to have walks consisting of SVP, RVP's and district managers spending all of their payroll prepping a store for walks and treating this like a military inspection.  "
bad,there was nothing enjoyable about this job. they were not very understanding of anything going on outside and inside the company. a lot of people seemed very upset with there employment
bad,"staples job culture is to run with minimal staff (2-3 people per shift)."
bad,"Well your day will start in a circle jerk with some rubbing and tugging and stretching. Real fun and productive.  Then the driver will check to see how many 1000's of pounds of product he will have to deliver."
bad,If you're in the store level you will be treated poorly. We had managers that would sell to some customer because of their race because she know they wouldn't buy a protection plan.  District managers would act as if they didn't know unless it was reported then take action.
bad,I used to over see the whole store and its operations. I learned that if you speak up to the wrong person that your job is in jeopardy. I think the company its self is a great company but the management at the store I worked at is horrible. I do not recommend anyone working there.
bad,"Do everything but get paid like a minimum wage flunky, get certified but don't plan on moving up in the company, you get no credit for even the best idea, everything great you do is a team effort but everything they don't like is a merit on your permanent record."
bad,"I started at staples in 2004 and it was a great place to work during that time,i had a great time working because if monthly bonus when and great boss and co-workers ..it's great until they take over corp express .we move twice within 2 years since they took over ce now we are at stoneham and i hate going to work everyday i wish i vote yes when the teamsters(union) try to come on board ..once i leave i will never step foot back in this company..please don't apply and waste your time ..Promotions is also very unfair don't believe in EOE from staples because it's BS .."
bad,"A typical day as a supervisor is always unexpected. Generally you will have the same daily tasks which can be drastically changed due to the customer crowd that day. You will eventually get in the habit of not allowing the day to interrupt what things you need to get done, even if you have to stay and get them done. I've learned at this job that you indeed can have an affect on people's perception of a signature experience. Every customer is different, what one customer requires you to do in order to satisfy their shopping experience, can vary from another shopper's needs/experience. You must learn to read customers and adapt to their needs very quickly. This will help you be successful. As well as managing your time. I enjoy my coworkers at Staples, they are like my second family. We often help each other get things done and take care of customers. The managers at my job do not provide job stability nor do they appreciate the hard work that employees put into our job, this would also be the hardest part of  the job. The most enjoyable part of my job would be meeting the budgets, goals and standards of the staples company! It always feels like a nice pat on the back!"
bad,Copy & Print is a very busy part of the store. We are always multi-tasking. There is always something to be done.
bad,"I would never recommend working for staples.  They were filled with both ignorant management, and favoritism everywhere.  There was no chance for moving up since every position was tightly held by people who where not willing to do more to advance.  If you have a choice, stay away."
bad,"Management sucks."
bad,Not a good company to work for if you are trying to build stability and have a career.
bad,I had a bad time. The manager was rude. I did not enjoy it at all
bad,"Before being bought out by Staples in 2009 i was with corperate express,which was a company who seemed to care about the employee. always had the drivers back. When Staples took over they changed the whole culture of the company and basically everyone is just a number. It seems like there goal is to get rid of really good drivers and keep the ones that are not as good. They dont care about the person as a human anymore, they only look at you as a number and like to micro manage every step that is made. Managment became like robots. I will say this. Atleast one supervisor cared."
bad,"not very good communication skills."
bad,"High pressure, low pay, poor management, zero communication, no support."
bad,I worked for a year an never moved up in the company and they never had any hrs to give me
bad,Working only for back-to-school rush was horrible and I didn't like the job that well!
bad,1st day of training I was harrased by the HR specialist on pulling out my note book taking notes and excusing myself to the restroom POOR BUSINESS
bad,i was an easytech the mangers all they care about is selling warranties and selling fixes on computers. to sell warranties you have to lie basically every time and also to sell fixes on computers. i saw many times coworkers purposely lying to people because they do not know anything about what they are getting. Also the mangers constantly do nothing and never tell you what you do good only what you do bad. also the raises they give workers are terrible i got like 10cents after one year. Overall if you think this is a job for you just run and dont stop. This job is not worth lost time with friends/family. it only gives you a headache and also if your scheduled lets say 8 to 5 many times they force you to stay longer because they never have enough people working. this is almost as bad as working at mcdonalds. if you ever get a rude customer and defend yourself it will always be your fault. they also constantly accuse there own workers of stealing.
bad,Staples is not a good company to work for. There always doing changes that don't work. There's a lot of favoritism.
bad,I worked for the company for a year and a half. I started out as a associate after 4 months of working very hard i was promoted to the Easy Tech Expert. I was the expert for 13 months the company did some change and add new job titles so in March i was promoted to  full time team supervisor. A new general Manager come in to the store and started to hire new people he hired a guy for the expert position that I was. He was then promoted to full time team supervisor but the full time was already fill by myself. The new general manager started making deals behind close doors without my knowledge.
bad,"This place is not a great work enviorment. Management doesn't liston to anything you say until it affects them, hr hotline is located in ( india) so if you ever had to call they wouldn't have a clue what's going on in the united states because their over seas. The hr lead at the watehouse is just as clueless as the people in india. This company you would think has grip on things but actually they  don't. They tell you all kinds of lies to get you intrested in the job but they are all lies. They hire drunks & crazy people who have felony charges after say'n they dont hire criminals. The hours are horrible 1:30am til 6:30am but don't think your leaving at your actual time beause trucks always run late and they assume that you will stay instead of asking"
bad,"Too much focus on inventory with no inventory team."
bad,"It was a easy job. It required you to use a lot of conflict resolution and management skills, so that was a plus; you got to hone your craft, but overall the job was not for me."
bad,I didn't enjoy this job at all just a pay checksadfsdfadsfdsfdsfdsfasfdsfadsfsdfdsfdsfdsfds
bad,"Low pay, rude customers, long hours etc. blah blah blah blah blah"
bad,You can work your whole life here and the whole time you work there you are under appreciated and management probably won't remember your name.
bad,I worked in the tax exemption department. I was put down by my peers for the way I dressed. 
bad,"Sloppy and lazy management, unorganized and not clear on how to run a large corporation. I dont blame a company for wanting to grow but I do blame them for being greedy. It has cost a lot of good people their jobs for no reason. Pay is terrible by the way. I was never paid my mileage for training. There is no excuse for that."
bad,"Staples makes their money through selling over priced office supplies and now technology.  The one problem Staples has as a company is the vast amount of overhead from keeping stores running, while they are essentially pushing pencils out the door.  They will try and minimize store expenses to such an extent as lining the walls with plexi in all the back offices of the stores i have been to. They also do not compensate their employees fairly, which is no surprise to most, but they also expect the world on a silver platter.  When you fall short and you are allowed to work 20 hours a week, getting paid 7.35 per hour, they will make you feel like the one who isn't performing.  The managers can be very manipulative, and are always loyal to the company. The structuring of staples is set up so the manager or supervisor is the only position you can start and advance in.  They would rather hire from outside the store for management, than promote from within like most businesses (the grass is always greener mentality). The structuring puts entry level employees on the same level as everyone else, (even if you have been with the company for years) and it was recently totally changed in order to cut jobs and save money without just coming out a saying it.  They eliminate positions and change things around, so always be on your toes.  From working for the company in two locations for about two years i will tell you this- It is a great job for a kid in high school, but if you are an adult and you want to put food on the table, this is not the company to work for.  They will ring you dry"
bad,"I wouldn't wish this type of torment on my worst enemy! The SICK SAD PATHETIC EXCUSE FOR ""MANAGEMENT."" At this STAPLES in VISTA is COMPLETELY UNBEARABLE at times. The ""GM."" Is so locked in his own lil world were NOTHING MATTERS BUT HIMSELF & MONEY of course! The obsession with MONEY & over charging the customers & NO SUPPORT of the employees at this store is discusting. I Ran the entire copy center, with a lil help from the other employees here & there, BUT CERTAINLY NOT FROM ""MANAGEMENT."" I'm talking everything! Took orders, produced them, greeted customers, maintained a friendly rapport, tryed my hardest to keep our business customers, made sure the center as clean, made sure the ""managers"" were ordering the CORRECT products. Made. Sure the machines were running correctly, made sure all of the production center jobs were being sent to the correct places & made sure they were being delivered on time and on and on and on..."
bad,"Staples is a company that promotes you if you don't question anything and do what the higher ups tell you, who knows who, not the people who work hard and question management.  My experience with management was typical corporate America, no brains, just do what you are told.  I have a hard time believing that Staples is in for the long haul with their practices, they are forcing the hard working people out because there is no chance for advancement.  I exceeded their weekly budget for 5 years and never earned a chance for advancment, their bonus program is a joke and this year they raised the weekly budget by $1200 to $3000 a week, so in other words you get to work harder for the same low pay.  I would never recommend working here, unless you know someone up high."
bad,"everything was bad, bullies, bad management, didn't learn anything."
bad,"was not a very nice place to work, no one was friendly , and only worked part time with only 10 hours a week if that much"
bad,very very dangerous place to work.
bad,"The managers were horrible, my coworkers were all men. Very poor organization when it came to inventory and damages."
bad,If was not for recruiting some quality associates everyday would have been unbearable. Senior management was very aggressive about results and force store level managers to take drastic measures with performance management if associates did not attach products to individual sales when the customers did not need or want the products. Associates were afriad of being fired if they did not attach sell or upgrade customers. Labor contranstrants were difficult to deal with. It was nice to have a break room for associates.
bad,"changed management too much never know who is in charge liked schedule duringslow times,on yourfeet 12 hours,was not allowed to talk to people much"
bad,"Although they are one of the leading businesses when it comes to customer service, Staples is far from perfect when it comes to their employees. Not enough hours, not enough workers and poor treatment from management makes working for this establishment almost unbareable."
bad,"Store level management is OK. Corporate could care less about you, what you are doing to help the company, or your excellent sales record. They only care about numbers. If you DO accept a position here make sure you are ready to get written up and yelled at (yes yelled at) for not selling enough warranty plans or tech services. If you are a cashier, make sure you are ready to get written up for not passing out ""Free PC tune up cards, offering the pen of the month, walking the customers bag around the counter to them (cashiers in my store were threatened to get fired if they did not do this), ask for rewards sign ups, etc. if you get 3 write ups, you are fired. the compensation system is a joke. they offer insurance but the deductible is set so high its usually far more than most hourly associates make in a month so it is basically useless. on a lighter note, my 3 store managers were pretty good and understood the problem was not the employees but the corporate structure. if you are desperate, go ahead, but honestly only look at this as a temporary job. start looking for a new position after your first day at staples."
bad,"This place shows no respect for the ""new guy"". They are more focused on sales then customer satisfaction. They are willing to lie for it. If you value your dignity, do not work for staples."
bad,There has been a huge turn over of management there. You are suppose to be customer service orientated but they make it to where it is almost nearly impossible to help a customer fully.
bad,I was working there while getting ready for graduate school. The management was horrible. I would never recommend this company to anyone seeking employment.
bad,get to work early
bad,By far the worse work site ever.I loved working with the customers.But managment behaviours were completely and utterly unprofessional.I gladly left and would discourage anyone from working there.
bad,I was an easy tech there they decided to write my number on a cabinet so everyone called me
bad,"At Staples, you will be treated like dirt. You will work very hard, receive peanuts for a paycheck, restock shelves, management that only care about the register not being short, deal with rude customers, listen to horrible songs on repeat, receive one uniform shirt, pick up after messy coworkers"
bad,Can be fast paced at times but there is not enough support from management.
bad,"i didnt have a great experience there,but its a job.management at the time didnt give great incentives to perform the job.co-workers was ok."
bad,Went in there with the promise to get the Customer Service Lead Position.
bad,"This warehouse is a joke. Management is useless, they will lay you off for no reason especially if you are a male they only keep on the young attractive females. Most unprofessional buisness I ever worked for"
bad,Could have been great. Management couldnt get it together.
bad,"I worked at Staples for almost three years, I started at 8.00/hr and ended at 8.50/hr, and I was the top sales man. Management does not appreciate employee efforts and is never satisfied. Half of the time they have no idea whats going on."
bad,I took this opportunity based on the financials of the company and the new division being opened. That being said this is nothing more that a complete mess at best. Compensation is horroble with no growth opportunitys; business is constantly being lost due to pricing being at times 3 times higher than the competition. They do not know their market share nor their place within thier market and for this reason I am looking for a change.
bad,"dont really want to write a review but it kinda sucks depending on where you work, its a small starter job"
bad,"The Aurora Colorado call center isnt the best place to work. Management is horrible, they dont offer a flexible schedule for employees that go to college and want to better themselves. The customers are ALWAYS complaining about backorders, missing items, and orders not being delivered. Management trains customer service reps to lie to their customers regarding the status of backorders and deliveries. Example, ""I apologize, you should receive that item tomorrow"" or ""The backorder will arrive in the next few business days"". No one ever verifies if the products are actually available or being shipped until the customer calls back the 3rd time upset with every one in the building!!! One manager stated in a team meeting, ""If we get rid of backorders, I wont have a job."" Worst job I ever had, they want a lot out of you for very little pay and bad benefits. Pay not worth the stress! Almost every csr and supervisor in the bldg walk around with an attitude, no one seems happy, EVER! Nice facility but the atmosphere isnt positive. Csr starts at $12.00/hr and raises are VERY little, benefits could be better!!!"
bad,they treat you like an unwanted child because they know you need the job. you don't need any education (not even high school diploma) and they don't do background checks or drug tests. they know if you stay employed its because you don't have any other options so they treat you like dirt and HR doesn't return calls to you they tell management to keep their people quite.
bad,"typical day spent walking on eggshells and teaching the HR Manager how to do her job; they are so unprofessional, they tell you personal and medical business and doesn't promote farly"
bad,Terrible place to work. The pay is bad and the work they make you do does not match the amount of money you make. Management are backwards.
bad,I was an Easy Tech at Staples. My hours would change weekly from 32 to as little as 10 hours a week. I worked there two years and my wages went from $8.63 to $8.74. Not a job you can support yourself with.
bad,"very bad management and scheduling, unfair work conditions"
bad,I worked nine years for and i will say that i hope no one has to work for them ever again.
bad,I was sexually harassed by a female. They made a story up saying I was a racist. No questions ask I was terminated
bad,"Typical day at work consisted of stocking product, and taking care of customers. To bad not everyone agreed with that. There were many co-workers who would not stock product, and caused others to do it for them."
bad,Staples is a company that takes terrible advantage of all employees. Who are lower than management.... And most management personnel have very little respect for store associates. Who do 98% of the work.
bad,"poor compensation, age discrimination, only likes to employ young adults so they can pay them less. they won't let anyone advance up or take on full time hours. management does not care abou it's employees or praise them for excellent work done."
bad,"i worked at staples 11/09-07/11 i thought it would be similar to working at circuit city but the management team really doesn't know how to run a show, one manager is so angry all the time he barely gets within 10 feet of a customer and starts complaining about them, if you want to advance yourself at staples dont bother working hard or anything like that just get all buddy buddy with the managers and they'll promote you over everyone else who busted their hump trying to get that spot."
bad,"Worst company I have ever worked for. Unethical business practices!!! When they acquired Corporate Express (a company I respected & had worked for 6 years) they were hostile, verbally abusive, told us we were over paid and required us to work hours we were not paid for."
bad,"It is the worst company you will ever work for. The managers are glorified associates, and you will never really be recognized. The pay will be below most any other job you can find with the same or similar title. If you are trying to get technology experience as a technician for P.C.s you might be okay for a very brief period of time, but the pressure on you for what little reimbursement or incentive they will offer will be entirely incongruous to the value of that experience. You will probably not even get breaks."
bad,"the freshly trained management is so poor, they will forget to schedule things or even cut your pay without a notice. they will terminate you without a witness. Environment reminds you your in a minimum wage job and nine dollars an hour is not wages for Easy Techs that work there. They will make you work every department some days and will never consider a differential, not to mention encourage you to quit by giving you only nine hours a week."
bad,"Company full of money grubbing corporate nonsense that wants to pat itself for being ""customer forward"" when it isn't. Overpriced, under paying, don't waste your time."
bad,I was hired for one position and on my first day I was put into another area and was shown videos and when they were done I was told to just jump in. everyone in the area had there own way of doing things which lead to quality issues. it was too fast pace for anyone to show you anything. when I was put into the area I was hired for. it was the same thing. no help and I was written off the schedule without any notice or any feed back of what I was doing wrong if anything. it mainly had to do with my age and disability.
bad,If you’re new to sales be prepared to make phone calls all day and be calling the same list of people over and over again. It’s outside sales but my manager would only let us be out in the field if we an appt.
bad,"All around Staples is a great place to be and shop however at the location I worked at in Branford, CT it was terrible. First month in and 5 people left and the remaining workers were left to struggle and come in for absurd hours all for minimum wage. Also the store was a mess and workers threw overstock onto of shelves without organization.Management was so poor that the third month in the manager got fired for fraud."
bad,First my boss sexually harassed me for 2 years before I finally got a witness that would help me.  Upper management did walk the loser out of the store BUT not too long after I bought a computer on employee purchase plan and a month later my night shift premium was cancelled.  I quit! Without sending me a bill or an account number to pay they sent me to collections. Very bad experience
bad,"The last few years management at store level and above were terrible. No one is trained properly, no manager seems to know how to do things to assist."
bad,"Wages are far too low for the position."
bad,"Ever since Staples failed to buy Office Depot and got bought by Sycamore Partners, the company has been on a downward spiral to destruction. Management has been desperate to make money even at the store level to the point that they withhold information from customers to sign them up fore a More Account (Staples Credit Card) and downright lie to customers to make a more lucrative sale."
bad,Everyone is very judgemental no training on the job they just expect you to catch on and there are no hours and barely anything to do besides bts. Once they decided they didn’t need me they tried to find reasons to fire me as if it wasn’t already a second job...! Lol bye bye staples
bad,"If you are a full time worker you cannot exceed 3 absences in the first 90 days even if that means you are in the hospital and you gave them written proof. I started work here September 5 and got fired November 29. A week before I received my .75 cent raise. They used my attendance as an excuse although I was told they were all approved, due to being in the hospital. It’s a bull job, with bull managers that know nothing about managing a work place."
bad,"Management is a huge issue here. They were looking for someone to cover weekends. They barely trained me on the floor to make sure I knew what I was doing. I got yelled at and pointed out to other co-workers for having bad numbers even though the manager kept swooping in while I was making a sale and stealing it from me. The managers got annoyed with me whenever I'd come to them with questions, yet they'd also get annoyed with me for not asking questions. They also never bothered to work with my schedule even though I'm a Music Major and I told them that at the interview and there would be times that I wouldn't find out till a week before. They acknowledged that during the interview and held it against me at my FIRST PERFORMANCE which is A PART OF MY GRADE. If the management loses their free time, they'll throw a fit and make you take the fall for it even if you did everything you could. This isn't even every issue I've had there. Never work here. Seriously."
bad,"I was hired as part time but most of the time worked 32 to 38 hours"
bad,Not a good place to work. Not a good work-life balance. Stores are understaffed and district managers expect supervisors and managers to get all the work done without going to overtime.
bad,I worked at Staples for 6 months before I told the manager that I had enough of his BS. They don't pay well and they lie about everything just to get you to shut up.
bad,When I 1st started it was a good job I began in shipping and in the first  3yrs a got  good raises and becoming a production center expert management was good and very knowledgeable about print production  but then they got rid of them and started bringing management from retail it was all down hill from there
bad,"Blatant favortism"
bad,"Constantly told conflicting orders from managers, always asked to jump on in other departments I was not trained in and upon a task not going right subsequently blamed for it.  While my lack of knowledge for that department was always brought up whenever I’d be asked to cover.  Was saddled with many managerial duties without compensation and when I inquired was simply told we’re a small store everyone has to pitch  while many others just skated and were not assigned extra duties.in"
bad,"Does not care about employees. Management is a joke. Would not recommend.  Does not treat everyone equally, "
bad,All management suck they never listen to the employees you make a mistake they give you coaching they don’t  appreciate the good thing but the bad thing they come fast to you manager from bulk  the guy is two face he doesn’t care about the employees they’re pro company They DONT HELP YOU FOR NOTHING ...really bad environment
bad,Travailler chez Staples chez rushant ils ne voient que de faire des ventes et visent à faire de l’argent tout en diminuant les heures de travail et donc le service client en prends un coup et l’ambiance de travail aussi on se retrouve trop souvent sous pression
bad,"In my 15 years in the same role, I had 10 managers. The furniture management position was a difficult one to maintain for a period longer than 2 years. This revolving door makes for an unstable environment both internally and externally as customers would also be exposed to the constant management changes."
bad,"The job itself wasn’t terrible, don’t get me wrong. It was easy. I was mostly cashier, but I also walked the floor a lot and helped in the copy center almost daily. Management at the store i worked at is a joke. They don’t care about employees. The general manager is actively aggressive. The assistant manager belittles you. They wrote me up because I called off Saturday night for my Sunday morning shift. My grandmother had just died and I called off maybe once a month at most. If staples was the last workplace on earth, I would rather be unemployed."
bad,"There was an awesome manager in the Print & Copy Center he left due to poor management from his boss. The new manager to replace him was a bully & the worst manager that I ever had the displeasure of working for. I have been in the work force for many years & this job was me winding down my career. I was willing to share my vast knowledge & experience to make the Print & Copy Center maintain its successful production numbers. In less than 6 months he pushed out the orginal crew & the dept was down $60,000 from last year. One week he didn't even make budget. He's very unprofessional & customers are leaving in droves. Nice job GM.."
bad,The pressure you to feel that your store will close if you dont sell protection plans and get a 250 dollar market basket on a 50 dollar printer. Good luck if you want to work here. Stress is not worth it.
bad,"they'll find a reason to fire you when there isn't enough work for everyone to get 8 hours. They mass hire during peak season and start to cut hours when the peak is over. If you don't kiss up you wont move up. when they told me i was being terminated the reasoning was so dumb, i didnt have the strength to plead my case. I felt stabbed in the back up until i walked out of the door. I was free."
bad,"As a manager, I made a fair salary. However, I could not hire good salespeople due to the fact that they could go get an easier job at Walmart for more. Expextations for sales are crazy, and when you dont meet them regularly, you are subjected to constant emails and conference calls. Way too muchvmiceo managing makes it difficult to lead your team effectively"
bad,"5 years ago this company was great to work for, now high pressure sales, chasing after products that don't matter and Dm's, RVP, SVP that could care less.  pay is subpar to the market"
bad,when i started working there everything seemed great but as the days past i soon realized this place needs a lot of work. the bulk supervisor's and lead are horrible. great thing about working for bulk is that you can have your phone with you to listen to music while you worked. cafeteria was always messy. it is always cold in the warehouse during the winter cause they never turned on the heat and in the summer it was extremely hot.
bad,"Working in the Copy and Print department was honestly kind of fun (if you take out the part where you interact with customers!) just because of how much you get to learn and if you like being challenged. Customers were largely rude, as if the people working behind the counter were actually trained professionals who went to college for printing and not just teens and young adults working minimum wage. Discount was up to 15% off which wasn't really that profitable. "
bad,Working at staples Fulfillment center can be very stressful and it's very repetitive. There is no flexibility when it comes to your personal life. Working in breakapck is a an easy job but you have to make sure that you meet your production numbers every week. They do quality control at the end of night where you have to run for tickets which are orders where the product has been out all day. Some supervisors don't really care. The management could be better. Breaks could be longer than 30 minuets. Overall the breakneck position is very repetitive and you do get tired throughout the week and they still expect for you to reach 85 lines every week.
bad,"Management was horrid! which in turn made the whole work environment very bad. Everyone was totally out for themselves, and corporate could have cared less.  There was no corporate presence which allowed the store to be run very poorly.  High pressure put on every employees to hit management goals. While managers sit around checking personal emails.  I would not tell anyone to work for Staples"
bad,"1) Growth limited... or nil "
bad,"I worked at Staples for 3 years as a Tech Sales Associate(I quit a few months before my OFFICIAL 3 year mark). The company isn't part of the union and will make it very clear from the first month you are there how much they value their employees. You will not get past minimum-wage, whatever the minimum for your state it. They push unrealistic sales goals on ALL employees and don't even incentivize your hard work. You're job is to sell as much useless add-ons to the customers as you can. We call this ""building the basket."" "
bad,"Don't go there... while it may not be so bad for other people my experience was not usual. I was demoted from doing the thing I loved to do cashier which was not why I went to college to get a degree in "
bad,"Poor Management. unorganized . promise, promise, promise.. lack of communication , no information on job sites, customers don`t know that we are in route."
bad,"Bad Work environment, most workers who were promised jobs were replaced by robots. Supervisors were not helpful often rude to employees, and would not help only jump to conclusion that it is their fault."
bad,"Staples was okay for college only. The pay was very low for all the work we did and the management wasn’t very supportive of the staff. We had to go above and beyond to sell credit cards, liquid armor($30), Square Trade, and other plans. It was so stressful because when the corporate people were snapping at my manager, they stressed us out to make goals. We had to do pull list everyday and go up ladders for extended work. The minimum pay was only $9 an hour when we were doing super extraneous work. The management also played favorites with hours and they allowed certain people to do what they wanted. Overall a decent place to start off but after a while, you’ll probably seek more for yourself. Btw, the discount is 10%"
bad,"This is a job for college students, a temporary thing you shouldn't stick with for very long, though really, you should never start."
bad,"Staples was a great place to work. However, There was nowhere to advance in my position. No matter how hard I worked, I was only seen as an Admin.  I went back to school for my Master's Degree and still no advancement. Booooo Staples."
bad,"feels like high school all the associates gossip manager is very rude and isn't professional and not easy to talk to "
bad,"Typical retail environment. Low pay , low or no benefits, fixed schedule, no advancement, at the mercy of seasonal flow when it comes to hours available. Overall would never work there again."
bad,I did not like working at Staples They did not care for professional  and experience input. They paid minimum wage for professional work experience. Some managers overstepped their authorities
bad,"So many people quit or were fired during the 3 months I worked there. I was constantly hit on by one of the managers, I couldn't even leave because I was trapped behind the register ALL THE TIME. A terrible environment, the only way I bonded with coworkers was by complaining"
bad,"Hostile and unfriendly employees, terrible culture with no room for flexibility.  You must be robotic and not display an individuality.  Customers are not their priority because they strangle you in red tape"
bad,"Management was not good , u did the managers work why they sat and did nothing to help you , people are cut throat , Best part of job was clocking out"
bad,"Copy and print is to stressful not enough help, district manager has no clue on retail store manager has no clue on copy center so if you get backed up and you will expect just stress."
bad,"Very stressful working conditions for my department, harassment was a very typical thing to come across daily this was reported to superiors, working hard hours commonly, very hard to adapt if you were not used to it."
bad,"Each business unit is extremely disjointed and does their own thing.  Similarly, all the systems supporting the business are also very fragmented.  Not an environment I would want to return to."
bad,"Staples management doesn't care about you, it's as simple as that. They will work you into the ground and expect things from you that you simply can't accomplish. Do not work here."
bad,Completely non or mismanaged. Continues trying to “get” one another. 0 team work. Lack of any discipline.  Morraly corrupt. Liers. Racist. Redneck good ol boy atmosphere. Total lack of respect for people in general. Every day is complete confusion and lack of planning. No organizations. Or organizational skills. You have to be a drinking buddy or friend of the family to hav any job security. Trash. 0 accountably.
bad,"Staples is not a culture sensitive work place, with no room for advancement unless you are particular type of person. The management isn't concerned with the individual growth as a person. They seem to hire people who really aren't qualified to do a the job. Most people are picked out of favoritism or nepotism. It was never good communication between the employees and management, and no matter how hard you worked for the company! Most times all of your hard effort was ignored."
bad,"No advancement, as part time you'll be given 16 hours, maybe 20 on a good week. Management doesnt treat complaints seriously, super lazy leads. Most employees just laze about during the night shift, and no one ever gets anything done, so the blame falls on the next shift."
bad,the store or company is all over the place and has no room for growth if you are looking for a place to not move forward staples is the place for you \
bad,"Not a very fair company"
bad,"Expect this location to be understaffed to the brim. Unprofessional managers, managers who pick favorites, and ignorant customers. Not only are you a cashier, but you have to answer the phone, pick up online orders, receive online orders from customers, while being all by yourself at your register while a line forms. They don't give you 8 hour shifts, 7.5/d so there's never overtime available (37.5/w). Breaks were never on-time, sometimes I wouldn't even get a break. It was an overall miserable place to work, never again."
bad,"This was an unpleasant place to work.  It was hard to get management to answer your questions, therefore hard to learn things properly.  Management is lacking in the training department."
bad,"If you are a liar, if you love to start gossip and love drama this is the place to work for you.  You will be lied to about this position, you will never have enough time to finish everything you are expected to do.   All you will receive for all the work you do is criticism and judgement.   The management at this store are the main contributors to the gossip line.  If you don't lie backstab or gossip you're not in the click."
bad,First 90 days they start you off at $13.10 per hour. After that its a $.75 raise and another $.75 cents once you reach a year. But let me be clear this job is very stressful. And they will fire you just as quickly as they brought you on board. They say they cross train ppl but its all a lie. Once your at a position its hard transfer to another  because other employers are trying to do the same. Plus its based on seniority and favortism. Upper management dnt care your just a number to them. Its even hard to tlk to HR ALSO. Your supervisor have to handle all issues first which is dumb if they dnt have the direct answers you need
bad,"Working at staples has not only been a learning experience but it also has been rocky.. The management at the Staples  is really ridiculous. If you do something wrong the managers will talk about you and pretty much laugh about it. Also, when you talk to the General manager about an issue you have with another manager nothing gets done. I have had friends come up to me talking to me about how their jobs have been threatened because a little mistake. Trust me the mistakes were small not like something a company would fire you for. Also, working in the copy and print department at the store is hard and way more stressful than it should be. The supervisor is rude, you could make a mistake and he would be sarcastic about it. The pay isn't worth the stress.."
bad,"Only 4 people get full time and they are management. I was lucky enough to be one. Still as management I only made $12 and hour. Every non management employee makes minimum wage and 30 hours a week or less so staples can mark them as ""part time"" and are not obligated to pay benefits. Part time employees had rotating shifts which made it impossible to have 2 jobs which is what is needed with no benefits and 30 hours a week at minimum wage."
bad,I loved my job Being able to create the art of production with customers was amazing to know that the customer was comfortable leaving he order in your hands and believing that the project would come out perfect was a real joy
bad,"all of September is pretty high pace which is expected because of the back to school season, I didn't learn much but i understand that discrimination against darker skinned employees is alive and well and theres only 2 black employee for affirmative action reasons i assume. the high expectation of ""work pace"" for the horrible pay is a joke but not ""everyone"" get that same treatment. Ironically i got a along with all of my former co-workers but to the managers SHAME ON YOU for your blatant favoritism and LACK of professionalism."
bad,Managers have no interest in helping the employees. Any retail associate is forced to shill products that they may hate. Tech associates have more responsibilities than most other associates. They essentially work 2 jobs for a low wage.
bad,Early mornings with people already outside waiting to get in. I learned about products we sold and how to purchase/ return. Management was poor they typical stayed in the office and became angry if you had questions to ask. The culture was all over we had many different types and cultures of people. The hardest part of the job was dealing with expired coupons and meeting quota even if people didn't come in the store. The most enjoyable part was the discounts.
bad,"Had to relocate about an hour from home for the job.  The commute killed my car, so I had to buy a new car not having much money to continue buying beaters from Craigslist.  Job does not pay enough for my rent, car, and other bills needed just to get to work everyday.  I ask for weekends to get a second job, I'm denied.  I ask if they are willing to work with hours of a second job, I'm denied.  I ask for a raise and I am denied.  They won't pay enough nor will they work with you regarding getting a second job just to pay your bills.  Was just nothing but stress and no payoff."
bad,"While I was employed here, I worked as a Fraud agent. The position was pretty straight forward and unlike most call center positions I was not restricted to just taking phone calls all day, I normally had phone shifts and had ""outbound"" work to complete as well. "
bad,do not do it unless you really have too. its all about selling ESP's and ripping people off on computer repair. all the big companies are like this. better off doing this on your own.
bad,"management isnt too great, pay is minimum wage, hours are limited to 25, and nothing but drama. Very customer oriented so don't let them catch you not smiling."
bad,"Better quality leadership"
bad,"Co-workers were unpolite, managers were rude and not organized. Very lackluster of an environment. Someone was always doing someone else's work."
bad,"There are 2 versions of this company: One version gets to participate in regular company events and activities, social networking events, have a good work/life balance, etc. I have no idea what departments these are..."
bad,"Working at Staples is a good place to work at if you need money. Especially in the Seattle area where the wages are up to $13.00 an hour....."
bad,"My time at Staples was honestly unpleasant, however it certainly help me understand and better myself. I was a certified technician for Staples and worked as part of Easytech, because of my position and certification I was able to work on-sites independently and efficiently. Unfortunately management was the determining factor as to why I left. From the day I started I was the only one assigned to the tech department and when we were staffed I had little to no official training. A typical day for me was to manage different stages of diagnosing and repairing personal computers as well as attending to customer needs regarding technology sales. The most enjoyable part of my job was by far helping and assisting customers regarding specific products from finding a simple cable, to picking out the right PC for them to fall in love with. I enjoy talking to customers about security and protection for their PCs as well as taking the time to break it down for customers to understand more challenging topics. This job however helped me learn more about my interests so for that I am quite thankful."
bad,"It's been like 6-7 months since I worked there and at first I loved it a lot. The problem was a few things. Keep in mind I struggle with severe anxiety and clinical depression so if it seems like I'm exaggerating that's why."
bad,Understaffed. Unorganized. Very unprofessional. Managers need way more training. Especially on how to talk to customers AND associates.
bad,"Was hired for the 2015 back to school time. Applied for the copy/print center. The interviewer only wanted to interview for the cashier/ retail sales associate position. Back to school season was busy, busy, busy!!! They would only have 1 person on register while the other associates hid somewhere in the store. They kept me on register and I couldn't learn anything else. They really pushed the staples rewards card. They force you to stay after your schedule to clean the store and bathrooms."
bad,"Staples is not a company I would recommend to anybody. I was promised a higher position in the store when I was hired, and about 8 months into my job, I finally inquired as to why I was never placed in that department, and instead placed as a cashier. I was told we needed more cashiers than we needed people in any other department of the store, which I understood. After awhile they did move me to the department I was promised, and I worked over there for about two months and I still hadn't received a pay increase, even though the job I was doing was increasingly more difficult than running a register. When I inquired as to why this was, I was told that because I still covered gaps on register in between cashiers, I could not get a pay raise. Then without warning, I was told I was being removed from the higher up position and placed permanently on register. I worked for that company for over a year and I got a 5 cent raise during the 17 months that I was there. The hardest part of that job was when I was working in the Copy and Print center. There are so many different types of prints you can make and it is very, very difficult to keep all of them straight sometimes. The easiest part of my job was when I was working register, which should be pretty self-explanatory."
bad,"General manager knew absolutely nothing about the store and the district manager knew it. Customers would ask her questions and she wouldn't know the answers so she would yell on the radio asking for someone to come help berating us all for not already being there. All associates would have their phone out at pretty much all times, no one cared and no one enforced us to stop. The only thing the store cared about was having a password to open the bathroom door, and the keys on the keypad didnt work all the time so sometimes you had to stand there for 3-4 minutes trying to open a door while a customer/family is waiting impatiently glaring at you. Horrible environment overall, none of our machines for unloading and loading in the back were operational. 2 of our 5 ladders were deemed unsafe and locked away, so we had 3 ladders divided among typically 7 or 8 associates walking around the store at all times."
bad,"I understand not all stores are run by the same people, I have to say my experience at the store I worked in (mountain home, ar) was Awful! by far the worst job in retail I have ever had. I was the inventory specialist and had little to no training, management that was clueless, and was thrown under the bus within my first week of being employed there. I also felt that the management had their little niches and favorites and I did not feel comfortable or secure in my job while being there. I had left a job with decent pay but poor management thinking that it was going to be great there... Just needed to put in some work to fix the problems the previous IA had left, over the course of several months of not doing their job... I felt that I had been totally screwed over by a car salesman into buying the crappiest car on the lot for the worst price! However, having that horrible job left me with motivation to go back to college and find a career... I feel much better about the future... I now have a better job, with a lot less stress and I will never regret my decision to leave Staples."
bad,"Honestly speaking, the only good thing about Bureau En Gros are the employees. If not for them, I would quit the same day I got hired. I CLEARLY specified in my resume that I'm looking for a full time job, and they still called me for an interview where they offered me a part time job, where they GUARANTEED 25 - 30 hours. I wasn't really mad, because that would cover my basic costs, so I accepted."
bad,"I've been with the company going on 3 years - and in that time frame, I've learned every department. I was given a promotion twice, however both times I was forced to step down from my position since the company does not allowed full timers to limit their available times, AT ALL. I have a small child that is in daycare, and when I voiced that a change in my SO's work schedule would mean that I would no longer be able to work past 4 pm, I was told that I had the choice to step down to a part time position, or be fired completely. "
bad,"It used to be a good place to work with a lot of room for advancement, but over the last two years it has gone down the tubes.  I am in management now getting paid 11.50, working 40+ hours a week with benefits that pay only 20-50% of my once a year doctor visits.  I get two weeks of paid vacation per year after nine years of work.  I get thirty minutes for lunch as a manager. There is only ever one person in each department at any given time and in the mornings, you are expected to be cashier for the first two hours that the store is open. If there are more than two customers in a department, you are expected to pick up the slack."
bad,"Staples has change a LOT of things over the past few years.  Most of the employees I worked with have quit in the past few months because of this.  The have changed a lot of their prices for tech services and even have a 3rd party company doing the computer repair remotely.  They take WAY TOO LONG to get started and get the repairs done and it has caused tension between the in-house techs (all have quit except for me, but I will be leaving soon).  The customers aren't very happy with the repair times and sales have dropped.  The new manager doesn't know how to run the store correctly nor do scheduling, because he will have only 2 people opening sometimes at 9 AM and no one else scheduled to come in until 2 or 3 PM.  Customers get upset because there is not enough employees to wait on them.  We have lost close to a dozen employees because of this because they are sick of how the new manager is running the store."
bad,i work there as a certified tech in easy tech. don't like it. Warranty sales are more important than working on customers pc's. they threaten that they can fire you if you don't meet warranty sale goals. not sale goals but warranty. they don't care about selling a computer or printer unless it has a squaretrade attached to it as well. they actually get upset if they sell it without a warranty. but i will be fair. management is mostly understanding when you need something. and they are nice most off the time. but again they just want warranty sales. co workers are nice and cool thou. customers are so needy and soo stupid. they don't have the ability of figuring out themselves and always ask for help (which takes you away from work and management gets upset that you didn't get your work done). they don't even know what there doing or want half the time. and there so rude and inpatient. if your an IT technician the i DO NOT recommend this job. its part time and they pay low. but if your living with your parents and are studying IT or to get your A+ then i recommend this only if you live with your parents and don't pay any bills.
bad,"Management make their own rules, like I left early because dad was sick, they gave me a behavior instead, not an attendance thing,called over the phone n told me you were terminated, that's how staples Orlando fc treat their employees, plus too much favortism at that place ,supervisors work around 65 hours a week n get paid for 40 hours,they add rules to the handbook, hope the Orlando fc goes union, it would become better for everyone,faulty equipment, the maintenance personnel fix the industrial machines, like they are pros, I bet you they are not even certified, have big  holes in the back wall, OSHA should go there there could be a serious accident or death,"
bad,"I was an Easy Tech for the entire time I worked there and it was a huge pain. Every customer knew nothing about what I was talking about and acted even dumber when I explained things. I could never get certified to repair computers, but they had me do it anyway. Pay kept the same no matter what, management chaos, and extreme lack of communication between employees."
bad,promised a full time job but no one tells you they close down in june 2015
bad,"A typical day at Staples was good at first, but after a while i resented coming to work. I took a minute to figure stuff out because I was not properly trained and my manager blamed that on me. I learned a lot about people, customer service and how to be a better retail employee. The management there was awful. When I first met him he was polite and professional. After a few weeks it was easy to tell he was actually a bully and although his first impression was good, he was someone who took his bitterness out on everybody else. I asked for a day off of work and for three weeks straight I got 8 hours a week. My co-workers for the most part were awesome. Helpful, polite and understanding. One in particular was flat out rude, but there is always one in the bunch. The hardest part of the job is when the manager was in a ""bad"" mood because that made everyone else's job that much harder. The most enjoyable was being able to assist customers and work in a place where your co-workers made it a fun environment to work in."
bad,"Micromanaged company!  "
bad,"I was the bulk driver ,my job was to deliver the bulk orders to our customers in a timely and professional manner. I was suppose to be in at 5:00 a.m. so I could load my truck and get into Boston Because one of my accounts was Brigham & Woman's Hospital. I was suppose to leave at 5:30 am. so i could beat the traffic into Boston. They never had me ready to load the truck until 6:00 am. So I ended up having to deal with the morning commute and I wouldn't get into Boston until 7:00 am. The management staff was M.I.A. most of the time. They all seem to run the door after there 8 hours were up. Sometimes I would get back to the hub and there would be no management staff at all in the building. It always seemed that when you had a heavy day they had no extra help, but when you had an easy day they always had someone to help you even if you didn't need the help. The hardest part of the job was trying to get everything delivered in an 8 hour day. Most of my co-workers were easy to get along with. but some of them had very big chips on there shoulders."
bad,"Working for Staples is like the old song ""Smiling Faces"" because everyone is smiling as they misrepresent opportunity, and pay. You are expected to work very hard with little to no return. If you play games - are unethical - lie to your customers - you are valued - if you go to work to work and expect honesty for hard labor; you will be disappointed. Staples has been taken to court under a class action suit by former non managerial staff who were conscripted into managerial hours without the pay - staff was working over 90 hours a week without the pay - on a salary basis - not hourly - they lost their case. Staples routinely writes things in such a way as to take advantage of the employee and expects you to be okay with it - a court disagreed - and Staples had to pay out over 10,000,000 in back pay to staff who were non managerial, but worked managerial titles and salaries."
bad,"I would come into work and already a load of expectations was handed to me for the day. If something didn't go as the manager saw fit, he would criticize... and it wasn't constructively. You could write down your availability as often as you'd like, they won't abide by it. It's as if they knew you couldn't work certain days, but would schedule you for it anyway, and if you show up, hoping it was an error that would never happen again, they would make it a custom, and schedule you on your UNAVAILABLE day more often."
bad,"I first thought it would be a simple and fun place to work. I then discovered after about two days that they do not offer full time because they are too cheap to pay for the obama care law, the employees are very lazy, and the job its self is very slow not rewarding and a waste of time for the pay you receive. There was two employees there who did absolutly nothing they were rude to customers and showed no effort in the work place and was rewarded for theyr behavior. They are the reason I left."
bad,"I work at the Terre Haute D.C. and other than the pay it's a horrible place to work. They mandatory at the drop of a hat, if they think they won't make dispatches. Mandatory Sundays at six hours notice. The health insurance is overpriced and isn't good coverage. I feel sorry for the supervisors, management moves their work schedules around, one week they would work 3-12s then the next 5-8s! Unless your favored then management doesn't move you at all. Do your research before you waste your time here, you are a number here, not a human being. Worst place I have ever worked!"
bad,"I've worked for Staples for 15 years. In that time I have seen a shift from a company that appreciated its employees to a company that is only concerned with putting money into the wallets of its highest level management (not even a average stockholder seems to be valued). The corporate idea of lowering hours and benefits as well as the way the indivual associate is treated has degenerated to the point where job/ product training is almost zero, and the average emplyee is more of an indentured servant than a respected part of the company. It seems with the sheer turnover, that Staples might jst be leading toward using temp help. Over the past few years, I have seen many new faces come and go. Most came in with a very positive attitude and left with the polar opposite. It is unfortunate that Staples now believes that minimum wage requires 100% open availablilty in scheduling matters and that individuals who need even the smallest amount of accomodation (even for schooling that would be beneficial to one's position) should seek employment elsewhere."
bad,Whatever you do don't work in region 15 . It's the worst region to work in . No benefits throughout the company . Pressure in selling everything . Harassment the worst .
bad,"Worked retail before, but never hated it as much as I did working there. Customers would get upset because I was uneducated about certain products. 2 out of 3 managers there were extremely unhelpful when I needed them. Never again."
bad,"Great company to work for.....depending on where you work. If you are looking to work in South Florida I would advise you not to apply for a position there. I have worked for Staples for many years. I have given my 110% everyday. That does not matter to the people above General Managers. All they care about is micromanaging you, call you on your days off, constantly public humiliate you, your character will be defamed to cover the DM's job if his/hers job is in jeapordy. Its honestly not worth the stress, and the humiliation among your peers. Now Staples as a company has alot of great things in place. I see the direction they are going and they are going to be a bigger company than what they are now. Again Stay away from South Florida. You cant use any resource such as HR, LP, or even corporate because there are so many repercautions taken on you even if you are trying to do things by the book. There is a Staples way of doing things and then there is the South Florida way of doing it. Dont know how people can get away with so much for so long. Staples has lost alot of great people."
bad,"A typical day at work in staples is very hard always under pressure to get things that sometimes are not manageable, some times no customers in and the day goes slow. Doing this job at staples I have learnt how to work better as a team, how to keep problems to myself that are happening in personal life. In staples the management talk down to you as you are worthless, my co-workers are amazing always up for a laugh no matter what the situation in the store is. The hardest part of the job is the pressure that is put upon me all the time I no in jobs you do have some pressure but as of the pressure that is given in this job is over the top, also the store I work in is never busy or if it is I am always working on my own management ignores that you are extremely busy. The most enjoyable part of my day is when i am having a laugh with my co-workers and when it is nearly time to go home."
bad,"If you wanna be treated like you aren’t a human being from, not only customers, but co workers as well then this is the place for you! Yeah it’s flexible but definitely not something you can live off of. Most of the mangers suck, I had one fabulous manager thank god, but I can’t imagine what others had to go through & the things I’ve heard. Honestly the corporate doesnt care about you. They don’t even follow their own policies and make it ten times harder dor you when customers are being already being rude. Just ot worrh the stress to me."
bad,Large matrixed organization that struggles to work cross functionally and assign ownership. Too many decision makers from the top down and not enough empowerment. Not an organization you can trust and job security is a challenge. Lack of culture and teamwork resulting in high turnover and company struggles to find and attract talent. Do not expect the company to perform well and too many more successful competitive threats.
bad,Worst place I have ever worked.  Management is miserable and treat you like you are not a human being .  Favoritism is a huge problem here so if you are lucky you may get treated decent but most of us get treated like pond scum
bad,"just no. not a good company. not good people. not a good place to work. they eat people up, spit people out, and move on to the next one. 56k to start, 50 hour minimum work week, and lots of constant negative feedback."
bad,"They don't pay enough for the expectations they place on their employees, there are no opportunities to advance unless someone quits or gets promoted, even then they don't pay the supervisors enough for all the things they do. The only people that make a great salary are the general manager ($50,000/yr) and the district manager ($60,000-100,000). Everyone else $9-$11 an hour. Also since they only hire part time workers you don't get to put in to a 44401k until after a year, raises depend on the stores productivity"
bad,At first I was really excited about working at staples. After starting I was immediately placed on the register. I consistently asked to be moved to a different department so that I would not have to worry about hours. They kept blowing me off and eventually dropped my hours to 4 hours a week.
bad,They throw you in. No training. Expect you to just KNOW it all. The kiosks don't work most of the time. People don't know what printer they have. It's your fault. Stressful and chaotic.
bad,"The General manager can care less about you or anyone else personal life. He expects you to sleep, eat, breathe,live staples. noone work as a team. There is a lack of communication. The schedule is always off because they are not made probably and as much that is expected from the workers..The pay is just not worth it at all. Someone is always quitting. Management hire lazy people and expect 3 people to do everything. Very cheap and never want to hire anyone, when clearly we are understaffed.  The main complaint by customers is that the store lack customer service and we are very understaffed. Barely get to take a break and never able to clock in on time because management are always late. General Manager needs to be replaced because he clearly can't run a store. I do not recommend working here at all."
bad,Maybe it's different other places but my manager here was so inhuman and unwilling to communicate it was as if I had a machine bossing me around. Total disconnect from all his employees and chose only to speak with his supervisors in which he only berated them with complaints about not meeting quotas set by poor marketing teams. Management can make or break a job.
bad,"Great Company although the management isn't, the Fleet warehouse is being ran and operated by someone that doesn't have a clue about anything about what it takes to get the physical job done"
bad,"Na don't know about the management people."
bad,"just no. not a good company. not good people. not a good place to work. they eat people up, spit people out, and move on to the next one. 56k to start, 50 hour minimum work week, and lots of constant negative feedback."
bad,"I recently reached my 1 year mark and got a raise of 10 cents. I worked hard and dedicated myself but all I got was working every single Saturday, made to work harder than what I am paid for among other things. I do NOT recommend this job to anyone. They give false hope and don't seem to care about the employees. We are made to work harder for other people to gain benefits."
bad,"tons and tons of favoritism.  Supervisors harass on a daily.  No job security. working 40 plus hours, so if you have a family, kiss them goodbye.  If you're a female, You can honestly flirt your way to the top."
bad,Bad work experience at Staples redemption center...I was always a argument with the owner he would treat you poorly if you did something wrong...so overall it was bad
bad,"I worked at Staples for over a year as an Inventory Specialist. I have been a retail manager for over 15 years at other various retailers, This was by far the worst place I have ever worked. To start I was never really trained to do my job. The cashiers got way more training than I ever received. We went through 3 Store Managers while I was there and 2 Assistant managers. So I had to do my job which has all of these responsibilities plus also covering manager positions constantly and covering for cashiers and helping customers. Then get in trouble for not being able to meet deadlines for my own job, which I basically had to figure out on my own because I only got 1 day of training. Then there is the pay. You are expected to cover for all of the managers and do everything that they do for slightly above minimum wage. The amount of constant stress is ulcer inducing. So unless you want stress hives and ulcers, I would not recommend this job to anyone."
bad,"things were great while i was at staples, im still employeed but considering leaving after seeing my days shrink and a threat from gm to give me  just one day a week. i met some great people while i worked but the store manager should take a little more consideration into her employees. i have had 15 people leave/quit in my 7 months here and for the first few months it was stressful, but im a hard worker. i sold printers..and parts, but im more of an on hands guy and there is no greater enjoyment then working on a computer that needs assistance,"
bad,A bad Company to work for. Very favorable with some employees and not all. It supposedly be work life BALANCE but every day it's mandatory overtime. One mistake and you can lose your job.
bad,"Everything about working at Staples was everything wrong with retail in America.  The people who wormed their way through were the ones who got the promotions and the people who actually worked hard and understood things passed over in favor of brown nosers.  You were most definitely not paid enough to live, After working there for 3 years I hit my pay cap at $10 an hour.  Management had a cap of $12 an hour."
bad,the job got stressful in the end cause they didnt want to give us a severance pay we got a severance pay in 2014 the supervisors were fired and we had heavy heavy workloads
bad,"Working part time gives you a lot of lee-way, it's not great pay, but you have the ability to change or move your schedule with little fuss. Once you go to full time it all goes down hill. You realize that the company cares about its customers 100% and cares about it's employees maybe 15%. no schedule wiggle room. Veteran employees are treated as royalty and new associates are basically disposable. The customer is always right even if they are harassing associates and the ""big wigs"" care more about sales rather than the individual companies so good luck moving up as well as getting the required help. If you don't keep your numbers up, even if you are the ONLY ONE IN YOUR DEPARTMENT FOR 4+ MONTHS,  you are solely responsible for drop in numbers. Breaks and lunches aren't required, and honestly good luck finding time to go on them because its almost always understaffed and if a customers is unhappy because there is no one to help, maybe because your went on lunch, that's your fault. Stay part time. Flexible, routine jobs, breaks guaranteed, and you aren't held accountable for things completely outside your control."
bad,"Work for staples for many  years as a sales support lead primary responsibilities were planograms, cycle counts ,presentation, merchandise flow, At the beginning the  store was fantastic to work for. Then new management came on board And they did not care about their employees all they cared about was money. The worst part is they pick and choose who they liked if they liked you he got away with everything.  If they didn’t like you they treated you with no respect. I applied for multiple different promotions and got denied for all of them just because the  Manager did not like me after a while I’ll try to go back to the same company and they gave me some story  about  head office was dealing with application for my position if you want to be treated like a doormat and have no respect from others that staples is a job for you take it from me that’s been there for many years"
bad,"Job is not a good position to have. Advice stay away from print and Marketing department, never touch that job position. The new supervisor is good but the last supervisor that worked over it has been with the company for years was good at what she does but was not a good people person, unprofessional, shows favoritism to customers and other coworkers and will train you right depending on how she felt about you, if she didn’t like you, you got her bad attitude no matter how polite, professional you were too her and regardless of how good a job you did, bad mouth you to other employees, management and  even customers  as she saw fit too, could never please her no matter how good you did, she focused on the negative. Bottom line if she didn’t like you than that was that. You did the work of two or three people, with low pay, that position is $11.00 not 9.30 an hour for all of what they have you do. Even the polite customers could tell you needed help or knew you should paid a lot more for all the hard work you do. When your busy, the sales floor associates and sometimes not even management will help you when they know you need it, they just expect you to deal with it. Machines, (at the minimum at least one) malfunction week to week. The customers are the worst, they expect you to perform miracles as if your God from the stuff they bring in or what they ask for. 75% are terrible to deal with and come in angry or with a bad attitude, they can be as rude, and disrespectful  too you as they want to be and you have to stand there and take it and management will do nothing about them."
bad,"Poor management. Over worked for low pay. The amount of hours were hit or miss from week to week. High pressure sales is encouraged to sell extended warranties and company brand products."
bad,I worked at staples for over 2 years and I promise you the last thing you want to do is work for Dean at 0757 store number. Ive never worked for a worse and the whole structure of the company is in turmoil would not recommend wasting any time here
bad,"Starting about eight months back, this company (definitely my store) has become a joke. You will not get a raise, the laziest person  will be promoted, and the stores now believe the customer can die in a hole. "
bad,"Staples owner must have had difficulty managing time at work. His attendance/time reporting/work log-in's at shift time, was OVERKILL! Your badge coming into building is a way of knowing the time an employee gets to work, logging into computer is another way to monitor work start time and then finally phone log-in was one more time stamp for employee. If forget to log off of phone for lunch but log time going to lunch on computer, they would interrupt your lunch to come do it. Horrible place to work."
bad,"Hard working veteran employees being let go. Forced to push unreachable sales force things people don't want. And when you do get great sales there is no compensation, this should be a commission based job and is not. Continual employee turnover including management and upper management."
bad,"Working at Staples, it's like working at any other retailers. I don't have to much to say. The hardest part about working at Staples it that you have to coach a bunch of kids since retailers these days don't even want to pay minimum wage. I think the most enjoyable part about working at Staples was getting paid weekly. Employers don't pay weekly anymore."
bad,"Working at Staples for 2 years and in two different states I came to realize that they do not know how to employ proper management or train them correctly. There is very little room for advancement and or promotions in the company. They completely ignore hard working employees and rarely give recognition unless they are bombarded by their District Manager. I'm sure that there are other store without this issue, however I was not fortunate enough to receive those locations. If you decide to work at Staples, you will likely run into great employees who are fun and very helpful when asking for question, but do not expect your manager to be helpful in the slightest. Once again, I've only experienced two different stores and others may be different but take this advice into all of them."
bad,"From day one the women in the Copy center were terribly mean to me.  I wasn't spoken to or I was spoken to as if I were a piece of dirt.  At the end, I cried on the way to work.  I went to management twice to try to resolve the problem and frankly, I was verbally abused by the store manager and he denied that there could possibly be a p problem.  I've never, ever had such a bad work experience."
bad,"The company had a strong focus on meeting sales goals, to the point that store managers would encourage unethical and amoral sales techniques. Upper management was severely disconnected from the people working in the stores. I would regularly see my district manager yell inappropriately at store managers. BAD."
bad,"6 months ago I would have given high rating, not today.  Some one gets hired and they are given a promotion and full time right away while those who have been there and faithful are ignored."
bad,"I started 8 years ago at 25 cents higher than minimum wage. Since it was mid-year, I wasn't eligible for a raise til a year after that. I did get that raise, and then a year later, a second raise. Four months after that, minimum wage went up, and I was back to only 25 cents higher than minimum wage."
bad,repeatedly screwed out of selling bonuses and raises. constantly having to meet impossible selling quotas and doesn't matter what product works best they only want to push who they have the biggest contract with
bad,Do not work here bad management. i was accused of stealing a check made out to the store even though it was in the managers pocket. Job for students. Very slow
bad,Corporate has become detached from retail. Entitled customers. Management is lacking and rude. I have never been more insulted and degraded. Management also belittles and berates. Supervisor positions are not salary and what corporate asks they wont pay for the time that is asked of them.
bad,This job is never boring but management doesn't care very much about their employees. There is a lack of support when it comes to employees. The managers don't learn all the departments so are not helpful when you need it.
bad,"Low pay, too much work for 1 person yet they only schedule 1 person at a time in copy center, the busiest department. Customers are nasty and you are abused for the entire shift. Staples does not give raises, only 4 or 5 cents PER YEAR! They push you to sell but give you no incentive to do so. Everyone complains all the time and the employee turn around is ridiculous."
bad,"No opportunities to grow in your career.  Worklife balance is non existent.  The company frowned upon Leave of Absences, when employees truly had medical necessity."
bad,"Understaffed, underpaid, undervalued, and one step above paid slave labor. Staples is a too big to fail corporation so they have the profit margin to pay better, staff better, and manage better but greed and maximum profit goals always get in the way. They know it, we know it, and whoever created this review knows it."
bad,"The general manager of the Hyannis store is a monster. The man is unhinged. He makes life there so unbelievably miserable, that he is the main reason that I left as soon as I found another job."
bad,"Managing a team for Staples is more difficult than it should be. They pay less than other retailers so it is hard to hire in the first place. Then the associates are expected to sell so many items and offer so many services that it gets confusing for them. "
bad,"At staples outside of management cashiers/customer service reps. is doing too much work for not enough money! You have to ask customers for too much stuff before they can get out your line and go home or where ever they go when they leave staples. For ex."
bad,"Low pay, too much work for 1 person yet they only schedule 1 person at a time in copy center, the busiest department. Customers are nasty and you are abused for the entire shift. Staples does not give raises, only 4 or 5 cents PER YEAR! They push you to sell but give you no incentive to do so. Everyone complains all the time and the employee turn around is ridiculous."
bad,"It's hire and fire,  poor management,  politics in customer care.  HR is useless.   Old employee control and form groups,  new people are left out.   In three years 4-5 managers for the department this shows the strength of the department.  The company is sold not performing well.   Join only if you are jobless.  Management and staff not friendly or helpful.  Back bite, gossip, rude people."
bad,"The management is absolute trash, unprofessional and childish managers. Wouldn't ever work here again, wish I wouldn't have wasted almost a year in this company. Definitely don't recommend to anyone."
bad,"This was a mill, high turnover, no guidance, and a bunch of false hope. We were all hyped up that we were joining a new salesforce to help build staples business advantage  It was all lies, 2 years later, Director jumped ship and everyone was laid off."
bad,doing a lot of counting and trying to put items in the right box to be shipped. Never was trained for the job. like the hours worked.. did not like been watch as counting the item as to how many you can do in 1 minute.
bad,"Constantly being forced to take on more and more responsibilities with little to no pay increase. "
bad,"schedule, cash handling, operations of receiving trucks, sending damage merchandise back to vendors in a timely manor, custom furniture order, payroll, leader of cashiers and office supplies"
bad,"Staples is a joke that takes a toll on the American economy by paying less than $12 an hour for their technicians. No technician worth their salt would stay at a place that cheats them of what they are worth, so they attract low skilled techs that can barely perform their job duties or have extremely high turnover of techs that used it as a quick stepping stone on their way to bigger and better things. I would never recommend anyone to work here and I don't recommend using their services as it more than likely will end up worse than what it was before their low-paid hands touched it."
bad,"Poor management and stressful environment, management didn't care for their people, pay was terrible, and that is just a few things that make the place horrible to work at. This is also a reason the company is closing a lot of stores."
bad,"They expect you to sell your soul and care about the the company. I cared about my store and the people in it, but as far as Staples as a whole and helping upper tier management make increasingly higher wages while mine stayed stagnant. Awful culture"
bad,"youre expected way too much of you to be paid 9.10 an hour, you basically help give info on products, set up display shelfs... ring customers up... order new stock to the store... restock... unbox... get yelled at to work fatser and it is a never ending tale of just sadness"
bad,"Management went from one extreme to another. Either micromanage you to death or would not answer the phone when you had a problem. Only plus were team members. Many of whom they let go when they ""restructured"" and cut pay so no one can make a living there any longer."
bad,"Awful upper management! "
bad,I hate working here. Most of the managers are liars and dont care about you at all. I was promised to be a tech then tried to revoke it. They will try to use you wherever they can.
bad,Management does nothing to maintain employee relationships. I told my boss I had Rheumatoid Arthritis and was struggling to perform my duties as I was left BY MYSELF most nights.. nothing changed. I was forced to leave a job I loved due to horrible management.
bad,"I worked there for 2 years in a position I neither qualified for, or asked for.  I was hired as a Certified Technician (A+ computer certified) and was turned into a cashier."
bad,"My experience at Staples was one of the worst jobs i have ever had in my 46 years on this planet. They push for the addons to be sold like you are getting commission on them, but in actuality you get nothing for a $600 PC basket on top of a $300 laptop that you flight tooth and nail to get.. get a ""good job now do it again"" but if you don't you end up on the shame list posted behind the cashier's area that you are ""losing the company money"""
bad,"Was working for Staples part time while in school, was never supposed to be long term but I ended up working my way to management.  As a part time supervisor I learned a lot but it was time to go."
bad,"i worked for staples 2 different times, it paid the bills, but there was no advancement. and the company was going in a diff direction, it used to have 3 managers on salary and changed it too only the general manager as salary an the other managers went to hourly with a big pay cut"
bad,"Try to force you to push every service they have to customers even when they dont need it. Management is incompetent. Not enough workers, nobody knows what they are doing. its more like everyone is just winging it."
bad,"I worked for this company for 6 years as an operations manager and I can tell you I have never seen a more unprofessional company, managers that talk bad about associates and play favorites with the ones they got along with. I have seen people get promoted just because the gm liked them as a person while the person most qualified was shafted because they were not buddy buddy with the gm. Also as everyone knows staples is a sinking ship new managers are being promoted with less pay and thrown impossible work loads ""sell 7 liquid armors a week or you're fired "" words right out of the district managers mouth. Absolutely disgusting company it's good for high school kids learning there first job but if you're an adult trying to make a living stay far far away!"
bad,"As manager for this company, I found that as times change, culture does not, if you are transferred from the Northeast to the Southeast, you have to be prepare to radically adjust to a  very different environment and culture. "
bad,"Accepting a sales position for Staples, Inc. was a terrible mistake. That position was all-consuming and asking management for time off was always a headache."
bad,"Overall was a great place to work, had nice staff and good people. Management were very numbers driven and lacked insight towards training and employee development. "
bad,"Staples is very bad the management shows favoritism and based upon that it's how you move up. They are very rude and ignorant. They don't train , they make you do it yourself and when you mess up they get mad and blame you for everything. Terrible company."
bad,Not a good company to work for  the management  sucks  they do not help out the employee . They quick to fire someone. They are very  picky over who they want to  advance  no place for growth. They fired all the black people and keep the others and advanced  them  not right how they treat people
bad,Worked in customer services on the email team and is by far the worst company that I have been employed with. I handed in my notice and now work for a firm with a lot more time for staff. Staples concentrated too much on silly things rather than the important things and I have also noticed a lot of business has been lost. Many staff  have come and gone over the months and I can see a tough future ahead for the business.
bad,The work was terrible and we were treated like garbage. Only good thing was the pay. Their attitude was we don't care how we treat you if you quit we will hire someone else tomorrow.
bad,"In Staples defense, I took this job with the knowledge that the entire store was in the process of shutting its doors, and because of this transition, many things were probably running irregularly in comparison to a fully functional store."
bad,"IS really a horrible place to work, mostly because my manager is nuts, which is not a singular view of the person, but a consensus to the general staff. The GM before  actually ran the store into the ground, from what i've heard. So all in all it's the management that makes it a bad place to work at."
bad,"Even as the top sales person in the store, they still threatened my job almost daily. I was promised that if I stayed the top sales person for 6 weeks I could move to EZ Tech. After 3 months of remaining at the top, the job was given to someone else because they ""couldn't afford to move me off the register"" with the numbers I was getting. Customers in my town were demanding and abusive, no matter how accommodating employees tried to be. Management would always take the customer's side over the employee's, and go out of their way to make you look bad."
bad,"As a manager we were told to manage our associates for better productivity, but we ended being the only associates in the building some days. Constant cutting of payroll meant we had to do the bulk of the freight processing and cashiering, which did not allow much time for planning and managing the building."
bad,"A pathetic place to work here and your job would only last for 6 months. A revolving door policy and unrealistic targets and guess what the company is competing with other divisions of staples in order to bring in new business which creates a really bad impression on customers. You will go out to bring business but they usually are with other division for e.g  staples preferred so you can't touch them very frustrating as you want to work but can't.  The upper management at the mississauga office is ruthless and won't care, instead of retaining the employees and make some changes in their policies they would prefer to let you go and hire someone else. The sales managers are puppets and every one is trying to save their jobs. I have never seen such a high turn over any where else which clearly speaks of the company. Please don't waste time and stay away from staples advantage."
bad,Staples is not a good place to work. It hires very bad workers who are very lazy. They do not pay you well enough for all the work you are expected to do. I would not recommend anyone for this job at all.
bad,"was an assistant manager from day 1. no room for advancement even though they say there was.. always had my numbers and metrics in the green, but it was never enough.. i did not like to work there in the enviornment that they have created.. district manager was yelling at my store manager on the sales floor in front of customers, tried to yell at me but i walked away from him and proceeded to have the conversation in the back office away from customer ears.  this structure is a joke and i left based on that"
bad,announced the closing of all distribution warehouses in the country multiple store closings are on the way  there is a huge lack of communication with management
bad,"Though I loved the people I worked with, the company was actually really disorganized and shady with some of their decisions. They downsized and my position was eliminated, and I chose not to continue to work for them because of how the company operates."
bad,Both of these company's concentration on customer satisfaction is great. Management is outstanding here. They are all very accessible and helpful.
bad,"A typical day at work consists of long lines, getting frequently disrespected by both customers and managers, and no breaks.  I've learned that I absolutely loathe retail and customer service.  I worked there for 3 weeks without pay when I first started because the management was too lazy to punch buttons and get me enrolled.   The pay is weekly.  The managers that have been at this place for years are complete morons.  They talk to the associates like they are their children.  The employees are over worked and underpaid.  Most of them have another job (or two) to make ends meet.  The hardest part of working there would probably be the heavy customer service due to lack of employees on shift.  They want to make budget so badly that there aren't many hours to give out.  So you're pretty much on your own.  The least stressful department would be stock if you don't mind occasionally being talked down to like a remedial slave.  Worst place ever to work."
bad,"It was the worst job you could imagine: was getting paid lower than the staff who were over 21 and were doing the same activities. Manager was a fud, co-workers he only thing i enjoyed. Holidays were never noted by management: salary and benefits none. no chance of growth, ceo of UK didnt help with management. thank to france i left"
bad,It was a very stressful work environment because there wasn't any job security and no matter how much you met goals or expectations there was no room for advancement.  The employers lied to me on numerous occasions promising me promotions and opportunity to advance in the company yet never fell through on their promises.
bad,"A company defined by an almost comic display of ineptitude of and nepotism. Time and time again measures are enacted with little thought to cost or consequence. "
bad,"Didn't enjoy working at Staples, they threaten the employees with termination if they're seen even associating themselves with union workers."
bad,"My time at Staples felt like a waste, as I earned a promotion and than was shut down by all my managers when i thought of new ideas to make a day go by problems free."
bad,I look stressed  because of some customers does not mean i talk to them badly. the manager told me i am not interacting with customers in a good way but i helped customers the best way a cashier can.  they only give cashiers 6 hours a day. the cash registers are very slow and this annoys the cashiers.  i would suggest that no body apply in staples because the managers are liars and there is a very bad environment.I  never  had a hard time with cash registers but in staples i did.
bad,"Work was a pretty typical retail sales job for the most part."
bad,"Thinking cashier at an office supply store was going to be easy, boy was i wrong. First off no one communicates. Coming into work everyday I had no idea what was going on and the cashier before makes it look like they didn't do anything all day. Boxes everywhere, trash over flowing, ink cartridges everywhere, no rewards, just a mess. Once I clocked in the managers were harping at me for everything the cashier before me DIDN'T do. That's just the beginning. The managers are awful, not helpful, and so unappreciated. They shove sales down your throat and you don't make the  sale point, or rewards amount, or 'ink pass' or 'back to school pass' amount they want they pretty much tell you your jobs on the line. They have no sympathy with firing you. They're just mean and rude. And the schedule. Awful. They're not fair with scheduling people and don't switch it up ever. I've been there 4 months and i close EVERY SINGLE NIGHT. They hired a new cashier, 2 weeks into her job and shes getting double my hours and gets what shift she wants. They're not fair at all and aren't even willing to negotiate with you even a little. I honestly would not recommend anyone to work at staples. You're better off just going to some other minimum wage job. "
bad,First off Im gonna start from the interview.
bad,"I would generally come in to help open the store and the general manager or sales manager would almost always be late. The phone instantly starts ringing off the hook with tech calls which were usually people calling to see if we carried ink for there printer, but no one else would answer the call even though anybody can look it up on the website, instead they keep paging you to answer the call even though you are already with a customer that is in the store. Meanwhile you have to go through the inventory and fill in the holes, try to sell services you can't commit to having done in a reasonable time, unload trucks, help with the register, help customers with heavy purchases usually by yourself, build displays, deal with vendors, wait on management to get items that are locked up, and try to do tech work with limited and date software and hardware. At random times of the day managers try to micro manage the day"
bad,"As some others have stated if management doesn't like you then you won't get any hours. I've worked here for going on two years and I must say it's been hell for the last few months. My manger doesn't value my opinion, he doesn't give me hours, very unreliable and disrespectful. What's even worst is EVERYONE in the store agrees that everything I stated is true including other managers yet he's still a manager. I worked here out of convenience because my college is nearby but I don't get paid nearly enough to be belittled by anyone. Only positive thing is the coworkers and HR. They truly made working there worth it if it wasn't for them I wouldn't have lasted this long. As for HR once my manager started making work life unbearable (forcing me to quit) I called HR. They sent someone out and miraculously I was given more hours and my manager gave me more respect. It's a shame I had to do that for him to realize what he was doing was wrong."
bad,"palm, beach team manager is a not a good manager at all. Micromanagemer.... comp and benefits is very basic.. no advancement opportunity at all.."
bad,"Job description is very misleading, my job was nothing like I was interviewed for, management very poor, you never know when you are going home."
bad,Picked items that customer ordered put onto box sometimes u had to go to other locations to help when they were short handed
bad,"I really enjoyed doing my job and interacting with customers. However, my job was a full time job which last year was made into a part-time job. It was virtually impossible to do in 4 hours what it normally took me 8 hrs to do."
bad,"Staples is a office supply store that wants to be in the tech business. Hours are not good, pay is not great. Its a great starter job for someone that is going to school or has recently graduated from high school. Typical work day is to put away truck, help customers, do tech work when you have a chance."
bad,"follow people around, learn nothing,"
bad,Staples has no regard for their hourly associates. Management is like a revolving door and generally they know less about the operation than hourly workers. I worked for this company for 16 years and had perfect attendance for 11 straight years of that time. When they needed to trim hours they will dump associates that make top wages without regard for their experience or good record.
bad,This company is quick to burn you expectaion is to commit your lifestyle to the job which is fine going in and all they give back at the managment level but also will drop you in a heartbeat if something goes wroung they dont share the same level of committment to there people as they expect form there people loyalty does not go both ways word of warning when working for staples watch your back if you plan a long term carreer
bad,"Generally speaking, it's an easy place to work for. Most employees across the board are helpful. But as you advance, your pay will not. Your schedule lacks any consistency, you won't get a day off without trying to be called in, and you can get written up for about anything. Customer could say you were mean to them, and there's a write up. Weather it be true or not."
bad,"The customer are always rude (for my location in Coney Island). Due to staples being privately owned, they give you goals everyday to make the money and if you can’t they cut hours. When they do that, it’s a lot on those working there with no breaks and closing alone for the copy center. Half the time the machines never worked and often ran out of supplies. No one is crossed trained you help out so we’re just stuck there to suffer. On our feet’s first 8-10 hours straight sometimes with no relief and expected to bring in all this money for cmcustomers who don’t like spending money for anything! I disliked this job so much"
bad,"Management is only interested in selling credit cards and product protection plans. Customer service is not emphasized at all. The job is fine, but the metrics are unattainable and the atmosphere is punitive."
bad,"Managers disappear for hours on end"
bad,"When I first started at Staples I was excited, that quickly wore off. Certain managers don't care about employees. Day to day the managers give you vague descriptions on what they need you to do and get annoyed when you ask questions."
bad,Fast turnover wow this was a very tough position I would recommend looking elsewhere before accepting the supervisor  position here. Not easy work....
bad,They don't respect their workers or their opinion. They don't appreciate the time and effort you put in  and management is useless at recognizing your commitment.. I don't think I have ever worked at a place where I watched new employees become disgruntled in such a short period of time.
bad,"HORRIBLE Place.  They will lie to your face to get you to hire on and then deny everything.  Been there only 9.5 months, compensation plans have changed 4 times, 5 department let go,  and no opportunities for growth and advancement.  They do not look out for their employees and will do what ever for the bottom dollar.  Awful customer support and services.  IF you like to compete against your own people, company just to do your job and are comfortable lying, then you will go places at Staples."
bad,"Strategy is to continue cutting costs (and people), but not much else. Management changes their mind every other month. Zero teamwork across departments."
bad,"Worst place to work ever. Staples has lost its way, not relevant and a partial makeover does not buy credibility in the market place. The staff run the store, there are no repercussions for bad behaviour, pretty much every day the calls for “I’m sick and can’t come in” begin. There’s constant in-fighting, positioning for advancement when there isn’t any.  It’s hard to find staff to hire, harder to get them to stay or just show up for a scheduled shift.  IT systems are outdated, slow and pretty much shocking for a seller of “tech”. The company spends a lot of time placating to the store teams providing union perks without a union. If you’re management you’ll be run off your feet, your schedule will be erratic and you’ll go back in time instead of a modern workplace. Impossible to get real work done as all you do is cover for the staff who bail on their shifts."
bad,Was there between GMs so that may impact my experience. Everyone seemed to actively work to make everyone else's job harder. The interim GM was completely clueless.
bad,This company is not focused on customer service. It is bad enough that almost everyone is part time but the management actively undermines the retention of many valued customers in favor of signing up new rewards customers. The young kids who I worked with don't care and that is what you get by not hiring more full time people who would be more invested in customer service.
bad,If this aint your first or second job don't work here!! Terrible management all through out but cant speak top-head store management.  Seems easy going but its so ever not with soo much worse in store.
bad,Wouldnt recommend any one working at this location the work environment is not friendly. Managers are not fair they have who they want to be friends with and for get about others. Not a good working environment
bad,"Working for staples was perfect example of working for a large corporation the doesnt value you as an employee."
bad,"My job as a Computer Technician, was never really about fixing computers or anything like I thought it would be. The only thing I ever really did was sell computers to people and while doing this I was forced to upsell everything with it. The protection plans were as much as the computer itself. Overall, if we didn't make the quota on selling per week or selling Liquid Armor per day we got a talking to. I never really felt that my job was secure or that I had a comfortable working environment there."
bad,"On the corporate side of Staples, it’s all take take take. They want you to sell even if it means lying to people. The management is NOT trained and treats their staff like trash. They roll out one thing after another only to later say that none of it worked. I wouldnt recommend to this job to anyone with self esteem...this B2B side is a revolving door of people."
bad,"I worked here during high school (several years ago), and I believe the management has changed since then. But when I was a crew member here, the managers made work a living nightmare."
bad,The company is constantly changing and restructuring. It's hard to dedicate yourself to your job when colleagues are getting laid off all around you every other month. Job security is nonexistent and you are constantly concerned about when your time will come.
bad,No opportunities or training offered.  Does not value tenured employees.  Inconsistent policies and procedures.  Good people work there but there is no support.
bad,"When I worked at Staples there was 10 total people on staff pretty much the whole time I was there. I worked weekends while attending Purdue University. Two of my managers I enjoyed and I felt did a good job, but the GM was awful and eventually left out of nowhere anyways. It is an easy job but not rewarding or no possibilities for advancement."
bad,"Terrible pay, terrible management"
bad,"I've worked in print and marketing for about half a year. What I've learned is that the people you work with are great. Everything else... terrible. Being a part of this job made me question my morals every single day and made me feel like I was stealing from people because I was being forced to nickel and dime everyone for things that would take only a minute to do. I've always been a person who loved helping, and i thought thats what I would get to do when taking the job. However; the way it's currently set up you get paid next to nothing and still be expected to want to come into work despite the fact that no matter what you do is wrong, either to customers or to staff or to yourself. The way you get treated and worked is one that I would never like to do again. The managers work you so hard because of the fact that they get bonuses based on how good the areas doing. There's no hope of ever being a full time worker due to the fact that they just don't want to give out the employee benefits. "
bad,I would not recommend this job to anyone. The Kansas City Fullfillment center is the worst. They don’t care about you at all. Managers there are the worst.
bad,This store is not a good place for a first time job. The absentee store manager is not interested in helping the employees with training or giving helpful suggestions.
bad,"The work space is high pace, and stressful. Working in the copy center, you should expect to receive little to no help from management. You are given unrealistic sales goals, and are told to push ever service the store offers, even though your department doesn't. You are expected to get 80 hours of work done a week, with only 40 hours scheduled, and will get reamed for even a minute of over time."
bad,"Staples only cares about rankings on reports and not the employees that work for them. Staples does not support their own unless it impacts the people one layer above, making them look bad. Very much a protect your own rear end culture."
bad,"Did not like working here people were great, management was inconsistent and helpful at advancement in the company  my position was procurement and data entry"
bad,"I enjoyed working at Staples, but I dislike all supervisors who refuse to help Tech Sales Associate and Sales Associate, and leave them by themselves at the production floor without assisting them. Be careful working with employees at Staples. If you don't like supervisors giving you Write-Ups for lack of performance in front of customers in the store, then leave the store and the job immediately. If selling products is not for you, then find another job that makes you feel comfortable the most instead of working at Staples."
bad,I was a computer tech for about 6 months and was in line for the next supervise spot to open. I always handled the difficult customer because my then manager never wanted to deal with it. I always had to pick up their slack and always got yelled at by my manager. I was promised the spot for the new role since the supervise was leaving but found out it was giving to the store managers childhood friend instead. I quite.
bad,"I was hired as a sales associate but I ended up having to pretty much learn how to do everything. That may not be the case if you are in a large store, but if you are in a small or mid-size store you better believe they will work you to death. Oh and unless you're applying for a management/lead position, you will be part-time. The hourly wage was low and not consistent with the amount of work I had to do. My manager wasn't horrible but there was a lot of micromanaging going on. Oh and they expect you to sell their protection plans and liquid armor that NO ONE wants to buy since it is actually a complete rip off. But they'll still force you to push it on customers when they buy high ticket items. You have a weekly quota for rewards cards and ESP as they call it. And no you don't get commission for selling it, just a nice pat on the back. The only benefit was the weekly pay."
bad,"Well where can I start oh yea I applied for Cashier they always had me on office supply, even after I requested more days on Cashier but apparently they don’t care. The managers really don’t manage more like they do enough so they can seem like they are doing something. Hmm what else oh yea they have their own favorite people! Basically if your not one of them they’ll give you all the extra work just so the others can just sit back and chill, place needs new management or to be shut down corporate needs to be involved and I’ll be more than happy to tell my side of the store alongn with others who ARE LEAVING"
bad,"Manager hires people so much and there are barley any hours to share with all the new people they are hiring, so you lose your hours, or fired for not up selling these bogus too high priced screen protecters that literally nobody wants."
bad,I’m not sure where Staples is headed in the future but at the location that I worked for it was a small  Floormat store and the hours were 25 hours per person no more than that there’s no such thing as overtime. And when they need you you are expected to stay the whole day and sometimes you don’t get breaks and there’s not much reward for the hard work of selling.  Managers here come and go and when some jobs got eliminated they put them in higher positions instead of the ones that worked so hard for an advancement.
bad,"Regional managers and higher were out of touch and demanded too much towards store level employees. "
bad,"Staples is a dying company to begin with, so its no surprise how badly they treat their workers. People get fired for not selling protection plans often. People are all underpaid, overworked, or get no hours at all. They just push to sell, and even if you are the best at customer service, you probably wont advance. I know people who have been working there 15+ years and barely have benefits, and are still just a normal cashier. If you wanna work retail, I recommend trying somewhere else."
bad,Not a great job. If you NEED a job to just sustain you to the next one this will work as they are always needing more people because employees quit so quickly. But can help you stay on your feet if needed.
bad,"Supervisors make less than fast food workers, and despite promises of advancement opportunities and raises from management there is virtually no follow-through. Districts are bleeding management-level employees as current employees leave and promises of training and internal promotions are not made in good faith."
bad,"Typically a day began with your manager calling you in early and asking you to stay late to cover the shifts that are already barely covered. On top of that you were provided little to no help from corporate or any of corporate's ""support"". Managers were a revolving door along with every associate. Hardest part of the job was working your shift plus someone else's position. Most enjoyable part was closing time. Then you'd get to go home and brace to do it all again."
bad,"While it was a learning experience in and of itself, I would not recommend the job to anyone else. Management would seldom do any of their own thinking They would not give more hours even with having more specialized sales than others. Even when sales goals per shift were met, management confronts employees about why sales goals for the week are not being met - when the only reason is that they withhold hours from specific people."
bad,"my day would start off by coming in and helping out a customer by answering the questions I could, if I didn't know something I would give the customer over to someone that did. the management was very tough on workers."
bad,Literally the worst place i could've worked. Most Management is awful. There is no respect ever. And they make you offer things that they know are terrible products/services.
bad,"A typical day is always busy, you have to help out with cashiering, as well as keeping the department up to date on customer orders while also helping customer in self service. Hardest part of the job is sometimes you are on your own and it can get quite busy. Best part of the job is making a customer happy."
bad,"i used to love my job but new managment is making it hard to love my job anymore, and there is noone to go above him that listens very well either while hours are great and working around work/home schedule i s great."
bad,"It will be a good day if managers were to be more involved into things as well as supervisor they can all tell you what to do but wouldn't be hands on until it were a store visit. Some of the management team was helping and considerate of certain situations other just let them slide by and that's not how things should be ran as a company. I believe, it would teach you a lot if it's your first job so I can recommend this job to beginningers due to that it can put you on your toes and make you actually work and appreciate the experience."
bad,"Bad management, bad co workers, didn't feel like I was meant to work there. Only worked for some extra cash that I'd need. Not a lot of job mobility. High turnover rate."
bad,"The job culture the company presents to you during training does not at all match the the behavior, rhetoric, and philosophy of the management. Staples was a terrible working experience."
bad,"Didn't train employees properly, outdated systems. Management was inexistent. Manager would not keep employees under control. Managers made false promises to customers. Everyone just changed there schedule as they pleased. Store didnt have anything for customers because the store employees didnt even keep track of inventory."
bad,"Very poor management they have associates who have very shady background no serious   back ground check of the employees working there"
bad,"Staples used to be a wonderful place to work.  Leadership placed people in charge that quite frankly, ruined the company. There is no work life balance.  It is a toxic environment."
bad,"I'm not sure about other stores but when the staff come and go like flavors of the month you know something from the top down is rotten. "
bad,"Too relaxed, poor management, no room for advancement, managers with no manager experience and very unprofessional, high turn over, unrealistic expectations."
bad,"If your aim is low, then sure, go with Staples.  I was expecting to be a computer technician here, as an ""EasyTech"", but it's just a title.  Still just a salesperson.  I never like lying to people and that's all I did at this job.  The free test scan shows there are cookies in your system? - well, you should pay us to clean that up for you.  Even though the Windows 8 and 10 have Defender built in, they still push you to sell that junky Sophos.  You have to fill out a card everyday, keeping a tally of all the worthless services you sell."
bad,worked here for 9 months. was constantly verbally abused by my manager. favortism runs rampant here. they didnt pay me for my last pay. Filed a complaint with the nova scotia labour board
bad,My experience in staples is only catered to the location I was working for. I will not bash Staples Inc. as a whole due to the fact that my employment was ruined by poor management and a lack of Uniform.
bad,"Little to no opportunity for advancement, unlicensed technicians, basically this is nothing but a job for high school kids, hopefully only for those with enough good sense to get out before the terrible work environment claims another manager and they actually do, on those rare opportunities, go looking for new blood."
bad,Horrible place to work. You don't get hours to support yourself unless you're a manager and hours get cut all the time. You're lucky to get paid $150 every week. DO NOT APPLY!
bad,"Unrealistic sales expectations and pressure ruin this job. If you're looking for an easy part time sales job, look elsewhere because the amount of sales pressure put upon you is insane. When you fail to meet weekly quotas they cut your hours, and then when you ask for help and you actually have determination to improve there is no one to really help. The pay is unfair because you need to be very well versed with computer hardware (CPU's, clock speeds, RAM frequencies, etc.). If you do not know how to explain computer specs to a customer and explain the benefits of A or B then you will NOT be able to sell, and there is very little to no training on this. And on top of that you need to know HOW to sell, stock shelves, do pull lists, operate stock pickers, and book in computers for repair. The pay is unfair when you realize that the cashier gets paid the exact same as you but they just have to stand there the entire shift while you're overworked and running all over the place all the while your GM asks you ""why are your numbers are so low."""
bad,"Not an ideal job/workplace environment. Dis-organized and no job security. Managements mood changes on a daily-basis. Favoritism happens alot. Unexpected requirements/expecation at times (especially in the heat working in a fan-based work environment-(over 3 hours for last breaks). Say they are a equal opportunity employer, but management finds ways around it by retaliating in different forms. Severity/punishment depends on who you are in the company and work place."
bad,"Don't waste your time, they will chew you up and spit you out! They can always find someone cheaper to do the same job your doing!"
bad,They fired me for wanting to spend time with my mother on Mother's Day. Good as a start off job but nothing more. Management never let out associates on time and associates were forced to get home late at night.
bad,"Staples is a good company for people who don't have any work experience yet. They aren't a good long term job but for the collage student or anyone right out of high school, this is a good place to start."
bad,"Staples is one of the worst companies I have ever worked for.  You work really long hours and nothing gets done or completed.  You are always behind in tasks.  If you expect to see your family, you wont underneath the new management tiers."
bad,"I worked at Staples from June 2013 until the present.  First of all, if you think you're going to be adequately trained in the copy and print center, you can forget about it.  I sat behind a computer for a week, went out on the floor and got VERY little training from the copy center ""supervisor"" who was really enthusiastic about doing the training ( not!)."
bad,company does not stand by employees .and advancement is not good
bad,"The district manager and store manager were the worst managers I have ever had to associate with, demeaning, belittling, and arrogant."
bad,Okay place to work at
bad,"I have worked at more than one Staples, and I did not like either of them. One had great co-workers and horrible management, and the other had one decent manager, a negative manager, and a lazy manager (There are about 3 managers in each store). The first Staples I worked at would call me an hour before I my shift was to begin and tell me not to come in because they did not have enough hours. I never had that problem at the second store."
bad,"Staples is a great company to work for, however, the management in Brampton is terrible and failed to train their employees properly. they send employees to learn at another branch but takes no time to train on their grounds. No team work involved and the hardest part is coping up with all the work without being trained or teamed up with."
bad,Its a decent place to work but there more that is needed to improve the way things are done and how employees are treated.
bad,I was dedicated to my customers and my associates who were working for me.
bad,"These people think everyone is a criminal except about 4 or 5 of them that run everything because NO ONE in Corporate cares about what this handful of ridulous people are doing in Arizona. If you want to get anywhere, MAYBE it will work by sucking up to them, but truly, I doubt that will even work. There is NO LOYALTY at this place, anyone will stick it in your back at any time. They even act like friends to each other and talk about that person the first chance they get to someone else. Very ""cut throat"" environment and if they want your job, you can kiss yourself goodbye. I was never so happy for my 90 days to end and this temp job to go away. Oh, by the way, they are right behind a slaughter house and meat rendering plant. The stench is nausating almost on a daily basis. Save yourself the trouble of applying here unless you love to be treated like a criminal, watched at everything you so, even how many times you go to the bathroom, and watched daily by other criminals....."
bad,There was so many occasions where they promised me training for my supervisor position and never followed through. I had to be store manager and printing and marketing manager on several occasions. I didn’t have a team but had loads of work that caused high stress since I was supposed to have a team of 5 people. I commuted 2hrs back and forth to work for low pay because of promises made from corporate that never came through. I left after a new store manager of 2days(we didn’t have a store manager when I transferred there) chastised me about an order that was messed up although she had knowledge of our short staffing.  I have tough skin but the way she spoke to me was in a way that she was discriminateing and I wasn’t standing for it. I am so glad I found a greater experience elsewhere.
bad,Female employees start off making less than male employees who are less qualified. I(female)was hired from another companies management ranks at  $9.00 while my SO(male) with no management experience was hired at 9.50. Was promised to send me to management training program for 6 months before I told the store manager I was sick of being lied to and left.
bad,"Had a manager who changed peoples hours without their knowledge, spoke poorly of people and customers, was very unfair and his expectations. High pressure to sell protection plans and looked down upon if you didn’t force it down her customers throat"
bad,nothing really good about this job. Management is horrible. Don’t waste your time. I thought Staples Would be a good company to work for because the name holds weight but boy was I wrong.
bad,very bad company. they will use you like laundry until you can't do it anymore and then they fire you !!! poor management . managers are trained to put pressure on workers
bad,"the work-life balance does not exist, the management is poor, they don't listen to their employee, the worse place I ever work would not recommend it to no one, even though the pay scale is good."
bad,"The only good thing about Staples is their employees. The contact centre managers are slimy and constantly finding ways to try and make themselves relevant by micro managing everything you do. The turn over rate was low only because they were on a hiring freeze. BEWARE: no manager there is actually looking out for your best interest, do not let them hold you back from excelling!"
bad,Good if you go to school and need a job that is flexible with your schedule. No room for advancement after 3 years working there. Forget taking a break or lunch when you work in copycenter. Armenian assistant manager was always in the back eating even when a customer wanted to speak to the manager on duty. Once kept a customer waiting for over an hour because he has to take his last break. Never had the chance to take a lunch even when I would clock out and not get paid for it. If you decide to work here don’t take any negativity from anyone and don’t be overly nice.
bad,"The turn over rate is 100%. Almost everyone that works here has quit and about half had other jobs when leaving. The print area is the worst department. The pay is not worth the money because it is common for one person to be responsible for the entire department but the do not pay more for the additional work. When the department is full staffed, people will only get 8-12 hours per week. If you ask for more hours, the store does not have the budget but when everyone quits because they can't pay their bills, suddenly budget is not a problem. Also don't expect a raise or promotion. The store will train a new hire for a management position rather than promote an experienced employee, they are scared to rock the boat and move people into new positions. Also the raises are terrible, it's 7-10 cents per year. The store does give bonuses every quarter. When you meet your goals employees will get an additional check for about $80. If you do the math, it's the same as an 8 hour shift. So you can work your but off for 3 months and maybe get a bonus check or do the bare minimum for everything and just work an extra day once every three months. Also don't work about loosing your job, the store is so under staffed, they can't afford to loose people. If you are interested in a career with Staples, just do the bare minimum for everything and when you are ready for a promotion just transfer to another store and apply there. Your lack of effort or experience will have no baring on your chance of getting a promotion unless you actually care about doing a good job. Then you will be expected to"
bad,Run away from this company management sucks hr agrees with the head manager on everything and doesn't have the associates back on nothing supervisors are treated like associates from top management also
bad,"Constant change to roles and responsibilities makes it very difficult to get promoted or have a career path. Lack of support from senior management. Continual cut backs has resulted in the lack of resources, overbearing workloads, and a poor work-life balance."
bad,Management lacked communication with each other as well as with employees. Their open door policy is in place to create an illusion of a work culture that does not exist. Problems were never resolved
bad,Just another sales and retail store competing against other office supply stores. Depends on who the supervisor working is whether or not your shift goes smoothly.
bad,"Spent 3 years there. 1 as part time, 2 as Print and Marketing Supervisor. First and second GM were great, however; the assistant manager, myself, and another hourly were forced to run the store for 9 months without a GM. Uncompensated, and with nothing more than ""you aren't doing good enough"" from the district manager. Never good enough, and most customers were atrocious."
bad,They try but fail to create a well-rounded corporate culture.  It’s every leader for themselves and may the most pompous and cutthroat win. They advise not to mistreat your staff while doing just that to the salaried staff.
bad,This company is going to do itself in.   The management has no idea what they are doing.   They are constantly changing direction and no one knows what they are going there.
bad,"I gave them 5 stars for job security because I was 1 of 2 people who could actually perform my job (even the managers couldn't do it), and they refused to hire new people and refused to fire incompetent workers who lost us $1,000's. They pay you retail wages for a high-skill position."
bad,I choose not to speak on this.  It was good until we were bought out by Sycamore.  Staples No longer takes care of their employees.  The pay is not at a level that you can live as a single parent
bad,"Staples purchased the printing division I worked for, unfortunately, they did not understand the requirements needed to run a manufacturing facility.."
bad,unrealistic expectations for the amount of labor you are provided. I was responsible for daily operations. merchandising. coaching associates and meeting sales and profit goals.
bad,"Staples has been sold, it is just a brand name now. No control over what happens to its employees, no concern. Every higher up is just trying to save his or her JOB. They take your commission and raise metrics to be unobtainable, so you don't get paid. Doesn't matter how hard you work or how much you sell, they still find a way not to pay. Most crooked company ever.."
bad,"Copy center especially was awful, managers don’t help and avoid copy center at all cost yet expect ridiculous things out you. Whole store is understaffed to the point where a part timer is working 40+ hours a week. Pay is low and the highest raise you’ll get is $.20 a year. Stress from district manager makes general manager freak out and cause an unhealthy work environment. The people used to be great but now there’s just a bunch of people who don’t want to work but will blame others for what they should be doing."
bad,"Not so much for an adult with bills to pay. I made just barely above minimum wage, part-time in the Tech Department. Despite having the most tech experience out of the entire store, nobody actually cared about that or the customers, it only matters if you can blindly sell things. Nobody cares if you're great with people and bring business through building relationships, nor do they care if you actually make an effort to go above and beyond for the customers. If you don't sell enough product on the item you are selling, you will be looked down upon."
bad,Staples is not a good company and I would not want to work there. They do not care about you. We got a raise because no one was staying and people still didn't stay. Management always was looking to cut hours so they could get a bonus.
bad,"Do NOT waste your time at Staples. No matter how hard you work, or how hard you try, you will be berated for not being able to sell products no one is interested in buying. Double that if you're in management. Do not expect support from the company or working equipment."
bad,"The role is forever changing, you never know what comes next. Also the pay plan is impossible to determine, never had reports that could help determine."
bad,The job was only a temp job for me until I found an IT job but the Store Management was terrible but I did like my direct Tech manger.  Staples does not provide hardly any full-time positions and they had out hours based on how much extended warranties that you sell even if you are working late hours and other people work better times during the day when more sales are happening.
bad,It seems like the company lost it's way from being customer focused to being solely profit focused. The future to me is uncertain not that I am anyone to be the judge of that. I loved working there for the better part of 10 years but saw the continued decline in empowering team members to truly make things happen for the customer to focusing on sales or products based on profit levels instead of customer needs and desires.
bad,"A couple good mangers but others who pick favorites."
bad,"Staples became a private equity company and in the process one of the CEOs promised that part of the contract was to protect the employees of Staples. Shortly after they closed down the store and laid everyone off. They are continuing to lay off 100s of people and are using the phrase ""business as usual"" to excuse it."
bad,"Worked there for almost 3 years, management is horrible. You have your good days and you have your bad days, but the bad days out weighed it. Wouldn’t really recommend this job to anyone unless you want a temporary job"
bad,I had no working hours when I was scheduled to work they changed my hours and never called to let me know when to come into work only got 6 hours a week
bad,"When I started my time at Staples, it appeared to be a very family centered corporation with values focused on employee satisfaction and a good work environment. Three years later, it has become a bogged down, beurocacy full of distrust of associates l, and punitive actions against them. The culture has gone from friendly and warm to cold and alouf. Going into the call center was a dreadful event. In short, Staples has a way of making the able and enthusiastic associate into a second guessing, stressed out drone."
bad,"The managers are rude and give you dirty looks, they take their job way too seriously to the point where you get written up and yelled at almost every day. I felt more like a slave than an actual working human being. But the job itself is cool and nice to have but the management is so poor."
bad,This use to be a really good place to work but every thing has change all they want is cheap labor like every other corporation. We have had our pay cut four times in one year and were told to be lucky we have a job. I will see if that gold star they gave me can pay my mortgage this month.
bad,"Inside sales position, selling into mid-size business customers with the responsibility of growing book of business.  Metric of meting number of calls, length of conversations/live contacts. Management is stressed and overworked. Co workers are outstanding. Hardest part of job is keeping up with the constant changes to metrics. Management constantly threatening job."
bad,"90 % of the management are not good at their job. They fail to give structure to employee's work days, such as what needs to be done, etc. This creates a backlog in projects because the employees don't know what should be done thus they just float through their shifts and don't produce results"
bad,"The job itself can be fun. Fast paced, and great customers. I have worked at 2 stores. I liked them both in that regard. But after 4 years. I did not see one promotion. Most were new hires, everything up to assistant store managers. I watched many good employees get passed over for a new hire or transfer."
bad,"This company is going down, the staff is very rude and boring, theres no enthusiatic anymore like before. This is just a place lucky to being open still. I'd rather work for Officedepot/MAX"
bad,"I worked here for 8 years. Hours are bad for part timers because you cannot get over 25 a week anymore, (new company policy) so your hours are constantly cut while new folks get hired. "
bad,"At first, it was a decent environment but about a month later, co-workers began talking about customers (mainly females), management weren't organized, and the store was a mess. "
bad,"I enjoyed coming into work, I enjoyed that staples had a fresh look into customer relations. The managers I had worked with were helpful and friendly. Recently the company has shown signs that it has changed, not for the better. I enjoyed giving customers solutions and alternatives to problems and products they sought out. Now, however the focus is less on helping the customer then to sell them things that are irrelevant to their needs/wants. I enjoyed this job and the people I worked with, it was hard closing stores and saying goodbye to the people I had built great working relations with."
bad,"I worked at Staples for 7 months as a Floor Supervisor. There is NO training whatsoever when you start there yet you are expected to know how to handle all situations, schedules always a mess and late coming in. Bad pay rates and expensive benefits."
bad,"Staples is by far the worst company I have ever worked for. The pay is terrible especially compared to other companies, they will constantly give you 5-10 cent raises(one of my coworkers actually got a 2 cent raise!), terrible benefits, management is terrible other than the store manager and will throw you under the bus and the company doesn't appreciate anything you do. I honestly can't say anything positive about working for staples other than my coworkers."
bad,"It is easy enough to get a job. Say you can do what you are told. Wait through three days of training videos. The worst interviewer for the company will actively try to intimidate you. The best response is to laugh at his ridiculousness. He made a few people cry. I'm not convinced it is ethical. He says things like ""this is a hard job,"" and ""I don't think you can handle it."""
bad,"overall attitude has declined in last several years.three different comp plans for the same job. long hours, little reward."
bad,"Working at Staples was a horrible existence, management was nasty to their associates and never gave any hours to the younger associates. This job did teach me however to deal with customers in a proper and effective manner as well as how to operate a cash register and the essence of what a sales associate is."
bad,I enjoy the environment Staples provides for it's employees. The monthly celebrations and we are all excited about the end of the year celebration. Staples in like a big family!
bad,"Staff exhibited a general sense of apathy."
bad,Work here if you want every job in existence to look appealing to you.
bad,"I’m a person who can manage stress pretty well, but this job really is too much. We’re understaffed, and there should be 2 people working the copy center at a time, but there’s only one. It’s just impossible to get all the orders done in time, and be able to take care of all the customers that come in during the day as well. The system that is used to keep track of online orders also is very unreliable. I’ve had really weird cases where a customer put an order in online, but it never came through to our system. The machines are always having problems. Thanks to this I can’t get orders done, and of course customers always get upset at you, even when the situation is out of your control. I feel like I can’t breathe at this job. I can get paid more to be a cashier at a grocery store than to work this stressful of a job. Not worth the pay or the stress."
bad,Upper management will leave you in the wind if it makes the upper managment money. Very under staffed. Improper training and lacking training for upward mobility.
bad,"This is a dying company. If you're not hired in for the summer rush, then you will be bored out of your mind. The work is easy and not challenging at all."
bad,"Working for Staples was not a good experience. The people you work with lies on you. Very ignorant, if you are new some of the customers are nice and some are not so nice. Customers are lazy and wants their projects done for nothing. The quality of the work is not good. I always tell customers to have a high quality resolution on any images, always make a dummy if they are printing a brochure or program, always bring in a sample to the printing department so they know how it should be printed out. Some of the managers had their favorites and only spoke to them."
bad,"It's a place to work for the time being but when a manager makes it a anxiety and fear tactic place to work no thanks. Trying to get people to sign up for rewards or there will be ""punishment"".... That's not good to hear. Felt nauseated before I'd leave for work because of that kind of environment. Always pushed to have  customers buy more than they want just to get numbers for the day. No good positive feedback besides at least one manager and some of the other workers but it seems everyone doesn't like being there, high turn over rate even before I got there. Most of our stuff is online anyways and it seems it's almost like Sears. Funny thing also we don't have a lot in store and it's more expensive."
bad,It wasn't my type of job. All you do is run the register and stock shelves. Not all but a majority of the customers are old and rude. I had to stand in 1 spot for hours .
bad,Staples hires inexperienced people to fill supervisory positions. The management team allows laziness and sub par work to exist in the distribution center. They've also let good workers go over he said/she said types of situations without having sufficient proof of any wrong doing.
bad,"There is such a high turn around of employees and management that they are always hiring. Pay is incredibly low, far less than what each employee is worth. Most employees will get no more than 25 hrs a week. If the company would invest in their employees they would have better service and happier employees. However as it is I do not know 1 employee that wants to work there. Management is disconnected and will say anything, no matter how untrue, to make their employees complacent for a moment. However, wait 6 months and you will have new management. The antiquated programs and systems, employee under compensation and under appreciation, lack of training, and lack of support of staff by management has resulted in threatening and even dangerous situations for employees. The best part about the job is that is will definitely spark a desire to find a better job."
bad,The absolute WORST job I have ever had. I couldn't express how boring and uninviting this job is. Not to mention the weeks and weeks of traing that you wont use half of. Staples is a dying business for a reason. DO NOT APPLY!!!
bad,"Staples doesn't offer an ideal benefits package or competitive pay. The job itself is pretty easy to learn and navigate and the managers are decent, but  I feel this is job that doesn't offer substantial growth or advancement."
bad,"Quand j'ai débuté dans cette entreprise, l'ambiance de travail était stimulante et agréable. Puisque la compagnie a éprouvée des difficultés dans les dernières années, le magasin a du être réaménagé et réduit. Des postes on été coupés et des privilèges et/ou postes acquis ont été prohibés. Ayant une énergie débordante, se faire changer de position pour un poste avec moins de tâches et responsabilités a été très difficile. Malgré les 5 dernières années passées auprès de cet employeur, aucune possibilités d'avancement professionnel ne m'a été offerte. De plus en plus, les gens démissionnent, ce qui créer un roulement d'employés et par le fait même, change la dynamique constamment. Je suis une personne qui aime avancer et se sentir accomplie, c'est donc la principale raison qui me pousse à chercher autre chose."
bad,No room for advancement even if you are a  top worker! The supervisors are rude and don’t care about there employees. They show a lot of favoritism! The pay is ok but the hours suck at times because they have a lot of mandatory overtime. They don’t care about your personal life they just want you at work no matter your circumstances. I worked in breakpack which is the easiest department but the supervisors make your job stressful and they Time your breaks like you are a child! And there conveyor was broke every other day!
bad,"I applied for this job in hopes to gain sales experience for the Tech Sales position."
bad,"be prepared to sell a lot of add-ons and constantly be told about metrics as that is all the managers seem to care about not even if they are profitable, just that the metrics are up to snuff, you'll have to answer for every person that buys most any kind of electronic and the customer didn't buy the protection plan."
bad,District manager had no idea how to motivate more work you do more work you get no extra pay or recognition just told to tell other stores what your doing
bad,"Strong arm sales tactics, no incentives at all, managers known to steal credit from associate's that work under them. Hours cut if various quotas not met i.e Tech Basket, Square Trades, More Accounts, Liquid Armor and so on. Interrogated on why a customer did't want a particular service."
bad,"When I started with the company, it was a good place to work. Over time we saw negative changes including the erosion of payroll hours. When Staples was bought by the new owners, managers and key personnel--who had been with Staples for years--were squeezed out and agreements that were made when associates were hired or promoted agreements were voided. This happened even without informing the associate who had been hired/promoted."
bad,"Would be a great place to work and as a store if it remained open in Tucson. As corporate was planning to close all stores in Tucson, they should have known better than hiring people even in a part time status knowing that they will close all stores in Tucson."
bad,"Now that they are privately held (by Sycamore), there is no accountability, and the ""slash and burn"" is in full progress. No job or department is safe anymore. Everyone is wondering when their area of business will be hit."
bad,Staples was a wonderful place to work until layoffs happen regularly with key resources resignations.  It has been home away from home for me. I have learned a lot and was never bored with the constant drive to be the best retail company.
bad,"The leadership from directors on up is poor.  They don't know what they are doing and everything they try to do just compounds the ineptity.  They have surrounded themselves with friends who do nothing to contribute other than being a pal.  This has resulted in them losing the good people who want to work and do the right thing.  TechOps is a horrible group to be in and is where the ""leadership"" is by far the most pitiful.  What was once a great place to work has been stripped of its dignity and been replaced with a tunnel with no light at the end of it."
bad,"The absolute worst management I have ever had. They do not care about their employees AT ALL! They are not understanding, and so too faced. And the other associates are bad too. Everyone is gossipy. They are all either teenagers or adults that can't go anywhere in life. AVOID AT ALL COSTS"
bad,I was hired there for one thing and then I was forced to be a cashier half way through. It was a very stressful enviorment since my managers at the time weren't great. Not enough training and horrible communication. My managers were bad at spacing out breaks for employees and I almost fainted one day for not eating on time. Ignored constantly when I needed help. It was an awful place.
bad,Do not work here. you are over worked under paid and treated poorly by upper management. staff are friendly but the amount of stress upper management put on team leaders can cause confrontations between them and general staff to get tasks completed for unrealistic deadlines.
bad,As a tech you are a salesmen first and a virus janitor second. Upper management does not care about their stores at all only their numbers/ I am approaching 6 months without a GM with no hope for a new one. I'm stuck working 45-58 hour weeks and getting scolded for poor performance all the way in a 2 manager store (that's 2/5). Staples is a joke.
bad,"Truly enjoyed the job, answering calls for numerous companies and talking to a great many people. Everyday was a new challenge and I loved it. Would like to try the job again."
bad,"After dedicating around three years of variably full & part time hours to Staples, I feel I can speak confidently when I say the following:"
bad,"The management at staples is corrupt, management leveraging associates with inappropriate advances.  When declined such advances, management did everything possible to get rid of associates."
bad,Your days are filled with restocking and working with customers.  You are expected to be knowledgeable about the product you are selling and be able to answer customers question in a professional easy manner.
bad,"Under staffed, bad training, rude customers. Schedule you a lot even if you have school so good luck if you want to work there"
bad,Manager is wishy washy.  Fails to communicate with other staff and doesn't remember to carry out tasks when he should.  It's sad that no one has caught on to this joker especially since they should or could be doing so well in this community.
bad,"This by far was my worst job since graduating college!"
bad,Constant Harassment by management. No real equipment really just junk left behind by inexperienced operators with no training. A building filled with deception and secret agendas from sales to shipping. A very ugly time in my life.
bad,"The only good point about working here is its easy work, unless your great friends with the management out of work you have no hope in this place!! if your face doesn't fit you may as well leave, the pay is poor and there is a bonus scheme in place that is impossible to achieve  , the customers are always put before staff even if you can prove a customer is wrong and they complain you still get a disciplinary, also they mess you about with working hours and change and delete hours from the rota at no notice, they always pressure you to get more and more attachments and rewards cards and you constantly have to harass the customers. 1 of the managers is ok but the others aren't!!! they speak to you like you are nothing and are constantly on your back when you stop for a split second, yet its ok for them to stand and talk for long periods ,"
bad,"lack of communication between upper management"
bad,The experience and learning how to balance several different things at the same time. Co workers were indeed the most important part of this job.
bad,"•  Assist customers with inquires."
bad,Horrible GM's who pick and chose when to follow policy depending on who they like personally and DM's who will back them up regardless of how overtly obvious their discrimination or harassment is.
bad,"The Company is a nice company, it has great values. The location I worked at had ghetto managers who were mean to employees and to customers. They would not listen, and were very pompus."
bad,"Easy tech is a very great job to have. great hours and staff and management is kind of ""spoty"" and co-workers are great."
bad,"she was not a really bad person, but my manager was a back stabber to anyone and everyone"
bad,"As a Business to Business Sales Consultant, you will earn much more your first year on the job than any subsequent years. This is because the ""ramp up"" pay is much more than you will earn in commissions. They will give you $1k/month for 9 months if you're at 100% of your quota, but then your ramp up pay slowly goes away. You will be lucky to earn $1k/month in commissions without the subsidy. The 1st year bonuses are great, but they don't give you any bonuses after your first year. There is no performance bonus after the 1st year. They will give you a $3k/year ""raise"" if you're meeting your number. Oh, and you are only paid commissions on your customers for 1 year."
bad,Management lacking. Husband and wife were Managers. Gave me 2 jobs for the price of one. Didn't support me. Made it so I would resign. Long meetings every morning taking away time from doing jobs.
bad,"The management sucks, they barely give hours if you’re not kissing behind or “crying”. The people who actually do their jobs get treated poorly & the pay sucks. They hire anyone because people are always quitting."
bad,Management cuss at there hard worker employees and no respect worse operation manager in my life calling vaulter words you will get your hours roughly 40 plus stops a day
bad,"-No advancement"
bad,You have to jump through hoops just to get hired on permanent. It takes about 6 months or more to get hired on at staples. Working conditions aren't good and everything is about hitting your numbers. Your health and well being are not a priority for staples.
bad,"If your in DFW don’t apply at staples, management is severely poor. Great job, meet great people, being out on routes but even if you do right it’s still wrong according the front office ."
bad,After Staples was bought out by Sycamore Partners everything changed. Our CEO along with more than 700 employees were let go. The new management that came in just came in to clean house. I worked there from Nov 2013 to Oct 2018 just a few days shy of my 5 years. The first half of my time at Staples was great but now its a whole new place and if your not kissing the behinds of the new management your not moving anywhere.
bad,"They are outsourcing everything!  You are clearly just a number to them...  A lot of people have been there a long time and have been outsourced or laid off.  They change their mission every year or so as well as the slogan.  ""That was Easy"", ""Make More Happen"", ""It’s Pro Time"".."
bad,Staples used to be a great company but now it's going downhill. The company wants the employees to do so much for such little pay while the prices of products are getting higher and higher. The company really doesn't care about their associates.
bad,I would strongly recommend not working here the upper management doesn't care about its employees cuts hours to  unliveable amount if you are part-time offseason.
bad,"Terrible hr and terrible management !! Dose not comunicate well at all. Extremely hot during the summer , has no ac. Very dirty. A lot of safety hazards."
bad,Nothing to mention except I gave a decade to that company and sacrificed my best years with my family for them to close my store with really scrappy severance pay.
bad,"Working as a Copy and Print associate you get no support from your general management or other managers. You can't get breaks at times, because they are so understaffed. Has been understaffed for the past year. Promises to fix that, but nothing has changed. If you don't work with HIS availability you will get your hours cut, and if you have a second job or go to school you're screwed over. Even if you put effort into helping him."
bad,"Staples is an unfair place to work if you are a part-time employee. Do not give enough training, and blamed for anything that may go wrong in chosen department."
bad,The management lied to us by saying we had a bonus coming and when we were to get the check they told us that the numbers were reconfigured and it turned out we didn't qualify so i quit
bad,i learned about competitive pay. Management was alright. Workplace was very slow. The hardest part was selling the rewards. The most enjoyable was my team.
bad,"A typical day at Staples in the Print & Marketing center was beyond stressful. Often you were left the work of others to do, you had to deal with orders that we done incorrectly, management did not take care of issues within the center, and often you were trying to guess what notes meant what. The general manager is amazing, and she treats you right. Everyone else slacks and will stab you in the back. Rarely do you get any sort of break, even to use the bathroom. I would not recommend."
bad,There are lots of other retail jobs that pay better and provide more support. More often then not you will work with no lunch or break due to lack of hours to provide coverage. No bonus other than a points program that will allow you to get products from a website called staples stars. You will hate the back to school season more than when you were in school.
bad,"Very laid back and comfortable work atmosphere but no room for mobility, bad pay and over worked! pay was horrible and basically just a dead end job."
bad,"Selling extended warranties while being head cashier."
bad,"The individuals who work at staples are great, but the way the company is run is horrific."
bad,Assist customers with their office supply needs. This job is really not what I want out of life. It is your basic if you need anything just call me job. Not challenging and not allowing my skill set to be used. I am really looking to find somewhere else to work.
bad,Very little training on equiptment. Left alone to help demanding customers everybody wants it now.
bad,"A typical day at work includes selling and interacting with the public."
bad,"Company does not practice what it preaches.Wants you to service "
bad,"Not a lot of room to grow within the immediate location worked"
bad,"Been at many different staples stores. Through all my experience, 3 years worth, I'm still at $10 an hour despite being one of the best workers. The stores are closing and I doubt theyll be around for much longer. Corporate is beyond stupid. They demand so much for so little, just like every other chain store. "
bad,"The people who work here are very friendly and helpful. Management needs to take a stand on the job requirements and processes."
bad,Company does not care about its employees at all. They continually stress employees to push for things that is near impossible to get time to time and managers berate you for that. Absolute garbage company and should only go into this company as a last resort.
bad,Very slow placed environment and terrible customers. Just located in a bad part of town. Too many job responsibilities and demand from management with little amount of staff and work ethic.
bad,Staples corporate office has lost their handle on the day to day operations of retail and continue to not support their teams while pushing excessive goals which lack compensation.
bad,"I helped customers find things and tell them about products. I also worked at the register. That was the extent of my day. My store closed only two months after I started working there, therefore in the months leading up to the closure we had almost no inventory so I told most customers that we did not have what we were looking for."
bad,They provide low pay for what they expect you to do.  Management often changes frequently.  Hours tend to be cut fairly often.  Management doesn't listen to their employees for improvement ideas.
bad,"Some days they schedule one manager, one cashier and one person in the copy center to run a 25,000 square foot store and reprimand you when customers complain they were not helped. I consider taking this job as the worst decision of my life."
bad,"Staples was the first of it's kind for me, large and what seemed like - on the verge of out-of-control. I can only comment on the group I had experienced, as not all departments functioned same."
bad,I think if you need a job bad enough then go for it. Stay part time or you will live there. If you do work there talk to as little people as you can. Go to do your job and go home. Don't try to make friends.
bad,"is a good job when considering the job/lifestyle balance,however hours chop and change constantly and pay is extremely bad for young people.Overall its a nice atmosphere and I like the people I work with,barr a couple."
bad,"All though it's a fun place to work it's not somewhere u can work for 10 years and progress quickly rates of pay are astonishingly bad, would I ever work for them again most probably not!"
bad,"This environment is quite chaotic, because the job itself revolves around a combination of multitasking and semi-tedious tasks. Such as creating business cards or converting a regular document into a PDF file; every task is evaluated on a never-ending maze of disorder."
bad,"I enjoyed working here for being able to work on things i was studying. Tech support within this retail environment helped me grow more into what i was taking courses for in class. Hours, sadly, were very low and i eventually had to move on."
bad,"Their awesome people to work with but the management was never stable people quit like it was not a job. Management took advantage of position, and some management were fair to the employees."
bad,"counting products, ensuring items are on shelf, recieving trucks, sending out bad products."
bad,"Rang cash register, learned customer service, management was good, coworkers were nice, nothing hard about the job. I liked all the different customers I got to know."
bad,Managers only cares about sales and themselves.too much work for what you are getting paid
bad,"Open the facility, turn off alarms, open safe, verify the safe $$$, then open and put money in cash registers. Work with inventory associate as needed. Prepare bank deposit, order change etc. Take out trash, clean break room and restrooms, unload trucks as needed, bale cardboard manage the sales floor. Manage the front end, handle any customer service issues, schedule associates, view e-mails, participate in conference calls."
bad,I felt like this job was not for me. Management was not fair with employees and gave no support. Some coworkers were disrespectful and not safe to be around. Overall I did not feel safe at this job.
bad,"The company has changed so much over time.  They used to have a motto - Great Place to Work - we all believed it, and would gladly recommend it to others looking for employment.  No one brings up the motto anymore.  It’s all about the bottom line and nothing you do is good enough.  Management pretend to care to your face, but their actions speak otherwise.  It makes me sad that a job I once took pride in is now a never-ending source of stress."
bad,"It's the people you work with that make the job.  As for upper management and corporate?  Not worth the greasy log of whomever's butt pushed it out.  Staples is an aging dinosaur.  Selling relics of old like jump drives and printers and ink.  The store is an office superstore, popular before things like the cloud or the internet.  Example: Staples has, 1000 SKU's of pen/pencil products.  Who is really going to spend the time to choose one pen from 300 different types?"
bad,A) i dont have my first check still B) they will make you work hours that force your sleep. C) they will schedule your days off. D)aggressive sales practices E) they lied about my entry wage. F) they fired the operations manager. G ) your selling type writers and gps. H) they will hire people above you all the time. Youll never make it out of retail. I) ive seen managers retaliate over complaints.
bad,I was hired as a site manager. Everything went very well first two months. On 12/07/2018 I was fired over lies. My manager at the time did not know how to be a proper manager. I was fired for sleeping and cell phone use which was false and everyone does that. The day I was fired one manager destroyed my things on my desk including posters I had on my wall at my desk and still was never replaced. I tried to fight the termination and they told me the manager said he didn't want me on his team. Some of my co workers were great to work with. If you work here watch who you trust.
bad,"Need better management "
bad,at first it was a great place to work but as time goes on it bring a new meaning to DEAD END JOBS i was there best seller for a year and a half and they said the only way i could move up was to transfer thats not cool. many people who were there before me warned me and now i see what they meant
bad,"nothing good to say.  stress, headaches, no appreciation for work  "
bad,"Company has been sold to a private equity firm, with job elimination and layoffs prevalent, therefore not a stable place to work. Used to be a great place to work many years back, but the company is in a downward spiral, like many retail companies."
bad,my store location was under bqe too much traffic too much complaints cheap customers management  lazy copy center work was cool the company wants too much for too little
bad,"Managers were usually so mean and rude. "
bad,"District managers to corporate execs tell you how much they are offering you but it's not as good as other companies offer. These same people don't even try to hide their comments to others such as ""Staff at this store don't care. They don't even try. They are worthless.We should fire them all."""
bad,"The position is new within the company, and every month something is changing. I'm not sure this position will last long for the company. There is already a B2B team in place, this position is pretty much a junior B2B position."
bad,"I worked for staples for 6 months. The company is shady and so are the people. It doesn't matter how hard working you are or how driven you could be, they'll cut your hours. The location I worked at was plotting on their employees downfall with the company. DISGUSTING! How could any human being survive on $100 check a week?"
bad,Typical day consisted of loading truck and making deliveries according to assigned route. Co-workers were nice and easy going. Management was fair. The hardest part of the job was the drive to Lakeland from Tampa. The most enjoyable part of my job was completing my route and feeling appreciated by my happy and satisfied customers. Some of my customers had candy and cookies waiting for me when I arrived.
bad,you dont always get breaks/lunches when your suppose to.And not much for moving up in the company.its hard to get a pay raise period.too much is required and the pay isn't worth it.
bad,My job that I have now always tell you their associates that they will move up in the company you can not get a supervisor.
bad,"I really didn't like working at staples , the environment was very dirty , cluttered and didn't seem like anyone cared about the dust. Also management was not acceptable at all . He treated his employees and customers very poorly , didn't seem like he cared."
bad,they expect you to work most weekends and the managers are only concerned with how much they can get sold in service plans
bad,Non supportive culture and long days. Senior management not truthful of what expectations are. In house deal making for personnel gains promoting division between staff.
bad,Staples is a terrible company that has huge rollover simply because it doesn't care how it treats it's employees. Even as the top easy tech at the company I was treated terribly by upper management who have an extreme power complex in every store I've been to.
bad,"So many things never happened when they said they would. You will do this for 2 weeks. Turned into 3 months. You will get your computer at this time. Weeks late, still didn't have. Contract work and they tease you with you will be brought on full time but either keep renewing your contact or end it and not hire you. High turn over. "
bad,a typical day was stressful and under alot of pressure but everyday was a brand new one and we had to be positive work harder as a team....i learned was not matter what was going on to always take care and appreciate customers....management was an understatement...the hardest part of my job was walking away to say enough was enough...the most important was my customers i sure do miss them and to be apart of a team
bad,"Great systems are in place, but the management on a district level is more focused on numbers rather then supporting the stores. Instead of sending managers from other stores they have left mine on his own for 4 months."
bad,It's a hard company to move up in and the pay isn't that great. Moving up isn't based on tenure with the company or work ethic it's based on who you're friends with
bad,"Managers favor certain employees and don’t appreciate hardworking individuals. They have relationships with women employees. If they fire all the managers, Staples will be a great warehouse .VERY POOR MANAGEMENT ."
bad,"Management expects unrealistic sales goals and associates get in trouble for not meeting them"
bad,"Transitioning from being a cashier to a Print & Marketing associate was one of the highlights of this job, otherwise I don't think I would've lasted as long as I had. Cashiering was alright, but I grew tired of pushing for reward cards and visa cards many people were not interested in. It was far easier in a specific department to suggest upgrades on material I had a hand in printing, editing, or outsourcing. It was hard to up-sale ink, electronic purchases, and marketing purchases as a cashier when you were more likely to help a variety of people. The Print & Marketing (at my location) tended to have more business clients and thus was easier to build a report of returning sales and rewards programs. Good steady job for a part timer, especially in school, but ultimately left because I felt management at the time at my location made a bad judgement call on case between coworkers.  Between the situation at my location, and another friend's experience at a different location, the one star is because this company failed to live up to my morals as I worked there/wrestled with leaving after so long."
bad,"At first working at Staples was fun, but as the days went on, it was not a place I wanted to work anymore. Personally, I am not the fastest worker there and I felt people were judging me. They expect their workers to work efficiently. Staples would be a fast-pace job."
bad,I was in the plover WI location and the management there is awful. You are expected to do a large amount of work for little pay. most of the time they were always understaffed and it was hard to keep the store going at times. would not recommend this location for sure.
bad,They make promises to promote to get you to work hard and when you do they dont give you the credit you deserve poor management and supervisors I was promised a higher position and never got it
bad,"I loved what I was doing at Staples and I got lucky in the management category as every manager I had was great. I got to work from home at least one day a week (some positions offer more) and I was truly grateful for that. However, I would not recommend any position with this company because they have been laying off people at the end of every fiscal year for the past decade. In other words your perfect Staples job could be gone within a year so I would avoid this company all-together."
bad,"I worked in staples Park Royal (West Vancouver). "
bad,"terrible company, impossible demands, poor culture, constant misery!  the worst company I have ever worked for....EVER.  Upper management is ruthless and nasty."
bad,"The store im currently working at is in a great area but seems they go through management like anything, no competitive raises for the cost of living, the only way you get a raise is if you move to tech or copy and print ... By 0.30"
bad,"Everyone slept with everyone, managers were incompetent and abusive, hours and pay were not what agreed to in interview. Customers in print area often abusive, and used racial slurs, but managers would never stop them."
bad,"I have a hard time deciding if this or being an associate at panera has been my worst job. Extremely unrealistic standards forced on employees, managers will always take the side of the customer. The workload is always more than is humanely possible to get done alone, and when I was employed there was only one other employee in the print department and no one else in the store was trained and able to help. They would often refuse to allow me on my break during 8-10 hour shifts. If that isn't enough, the equipment we had to use was constantly breaking and not working right, I'd spend at least an hour every shift on the phone with tech support to get whatever machine was broken that day working again. They offered me raises that I never saw and I eventually quit when they implemented a mandatory 40 hour work week for all employees when they couldn't find new hires, as it was my second job. No work-life balance whatsoever, I was asked to come in on nearly every day off I had. Terrible job, even if the store had it together there isn't enough money in the world to pay people to deal with the nasty customers."
bad,"Staples is a sinking ship. They have to resort to unethical business practices to stay afloat. They like to toot their own horn about being ethical and whatnot, however, it's all just lip service. They would love to have everyone on the same page when it comes to cheating. And if you don't conform, then you are treated as an outcast."
bad,Worst place ever to work. Management is a joke. Pay is ridiculous. Don't stick up for employees when customers are rude and nasty. People drink on the job and smoke weed in parking lot. Manager hides and watches Netflix movies.
bad,"I think my store location in particular made it the experience that it did (negative). We have a lot of foot traffic than most stores and we are very understaffed. It's a lot of customer service, and everyone wants everything right then and there. If your staff works as individuals and not a team, everything is 10x harder than it needs to be. It can really suck the soul out of you. I definitely would not recommend working here to anyone."
bad,"I took a job at the Portland fulfillment center right out of high school in 08 and was hired PART TIME. The job is extremely fast paced and stressful for a couple of reasons, however at the time pay was very competitive in the market. "
bad,Good training for first sales job. Hard numbers to meet. Dysfunctional management and no clear vision. It was hard to take this job seriously. I appreciate what I learned there.
bad,"Doesn't Recommend "
bad,"Typical day at Staples Business Advantage meant cold calling from a list of old prospects and signing up small customers already using Staples stores, cannibalizing their own business for the sake of metrics."
bad,"Great at first until mgt changed.She was evil, bossy and under stress during a pregnancy. I worked there for a number of years. eventually they closed."
bad,"stock shelves, fix computers, sell products and assist customers.   all in all not a bad job just not enough hours or pay for what they expected you to do."
bad,"Horrible people to work with, the one good person had to resign. It is a very childish work environment. Way too relaxed. No one knows what is going on at any given point."
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job was balancing the cash office for the day without any major problems.  I also, enjoyed figuring out what happened if credits/debits did not balance.  The customers were friendly and I enjoyed helping them.  I learned to balance the different tasks I was given."
bad,Very demanding and tough place to work. Hired for one job but constantly must fill in for others in their jobs. Minimum pay with barely any benefits at all.
bad,Big mistake working here. The management and the district leader do nothing to help you grow within the company. The work is very fast-paced and you have very little time to complete it in between customers.
bad,Opening and closing the store.  I provided excellent customer service on a daily basis.  I managed the cash register by balancing end of the day transaction.   Provided daily cleaning and restocked the store.
bad,"its okay first job. not the best place to work or if you want any growth, opportunities. No company culture, no work life balance. very bland place to work."
bad,"If you are a cut throat person, then Staples is the place for you. If you have a conscience and want to lay your head down at night...do not work there."
bad,Getting a job a staples as a stater job is an okay job depending on who your bosses are I cant say that some people can make a carrier out from working at staple due to the amount of hours the associates get since 25 hours at a low pay rate for what most associates do and some aren't appreciate of the extra mile they do
bad,"In the beginning, this was one of the best jobs I'd ever had. However, after the company made poor ""Money Saving"" choices such as outsourcing calls, email correspondents, and delivery services, the new management became terrible. Six months before I left, I would have raved about this company and the call center in which I worked, but after these changes, upwards of 25 (out of 40) of my teammates were either fired, or driven to quit within a 3 month period. Most of these people were dedicated employees for upwards of 5-15 years. Additionally, Upper Management and Strategic Account Managers of up to 25 years with the company experienced the same fate. This became such a toxic work environment, that I had to leave for my mental health."
bad,"I enjoyed this job, but when i first got pregnant i was throwing up all day everyday. I only called out once, and my boss told me he would fire me if i do it again. But most employees did not show up for half of their shifts and never got fired so i never understood. When i finally did quit, i had to get them to sign a paper stating i no longer worked there so i would be eligible for insurance and he refused."
bad,Worst place to work for cold hearted people don't care about workers they will manipulate you and they didn't even know what to do with me lied and said they will train me for forklift never did and the FAT boss alex who harassed me beware of him and and supervisor name carl they are snakes wouldn't recommend anybody to work there stressful place
bad,I really disliked working here.  They would cut my hours down to one day a week once school season was over.  Managment was terrible
bad,Hours kept getting cut. Unproductive employees never let go. Made one not want to bother working since it didn't seem to matter if you gave 100% or 10%
bad,they are not geared towards families or their employees. Changed working hours multiple times in the seven years i was there management does not seem to care about employees or their happiness at work at all
bad,"Staples is a horrendous company but the people I have worked with have all been very nice. But the poor upper management, hour restrictions, lack of employees, and the myriad issues with the store make it a nightmare to work at."
bad,The company is transferring jobs overseas. They are not a good company to work for. They lied in the interview and push stats when they said they didn't. They don't care about the customers they just want to push the bottom line.
bad,low paying for a lot of work and expectations. Company does not try and retain employees just uses them until you have had enough
bad,"Management was terrible."
bad,"Busy place to work."
bad,Got this job through a staffing agency Temp to hire I put in for positions on a constant basis and on the 89th day out of a 90 day probation period i got a phone call before my shift saying i was no longer needed. Horrible pay for the amount of work you do.
bad,"my typical day at work is going in and stocking shelves; checking people out at the register, and balancing the cash register"
bad,not a place I will continue to work when i get a better job. they need to treat their associates better and not discriminate against people that want to advance based off of their looks.
bad,"I did not enjoy them, they were rude to their employees and individuals were fired for frivilous reasons."
bad,"They are not being honest about what they want from the so called Import/Export Manager. You will not be a manager of any Import or Export functions. Instead, this title is only a cover up for what they actually want, which is a person to prepare and submit all ISF filings."
bad,"I did the job of a general manager and received compensation of basically minimum wage, they skipped my review twice, and never recognized me for the extra work I did"
bad,This company does not care for their employees. little pay and employee breaks are not priority. They do not train their employees well.
bad,Handled responsibility of unpacking shipments. I also provided answers and information to customers as needed.
bad,"learned alot about technology, liked some of the managers there that were fair with employees. Enjoyed working with some of the co-workers"
bad,the company needs to value their top performers.
bad,"By far this is one of the worst companies to work for in America. There is little support or training for managment level employees, upper managment shows lno concern about employee morale or work environment. Mid level managment turnover rate is horrendous."
bad,I worked for Staples for six years and moved up and learned several programs my first 5 years. I enjoyed learning new things and volunteered my skills to several different teams when asked. I felt privileged to work with several different talented supervisors. I was lucky enough that most my supervisors believed in shifting and moving all of us around so that we had knowledge in several different areas even if that wasn't our job class. The most enjoyable part was the different jobs I did on daily basis to keep us from getting in a rut and Staples for the most part teaches you team work along with skills.
bad,I am a person with a learning disability and after 10 months I was fire for being to slow at productivity even though I disclosed my disability. I was place on an action but wasn't given any official warning prior of being terminated...
bad,"No job security. Have nothing good to say about a company that moves their call center departments to foreign companies. Shame on them !"
bad,"Loved my manager and the people on my team. Liked my job and was paid fairly for my efforts."
bad,"Some of the people you work with at staples can turn out to be life long friends, but it is very rare for them to hire high-quality people. If you take work very seriously, Staples is not the place for you."
bad,"Inconsistent, heavy handed management and backwards policies.  Floor management and upper management are inconsistent.  Loud, chaotic environments.  No recognition for employees who go the extra mile.  You might as well work for the Galactic Empire."
bad,No growth possible minimum wage and not much advancement possible only worth it to get started
bad,"I have worked for staples for almost two years. The pay for this position is terrible for the amount of work load you deal with. There should never be a way for a regular associate to make for then the MANAGER simply because they come from a different district and the minimum wage is more. MANAGERS should get paid well... There is no managerial back-up. Employees are constantly being scolded but not praised when things go great. No growth for ANY position in the store. They do not follow CORPORATE policies  which really makes It harder for managers. I'm a VERY HARD WORKER, AND I GOT NOTHING BACK FROM THIS COMPANY. Employee never last more then 5 months and well you cant blame them. Horrible pay, no motivation, do not abide by company policy, no support from managers, and constantly scolded for things you cant fix. They need to really look into their employees needs to have a great functioning COMPANY . However the company as a whole is failing... Clearly"
bad,No explanation of rating system. Manager didn't take the time to explain how it works. More concerned their own position and job security than those under them.
bad,"Overall, my work experience was very bad. I hated working other people’s shifts when they wouldn’t show up, even on my days off they would schedule me to go in, but there was only one good thing that they had and that was the break room  the break room was so comfy and relaxing because they had a couch, a television to watch movies and other consoles, a table to eat with chairs and other appliances, and electronics."
bad,They played favorites and only promoted the people who kissed up to them the most and not by compitence also the management spent a lot of time in there office instead of managing
bad,Office Depot offers so much more in benefits than Staples ever had. The management was non-existent and stores simply keep closing everywhere. Staples needs to clean up their act.
bad,"fun and not fun at the same time, love the people baye the management nothing was that fun i don’t wanna work there again it sets you for nothing and is pointless i just boxed ink all day"
bad,Hardcore sales since change in business.  Cut hours even for top sales associates.  Would rather have associates harass customers to purchase insurance programs.  Refuse to take no as an answer.
bad,"working with Staples was a bad experience, you never knew what the ground rules were, staples did not care about quality work, the bottom line was about how much business did you bring in, while one manager told his set of rules another would tell you something different, I never knew what was legal, never had the time to learn something that I did know how to work on and my working hours would not even pay for the gas that I spent to get there.  There was no paid vacation or sick days and way too much stress for one person as a computer repair tech"
bad,"Managers trying to get with young girls and intentionally hire cute girls for that reason, absolutely disgusting supervisor having relations with manager etc"
bad,"Unless one is interested in having a career in electronics of some sort, I wouldn't recommend this as a long term position for anyone. Working in the copy and print center specifically is very grueling and there is no advancement. With that you're expected to do loads of work that have deadlines with minimal appreciation."
bad,"Staples will bend over backwards to help their customers and from a business standpoint, that is awesome. They are, unfortunately, not as loyal to their employees. Most positions are part-time in an effort to avoid providing benefits and the full time positions are reserved for management. Store Managers receive a pretty decent salary and are, of course, ultimately responsible for the sales of the store which, if not up to corporate standards, can lead to termination. Assistant Managers are forced to work at least 45 hours per week to receive a their 40 hr/wk wage. Anything less than 45 results in not receiving full pay. "
bad,Staples is a great place to work.  My fellow co-workers where great.  I learned a lot while I was studying for my A+.  I sold a lot of printer and computers
bad,Staples had a high turn over. They did not seem to care about any employees. It was more of a push limits until you quit. One of my managers started a vendetta against me and treated the whole store like a high school. I quit once I couldn't take it anymore.
bad,"I was the certified technician and the unrealistic standards they set were something else. management often lied about policies in order to get you to do what they wanted. The pressure to sell plans was through the roof although not impossible to reach these goals the associates were often not taught about said plans policies and the way they worked. Being a Tech at staples is very stressful due to the fact that you are the only thing on the floor so all the sales pressure leans on you. Management was very hard to work with and if i had a nickel for every time i was told one thing and another was done i could have retired and moved to Florida by now. I'll be honest if they put more effort into catering their employees as well as educating them with equipment and policies then it would have been as bad. The main issue i ran across in store 0380 was management and the constant difficulty and lying. I will say once you get past the managers and some supervisors its like a family and some of the best people i have ever worked with, you know what they say ""you quit your manager not your job"" well unfortunately ive seen that numerous times at Staples but with the people you work with you can make the environment just tolerable enough to work. Overall i do not recommend Staples as a place of employment but hey who knows if you love to kiss the rear ends of managers and break policies and also love to lie to employees to make sure you get what you want then you might be a perfect match."
bad,I was grateful for what they gave me but overall the pay was not sufficient for the job that I had to perform. Also was very one sided when it came to certain employees and expectations.
bad,"Un-professional treatment of Associates & customers. Very poor training. Un-qualified management...inexperienced. "
bad,i didn't think that the management is very well trained. Didn't get many hours. Interacted with the customers. I loved my co-workers.
bad,Customer service cashier management ok coworkers ok  enjoyable part of job working with customers  hardest part working with the managers
bad,"Internship only."
bad,"Customers expected way way way too much out of you, how are you supposed to know how long every single pen will last a certain individual? Management just drove the people that worked hard already and if a task wasn't done slammed down on them, while instead of developing under performing associates to help with the slack. Overall the worst experience in retail. Some staff members were understanding though at times that made it worth the time you spent because you were helping them. "
bad,This is a great temporary company to work for.  If you are looking to stay long term do not expect loyalty or fairness from here.  Bottom line is $$$ if you make the company $$$ they will keep you. If you don't make the $$$ they expect...no matter how hard you work or how much effort you in to this company they wont care and your yearly review is not based on merits.  Its based on how much $$$ the company made.
bad,Staples does NOT care about their employee's ALL they care about is how much money you can make them and they do NOT want to give their employee's raises or promote them at all Staple's feel that their employee's should do the jobs of two to three people and only give you a nickel raise every year. Can you live on a nickel raise each year NO! Maybe Staple's wouldn't be closing stores if their employee's were paid fairly and the company actually cared about them.
bad,"Very unstable company at the moment. Management has high turnover at the highest levels. Lots of internal chaos, the new owners are slow to make changes."
bad,No organization. this company gives you the freedom to take your route for the day and make it work and make smart decisions your route is pre planned but you can change it as needed to ensure all deliveries for that day are completed
bad,Have to deal with being short staffed all the time because for some reason never have hours to have people work. The Staples I'm at some of  the management team doesn't know how to manage.
bad,The company itself does not care about its employees but I had a great general manager at my store and he alone made it enjoyable to work there. I did learn a lot about fixing computers.
bad,"This location is literally horrible. The manager is an absolute stress ball, monster to work for. The Assistant manager acts like she wants to help with scheduling issues but will schedule you on days you specifically said you couldn’t work. The “team members” never communicate. Print & Marketing employees are left to drown by themselves and are treated horribly. Awful place to work. 100% would t recommend"
bad,Ok if you want to work and not do anything outside of work. You do more then what you are paid. Dont always have a set schedule. It is you're a number not a person.
bad,I was locked in the store alone with-in my first week. Other Supervisors would leave the floor for hours the chat with friends. I was blamed for things done before I was even working for the company. I was told the Job that I was hired to do was not really going to be my job.
bad,They did not consider my school schedule and took me off payroll due to not working as much as others... because of school. Some of the management was bad and the training was all over the place.
bad,Once it went under new management things change completely.  Always said that they had their employees backs … experienced a lot of back stabbing and a lot of two face behavior
bad,"When your co-workers trust you over the manager, the manager just seems to hate it. It's gone so far to where someone was accused of stuff that never did happen. They DO NOT believe in promotions, they hire managers and leads from outsourcing and not with-in. The employees that get the most praise and recognition are the bad and most ghetto employees. No breaks/lunch are not allowed and are frowned upon when asked."
bad,"If you can handle drinking a lot of corporate Kool-aid, Staples is the place for you. Management would lie often, over the dumbest stuff. Definitely a lot of favoritism. The same people were always getting promoted and recognized. It started off as, a great place to work but the went downhill, real fast. The buck stop at HR because she is the worst. She best at looking down at everyone."
bad,"My time as a print and marketing associate was not time well spent. Barely any training, and the print and marketing department was understaffed. The software used for organization was dated and had multiple issues."
bad,"The direction of my position is undefined yet they continue to build out teams with no clear direction or processes in place.  I have held a management position for over 10 years but the methodology that this management team has is hilarious.  This also applies for other teams and divisions.  The development of more Excel spreadsheets to cover the fact that there is no quality work to be done is a daily occurence.  Pointless meetings that the content is repeated numerous times when a simple email with a recap would suffice.  The desire for higher ups to credit us with being a new and highest potential for growth within the company yet not providing sufficient quality of data to be able to develop and grow the sales all while asking what our feedback is while not actively listening is common.  The non-development of current employees is sad, many on this team have solid sales experience along with past management experience while hiring outside employees.  I personally feel like there is no growth here while the same employees hold on to their continuous paycheck without the need to grow or help others grow"
bad,"This facility is fast paced and stressful.  The hourly employees often are on mandator overtime and the salary employees are required to work 10 to 12 hours a day with no breaks or overtime compensation.  If you like overtime as an hourly employee its a perfect job for you.  However, there is absolutely not work life balance for the salaried supervisors."
bad,Very slow working environment with repetitive tasks that seem irrelevant. Basically moving stock around from shelf to shelf every week as there was nothing else to do. Strange sales strategies which were putting customers in awkward positions as well as the staff. Managerial staff useless and very shady...
bad,"I poured my heart into my job, and while the clients appreciated my hard work and dedication, the management was never satififed, from my General Manager, on up to the Regional Manager..."
bad,"Management was horrible. I have an invisible disability and when I revealed that to the new manager when he arrived, my position changed from Tech Associate to walking around with a clipboard trying to sell liquid screen protectors. It was embarrassing and humiliating."
bad,This job is perfect for college students they have flexible hours and work with college schedules but the pay is horrible. If you're an adult with big responsibilities this is not the place for you.
bad,the managers are always hiding in there offices and bark order. but never seem to want to train a new employee right but get mad because they don't know what they are doing. the managers get upset a you for not making sales will they sit in there office.
bad,"With Staples Inc fighting to stay afloat in the economy and under new management by the Sycamore Partners group, the staff has become less of a commodity and more of a financial burden for the company. "
bad,The managers were bullies and did not care for the employees. they use to treat us like dirt and did not stay truthful to there words when it came to offering employees time off. I have been told that numerous people have quit and left for a better work life.
bad,"I was able to work my way up the ranks pretty fast, ended up being assistant manager, however, our store was required to hit unreachable goals, the GM left, and we got a new DM every few months. Some of the DMs were pretty good and actually helped the store, but the last one was an inexperienced, pretentious, moron who made me do GM, SM, and OS work at the pay rate of an assistant manager. I ended up having to work 60+ hours per week to make ends meet and had absolutely no time to do anything else. Staples is a horrible corporation and they don't care about their retail workers, they'll pay you the bare minimum, give you little to no growth potential, and make you do work that's not even in your job description. Oh, and they make you take a training video that demonizes workers unions and have you sign a paper that essentially says if you contact a union, they'll fire you."
bad,very poor management and you are not compensated for all of the things that you do. It is very hard to move within the company and there was a lot of confusion.
bad,"This job was more stressful than being a full time college student. The management was so terrible, i'd always have to stay late or come in early. I never got a break, sometimes working 9-10 hours without a break even when I was only scheduled for a 6 hour shift. The general manager would always get really mad and publicly shamed if you had to call out for an emergency. One of my worst work experiences."
bad,"It's a good job for students, I wouldn't recommend this for an adult looking for long term employment. The environment is not team based and there are a lot of politics involved."
bad,Horrible management. I was there for two years and every day was exactly the same as the other. You are required to sell service plans and credit card memberships. Managers would attack you on your sales or treat you like trash if you offered but customers refused. With the big sales i made usually 400-800 dollar sales I'd get no commission or anything for the hard work and great sale. I left when a manager started retaliating on sale that didn't hit what he wanted. He made the customer even feel uncomfortable where they walked away and nothing sold. This was then attacked on me as was my fault. HR is useless they don't give a care about the associates you're only a dime a dozen. Even the district manager shows no care ignoring your call for help and blocking you're email address. All in all Staples is a joke of a store and you'd be better off working at best buy or anywhere where associates can be treated better and be rewarded for your work.
bad,"After working for this company for 9 months, I would recommend you steer clear.  They will avoid advancing anyone and will hire externally for any management positions. I have achieved multiple recognitions but have still been passed over 3 times for advancement/promotion. I have also been witness to employees who have worked for them for multiple years, being fired for doing nothing other than what was asked of them. I'm sure there are much more worthy companies to invest your time in. Let alone the fact that their pay is awful."
bad,"The store I worked at closed, before that they were trying to compete in every market but office suppies. I heard they have been laying people off left and right. Not a good place to build a future."
bad,"short days,only there for 3 weeks for back to school so wasn't able to be kept. plus management wasn't good. just wasn't a great place to work as far as to help my skills."
bad,Working for this company many years allowed me to see the inner workings and unethical approach to retail sales. Not only were newly graduate students tricked into a job with promises of advances in pay and weekly hours but to add insult to injury they were forced to do task that simply were not a part of they're original job description when applied. Workers were underpaid and often not given the standard hours the positions implied at hire. Overall this company does not take into consideration its workers. Managers were given information and task that were not reasonable and time frames that were even more unreasonable. Managers would then lash out on employees to help with that workload and things would still not be completed. Unfortunately customer service at this job is terrible do to the overwhelming amount of work and the understaffed building.
bad,"Do you wanna bad hours, useless responsibilities, & bad pay? Then come down to this retail shareholder pit of wretchedness"
bad,"At the beginning all I did was stand around and was not productive, but once I was by myself, then I liked staying busy and helped others if their line was full"
bad,working and fixing on computers was my peace of mind. and the co-workers were ok to a certain point. the management team I didn't really like at all . and the hardest was to try and manage everything at once
bad,I worked there when I was in high school. Ok job to get a part time position but they will try to take advantage of you as far as work hours and pay.  Good starter job but not a career. Many times I saw a few people looking to go full time from part time positions and they gave them full time hours while labeling them part time so they didn't have to pay out for benefits.
bad,"Most employees were related. Only the ones related were able to have growth potential. I was the only girl on a 13 guy Sales Team. The Mgr wouldn't return my calls for questions and to discuss different job opportunities."
bad,Its not the best job in the world but it pays the bills. Management is full of immature individuals.
bad,"typical work day-confused no guidelines or manuals on processing,supervisor calls in at least once a week,co workers gossip about each other when you process incorrectly instead of helping you,HR department not trustworthy"
bad,my typical day starts out i clock in and start on any projects that need to be done or finished. i learned a lot about how the big industrial printers work. management was all over the place at first they were ok but then they just started not knowing what to do. the hardest part of the job was when i had to take back the recycled ink those things are heavy. most enjoyable part is working on customers orders.
bad,overall a terrible experience working there.  as a top performer there was little to no recognition. upper management always expects you to stretch goals with little to not support
bad,Does not pay. you bring in a lot of money to the company and they do say thank you but does not pay at all
bad,"The only problem I had was how one specific manager ran things cause it was not professional! Some of my co-workers was awesome, the most enjoyable part of my day was getting ready to head home."
bad,Not a bad place to work but requires someone with excessive amounts of freedom with their schedules. Staples does not give many hours. Would be an ok 2nd job.
bad,"It started with checking out the work area, looking for what was missing in the aisles and restocking. Irate customers that the supervisors did not manage well, the management's energy and attitudes were negative. The hardest part of the job is giving an assignment that was meant for two people and assigning one person to do so. The most enjoyable was probably the jokes and fun with the co workers"
bad,"Everyday workers would be micro managed and given critical treatment. The store was disorganized and training wasn't done by a manager or supervisor. A person would get their training from a co-worker and learn how they do things, which isn't the way things are supposed to be done. Was never told about health benefits provided by the job."
bad,They use you. And have major favoritism. They are discriminating and cliquey. They don't do anything to help their employees unless they like them. They have deformation of character when it comes to appearance.
bad,"Underpaid for the amount of stress given. Manager only cared about the dollar sign and pretended that he cared about his employees.  When the average time an employee stays is a few months, that says it all. Plus with the new obligated shirts, not everyone can wear a crew neck. No flexibility in policy for practical things. There is a reason the company is sinking."
bad,"The training was sub-par, the management seemed to care more about numbers and beating set goals by corporate, and most of the time the numbers are not available to non management employees, and yet the district managers and such want every employee to know where the store is vs where it needs to be. The biggest example of this is the survey system, which each store has their own minimum required % of perfect surveys, and can only be accessed by higher management. These were considered to be the most important to corporate and other management, and kissing up to customers to give good surveys was considered more important than following procedure or even completing required tasks. There were also not enough employees who were hired to cover the scheduling, and often scheduling was done off of giving the bare minimum to cover shifts, with no breaks. Often one person would be scheduled to cover the whole 14 hour day if someone called out. For certain employees there would be no consequences to calling out sick or not showing up to shifts, but others would be written up for being 10 minutes late. The lack of consistency and not caring about employees who are not the ""favorite"" is what makes for quite a toxic work environment, as well as corporate not caring about the employees makes for even worse experience."
bad,Management treats the workplace like if the employees are in the military. Used to be a great place to work at. But since the new management went in they dont defend their employees for anything and frankly dont care about them. The pay is pretty good but doesn't come close to how hard you work. Overall not a good environment anymore.
bad,"Staples sells itself in a positive light until you get out of training. "
bad,"Starting pay is lower than the competition, I worked for the company for two years and I never saw and/heard of someone being promoted within the company, you will not have a life anymore, I hope you enjoy micromanaging and poor choices they make."
bad,"I can't speak for the other Staples in other states. However if you like being treated like a slave , and like dealing with indifferent management  that only cares about protecting their own jobs then come to the Denver Staples. They change drivers, and warehouse personal like you change underwear. I'm writing this because I care about people's well being. Not to get back at Staples. You simply don't get paid enough to do the long hours, and back breaking labor. The decision is yours to make. In my opinion I would tell others to look elsewhere. I hope this helps good luck in your job search."
bad,"When working at Staples is gear around making connections with the customer business. "
bad,"I felt they had little or no regard for most of their associates. Operated like a club with a few members receiving special benefits and opportunities."
bad,"Suffering retail store on the decline. Pay is low, no real benefits. If you hang in long enough there is some promotion opportunity, but no raise in pay or benefits to justify higher level of scrutiny from over stressed, underpaid, often incompetent management. Pressure for sales and declining customers often encourages scummy and unethical sales environment. Depending on store and manager, hours can be flexible, but would only recommend job for student or person looking for temporary part time work."
bad,"I started working at staples in summer of 2015, and I would say I enjoyed my job for the first two years or so. My store had a really good team for that time, and although the pay was a few cents over minimum wage in my state I was able to cope with it because of the laid back environment. I think upper leadership in this company has changed greatly over the past few years, and I really couldn't recommend anybody looking at staples for long term employment. You will be pushed beyond reason to sell things like extended warranties, and the store credit card. If you don't achieve results you will likely be berated and harassed by management. If you can sell, and you don't mind being grossly underpaid and constantly told you are not doing good enough, this may be a good temporary job for you."
bad,"Not a good place for IT, never given more responsibility or stretch goals to try to get ahead. I would not recommend this as a good place to work for career."
bad,"This place is just like all of the other warehouses: work you to death, not paid enough for what they want you to do, favoritism, huge lack of organization, more temps than permanent employees, etc. etc"
bad,Poor choice in Management. Low pay. Low recognition for work. I am sure this is not the same across the board but I do know that in this region it is. It is a good first job for teens.
bad,Many long time qualified associates were let go after the company was sold to a private investment company. Not much more I can say about Staples expect good luck if you decide to work there.
bad,basically you'll be maxed at 20 hours unless you are management. and you'll almost have nothing to do all shift unless you are copy center or tech center
bad,"Over the years Staples has declined in what it once stood for. Customers are treated like fools and lied too, employees are expected to maintain unrealistic sales goals that are aquired by immoral sales practices. The CEO left the company, changed ownership and now Staples in a sinking ship in competition with Amazon. The stores are non-profitable and the Copy Center is the main money maker."
bad,"Work life balance was non existent.  Company was getting rid of employees and stretching all remainder employees to assist client across multiple departments while maintaining same pay.  They wanted employees to walk around with clipboards and fill out sheets with client information as if they were selling cars or appliances or home improvement materials worth thousands of dollars and again while keeping same pay.  The pay was not good compared to amount of work expected.  I am happy to do the work, by no means have I ever been a slacker but they should pay a lot more for the work they ask of their employees."
bad,"I enjoyed working at the store I worked in. I worked in two. I like my coworkers but the pay is pretty dismal for the work the company assigns to the store managers. All the store look like they are still in 1990 and that's pretty sad because you have to change with the times in life. Sometimes, my manager didn't like that I took off to take care of personal matters. Well, guess what when you're a supervisor and working 40 plus hours a week you have no time to yourself."
bad,"Its really just a start to a resume. The management could use some more management training. The require a lot of work to be done for the pay."
bad,"Can be good at times. I liked working there until all the work was just on one person which is me "
bad,"On a Typical day, I ran about 20 regular reports supporting both Accounts payable and Receivable. The management I experienced in my daily work treated me with respect.  The culture at the Shared Services Center was business casual.  The hardest part of my job was getting cooperation from end users of reports on exactly what they needed.  The most enjoyable part of my job was the processes I was able to streamline and that I was able to reduce the work needed to process as well as the time needed to complete."
bad,"As a business model, the company works well, and is nimble. Store layouts are easily changed and adapted, which keeps the environment fresh. However, this adaptability can lead to a haphazard approach, confused communication, and a tendancy to focus on tasking rather than customers."
bad,"It's retail, so it's the kind of place where untitled jerks complain to your manager and your manager expects you to sign people up for rewards cards."
bad,Applied ACH and EFT payments for customers. Pulled invoices  packing slips and PO's for customers. Sales Liaison. Applied million dollar payments.Trained and coached new employees.
bad,They don't care about you. I worked there for about 4 years and the pay was changed atleast 4 different times. Management is lacking. One office manager controls way too much and can ruin your day very fast. Not a healthy place to work.
bad,"$9 an hour is not enough to make a living and the hours are terrible I was never given decent hours and when I asked for more hours I was given less. I then asked to get moved to copy center but was then given the biggest ultimatum of my life ""smile more and it'll be considered"" how can I smile more when I'm miserable at what my job is which is why I was asking to move departments in the first place."
bad,"The work environment is very immature including management. There’s always fights between management and other associates. Hours are horrible , how is anyone suppose to live off a 60$ to 150$ paycheck a week. Management needs to stop favoritism and maybe it would be a better place."
bad,After being sold to Private Equity the only concern is profit.  Will cut as necessary to achieve bottom line goals.  Retail is dying and still held as the crown jewel.  Very poor management with no direction at the senior levels so the company is constantly in turmoil.
bad,"I worked in the Staples Copy Center, and consistently had to contend with: lack of staff (I was one of two trained copy center persons, and I was only there 20 hours a week), unruly or rude customers, and a manager/assistant managers that weren't adequately trained in copy center procedures, resulting in unhappy customers."
bad,"Management was awful. After numerous talks about scheduling around my schooling, things were never correct. Only supposed to b part-time but worked full time hours. Promised a certain pay then was never given it. Customers are horrible. Half of the associates do not know what they are doing. Never received proper or helpful training. Never enough staff working during shifts. "
bad,We had a serious issues with being chronically understaffed. You know it is a problem when the District Manager demands that the General Manager hire more employees. I was supposed to work out on the sales floor helping customers but we didn't have enough staff for that. I ended up running a cash register and still helping people find what they need from the register. I was yelled at for not working fast enough even when I was suffering from a bad illness that I was sick with for two months straight right at the busiest time of our year.
bad,"I worked at Staples for about a year, starting as a cashier, and moving into Easy Tech Management by the end of my time there. There was always mounds of work, though the managers never seemed to help out, save for one. A handful of employees and I would try to consistently go above and beyond what was needed, though  we received little recognition."
bad,"When I worked there, not enough hours and always short on cashiers. I was hired for the Print and Marketing Department and then was moved to Cashier because people couldn't afford to work there 15 hours a week.  Also, I lost three days of work because the store manager went on vacation and didn't assign me a number to get into the Staples computer program to start doing the computer based training.  No other managers had this information. Wasn't given enough hours but was told working on Black Friday was mandatory despite the fact I had two other jobs and had already committed to working at another place that offered more hours. Needless to say, we parted ways. Personally Staples will be completely online and the retail stores will die out.  The customers are some of the most arrogant people you will ever meet.  Also you will get lectured about pushing their discount cards down peoples throats."
bad,I liked the customers that came in. the management was not very good. the hours dropped and I wasn't able to advance in the company. Overall this was a typical retail job.
bad,"Low pay for a specialized job that becomes a revolving door because of poor management. I was hired for Technical support but was hardly ever used for computer repair and was put on the sales floor for most of my time in that department. I then moved to to Copy center, but the low pay and the constant revolving door forced me to consider places I could actually use my skills for a fair wage."
bad,"High stress, upper level management demands, unreasonable expectations for middle management level.  No work / life balance; Store management expected to put in 12+ hour Sundays without lunch or breaks."
bad,"Did more than I was supposed to be doing only to be underpaid. Worked too often with little praise. Nobody was applying because the job didn't pay well enough, and the employees who did work there were quitting left and right. Nobody gets the praise they deserve and everybody was overworked. Too busy, too stressful, pay doesn't make sense for what they ask of you."
bad,"was only a part time job whilst i was studying so was never a job which i intended to stay with, just to earn some extra cash. Typical retail job    ."
bad,"Reported a ""top sales rep"" who was ripping off the company. When found out by upper mgrs., they terminated me as all their commissions had to be returned."
bad,They have no value for there employees . Just another number on a piece of paper . The poor pay and poor working conditions make it hard to stay with a company that does not care . Only saving grace is that when there my particular manager was a human being and was always understanding and a pleasure to work with .
bad,Very good management customer service needs to be improved but overall a good company to work for   I made new friends while I was there and I will fairly miss working with them but unfortunately I have to MoveOn for better things
bad,"management is poor,"
bad,"Working at Bureau en Gros in the Plateau is like being part of a family, one where you're never appreciated for the work you do, one where at any time if you happen to fall ill or need a week off you will loose your hours and will have to live off the minimum wage with 8hrs a week, one where there's always that one supervisor who's always bad mouthing every employee for every small reason. In short ""a family you might never want to spend time with"". Harsh words I know but I've seen them take away peoples livelihood at the drop of a hat with those precious words, everyone is replaceable. "
bad,"Nothing to tell about this company, overall was not impressed with there standards, or there work practices. Staples is more of a company that has a lot of favoritism with certain management."
bad,"Not at all recommended."
bad,"Staples is not a job you should look into if you're wanting growth, and pay that'll support the rare growth. Whether you're a sales man or a floor associate, you're 100% expected to sell for the company and make profit for them. Management has changed 3 times for me over the course of 1 year. It's literally ridiculous, and they hired my 3rd manager without any prior knowledge about Staples."
bad,no communication. when associates speak up its rare that solutions are achieved through talking to the associates that are actually involved in the issue.. Not enough preventive maintenance on machines or carts causing accidents and low rates.
bad,The management expects you to put your job before your family. They want you to live and breathe Staples. There is no room for growth. If there was a long line management just stood there and looked would not get on the register.
bad,"Staples is an office supply store, it's the retail equivalent of a cubicle. Very slow and monotonous, no room for creativity or new ideas. My average day consisted of organizing notebooks, or pushing for the sale of printer paper. The job was relatively easy, but it took a toll on me personally. Some days were great though, those days being when I was asked to help in the tech department, or when I got a customer who was looking for a bulk shipment of desks, computers, printers, etc. At least then I was able to really give my marketing and sales skill a workout and feel good about what id accomplished when I landed a multi thousand dollar sale. But most days were just the same basic routine. Keep the store clean and organized. Help point customers to the various supplies they were looking for (most didnt need any additional details other than where to find something). Work the register calmly and efficiently. Nothing particularly exciting. The management was overbearing and seemingly uninterested in keeping their employees happy, or even trying to keep customers happy for that matter. I routinely was told I'd be getting a promotion or a raise soon from practically day 1, which never happened. I kept on being told Id be trained and certified for computer repairs, which never happened. I eventually left because I could see the job ultimately wasn't going to lead anywhere. That location ended up going out of business just over a year later"
bad,This isn't something i would recommend for someone thats looking for a job. they make you force these warranties that are very word tricky and people don't get fully cover under what they are buying and that was approximate at all.
bad,corporate restructuring in 2016 cause a lot of people to lose hours and eventually had to find jobs that allowed people to have a livable wage.
bad,"I wanted to make technology sales and was able to independently sell 4 printers with extra toner/cartridges by the end of my time there, but I was a ""store associate"" so I wasn't technically supposed to even be in that department. Essentially, I was expected to tidy up the store displays, work the register, vacuum the floors, and maybe help a customer find something. Even the managers were running back and forth between the registers and the stock room since the stock room was constantly in complete disarray. Other employees were looking for a way out of this hostile environment and they often work one or two other part-time jobs."
bad,While I worked for staples it seemed that the person with the biggest ego shined the most while taking credit for others work. The managers seemed to be plucked from a nut house minus a few good ones.
bad,"I actually have nothing good to say about Staples. I found that I was actually working at the ""Worst Staples of Long Island"". When the customers weren't yelling at you because the systems were constantly freezing and shutting down on you, you had horrible and mentally abusive managers screaming at you for having you do everything BUT your actual job."
bad,i been working for staples for about 2 years and i recently realized i wasted my time with this company there is no type of career advancement with a terrible union. O yea how bout a .25 raise every year lol WOOOOHOOO lol
bad,"For the stress they put you through based on lies and un organisation alone, it is a waste of time for anyone who wants to grow. Layoffs happen every year. They put new people, systems, and machines in place without proper training, research, and development. "
bad,Raises were ridiculous even though I had highest sales in store. The only benefits were that I won electronics for sales like routers for computers etc.
bad,"The local manager has zero credentials in management, poor organizational & planning skills."
bad,"Retail...management was unprofessional, often bordering on harassment despite company training- poisoned work environment.  Pay was horrible and didn't keep up with inflation.  They don't give out good reviews to anyone because they don't want to pay you the extra 25 cents it would entail. Hard to leave on time because of bag checks that you might have to wait 20 minutes or more for.  I loved the work, worked hard, did my time, but was relieved to leave."
bad,"I worked at staples for 2 years as a sales associate. "
bad,"Very boring work day. process orders, returns, locate lost orders "
bad,"The company continues to try to reinvent itself instead of looking at what has worked well. The new IT leadership is bound to bankrupt the company as they are running it like a mom and pop shop. "
bad,A normal day at staples i would operate the cash register if the store was busy and i normally take-out the merchandise  from the inventory room and organize the sales floor while assisting costumers through out the day.
bad,"When I worked here, it was my job to sell tech products to customers, as well as ensuring they found everything they needed and had a good experience.  This could range from technical products to anything else in the store from office supplies to furniture.  There was a lot of bleed over from one department to the next."
bad,"I was desperate, Looking for a job. I applied at Staples, the Hiring manager seemed SO nice at the start, I was stoked. "
bad,The company itself fluctuates dramatically and unless you want to advance in sales there is no job growth. The company values it's bottom line over the employees and does not respond well with HR. Schedules are not flexible and benefits not as generous as they could be.
bad,"Never really liked working for Staples"
bad,"It was busy, learned a lot on my communication skills and also able to work with different kinds of customers. Staples hired few employees but with a lot of work for us to accomplish each day"
bad,"I was a packer for production part of the company,I worked 12hr shifts with a 30 minute lunch and two 15 minute breaks. Only thing good was getting paid every week really."
bad,"Management expects full time availability for part time hours given."
bad,"Top management is obviously feeling intense pressure to cut costs in the face on on-line competition and a stagnant stock price. The 'Obama Care' rules are used to slash hours of part-timers -- and now almost all employees are part-time."
bad,"Very poor management, no training, heavy workload. Not enough people and poorly laid out store. No food/drink in breakroom"
bad,I can't wait to get out. Unfocused management that relies on fear. No commitment to actually training and growing valuable employees. Horrible benefits and no bonuses. I am actually netting less than my previous job. I would not recommend Staples to anyone.
bad,"I loved my job and would do anything for it "
bad,Poor management at all levels not a good company would not recommend
bad,"I'm getting paid a little over minimum wage in a field that pays double elsewhere.  As a technician, I'm expected to handle the sales floor and repair a high volume of machines.  I don't get enough time to fully diagnose issues and complete my work in detail.  We're under staffed and under paid.  Management could use some improvement in many areas."
bad,Ok for someone out of high school or pt job. Not the best employee friendly company.
bad,"Understaffed and Stressful, forced to sell things Customers Don't Need"
bad,Hours for management were 70 + hours per week. Not conducive for family life.
bad,The pay is very low and you are pressured to sell more than what the customer needs or can afford. None of the positions are full time.
bad,"Provide consultation and sales support to Staples customers in regards to computers,"
bad,"Very poor training. When it came to doing the hands-on printing assignments for training, the copy machine needed was out of service for 3 days. They didn't really want you to do the hands on training, just to pass the staples training exams as they said that's how they've done it in the past. The assistant manager shorted me a full days pay for two weeks in a row. I had to micro-manage my pay every week to make sure she would do it right. Staples employees broke copyright agreements by giving prints for customers to other customers not associated/related to the original customer and they would make photo/book/newspaper copies for many people which we are not supposed to do."
bad,"The only positive I can give Staples is that they promoted me quickly. Other than that, nothing. The working environment is horrible and the upper management is quick to find scapegoats and throw their good people under the bus in order to save their jobs."
bad,Lots of finger pointing and spreading rumors talking behind peoples back by the management. Management is late to open store everyday.
bad,"The upper management class does not listen to the real problems at hand. all they want is for you to ""engage"" the customer and sell service plans! They treat employees like slaves and push to get customers money every which way possible."
bad,"there is not much to say about this company, there are many different areas that can be focused on but none of them require and real effort. The company has a learning system to understand newer product or how to do your job better is almost unexisting. And unfortunitly the management is no better."
bad,Staples is a company that I worked at for fourteen years. In the early years it was a great growing company but in the last part of my employment it took a turn for the worst. Most of the upper level management positions were filled with outside people from other failed companies that lacked the understanding of Staples. The stores are filled with some of the best people you could ever meet.
bad,"Granted most of the employees were very cool and nice, the occasional bad ones seemed to get away with saying anything they wanted to any other employee."
bad,"Over all staples is a great place to work if you have the right management in your corner. I learned alot about store operations and I worked hard, but thier policies are a tad bit unfair. I was terminated because I let a family member use my discount. There policy states that only people in your house hold can use your discount. Which was never fully explained to me or some of my co-workers."
bad,"Staples has truly lost its way. Through poor leadership decisions, Staples has lost its strong foothold in the market and lost customer faith. Because of constant decline, there are major layoffs once a year (i.e. leadership will often blindly chose employees/departments based on salary alone, and doesnt dive deep to understand the wealth of knowledge they are letting go). Passionate/ hardworking people are either layed off, or leave on their own accord in frustration. Systems are either archaic, or so nuanced that users spend most of the time trying to learn functionality rather than using it to drive a better customer experience. "
bad,Staples is ruled by unfair corporate standards that create a toxic work environment. The corporation cares more about meeting sales metrics than it does about customer service or employee health or education.
bad,"I did 3 years working different shifts at the print Hub at Staples. What made me leave was their new policy with regard to hiring and the management. "
bad,If you ever have an accident with faulty equipment you we're always made to feel like it was your own fault. Any work related problems you would find it hard to talk to management about it.
bad,"As a manager or service supervisor my job is to be available on the floor for more then 30 employees."
bad,"Needed to rely constantly on various other teams/departments that were not held to the same standards. Communication to management about issues and roadblocks never became resolved, and were simply brushed under the table. These issues and roadblocks will cost you commissions on a daily basis and make it significantly more difficult to reach your daily metrics."
bad,The particular store I worked at was awful.  Lousy  manager. Doesn't seem to care about employees.  Never around when you need help. Atmosphere is poor and the people seem miserable. Not fun place to work at.
bad,"If someone prefer status of good job culture, stay away from staples warehouse job. People here are like pond fish who never knows what is ocean like."
bad,Staples workers were misogynistic and slightly racist. They refused to train you in certain areas based on gender and made insulting comments based on appearance/gender.
bad,"When I first started the company had good pay, good benefits and options for advancement. Over the years the company started showing a lack of care for customers and employees, cutting benefits on both sides."
bad,"As irresponsible and unhelpful as the associates were I can’t say I didn’t make mistakes. I can however say that management was unhelpful, put too many expectations on one employee and genuinely do not care about you, your life’s outside of work or even the job itself."
bad,"The first manager could never be found, didn't know anything and would randomly disappear for hrs, then start a fight with u in front of everyone when she finally noticed that something wasn't done cause she couldn't be found to get it done."
bad,To be honest I was excited to work at staples until the management worked from what felt like behind the scenes and I was often left high expectations and no way to receive any help developing my skills.
bad,Got let go because i reported the manager for stealing. Culture was great I loved dealing with new people. Hardest part was repairing computers. I learned how to work on tv's. The only part about workplace culture is I have to say the cooked the worst coffee in the world.
bad,"The company will tell you to run the business as if it were your own, yet if you do they will tell you they want you doing it differently. Upon reaching goals, you will be informed other goals were not meant."
bad,Staples 2.0 is about reducing headcount by 32% and it is in all segments. Talent is not the gauge. Randomly let some go but terminated all of the BDEs for facilities.
bad,"The hours are. not good, the you are expected to do large amounts for work for little pay. I learned that I should be grateful when I get  a nice place to work.Management can have favorites and doing not give everyone the same chances. It seems to me that everyone is trying to strive to achieve the managements good side and not concentrating on their work. the hardest part of the job is dealing with co-works and management. Going home"
bad,"Since Staples was sold to a private investment company, its future is bleak."
bad,"Main issue, management did very few things to make our work on the floor easier. easier better paying jobs are widely available and staples doesnt care. Expected to bring down large 60 lbs+ objects off ladders while maintaining 3 points of contact on a narrow ladder. Not safe."
bad,"I been at this store for some years now and I have witness over 30-40 people get hired and leave shortly after (not including the few bad seeds out the bunch). Too much favoritism the GM has expressed to certain employees. Also witnessed some forms of retaliation as well. Not much job security. We are told to lie to customers to sell protection plans and amongst other things. I only make enough to pay a few bills and maybe put gas in my vehicle. If you plan on working for this company, you better have a second job that pay A LOT more."
bad,"Positives: 3 Pay brackets to start out at. Excluding management."
bad,"The current management and the Human Resource Consultant, in the La Mirada, FC building, are unprofessional, unfair, and lack communication with the employees."
bad,"This company sees part time employees as an expendable asset rather than an actual employment base. Hours are dictated by sales performance and your relationship with management, ranging anywhere from full-time hours (35-40) to barely employed (one or two 4 hours shifts a week). Management treats you as a number based on your performance, the more lucrative you are to their sales, the more favorable you are to them. Actual ethics and morality go out the window when it comes to sales. The main goal is to extract as much money from a customer as possible, rather than doing the sensible thing of providing the customer with a sales solution that they actually require (which, ironically, is the ideology that they promote with their sales culture). Benefits are non-existent, and part-time employees are exploited harshly, since the full-time staff is always limited in number, regardless of the location; and turnover is high due to low pay standards and questionable ethics in regards to treatment of their employees. The company becoming privatized served only to make the work environment more toxic, creating a hostile work environment where your employment is impacted directly by your performance, but the compensation does not provide any incentive to actually perform above and beyond within the company. The only true benefit of this company is your co-workers, since they are most times able to create a stable, inviting work environment when management fails to."
bad,"I was hired with no retail experience and put on 3 hr shifts because I could not keep up with high volume the first week,  never given an opportunity to improve or use prior computer skills.  Never given opportunity to work on stocking counters or other functions."
bad,"I worked at Staples for many years and it was an OK job while I was going to school, but I would not recommend it for a career move. All of the managers come and go because of the tremendous pressure corporate puts on them."
bad,"Lots of immature drama. I dreaded coming to work everyday and hearing people gossip and start rumors. Someone I didn't know got hired and immediately took a disliking to me, starting rumors about not only me but others too. I was not defended or protected by management. Just bullied and told I couldn't stick up for myself. Grown adults... Management did nothing and played favorites. A couple of my supervisors were nice. The general manager took his bad mood out on us and essentially became a bully after being pressured with sales metrics. Even though I was making the highest sales in my department, my job was constantly threatened along with others if we didn't meet the VERY UNREALISTIC sales goals after the new fiscal year came. When I started, it was much better and we were not forced to pressure customers. About 3 months in, the store shifted and it became all about money rather than customer service."
bad,"Poor management."
bad,"The culture is to take advantage of employees, I would not recommend working for Staples.  While rewarding to succeed, your value is not recognized financially or otherwise."
bad,Management has no care for quality of life when it comes to scheduling. Management always changing and leadership has no foundation. Overworked and no regard for breaks. Paid for one department but do all store tasks. No voice in change or improvement as management does not listen to staff but instead customer service surveys from store receipts.
bad,"The job of a print and marketing supervisor is more stress than any other position at the store. The compensation does not reflect that whatsoever. Associates under you will not be held accountable for their actions (due to corporate policies and management not willing to follow through unless it directly affects them), making it very hard for you to do your job well and maintain numbers you are required to meet. It was great experience and the job itself is very fun and allows you to be extremely creative and use critical thinking skills on a daily basis."
bad,"I have worked at staples for around 3 years and it was good place to work with good managers, then an old manager came off maternity leave and since coming back has made 2 managers and 4 associates leave due to her treating them like trash, constantly trying to get them in trouble for things they have zero control over, and going against associates availability. There is no room for growth as I have had one raise in the time I have been there and that was due to the minimum wage going up. I would not recomend this job as a full time job you want to stay long at."
bad,"It wasn't a very fun job to have. My coworkers all hated being there and people were not very friendly to me. The clientelle was snooty and entitled. It was a good experience to have and I shouldn't complain, but I think 11 bucks an hr wasn't enough for the work I did."
bad,It was fun employees got to check out and play with new computer systems and software. Just wish the hours where better and that they  where more willing to let you pick up extra hours
bad,The upper management is disconnected from the reality of the workplace. Inventing unsustainable goals and matrices. only selected circle could advance as you have to kiss @#$%#$%$
bad,"Things were good, until they re-organized again....adding too many managers.  Most recent manager was new to the company and the industry, and was a micro-manager with a thirst for control and power.  Making it a hostile work environment.  Worst manager I have EVER had."
bad,"Some Staples stores, depending on management, are run very poorly. Lots of favoritism, harassment, retaliation, make for a very uncomfortable workplace."
bad,"While working at Staples, there is little job advancement so you'll never move up and while you're there, management picks favorites. Drama is constant, people hardly help and rude. Toxic place."
bad,"Very bad management, never explain any of the company changes only used to tell us that everything is confidential and that all directions come from ""upper management"" and direct manager have no control or say in any of the matters.  poor pay, long hours, zero support, terrible benefits package."
bad,"You will do everything from unloading tracks to fixing laptops."
bad,"Day in day out is as intense as staying home and dealing with 50 kids that have no sense of urgency due to lack of respect for authority. I learned that no matter how good you are at your job management will not give you a pat on the back , they will only stomp on you if something went wrong.Management is really unprofessional not all but the new ones have no clue about what makes that  place work efficiently."
bad,"After working at Staples for nearly three years in the Copy and Print Department, I finally had enough of managers who aren't trained and unable to assist you in your department. From my very first day I was basically told I was on my own back in Copy and Print and it never got better. Customers were absolutely terrible sometimes. The only good thing was we got paid weekly."
bad,"The store that I work at has very few customers and very little room for advancement. Nobody cares to work for them and turnover rate is really high. However, they are really flexible with the hours you work if you go to school but the pay rate is super low. Overall, good first time job however try to work somewhere else in the long run."
bad,"Management urged you to sell credit cards, do rewards sign ups, you have a quota to sell those and certain items a day. You would be pressured, every job can be intense but eventually it gets to you."
bad,Good company many moving parts - fast paced - interesting culture - too many moving pieces to get ahead - Enjoyed some of the people - vastly changing
bad,"Expected to work for low wages in a competitive sales environment with little respect from managers, corporate, or customer base. Other general associates are friendly but suffer the same mistreatment everyday. Company is poorly managed as a whole."
bad,"at Quill, unstable environment.constant changes in evaluating sales reps performance, high turnover. regional territories. need 3 hours of phone time per day"
bad,"It's retail. Extremely hard work for hardly comparable pay. Hard floors, customers range from good to completely rude, and expectations of arbitrary sales that mostly annoy customers rather than benefit them."
bad,"Manager has very little patience .. since I left I am told that he yells at the workers to their face, makes them feel stupid and incompetent no team work ..."
bad,As a retail store I doubt Staples is very different from many other stores. For the amount of work they wanted us to do we were not paid nearly enough. Everything felt orchestrated so as to extract the maximum amount of work from us while paying as little as possible. Also we were told to lie to customers and say that we didn't have expensive electronics hardware in stock if the customer didn't want to purchase a protection plan.
bad,Overall I had a bad experience at Branson staples. Management is poor and does things outside policy. No advancement at all. I wouldn't recommend anyone to work here
bad,"The most difficult part of the job was that there were no standard practices to follow.  Depending on the day, rules would change, even if the issue was the same.  "
bad,Customers are terrible. But atleast coworkers made it fun. Store has around 4 managers I believe? All were cool. Except store manager. Wouldn't really recommend.
bad,Staples is a company doomed to go out of business. Executive management is pushing customers to the online markets so they can close stores and become a web retailer.
bad,This job requests a lot of your time and has a very high stress level because of far too many employees not being trained properly and short staffing making this job way too hard to maintain to reach every goal that they are demanding.
bad,young kids trying to run shop used back handed  technique to rid themselves of older more experience employees  they got fired but after damage was done
bad,"No consequences for being a terrible worker, this means if you're a good worker they overwork you but you get no extra benefits. Terrible management. Corporate has no idea how it is to actually implement their crazy policies (which change every 2 months). Employee turnover was about 3months."
bad,"Not a great place to work. Management really does not do much around the store and expect way more than is required for your job position. Pay is low, but staples does offer some benefits even to part time employees including tuition reimbursement. No chance for advancement."
bad,Staples was an alright place to work and i say that only because they were really un fair with some people. I also think that letting people know last minute that we will be working extra hours was un fair as well. Most of the people i had worked with had families to go home to and couldn't see their children because of the work schedule.
bad,"I worked a lot over the summer and attempted to work while I was attending school as well, but they refused to work with my schedule and would schedule me throughout the day while I was supposed to be in school. I went from 35-40 hours a week to 5, maybe 10 if I was lucky. I was always promised better incentives to work, promotion opportunities, and the chance to work in other sections that were never fulfilled. I never got so much as a pay raise, let alone an opportunity to work more or for other sections, especially when we needed it. The Staples I worked at has now since closed down due to poor business."
bad,You never do what they hired you to do. Lack of leadership. If you just need a place to stay stagnate then this is your place but if you want an actual career use them for experience then move on if you can.
bad,"It's retail, I know, so I 'll keep it short:"
bad,"My experience started off great, and thats considering I had no actual tools that were required for me to be successful at my job. My manager was amazing. I noticed a few things of concern after a few months but, I let it go. Then after some personal difficulties the entire atmosphere changed. Instead of a positive work environment its become negative.  Support isnt really isnt there. Instead my ASM makes comments about my job security. I am an employee who never had anybincidents with clients. If anything I always received praise. With being out of the office for a bit a few things fell through and even though others were supposed to be helping and failed to do so I came back and resolved them. I lead our team  for 2 1/2 weeks in sales and I was still given grief. "
bad,"Cette entreprise fonctionne sur la culture de la vente , à chaque matin les directeurs parlent des ventes de la veille en comparaison à l'an passé , les employés ont constamment de la pression pour vendre des produits , offrir garantie prolongé , demander de l'argent au clients pour club petit déjeuner , olympique spéciaux etc , j'ai souvent vu les directeurs couper les heures de bons employés juste parce qu'il ne  recolte pas assez de garanties ou d'argent ramassé pour des causes . il y a souvent des employés rencontré dans le bureau directeur où ils sont menacés de perdre leur emploi sil ne performe pas mieux . ce si apporte dans certain magasin un climat de terreur , les directeurs eux mêmes vivent cette situation avec leur patron si les ventes ne sont pas atteinte .  le salaire est tres minimum avec peu d'avantage , le travail est toujours sous pression avec peu de support puisqu'on coupe les heures dans plus en plus de magasin . Le problème est que staples  se fou des employés avec des salaires rédicule et se fou des clients qui sont devenue juste un chiffre ."
bad,"This is not your typical retail environment. Co-workers are very friendly, however, management can be overbearing and loves to micro-manage. I have been with the company for over 2+ years now and have received very few opportunities for advancement, and have been poorly compensated. Also there is no consistency in hours. One week I may be scheduled 40 hours, then the next they will only have me on for 20. Extremely unstable. I would NOT recommend working here to anyone unless they are looking for something on the side for extra money to supplement another job."
bad,"Part-time employees are supposed to receive at least 18hrs. I haven't received anything past 8-12hrs. Bills won't pay themselves and they keep hiring new associates. The software is horrible and they act like we can be successful using poor, tired equipment in the copy center. Management is hardly around. One manager knows everything while the other doesn't. Nobody is cross-trained so if we ever need assistance in CPC when it's backed up, you're pretty much screwed."
bad,"I am currently responsible for 2x Team Leaders, 1x Copy Centre Specialist & 14x Associates, I report to my 'Cluster Manager' who I may see once a fortnight."
bad,"Working at staples showed me my first ever example of not caring much about employees. Managers are always stressed because their bosses are telling them to meet some quota and because they can't do it they put their stress on you to do something..even when you haven't been trained to do it. Pays minimum wage and a tiny raise evey year. Managers yell at customers and employees so your survey scored are never good no matter how friendly you are. You get paid almost nothing to do the same jobs that your manager should be doing. If you NEED a job, work here, 10% discount is great if you're in college but if you can find a better job save yourself the bother and work somewhere else. Also don't expect to get a break unless you ask for one and even then you'll get complaints from your manager and will have to wait another hour or so."
bad,My job was eliminated after almost 16yrs with the company. The job was stressful and the pay was lacking for what was expected of us.
bad,Your typical day in the Copy and Print department is very high paced and stressful.  I learned to further develop my customer service skills in an effort to make every visit the most productive.  Unfortunately there is very little support from management for this department.  My co-workers were great people who really did their best with every customer interaction.  The hardest part of the job was meeting all the demands presented by the company and by the customers.  The best part of the job is interacting with so many customer types and growing a relationship with them and becoming a dependable part of their continuing business.
bad,"in breakpack you don't have a set schedule,you never know when you're getting off.employees are not heard.favortism.retaliation.no support from supervisors or upper management."
bad,"Pays Bills, Every day is mostly the same. 7-6 weekends off. Some Holidays off. No Advancement. All phone work. Interesting People"
bad,"High pressure job, although it isn't a high level position.  Demand and scrutiny is high and not a lot of training.  Expectations exceed role, pressure cooker environment.  Worked with some great people and some ineffective managers.  Inventory and Merchandising are separate entities although they are required to coincide, lack of communication between 2 divisions and open hostility.  Merchandising makes last minute decisions and fails to communicate properly although they expect execution regardless.  Finger pointers when something goes wrong."
bad,There is way too much pressure on management and there is not enough employees. Most employees are overworked for minimum wage and cannot finish jobs because most are not given enough hours to work. Store hours keep changing. Big push on digital receipts and protection plans when most customers do not want them. They don't put any money into their stores so the store is old and outdated and dirty. The candy in the store melts during the summer because they barely have the AC on and turn it off half hour before the store closes. The stores register system is frustrating to use and so slow it makes customers impatient.
bad,"Mississauga is the busiest hub in Canada"
bad,"Was a great place to work when it was Corporate Express Canada but after acquisition by Staples the environment and culture changed for the worst."
bad,"I would encourage anyone to stay away from working here.  In 5 years, despite tremendous work ethic and effort, I did not advance in my position there.  I was told I was ""too valuable at my level to promote"".  If you do get a job here, just do a lousy job because if you work hard, you will get trapped in the lowest rung of the infrastructure. On a positive note, the doom and gloom of never advancing in the company motivated me to continue my education and earn my degree.  Only one step above fast food treatment."
bad,Did not like the culture or environment. Would not recommend this company to someone else. There was a lot of turnover. This was not a good working experience.
bad,This started out as a job promising full time hours. The hours quickly dwindled and the management was rarely there for support. Schedules could change at a whim and there was no room for advancement and no reliability
bad,"Going into work everyday was draining. At the time it was I felt it was a waste of time but it actually taught be to be independent and helped with my time management skills.  The actual management were like the coworkers in the way that they liked to run from the responsibilities they were given.  For example, I was there for one day as a cashier and asked manager if they would do a return and they got upset with me because I asked him.  He gave me access to do returns and left, I still didn't know how to do one so I fumbled my way through it, Needless to say, this was the hardest part of the job, I learned a lot of the job by coming in early and playing with a register.  I cannot say it was all bad, I still love my old managers they were really nice and understood why I left.  My co-workers were good people and were more than willing to trade hours with me even weekends.  I can say that my experience at Staples was a overall good experience. It was a good job experience and I learned a lot from it but if I can help it I will not be returning."
bad,"This is not a slam against the company as a whole.  I am all too aware that things have improved greatly since I was there.  However this is my experience with them in the one store I worked in."
bad,"The staffing is great and everyone really helps new hires out. There are number job responsibilities one could take on however, the work conditions are unsafe and the workplace in general may be dangerous."
bad,"manager wasnt great but the other employees were great same with the general manager, pay is not the greatest, but a pretty ok place to work for first job"
bad,"I did not work at Staples very long, so I dont have much to say about it. Worked a lot of weekends and nights which was unfortunate, and also the reason I left."
bad,"It depends on the department in regards to management; stay away from the pricing and accounting departments.  In general, employees are either dinosaurs, having been there 20+ years, or new with high turnover rates.  New and good employees do not stay on board.  Benefits are below average.  Dark and dumpy building with heat & a/c regulation problems all year long.  Management will not respond to ideas for improvement."
bad,"too much politics, meetings every Friday requiring a list of accomplishments for that week. Way too demanding"
bad,"Staples is a terrible place to work, especially for a tech sales associate. I was expected to do everyone else's job and then got reprimanded for not meeting sales goals. I don't know how other locations operate, but Harrison, OH store has ridiculously inept management. If you're not in their little clique and don't hang out with them and play World of Warcraft, they treat you like dirt."
bad,"Want's to be the next Amazon."
bad,"My day consists of sending morning reports using an excel spreadsheet, Working with a vendor compliance database to print up compliance sheets for all incoming trucks with freight to be received.  Sign in drivers and assign receiving doors. Fill out all necessary BOL's in order to receive freight.  Inspect freight as it is unloaded from trucks.  Assist in unloading trucks when necessary.  Assist in receiving freight using a wms system when needed.  Take pictures of vendors violations, download and submit them to a vendor compliance team, on the computer. Have meetings with the receiving team to update them on vendor compliance issues.  Other various warehouse activities which are included in resume."
bad,"Although Staples, Inc. is a great company in general, it was not a great fit for me.  There weren't enough hours available to provide even the basic of needs; rent, utilities, food, gas, etc..."
bad,Pretty bust during the summer but not so much after the school season starts. Fun job but no hours to offer and horrible management. If you weren't a manager you didn't matter.
bad,My experience at Staples was good in the beginning with great training from management and satisfactory employment. Though the management was very poor.
bad,"The list of responsibilities that I have is 10 times longer than my previous job, only making $0.20 more."
bad,"Management was forceful and detached, no benefits, low pay, hardly any room for advancement, constantly stressful due to having to push sales with ZERO benefit."
bad,I enjoyed working at Staples because it was exciting to learn everything there was about Copy and Print. It was trying and I learned quite a bit about devices that were complicated.
bad,Very little passion from upper management. Cut throat. Not a great place to work.
bad,"I had been hired as an easy technician and i did just that but when a truck would come in bearing furniture, i was the only one who had the task of carrying all the boxes to pallets. It was a very strenuous job and for 8.50 an hour, it was very lacking. "
bad,"If you are a cashier, you will have to interact with a lot of crazy people. Management does not care for you. Don't give you any hours no matter how many times you beg. They just don't care. Barely any increase in raises, like 10 cents. Pitiful. Nothing enjoyable about working here, especially not during back to school. Apply somewhere else."
bad,"As a former employee in Sales/Telesales for over 6 years, this area is poorly managed. Commissions are subject to change at the drop of a hat if you start to make more than they want to pay. "
bad,"As each day for mine is set work tasks. The first day of the week i would complete a availability report to correct stock levels, then i would tidy the the warehouse to health and safety regulations. The second day of work would be making sure cycle counts are completed so shrink would not be a issue within the store, that day would finish off with a tidy of the store and setting standards for other associates.The third day of the week i would be there to tidy the store and make sure all stock is blocked and faced and all possible stock is on show. Promotions signage would also be completed, along with any outstanding paper that is required for that week. The last day of the week is purely for delivery the day is set for myself to pull in delivery from a truck and to work that onto the shop floor."
bad,Having been with the company for five years and advanced quite quickly I can attest to the fact that Staples is a very unsettling company to work for. The network is quite corrupt and I have seen many unethical behaviors in my experience. There is a culture of fear instilled on all full-time employees sent from upper management.
bad,"Expect to have your Hours cut and do not expect a wage increase unless the national minimum wage increases. At staples they have a tier bracket for associate pay as to what level you are, and what you can do. The manager will not put you on a higher tier of pay unless head office state a certain amount of staff need to be on a certain bracket, (tier 4) in order to open and close the store."
bad,when staples took over corporate express and bought their way into Ireland they ran the company down.
bad,"Pay sucks, management is ineffective, no chain of command,"
bad,"The pay scale is worthless. Your pay raises are based on an evaluation that no-one was given the top score of 4 BECAUSE no one is perfect!!!!!!!! While I shouldn't complain as I apparently received some of the highest scores, over five years of service I collectively received, $1.25 in pay raises."
bad,Your job is never safe. I never feel comfortable with management. Protocol states that the schedule is suppose to be put up 2 weeks in advance and it never is. I never feel like I actually have a chance to move up in this company.
bad,Very high pressure to meet project deadlines in order for company profits to grow.
bad,poor working environment lack of concern for employees well being working hours are not flexable
bad,"Its just hard to work at a place where the computers never work and they dont give out good hours, the only full time workers are managers and one of my coworkers."
bad,A typical day was putting out fires that could've been previously resolved and just trying to keep team moral up. The hardest part of the job was new processing being rejected for lack of innovation. Lack of cross department communication.
bad,"Management is biased and will pick favourites - very obvious who is better because they get scheduled lots. No advancement but you can ask to be cross-trained. Only busy during back to school season but that’s it. If you like a growing environment, would not recommend this company."
bad,"Staples has been bought out by the Sycamore Partners Group, and no longer is it's own company, which has been sad to see as Staples stores continue to close down and let go of employees. Staples like any retail chain is counting it's pennies to survive. The restructuring of the company has changed the atmosphere of staples employees to be under a constant pressure to ""Over Sell"" it's customers in my opinion. Staples isn't a bad company and I believe it wants to do great for it's customers but unfortunately most stores are carrying massive debt which has effected the attitude of everybody as it trickles down from the top. Working for staples would be a decent first job for a High school student or somebody who is looking for a part time job."
bad,"Couldn’t get raises that I had earned."
bad,i worked in two staples stores as supervisor and i loved working with some teams of employee and manager but few are not that  Good so that's why the environment is very good but it's depend on the team you working with the only thing is the salary is too low for the amount of work to do
bad,"These people have no respect for their employees. Everything is a double standard and the whole warehouse is a total mess. No room for growth unless you are Hispanic no matey hoe long you've been there. There is no HR"
bad,"New facility in North Carolina with a horrible employee retention rate. Inventory is full of made up numbers, and the hourly employees plus supervisors are well under paid. The managers here seem to be afraid to share new ideas because of the turnover. The two tenured (15years plus) operations managers left for other jobs in different companies. There’s an underlying virus that hopefully the management team can identify because they are capable of making the FC and great place to work."
bad,"a typical day:"
bad,"Don’t work here unless you want to be belittled constantly. Not one of the managers are on the same page, and they have extremely unrealistic expectations. And if I do reach those expectations, don’t expect a thank you or anything of the sort, they just expect more from you.  If they don’t like you, they’ll cut your hours, to un-liveable amounts. Don’t work here unless you’re prepared for ridiculing and bullying."
bad,"The chain is dying. When the stores portion of the business was sold a few years back, the new owners shifted focus from brick and mortar to their web site. Associates main goal is to kiss the customers behind and sell their ever popular service plans. If associates dont sell service plans and laptop bags and accessories when they sell laptops they make no money because the machines they sell are on such a low profit margin."
bad,The upper management at Staples Fulfillment Center favorited those employees that were directly related to them and/or who grew up with them in Mississippi.
bad,"A typical day included clocking in, opening the Print & Marketing department and starting up the machines. I would deal with customer service, sales, order production, phone calls, UPS shipping and customer order pickup all by myself until about noon. Management rarely stepped in to lend a hand even when customers became irritated because of the wait. Low pay for work performed. Would not recommend."
bad,Poor management. Never knew when you were getting off. Fast pace and needed to meet quotas. It would get really really hot in there because it is a warehouse. They would only supply bottled water if it got over a certain degrees.
bad,"As a student, if you think you have time to spend in a dustbeen than obviously join here as a team member but choose alternative jobs for better future."
bad,This company is owned by private equity and has gone through many changes in the past couple of years including all management.  Hours are long.  Start around 8.  Finish when the job is done.  Currently going through a transformation which is exciting.
bad,I was not given a reasonable explanation explanation as to why I was being let go l  honestly didn’t feel I was given a proper training  I didn’t really feel comfortable at all around any manager when asking for help or having any type of question. I did  feel uncomfortable at times to ask for help.
bad,Unclean bathroom and break room. The company expects way too much of one person. Not enough employees to assist customers and no employee training or lack of.
bad,"Horrible management, they pressure you with targets that arent achievable plus its a graphic design job with zero creativity chance but a 100% sales. If you have any questions with any issues, sooner or later they are gonna tell u to stop bothering them and not ask too many questions."
bad,"To begin, the biggest issue with Staples is the competitive nature between stores makes the environment breed a lot of toxicity. I wasn't in management, but secondhand experiences from managers or the occasional sentence off of a conference call made it obvious that they weren't being treated well. If you're empathetic, this will be an extremely negative experience if you let your nose move around too much. Those same pressures are moved onto Associates, which makes the job more stressful than the pay entails."
bad,"Ever changing priorities, never seeing projects through, poor cash flow and ever reducing staff make working here not only difficult but, stressful too."
bad,"Hours are very hit or miss, depending on if you hit their sales count or not"
bad,"I found this to be a very stressful environment with little room to grow.   Hourly wages are very low, especially for the cost of living in this area."
bad,The manager there will get you fired. The hr team offers no support to employees. They sideswipe you they have faulty equipment. No proper training and also no proper communications.
bad,Work hard management no good at all don't care about workers only to them self HR don't pay attention there workers in any matter but other drivers are good people
bad,"The management is very poor. They rather recycle “talent” within the company and expect different results. "
bad,"For the most part, it was a fairly easy job. I enjoyed interacting with the customers and fellow associates. However, the boss that I had did not communicate very well. I would ask her a question and was either given sarcastic or short, cryptic answers."
bad,"I was hired as a Print & Marketing associate. The day before my first day all but one person in the entire print & marketing department quit. It was fine at first, lots of fun to learn all the different machines and make a variety of products. However training was very limited (due to all the quitting, no fully trained personnel anywhere.) I ended up getting promoted to Print & Marketing supervisor due to me learning the most the quickest and everyone else quitting. I basically was running the entire department (a minimum 3 people working at the same time department) by myself. AKA doing the work of 3-5 people for the pay of one. Since I was one of the few persons trying to learn new things to not get yelled at by customers as much, any time off wasn't really time off as I was constantly called and texted about orders and such. Way too stressful for bad pay, horrible work/life balance."
bad,"Great if you need a part time 20 hour a week only making 9.00 dollars an hour. No job placement, no raises, no benefits, early morning start early end."
bad,"I've been told and promised advancement at the start, yet i try really hard for little to no compensation. The occasional high-five is all i get, which means nothing at the end of the day."
bad,"Working at staples started off great. The hours are flexible and the pay is decent. After a few months the environment changed to a commission like workplace, without the commission bonuses. They wanted employees to bundle items (Ex. Paper & ink with printer sales) and sell warranties for every electronic and furniture. This is understandable because they want to sell more stuff and make a profit. But when you don't sell a warranty or bundle an item the sales manager will get upset, be disrespectful, and unprofessional. There was no incentive to up-sale customers other than the threat of losing your job."
bad,Management put unreasonable expectations on the staff that worked hard due the lack of staff and the fact that many of them didn't do their job. It made for a very stressful but secure job.
bad,Staples has a good concept for driving sales and working with employees.  They also have department reward system that helped employees want to do better.
bad,Working here has not only taught me so much but its made life a lot less stressful there a great group of people.........................................
bad,"- Does the bare minimum at everything."
bad,Great people to work with. Worked in a team atmostphere. No advancment in Edmonton. Stuck in the same postion with added responsiblies for little pay. I became the lead hand 8 years ago and now look after the day to day actitives for our deparment as a lead. No supervisor role or pay. Our team of drivers are excellent.
bad,It is an overly stressful and toxic environment and they do not care about the employees. The staff and management are constantly changing because no one wants to stay. You deal with bullying and harassment but it's mainly by management so you feel like you can't say anything. It's hard to learn anything new and the problems of the store follow you home.
bad,"A typical day at work will involve me helping customers place orders to be printed in flight deck, assisting with self serve printers, UPS shipping, and answering the dept phone calls. This staples copy and print location is normally always busy with customers. The hardest part of this job is trying to help everyone because 95% of the time I was by myself with no help from any other asociates or managers in the store at the time. This was extremely frustrating trying to keep calm while being pulled and asked for help in every direction! They are under staff and needs more employees ASAP! The most enjoyable part of the job is the happy reaction from customers when you are able to exceed their expectations."
bad,"Worked at Staples for a few years. First year was mostly cashiering, later years I was on the floor doing pull lists, planograms, facing the store, and helping with inventory. The work itself is not bad. I don't mind cashiering, and I enjoyed the busy work on the floor and helping customers. But there is not enough money in the world to make up for how corporate/management treat their employees. "
bad,Honestly just never felt like managment cared about us. Ya some manager's where better then other but for the most part they where just there to work and go home and we where pawns on a board. But the other employees where great made alot of good friends working there
bad,"Regardless of skillset, you can't help but feel as if you're wasting your time and ability here.  Literally 11 focal points drive this business (nuff said) …"
bad,"The expectation was extremely unrealistic and very cut throat.  For example we were required to fix 10 screen repairs per week, protection plan on even the flash drives and surge protectors, liquid screen protectors, etc.  Out of the 14 stores in our district maybe only 1 or 2 stores met 'part' of the goal.  However, we had to get on a weekly conference call just to write up an action plan on how to meet these unrealistic expectation.  If you consistently didn't meet it, which most of us didn't it was a disciplinary action."
bad,"company sold to new owners due to poor running of business, badly staffed, budgets reduced on staffing for warehouse stores to run on 3 members of staff during peak trading periods"
bad,working in the Staples store is a great job especially for college students. The management however is terrible in the store. there is no room at all to get promoted or move up. when an associate is a top seller the management rewards them by giving the associate a box of cereal. long time employees get their hours cut constantly as well
bad,"Very quiet store as the general public either don't know it exists or think it's only for trade. This caused my store to go out of business, meaning that there was a team of 5 of us in a huge shop. "
bad,Working for staples would make a decent enough first time job. Now putting that aside pay here was absurd in its own. Management was questionable and the future of staples looks grim to say the least.
bad,Job its self wouldn't be so bad if management was different . Felt like the store was being run by a bunch of Highschool kids. The managers were always in the back office gossiping an on their phones. Some associates would just walk off the floor an not help anyone in need.
bad,"no raises no promotions management is usually uptight, the pay is minimum wage no overtime and they always want you to work weekends, it was an overall bad experience."
bad,"Retail work that isn't challenging except that they are consistently understaffed. Management is wildly inconsistent, but if you get a good one, it's a good place to work"
bad,I worked for this company for over 12 years and for the most part was  good.Beginning in 2017 the company was purchased by investment firm and they cut so many resources from the field team it made it difficult  to perform your daily duties.The company also made major cuts in compensation. The culture was very toxic at times. I personally had a great boss but others that i collaborated with where not so cooperative.
bad,Less support from management and team. Lots of politics. Managers don't know how to support and encourage employees. In general management sucks!!!!!!
bad,"Overall it’s a fine place to work for, however I started with the company as a manager and accepted because it was 10 mi utes from home, right next door to my old store. Soon after I was hired they closed the store, although it was profitable, and I was forced to commute 2 hours with no compensation for that"
bad,Work life balance is great but advancement is a trainwreck. Plus the business is allowed to run around processes driven to protect their systems and IT is blamed for it.
bad,You do alot of work to get back nickles and dimes. Over worked employees is not cool. Business structure is horrible. Our equipment does work right so how are we suppose to do our job.
bad,"Terrible culture and a dying company."
bad,The Staff is constantly causing drama as well as being a bunch of backstabbing hyenas. The management is utterly useless and isn't good for anything more than taking up payroll.
bad,"Employees are disposable there. They work you like a dog and though they claim they promote work/life balance, the reality is you need to put in 50 hrs/wk just to keep your head above water. They've downsized to the point that each employee does the job of 3 people. Their operations are very inefficient."
bad,The corporate pushes associate to sell all kinds of ridiculous add-ons; the consumer base in our area was mainly low income.  The products and additions had no place in this income bracket.
bad,Morale is low due to the continuous layoffs taking place every 3 months.  New management in several key organizations are clueless to who and what make the company work.  Loved working here until Office Depot merger failed.
bad,"A typical work week for an associate would consist of anywhere from 10-20 hours. This is a low amount, even for part-time, which makes it difficult to make nay money. Furthermore, upper management of the store, General Manager and Assistant manager, ask the associates to do too much for compensation. They consistently push associates to sell but do not receive additional compensation or real praise for doing so. The associates themselves have a very low work ethic and somewhat blame one another for work not being completed."
bad,"Empresa onde te dizem que há progressão de carreira e na realidade nada acontece, nao efectivam ninguem!Tem salários baixos. Gerencia que nao quer saber dos trabalhadores e foca-se mais nos ""lucros""/vendas do que as pessoas em si. Vais com salario minimo para casa."
bad,"With Staples selling and being bought by a private equity company  so, far has not been a smooth transition."
bad,"Management was rude and made employees uncomfortable"
bad,Constantly being messaged on days off by those at work about different clients. Schedule was often out late into the work week or drastically updated throughout. Lack of training when promoted to higher positions. The work itself was a great challenge and the best part of the job. Very little communication between co-workers leading to corporate intervention regarding policies.
bad,Company is currently in the process of Outsourcing many positions.  They now seem more interested in sending jobs over seas than retaining good talent.
bad,"management is disrespectful, and none supportive, pay is not good, work can be a bit much considering you will not be compensated for the work you do."
bad,Management is horrible when it comes to how employees are treated. It is literally a Chain of yelling. management gets yelled at then the managers yell at associates in turn we get made and around getting mad. they force you to sell products or advise products that nobody wants.
bad,"The Company itself can offer excellent opportunities for those who would like to grow in their professional experience.Unfortunately, there are several individuals in the organization that doesn't follow proper procedures as they should be followed in the world of management and all because of their connections with their superiors. "
bad,"Usually you go in and the manager gives you tasks to do. In addition you sell products and production plans. I learned how to do sales but I did not like the managers and certain co workers were very rude and made the job terrible. I did not like selling warranties but you had to, the best part of the job was closing when the customers left."
bad,"It seems that management doesn't choose leaders based on work performance, experience, or report. They choose leaders based on favoritism. I was passed over for a supervisor position for the shift I've worked on throughout my employment for a person who barely has been with the company for 2 years and had 0 experience in my department. Working conditions have gotten worse since she's taken over and upper management doesn't seem to care."
bad,ASMs were asked to more than double the prior year's performance and subsequently given a significant decrease in pay.  When those two things happen simultaneously it became difficult to stay motivated.
bad,"The work environment is very exclusive and shut off-ish to new comers. You will be doing a lot of work for not a lot of pay. You will be understaffed. You will not be given things like your breaks all the time as a result of being understaffed because of the poor time tabling. Some weeks you'll have 10 hours of work. Others you'll have 30+ (if you're part time). Sometimes they are late on your paycheck. But the work skills you get are pretty great and solid. Your customer service skills are going to be phenomenal and lots of employers / managers of other companies tend to understand that if you work for Staples, you learned the best ways of dealing with that angry customer."
bad,"Work environment provides opportunities to advance within the company, unfortunately the management there does not. Often found myself covering for my supervisors so they could take extra breaks and long lunches, wound up taking a lot of responsibility that I was not getting paid to do."
bad,Staples is in flux.  The company is currently being purchased by a private equity firm and the future is murky. This pending change presents a large amount of uncertainty that permeates the current work climate.
bad,The company has been in internal turmoil since future shop closed and the company hired on a bulk of the upper management from there. The stores are being used as pickup and drop locations and aren't being staffed properly as the push for online sales is increased.
bad,The first 4 years i worked there i couldn't ask for better store managers!! After that the management was sub-par. They would complain to other employees about other employees and be very unprofessional... the pay varied based on if were a relative to the manager or favored (At least for the 5th and final year i will ever work in that store) Don't get me wrong Staples is a good place to work and has great benefits! It's just some of the people they put in management position that run good people off.
bad,"Incredibly high stress job, where sales metrics and valued above all. at the location where i worked for three years during which we went through four general managers and two assistant managers the turn over was so high there was a new face every week due to the lack of any real management. when the location was finally closed down for reasons that were never made apparent we were given three weeks notice and one week of severance which was denied to ninety percent of people for simple reasons. If you missed one sales goal or had a single even mildly negative comment on your record your severance was pulled and you were left high and dry."
bad,"clocking in lots of customer interaction and multi-tasking i.e managing the customer line, answering the phone for either customers or vendors, filling out pickup, shipping and kiosk orders, handling uber pickup orders, stocking and facing and much more."
bad,"The low compensation and opportunity for growth is a serious problem, not to mention the sales-oriented goals despite a heavy workload of computer repair."
bad,"They were fairly flexible with hours, although I didn't give them much choice. The pay was appalling. The management treated us like children. There were no opportunities to improve."
bad,"Do not give majority of their workers more than 25 hrs a week. Managers are incompetent. Work tends to have its up and downs. Decent parttime job, not a place to be at longterm"
bad,"There are lot of things wrong with Staples as a company. Pay and benefits are bad even for retail, store managers are only concerned about themselves and their bonus. Typically they have no regard for their employees. The only help available is from other employees."
bad,It could have been a better experience. Management were strict and didn't really train you. But other than that it was good got to learn a lot and coworkers were the best.
bad,"Staples used to really be a great place to work, however with the advancement of online competitors Staples has began to decline and the pressure to stay afloat is too much."
bad,"with 4 managers in a year and 3 compensation plans in 3 years, Staples is constantly in the process of ""re-invention"" without really addressing its core deficiencies."
bad,"At the ludington store where i worked a couple of years ago, I did not enjoy my job at all. I wasnt trained properly to do my duties and would often get confused because i didnt know what to do. Management was almost nonexistent while i was there and that is why i did not last very long at all. was not a good work environment"
bad,leadership are more managers than leaders. very negative environment. no clear direction ever given. always short-staffed which prevents you from performing your actual responsibilities. poor wage/compensation. no reward/recognition/celebration of success. mostly negative feedback provided. little-to-no employee perks.
bad,"In my case, my manager was an abrasive person with little to no people skills. When our checks did not arrive, he did not assist with getting them to the store, stating ""It was not his responsibility to handle our checks"". (Staples Corporate said it was, by the way)."
bad,"A typical day at Staples is you have to sell  printers, computers, telephones and etc. Also you have to sell the warranties and attachments when selling printers and computers for example.  The attitude of the management at Staples is negative.  They are never satisfied at the workplace and demand more.  The hardest part of the job is the management always puts pressure on the employees.  When I first started with Staples it was a great place to work plus everyone was like family.  As far as today Staples is not as it used to be working in the past.  The management put a lot of pressure on the workers."
bad,very hard place to keep people higher management is the worst. To many things to do for the pay. Always under staff rude and nasty store manager. The best days were the off days when I didn't have to be there
bad,"management is stubborn,co workers lazy not team oriented . the customers were the best part of my day.  the store closed down and the second store i went to also shut down"
bad,"My experience  with Staples was not very good .. hardly six months at work was made redundant. "
bad,"It was not worth the pay we received for all of the work they give us to do. The hours are deplorable, the management is even worse. I was not receiving my paychecks by mail for weeks and no one did anything about it until I told the general manager which also took two weeks for me to be able to receive any type of payment. The company will work you to the bone for very little pay and expect you to keep a smile on your face while doing it. If you have a day off, please do yourself a favor and turn your phone off because they will try to guilt you into coming to work because they don't notify the employees of when they make a schedule change (which they frequently do). My advice is please do not work here if you have a better alternative."
bad,Employees are only as good as their numbers. If you don't meet the numbers you feel like you are not cared for. Manages always give their way to stubborn customers. Hours are not guaranteed and becoming full time is hard.
bad,"Also the staff is too gossipy and it will randomly put you into weird positions with the management. The work itself is pretty easy and the costumers tend to be nice, but the manager tends to make your day very hard. They also don't pay you the right amount of money and change your clocking in and out times, just to pay you less than you deserve. Many co-workers including me had plenty of unpaid hours. And the management finds a way not to give your holiday payment which you are entitled. "
bad,Not much to like. Raises never occur even if you get a great review. Minimal opportunities to advance. Constant threats of store closings. The district manager does visit often and knows all of the employees names.
bad,"By the time I got to Staples, the company had slashed staffing to what amounted to a skeleton crew, making their computer technicians troubleshoot and diagnose client computers, create work orders, unload trucks, maintain product, face product at night, run registers...they wanted one person working what amounted to half the floor space of the establishment for minimum wage. Ridiculous."
bad,"Your raise is only once a year which is @ 10 cents if you're lucky. Even as a cashier you are expected to handle all calls, every customer (you handle customer service needs while cashiering/answering phone calls) and you have to do 5 things at once getting paid minimum wage. Half the people there hate their jobs but they have to put up with it for low money. Also you work at 5 pm on Thanksgiving and have to come back at 5am for black friday. You're literally better off at any other retail store."
bad,"Not much hours unless your ok with working between 10 and 15 hours a week,. Managers don't cross train in other departments. some members of management are not the greatest while some are great."
bad,I learned a great deal at Staples in regards to how to handle large groups of associates. Would recommend to those who are trying to learn about logistics and production. Life work balance is real bad with an average day being at least 10 hours long.
bad,"Very often was I faced with the reality of customers approaching me with very little resources, and wanting me to create grand projects."
bad,"Busy from start to end with little direction , need more ownership of tasks and less politics. highly unorganised, need more organization"
bad,"As a Tech, you are required to do everything beyond your job duties.  Techs run the store. Customers are spoiled and they get everything they want"
bad,"Punch the clock, set up pallets, put up replenishments, stack and wrap pallets, check that everything is there and load pallets onto trailer/truck."
bad,okay job to start in the workforce. The site Manager I worked for was very unprofessional which made it hard to have a positive experience.
bad,I worked here as a cashier and talked to the customers. I tried to always stay busy but the pay was not worth the headache of the job.
bad,"Part time Tech and I get MAYBE 15 hours a week but can't go over 25. "
bad,"Sales in customer service. Besides having fun joking with co workers, this job is one I would never want to do again. There was no consistency, one minute management is friendly and the next they was to act like managers."
bad,Bad place to work at. Managers know less then you and they get mad at you when you prove them wrong. It takes along time to move up in the company
bad,"If you wanna work for Staples, do not work for any staples in the Bronx. They hire ban managers,who always talk about each other and throw each other under the bus"
bad,"typical day started at 7pm with stretches before we started to do our each individual jobs management would inform us of our nightly goal."
bad,"Typical day at Staples is fix whatever ever computers are on the bench, shoot a pull list, relentlessly ask customers to buy the protection plans."
bad,The company kept adding workload and ridiculous demands and did not offer any kind of pay increase or advancement opportunities.
bad,"Management here consistently treats me as if I am not important to the success of the store. Manager drops hours without prior communication, ignores my availability schedule (college student), does not confront me with issues regarding my performance and consequently drops my hours, and has me perform tasks that are supposed to be assigned to other departments. The job itself is fine, but I constantly feel as if I am going to be dropped at any moment."
bad,"Stressful from the start"
bad,It much have been the store I was in but that line of work wasn't for me. Management was never satisfied with what you did or how hard you worked. There was a lot of broken promises and miscommunication. There were times when I worked 7 hours without a single break because someone had to be on the floor. Management changed soon after I left.
bad,It's good to be gone. Difficult environment due to constant management shifting and downsizing.
bad,"On a standard day you would get pulled from pillar to post, never getting enough time to finish a job before starting another. a lot of part time staff that dont really care about kpi's and you constantly have to battle against them to get any kind of work out of them."
bad,I worked for Staples Inc for 7 months and it is an old fashioned and regressive place to work at.
bad,"If you want to work there than do it. Overall, its a good job for students in college or teens still in high school. there is no career opportunity"
bad,"I am a certified pc technician just looking to get some retail experience with computers to solidify my resume. I have great chemistry with the customers despite that most of them get mad over little issues that has nothing to do with the repair services that was offered to them. However, as a tech, the store i am at does not supply us with the right material to perform computer repairs and thats if we get the chance. We are mostly on the sales floor assisting customers and checkout. We are treated like tech savvy cashiers than pc technicians. Then stocking is horrendous with performing pull lists and stock since only one easy tech closes at night, have to restock everything by myself. The pay and hours suck since, at most i see 20 hours which is good because i cant stand working there. If you have i.t certs like myself, education, and experience but are still considering entry level i would not advise staples. I say steer clear and far from here because you are not hired as a certified pc technician like the description says, you are an easytech associate which is a fancy word for tech savvy cashier wasting your time. Im already looking for another job and i only been here a 2 months..."
bad,"Not recommended for anyone other then students. If you have bills don't rely on working full time. Management is poor. Truth be told it's really a joke for more reasons then one. Completely unorganized being the main reason. Also if you aren't level headed you are going to either confront the manager's or Co-workers. Often short staffed. I've worked a full 8 hour shift with one person in each department (5 people, which sounds like an ok amount, but that's spread through an entire store. Mind you no one knows anything about the others Department, so its up to you to balance customers.) on a Saturday, which is a busy day there."
bad,"The business end of Staples is alright, selling technology and office supplies as expected. It can get slow and boring but that just may have been at my location. I learned that not all companies are equal, and not all companies are ran alike though. I also learned that upper managementreally does count. When I had arrived, the GM for the first half of my employment was, to put it bluntly, not very good at what he did. He would constantly show up late and leave early, only sit in the office and watch Youtube, things of that sort. My co-workers though, they were a good bunch. They worked tirelessly and faithfully. Working got easier when management shifted, but rules that had never been enforced before did get enforced. The hardest part of the job was top-stocking printers. You can be told to top-stock some pretty heavy printers. Still, at the end of the day, if I was able to make a customer's retail experience a good one, I was happy."
bad,I enjoyed the co workers I had and the customers they were what made the job great. Work was unevenly distributed between a specific few including me and we were left with a sizable amount of the work and never acknowledged for it just thrown more work. Didn't really learn too much I did not know already besides about pens and printers and etc. For all of the work I was given a five cent raise. Other than the management and the lack of care for the sales associates the job was a great experience.
bad,I did not like working at staples at all. The other employees were not nice or friendly at all and the customers were just the same.
bad,"Not a good place to work, Poor management, average wages and benefits. A culture of profit over everything else."
bad,Good for the average college kid. Not the way to go if you have a family or about to start a family.
bad,"Typically, the environment at Staples is positive, but the atmosphere mainly depends on which manager is currently working. After working there for almost a year, I began receiving less and less hours for no reason, even after stating that I wanted more hours. Eventually, I started to receive 0 hours per week, while the company still hired new employees. On my yearly evaluation, I received extremely satisfactory in all categories. Therefore, the reason for receiving less hours until I started receiving none wasn't a shortage of work, or the fact of my ability to work. I can only assume it to be some sort of discrimination, so just be careful if you choose to work here."
bad,That's just it. You're given all these tasks to complete and not nearly enough time to do them. The company pays you in peanuts and the only way you can survive (even as a full time manager) is to pick up a second job. I watched them fire people with the combined experience of 35 years in the company for no reason. 
bad,"If you absolutely NEED a paycheck NOW go ahead and do this, but start looking for a new job after your first day. the pay is terrible, there is no compensation for selling any easy tech services...there is but you have to hit a level the company knows you will not hit. the store level management was the only thing that was decent here. the regional and district people have no clue what is going on, nor do they know anything about how a retail store actually works. you will be constantly threatened with your position if you basically do not start throwing things in shopping carts for people. get used to hearing ""why didn't you get more with that sale?"". the health benefits are terrible and the company has no values or culture. if you want to advance, you have to know someone."
bad,If your in management or tech the pay is ok and the presure to sell plans is tremendous! They go through GM's like water
bad,the ware house has alot of favoritism whit the supervisors in the picking department and the associates .. the hardest part of the job is when when you see the supervisors favorite associate not doing anything but stand around and talk all day its unfair to other associate that has to pick all day
bad,"Managers were very unprofessional, very difficult to advance, pay was terrible, and health benefits were awful."
bad,"Managers were horrendous. They'd wait until the end of the day before they'd nitpick all my mistakes and (as a person unable to handle constant screaming) if I cried, they'd ask me what was wrong with me. They knew I was slow to start and they gave me such impractical training of ""If you don't understand something, call me over. I don't know what else to tell you right now."" And left me to the cash register all on my own. And just went off and did their own thing. Overall, it was an awful job experience. Never again. By the way, you have to wait three months of working there before getting any benefit. They threaten your job if I did not sell their back to school passes. It's a stressful environment between mothers who need all the savings (understandably) and elderly as the most frequent customers."
bad,"For Staples there is only thing that is important to them and that is making the next quarters earnings numbers from Wall Street. Just last quarter the way the beat Wall Street expectations is they did another massive ""Reduction in Workforce"", this was the only way they could do it as the margins continue to shrink and they are losing local Mid - Large Size customers to the Local Independent Dealers. These dealers are offering better price, service and account management and these kinds of customers loved to be serviced and Staples hates to do it."
bad,"Staples is definitely the last place i would recommend someone to work in. Management think they run the world, and are so disrespectful. Even when you produce outstanding numbers, you never get recognition. Customers are friendly depending on where you work, but usually other associates are stressed from working there."
bad,"The company offers great training, the pay is very low. I think the management team needs to work much better on how to motivate and recognize the work of their employees. I strongly believe that they, management, finds extremely difficult to pull better benefits and perks for their employees. In regards of the Copy and Print division, account managers should be separated completely from the retail stores budget. The Account Mmanagement team should conform a new division for Staples, be completely independent for better results and more clear results."
bad,Staple's was my first real job experience. I was there for a very short time and would not recommend employment at this company to anyone. The management is incredibly unorganized.
bad,customer service helping customer find the things they needed and cashier
bad,"As a former retail manager, I was hired on as a dept supervisor at a pay rate of $8.85 an hour. Anyone with decent working experience should pass this place up."
bad,Not a great place to work. Loss it's edge as a people company in it's strive to be number one.
bad,"This was a classic job for just paying the bills. Very corporate retail, the pay was just pennies over minimum wage after a year or two, and emphasis was always on sale volume and customer satisfaction. I didn't know a single person there that was happy with their job."
bad,"Try somewhere else, underpaid and overworked. It's never the customers fault. Not a positive culture. Work life balance is terrible, no sense of fairness when it comes to scheduling."
bad,"Staples Canada is becoming The Working and Learning Company, with a focus on community, inspiration and services, the company is committed to being a dynamic, inspiring partner to customers who visit its 305 locations across the country or shop online at Staples.ca. Headquartered near Toronto, Ontario, The Working and Learning Company offers next-day more »"
bad,"The position I am in sounds great, but management and teammates are not the best.  5 managers in just under 3 years.  No stability.  The company states they are inclusive of all people, but that is not the case."
bad,"As a sales associate I was given the worst hours to work - Friday & Saturday nights. Worked all the holidays that the store was opened."
bad,"This job paid badly, was poorly managed, and didn’t have any disciplinary action. The other employees were awesome, though. They were the only reason I liked it and am glad I had that job."
bad,Zero job security at their contact center. ZERO. Do not look to work there if you depend on your paycheck! Promise to assist and rehire however getting an interview to get rehired never happens.
bad,"Lieu de travail stressant, peu de formation."
bad,"I have been working at Staples part-time for more than a year"
bad,Not a good job to work at. Lazy employees and managers. Long long hours. Bad management. I would not recommend nobody to work for staples. Very hard back breaking work.
bad,"If you're in high school I would suggest staples because of their flexible work hours, especially during the summer when it is back to school season when they need the most help. The wage and raises are not so good. Any other retail job would give better raises."
bad,"N/A - No longer trading "
bad,"Lazy workers, drugged up mangers and management with bad attitudes. On agency your promised full time but never seem to get offered. I was sacked few to a manger owing me money and decided to get me sacked so he didn’t have to pay me back!"
bad,"It's a retail job, people call off all the time, people quit all the time, You are forced to work every weekend because reasons. The job itself is not difficult and rarely challenges you. It's something to pay the bills until you get something better."
bad,"A lot of competition in the market now causing changes that don't seem to give them a competitive advantage.  ie robotics"
bad,"Too fast paced with little to no help. Expected, as one person, to get too many things done at once. Very stressful environment. Do not get paid enough to do as much as we do in the print department."
bad,"Management was really bad, no respect for in employees and management having relationship with Higher up.no support for employees or family, just how delivery"
bad,"During my time here I found that it was an unfavourable place to work at. At the location I was at they payed no one other that Supervisors and Managers more than Minimal wage, as a warehouse worker (Shipping and Receiving) I found this to be most difficult that I was being payed minimum wage to work the most labouring job at the location. The ""Team"" we had was only a skeletal crew and the management was such a micromanagement team that it made employees not enjoy showing up for work. During back to school season we didn't have the coverage that the company has lots of time to hire and be prepared for."
bad,The employees are overworked underpaid management treats them like slaves the benefits are so so but management definitely does not care about the drivers They hire nothing but inexperienced  drivers use them up till they’re burned out and then gets rid of them if they complain
bad,"Very unorganized"
bad,"If you have a pulse and will work full time they will want you to be a supervisor within months. This isn’t a good idea unless $11.15 an hour sounds good for being responsible for up to 10 employees at a time, and performing key holder duties. Once you are a supervisor you are essentially the sales and general manager’s fall guy."
bad,no leadership stressful work place management does not help you get head no room to grow lack of leadership micromanage alot no brake time ........................
bad,"Strong sales culture which i appreciate, not much concern for associates, scheduling or personal time.Pay is low, fairness in scheduling is low always under staffed."
bad,No accountabilty at all.the compensation is lower that what other similar jobs offer. My fellow associates were great but management did not seem to consider our team important.
bad,"I was the Tech Supervisor for my store for a year and a half and it was the worst experience ever. The only thing I take out my time with Staples is the excellent experience I gained while repairing and refurbishing computers. Management changed all the time, sales goals changed every other week, and nothing was consistent. I was never reimbursed for miles I used to complete On-site computer repairs and more. I was accused of stealing laptops while leaving the  store. This was later proven to be completely false. I will never work with this company again."
bad,"Staples is great for sales people or workers who are reliable and stay in low level positions. "
bad,"Disorganization, lack of leadership, and constant finger pointing regarding any issues that arise. The store has the capability to run well and be a positive and rewarding workplace however due to the above issues, it is not. 5 years in and I have had my fair share of let downs, disappointments, and name games."
bad,"Lack of management skill, a fun and energetic environment but organisation needs an overhaul. "
bad,Staples is a company to work at if you don’t really need to pay bills. Not a place for someone who has a lot of responsibility. Not an easy place to work but a nice little part time gig if needed
bad,"There is a lack of real communication and efficacy within Staples, especially from the corporate level. There seems to be no desire to modernize the company to compete with modern products and services. The company has seemingly been pillaged by people without any care for what the company was originally envisioned as; and the people who built it in the trenches. The executives are just there to make money and run. It has become a show of yes-men. It is purely a carcass being picked over by vultures at this point. Personally the management I worked with wasn't bad. I was given opportunities based on merit. I do feel I was being underutilized, underpaid, and not challenged enough for my capabilities. For the shortcomings that the company has, at the end of the day if you are a hard-working and motivated individual you can make the best of it."
bad,"The compensation at Staples is very low when compared to the expectations management has, at least for my current position. Lots of manual warehouse labor without the corresponding pay you might expect from such strenuous activity."
bad,"Staples is a prime example of why nepotism ruins the work environment . I had at least 2 managers who were only managers because they were friends with another manager. Supervisors blamed you for ""not working hard enough"" even though you were helping customers, stocking shelves, selling protection plans, and compensating for their laziness back to back with little to no breathing room. Management is so detached that the only thing they're good at is telling you how far behind you are compared to their fantasy expectations. The only reason I didn't give Staples a 1 star rating is because some of my coworkers were the most fun and supportive people I've ever met. Very few of them tolerated the job for longer than 5 months, however, so there wasn't much support from them for long because of how quickly they left the job."
bad,"While working at staples I became pregnant, was put on bed rest and my job was all but given away by the time that I was able to return. The manager then  stated that it was given to the other person because they didn't have a family and was able to work more than me, not based on merit or experience."
bad,"fun coworkers thats about it and great management, before the upper maangement came and changed to their liking. Now its bad and run by their people for the most part."
bad,"The last 6 months of my employment here was terrible. The company left us without a regional manager, general manager or an assistant manager for 3 months which is when I chose to leave. During that time, the store was run by key-holders who lost interest in managing their departments. Staples only offers yearly raises which is not much. I was moved to their copy and print department after a year of working there, which came with a $0.50 pay raise. However, my yearly raise was $0.10. Although I loved the job itself, the company and lack of management left me disappointed with the experience I had working at Staples."
bad,"Great place to work with good training, great product and pay for performance. There are a lot of resources available to help employees succeed in their position."
bad,I been working for staples since 2014.  For 4 years  I have worked there and learned everything I know about register. I've seen colleagues come and go. I trained a lot of new employees along the way.  Lately though we've lost too many employees.  At least half a dozen co-workers of mine quit or got themselves fired.  I got 2 managers that are hardly around to help with tech work being be have none left and we got next to no coverage when customers need help.  Very stressful and unfair situation for a cashier.
bad,temporary job and requires alot of multi tasking and alot of customer service experience. mostly part time workers because they do not provide any benefits.
bad,"Pros; ability to control own schedule and ability to work from home."
bad,"Understaffed, poor managment,  employees had to walk around the floor looking like they were doing something when CLEARLY their was other important work to do and the employees KNEW that, but are forced to walk this floor like a zombie. Poor organization and overall company."
bad,"was fun at first then the small business changed causing them to focus on services. then became cut throat and pushing stuff on customers that they did not want.,"
bad,"Management relied heavily on the associate that needed very little direction. Which in return over worked them while the other associates did whatever they wanted and got the hours. "
bad,Wasn't there long enough to really benefit from the job. worked in the copy center and it was just a stepping stone to gert another job. Management wasn't too friendly and couldn't wait to find something else
bad,Great place to start your work experience but not a great place to stay unless you would like to be a manager.  At the time pay was about average with other retail.
bad,"Not a company to work for if you're looking for a career job! Perfect job for young college kids or someone who only wants to work part time. Upside is there are stores that provide excellent customer service, products and services."
bad,"I wasn’t getting enough help to get my tasks done on time, other employees were lazy & lack of team work, the manager at that time was always moody, it was hard to express your opinions around the manager"
bad,"There were a lot get rich ideas that the executives thought would help.  When those ideas didn't show results in 90 days the program was changed or abandoned.  They are great at selling technology but didn't use it, has anyone ever had a quick check out?"
bad,"Underplayed and under appreciated. The hours were always inconsistent. The management was generally good, but wildly unorganized at a corporate level."
bad,Working at staples is very much a typical retail job. There is pressure to sell so many things for any reason. And the employee turnaround is almost a betting game of seeing who lasts how long. The pay is not good to stick around and there are no benefits and at the time there was a HEAVY emphasis on all non managers are 20 hours or less a week. Period.
bad,This company will take your soul. There's never enough coverage and they don't care about your well being or if you have personal problems that need to be taken care of. A typical day there consists of idiots that don't know what they are doing or just don't care and the favoritism is ridiculous. Nobody does anything there. Like bare minimum of learning where to find or learn about the product. It's the most stressful job I ever had.
bad,Not an enjoyable experience. Management used their position of power to treat people as if a number and not a person. Did not enjoy working at Staples at the time that I was there.
bad,I applied for tech sales and was put in office supplies. They want you to pressure people into getting the insurance for products. Management had  issues understanding personal life problems and were not very lenient.
bad,"Empresa que não dá valor aos colaboradore. Focam-se apenas nas vendas colocando de parte os colaboradores que dão a cara. Péssima gestao de logistica/armazem, péssimos salários(sem estabilidade financeira). Chegas aos 3ºcontrato e vais embora."
bad,"The company itself has become outdated and is slowly dying off. They put pressure on the management and associates by pushing metrics. Wanting a amount of Liquid Armors, credit card applications, reward signups, sales of PCs with a certain amount of attachments, and surveys being done."
bad,"A typical day at work starts slow until around 9:30-10-00,after that the demand to be on point increases.We employees learn to have to work fast to satisfy every customer the best we know how and are supervisors and managers sometimes help making it flow much easier.The hardest part of the job would be satisfying every customer at the same time because when back to school starts the customers have high demands and so does the employer but that's what makes us great,we work perfect under pressure."
bad,"Management is horrible, there is more drama than people actually getting things done, there's tricky things going on behind closed doors such as the manager allowing employees to forge his signature to pass store requirements. Lots of stress, not worth it. Pay is okay but very few hours. Usually very slow."
bad,Stressful place to be no good management team at this place. Would not work here again. Nothing else to say about this place. Just my opinion that's all.
bad,"The training at this place is a joke.  It was a horrible place to work and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.  And by that I mean run for cover. Management have their favourites and if it isn't you, look out. Expect to be a workaholic or you wont succeed at keeping your job.  The customers on the phone are easier to handle than the management."
bad,They promised me a raise after 6 months and I got it… five cents. Wow. Thank you. Also the management was bad and hey didn’t care if you spent the whole day watching Netflix in the bathroom and they kept me until 11:30 some school nights even though I was onky schedule until 10.
bad,Staples was a place to earn cash over the summer and I would try my best to not have to work in that environment again. The superiors felt they were allowed to do or say anything and those below them were silenced if they ever spoke up.
bad,The only thing that stays the same is constant change. Hard to get things done with priorities and projects always changing.  A lot of hard working co-works that you could depend on.
bad,If you are a high school student or college student this would be a great job for you and if you are not looking to advance in the company this would be a great position and first job for you otherwise I would not work for this company.
bad,I thought there was a large disconnection between what happens on the floor and what the business pushed us to do.  I loved my coworkers and manager but I never felt like staples actually cared about me.
bad,A fair retail experience although more times than not you are expected to do more or if not perform better than realistic numbers not a place to excel
bad,"Managers do the best they can but they are afforded little resources and still expected to produce results"
bad,"I don't know if it was just because I didn't get on with the managers or what but I had a horrible time working for Staples. The job was supposed to be 2 shifts, Saturday and Sunday 9am-6pm. Not once did I work my actual shifts. I lived quite far from where Staples was and a 4 hour shift was not worth the money by the time I'd paid for petrol. I felt bullied by some members of staff and the building was like a furnace. I enjoyed learning how to photocopy things or make calendars or bind folders for people. I learned a lot whilst I worked there."
bad,"I have worked here for 3 years now, a large portion of the managers are remote and never available to support when needed and do not answer email contacts."
bad,A very hard job management not good expected you to work all hours even though at the time my child was young and family didn't come into their way of employment
bad,In the time i worked for this company I past through 23 store managers. In that time i trained and worked in all 6 depts. They do have a great retirement program
bad,"The culture has changed dramatically over the 13yrs employed at Staples.  Unfortunately, like many firms, they are battling to stay competitive in an ever-evolving business world.  Once leaders in the market they are challenged to sustain against new major competitors like Amazon.  "
bad,"Staples will drain the life out of you. They really don't care about the employees and the higher up in the chain the less human they become. There are some great resources if you have been in a devastating situation but other than that forget about it. They used to have a great scholarship program but made it more impossible as time passed. Changes to the schedule are made with no notice to anyone, unless you see it happening you don't have a clue. Unless you have worked there for a long time and have sacrificed all your social life for this place they will not care about you, and even then if you try to step down they will cut some people's pay but other's get to keep it. Favoritism at its finest. You will also have to fight for fair pay and it takes YEARS to get something decent."
bad,"My review is i like Staples as a company, but the store i work at is hard to work at, inventory is always off, employees are always taking days off,so for a reliable worker like myself its not a decent job anymore."
bad,"Worked at Staples as a part time cashier who had many abilities beyond the front end. Typically as a cashier you would customer service, direct phone calls to the right department or try to help out and answer whatever question they have. Your'e required to promote Staples' credit card, protection plans, liquid armor and whatever other promotion is occurring. You are constantly trying to sell extra things to people and ask everyone the same questions. Management at this particular site is complete garbage. It's very obvious your immediate management and corporate could not care less. The most stressful part of this job was basically doing other people's jobs when I had my own things to handle, and not being recognized for it."
bad,"Stressful, cut throat , hard to grow , to much high demand not enuff pay almost never get a raise , poor manegment poor hr poor understanding of job title"
bad,"Job culture/ job security  is cut throat, time and time again your put on the spot in front of all your peers if your store is not one of the top preforming stores even if its out of your control."
bad,I was hired through a jobzone program and was paid by them for the first three months. Things were average for a retail job though I was very young making it hard to relate to most of the staff.
bad,"Working for staples felt like working with children, people would walk out and then have a job next day. mangers would hid all day in their office, employees are doing nothing and get away with it."
bad,Would have loved to grow with the company but management and employees need proper retraining. So many good employees left the company due to the lack of professionalism in our management circle.
bad,Going through changes closing stores that are not profitable. My manager was transferred and changes are occurring everyday. My role changed and may change again.
bad,Each day was busy and you always have something to do.  It is never ending and things are always different you are coaching and working with the employees to make sure they also understand the culture
bad,Wouldnt go back. Management terrible .  Not sure why you are asking for this when I havent worked there for many years. You should talk to current employees
bad,"Pay is minimum wage. They overload you with work when i was there. One person at register, one person working floor and one manager. Understaffed like crazy (due to Staples taking employee cuts)."
bad,"Very monotonous work with a very incompetent GM, who was often never in-store except during the few busy weeks. The silver lining to this place was my co-workers, who broke up the monotony by being light-hearted and fun."
bad,"Loved the work, and co-workers, but management put their overseeing responsibilities onto the floor staffs shoulders and when they didn't the results they were hoping for, employees were railroaded out the door.  Very unprofessional and sneekie."
bad,"Its a job. They dont pay well, and expect alot out of their employees for little pay. They do offer few holidays, but not many. Its a retail position."
bad,"I'll just say I wasn't surprised when they were bought by a private equity company earlier this year. Even if the merger with Office Depot were successful, Staples would still have been in huge trouble. I like the CEO's vision and think the supply chain side of the organization is well-run, but as far as merchandising is concerned, management is a disaster."
bad,"Was a fast paced environment."
bad,"Typical Day :"
bad,stressful work place management was unprofessional. the hardest part about working here were the customers. they were extremely and at times will belittle the associates.
bad,"have been with them for long years and I am truly excited each day because I have an opportunity to think about my current role, my opportunity to grow and most important my value to the community and believe it or not earth."
bad,"The training was crashed coursed,had to wait 30 minutes for mgr to open the door after hours so I could go home, parking lot lights were off. Not Cool"
bad,"And this is not for all departments."
bad,Working at staples puts a person through more stress than it should be.  Management won't do anything to help you rather they just tell you to do tasks as they constantly check weekly numbers. Just about 100% of the time the store is understaffed and if  you work on the floor you're asked to do way to many things at once for a minimum wage job. Every one in the store is very pressured to sell plans even though you received no compensation for it and it should only be the tech's job.
bad,I joined Staples in Greenwood as a tech expert to use my skills at computer repair and maintenance to improve customers lives. The rigid nature of the repairs and the associated costs prohibited me from using my skills. The unscheduled nature of the management prohibited me personally from dedicating enough time to customer issues. Staples was only interested in getting the customer into the door to make the sale. The focus on making the sale instead of customer satisfaction created a toxic environment that prohibited both.
bad,It was a short summer job during college. You restocked and helped kids during back to school. Overall easy and the employees were easy to get along with.
bad,they only work with you when its convenient for them. no consideration for personal growth or development. the work environment was competitive and unhealthy.
bad,"Start up meeting is good, but your opinion will not be respected. They do give most employees a chance to learn different aspects of the overall operation. Management is unstable. I worked there 10 months and had 3 different supervisors. The place is like a high school, and very unsafe. The hardest part of the job is the disorganization. The best part of the job is the pay rate."
bad,"Staples, Inc. is more concerned with revenue than employees.  "
bad,Staples has a lot of locations and thus a lot of room for advancement. The company puts a high value on people development. The job requires a lot of long hours at the General Manager level due to a high number of metrics required to be hit with dwindling resources.
bad,"I found my time at Staples to be unfruitful towards pursuing a full career. Typical of most retail entry level positions, they did not have any career paths truly open to pursue."
bad,"very fast paced around holidays, scheduling sucks. pay was decent. managers were ok when they weren't stressed out. for a office supply store you would thing its very calm and cool. not the case when you work there,"
bad,Management is not trained properly which makes for a very unorganized store. Coworkers are great and fun to be around. Advancement is almost impossible if you are a woman.
bad,Not a very fun place to work at all. Many mean customers and unfriendly people. Probably one of the worst experiences one could find. Dreaded going into work.
bad,"assistant manager would record and threaten to report us"
bad,"i started off at this company at their call center, not much training"
bad,"not the type of place you really want to be to build a career, your essentially doing the job of a basic amazon or google search. Expect not to really advance in the company unless you have a degree or some sort of certification, which will allow them to squeeze out extra skill at the lowest pay they can get away with"
bad,"Friendly co workers, but if you do not quite fit in to the staples crowd dont expect to. I remember feeling alienated because I didnt have the same interests, or the same age as a lot of the other workers who had been there longer than me. I was not Happy when I found out I was being paid 9.99/hour. One cent short of minimum wage based on the staples fundamentals on how much you earn based on your job description AND hours worked. Never made sense to me"
bad,Steady work environment..Sometimes the hours can be up and down ..But it is an part time job.. Staples is a great job to give you basic training on the ins and outs of retail.
bad,"Staples only seems to hire for just part time, and is only good for people who are looking for their first job. Not recommended for someone who is trying to raise a family."
bad,"I worked for Staples for roughly a year. Started out seasonal and managed to stay with the team. sadly, you won't get promising hours, however, during the back to school season, your hours are promised."
bad,Good company to work for if you are just starting out. Good hours and as long as you do what you are told you will not have any problems. Make sure you are always on time.
bad,"Staples was high stress, low pay environment.  Be buddy buddy with management or they dont care for you too much and target you. would not want to work there again"
bad,Not somewhere i'd like to work again under the current management. Management were very deceptive and not very experienced about the job. Withheld beneficial infornation needed to complete the job.
bad,Great place. Great people. More assistance needed for employee concerns. Great benefits. Great space for independent work. Needs more team players. Need more fun activities.
bad,My facility received virtually support from upper management in management/labor relations when numerous drivers complained of the work hours and refused to take on additional duties.
bad,"Call center environment. I learned to build rapport with customers while communicating with management and utilizing the resources provided to assist customers to resolve any issues they may have with their account, shipments, etc. High turnover rate with management which made it difficult to provide perficient service, as well as advancement opportunities. Very friendly environment with acceptable pay. Assisted customers with orders fulfillment, data entry, shipment tracking, or helping them resolve their concerns on one call."
bad,"Heavy call volume most times, a lot of different things to learn regarding orders. Management was ok workplace culture was very different. The hardest part of the job was making sure that you did the right procedure for a particular order. Best part of the job was getting paid weekly and voluntary time off."
bad,"Very busy solving furniture order process, delivering and installing furniture projects. Immediate workplace culture was fine, upper management was minimal."
bad,this company is very professional and is a very comfortable work environment. there is opportunity for advancement. management is very productive
bad,"I did not enjoy working at Staples, Although some of my coworkers were pleasant to work with the overall vibe from the store was cluttered and annoyed. The manager constantly withheld information pertinent to the employees to do our job. The hardest part of the job was trying to work under such unorganized manner"
bad,"I worked in the Burlington location and did not enjoy my position past two weeks. "
bad,"a typical day starts with opening the store making sure everything is ready for the day ahead, check emails and action anything that has been sent down, set targets for staff and talk them through how to achieve these, serve customers, make sure daily tasks are complete make sure inventory tasks are complete. management are spread too thin, team leaders running the stores general managers acting as district managers. the people who work in the stores are by far the best thing about staples. the running of the company is dreadful randomly changing ideas every month to try and make some sort of progress, pushing the price of products higher and higher and wondering why there are no customers, having an online business that undercuts the stores and not allowing stores to match the price is crazy and turns the customer away."
bad,"This job has been helpful for the last few years, however I'm looking for a position that offers me room for advancement, with a higher pay grade."
bad,"lack of hours, poor management, bad pay, bad benefits,  bad this bad that bad everything about this job everything bad do not apply to this terrible place"
bad,"Culture was mostly "" Make it so Number One"". Mgmt attitude towards customers was My way or the highway. No cross training unless self taught. Scheduling was difficult the store needs overrode any other concerns i.e. family, med appointments."
bad,"Just wasn't the job for me. I wanted to do different type of work $7.85/hr. was not going to make ends meet, especially after having my first born. So I expanded for greater opportunities."
bad,Great starting position for someone right out of college. Not much job security but good training for someone just starting out.
bad,"No geral a experiência foi boa a nível pessoal para evoluir como profissional para algumas áreas que eram fora da minha zona de conforto, aprendi coisas novas e aventurei-me mais para algumas coisas que não eram o meu forte na altura. "
bad,"Feminism makes this place a horrendous place to work for. That's all I can say. The GM is there to collect a check, and generally treats men like garbage. We have an excellent female manager; she got transfered to a different store then everything got out of control."
bad,"Terrible management for the BDM's (gun to your head style management). Extreme micromanagement and unrealistic activity metrics are put in place. No job security in this division. If you are not in this division, then overall Staples is a good company to work for."
bad,"Our manager is not even a real manager. We're short of staff. I'm in college so I need time off to study but I work 5 days a week even though they know it. I also have minor health problems which require medicines that make me feel horrible. I ask for time off because of that and I get told no because ""nobody can cover me"" although the ""manager"" didn't ask anybody if they could."
bad,"Horrible place to work, long shifts, underpays employees. The most important con is that the management team overworks their employees and they are rude and disrespectful."
bad,"Into work, begin answering calls from store associates and customer service reps, taking on a teaching role when applicable and taking over escalations for reps to resolve customer issues"
bad,"Horrible management at the store level. Was told by my GM that I was ""never allowed t sell a computer again"" because of minor mistakes I made in an area I was never trained instead of offering to train me. Maybe if they actually spent the money to have more sales people in the store I wouldn't get dragged over there. The other manager, divisional sales or something is constantly being sarcastic when I ask him questions or hardly ever listens when I talk to him on the phone. very unprofessional and can't wait to leave."
bad,"Manager there was a pervert who flirted with the girls and gave the males a hard time, he was also never satisfied with our line of work.If we completed something in a very good time he would get enraged and assign us things that not even he could do himself overall the job was a terrible place to work at all of management had terrible attitudes and were very disrespectful the only good person there was the general manager john."
bad,"boring workplace with non- supportive management."
bad,"There is no Policies and procedures."
bad,"First of all let me say there are parts of this job I liked and parts I didn't like . This happens in many jobs that we just need to deal with but I myself would not choose this company as a career move. However they are a great company for people to work for.  I wish they had better training.  This was a safe and clean place to work for, also the customers were very nice typically. Usually they were business type or minded people who tended to shop there, which was a nice change."
bad,Very big company but doesn't pay that well. Long hours in the summer time but in the winter always struggled to hit 40 hours.
bad,"Très bonne équipe de travail. Il y a beaucoup à faire en peu de temps, donc ça passait généralement vite."
bad,"Full of friendly, welcoming staff. Great atmosphere. Fantastic customer base and wide variety of calls.  "
bad,I worked for them years ago on the west coast and every one was so happy someone had to retire to move up. The people and culture was fabulous on the west coast. When coming to the east coast and had to walk outside and look at the building to make sure I was still with the same company.
bad,"Staples is a very inconsistent place to work. They change your schedule without your knowledge or even asking you, and then get mad when you don't know the schedule changed. They are inconsiderate and don't like to work as a team."
bad,"Company is struggling to find it's way, is trying to chase down too many different things at the same time. Rather than focusing on it's core business"
bad,"Falta de organização, comunicação e formação insuficiente."
bad,"The schedules are poorly made and poorly regulated, by the end of the week we are extremely short staffed due to a 25 hour cap on all part time employees. Many are ineligible to complete the work week."
bad,"Promises of upward advancement and fair compensation lured me to Staples only to find after 8 months that they are slicing the retail presence and over working the people that weren't eliminated. The whole company is moving towards an online sales theme and the store is only staffed enough to keep the lights on."
bad,Good balance of tasking and customer service. Flexible schedule. I love looking at all the neat technical stuff they carry
bad,worked on the front end of the store. assisted customers in checking out. Occasionally I would work on the floor as well.
bad,this job was not good at all. I was an intern there and the real workers that actually worked there was not doing their job. they were using the interns and the managers didn't watch over their employees.
bad,The scheduling was very confusing and the organization of our inventory created a lot of issues when trying to help customer.
bad,"At Vector there wasn't a lot of things there that I was into. They did have me as a sales rep, but we had to make appointments to sell knifes. The only way you made money was if you sold to a specific age group or sold some of the knifes"
bad,"a typical day at work is busy and unpredicatable. i learned copy & print and designing work, the management os ok but could be better. my co-workers are awesome. The hardest part of the job was dealing with irate customers. the most enjoyable pasrt of the job was being able to help others"
bad,Staples needs to learn to treat their employees much better. They also need to take the time to pay attention to their managers - some do not deserve their jobs
bad,Major cutback in hours and staff has made the work double and pay lessen if we measure a work to hour ratio. It's not the worst job to have as it can have good days but not a job that has advancements.
bad,"They expected you to perform far too many job functions for the amount of pay received and favored employees far too much."
bad,"it wasnt great working there, the salary was very low.. required as to do alot of stuff and some of the managers werent even qualified to be one"
bad,I would not recommend Staples to anyone looking to make a major career change.  The company is highly disorganized and it appears to have no leadership.
bad,"Computer sales based, does not require any skills; other than very basic PC repair/troubleshooting. Very low pay (in hand with the no skills needed job). Management situation varies by store."
bad,The success of a company depends on the motivation and work growth of its workers. This job taught me what I didn't want in a company. The management team focuses more on  negatives while continuously overlooking the positives. They do not provide commission and expect you to go out of your job description at any moment at their request (which happens often). For a company that expects so much from their workers they sure do treat them poorly. Which is clearly counterproductive. Consistent Stress should be a job expectation on applications.
bad,"Staples is closing 300 stores. Job security is shaky."
bad,"Driving sales, service and employee developmen.  Also making sure the store is clean, instock for the customer and hazard free."
bad,"stressful and not worth the pay"
bad,"A typical day at work would be coming in to see nothing has been done while i'm not there and then assessing all the statuses of the customers computers at where still in store. I'd then run an audit for the whole tech bench to make sure everything is accounted for and then begin working on the computers at hand. I actually have learned quite a bit from this job from other associate who knew more then i and then from just personal experience with computers. Management is very rude and not caring of your well being and more worried about making money then selling the customer the correct product. Their mindsets i found not in the right place when it came to the customer they simply wanted the sale, and not to help them. The hardest part of the job was the deal with the management and other employees. The most enjoyable part of the job was help the customers and a polite way to find the right product and have them happy in the long run i made sure they were comfortable with what they were getting."
bad,"this is a place for younger people to work , not for adult who have bills , because the pay is so bad"
bad,"good experience for retail, store is cool, corporate is evil"
bad,Management never wanted to advance you they just want their sales goals met
bad,"As a past cashier, there wasn't much to my job. I handled transactions and made sure that people were informed on products and services we offered. Management was all about sales and co-workers were all about kissing management's butt. Hardest part of job was meeting sales goals cause business was slow. Most enjoyable part was knowing that this was just temporary, wasn't going to be at this job forever."
bad,"Working with different types of customers who are tech savvy or less tech savvy, in providing them the best technology that will meet their needs. In addition, fixing customers computers that may be infected with viruses or need addition parts or services."
bad,Management has changed and everyday is a new chore and problem
bad,People were rude and the work environment was petty.  I have nothing really to say about it other than it wasn't worth the pay
bad,"I was hired as a seasonal employee for the back-to-school period with the potential to be hired on as a permanent part-time."
bad,Very unprofessional workplace. Leadership skills were not taught
bad,Troubleshoot and diagnose workstation and laptop problems. Handle floor sales in technical department. Inventory of store products. Run checkout counter from time to time. The staff was mostly young people. Very repetitive daily tasks with no room for growth.
bad,Before staples took over. I was glad to be out when it first started. Staples is not employee friendly.
bad,"asked to do too much for a very low pay, under staffed most of the time, not enough hours is the most common answer you hear from everyone, really hard to get a raise and when you do its like nothing, managers are getting fired left and right and some just quit, a high turn over rate of employees just quitting, apply there if you are desperate for a job"
bad,A typical day consisted of me trying to get my work done after fixing/finishing what other people were supposed to do the night before. Management did not hold people accountable for their actions. People got away with more than they should have. The hardest part of my job was trying to communicate with the management team. I did enjoy helping the customers.
bad,They have good intentions and ideas that are theoretical but completely lack reality to execute and utterly lack willingness to back up those intentions and ideas or their people they task with pulling off those ideas.   They are run by the HR department which is in CYA mode all the time to stay out of court because the leaders abuse their people and enrich themselves off the backs of most everyone else.  They are the tail wagging the dog at Staples.
bad,"Working with others is the best part of the job.  However, Field Management often substitutes is self serving vision for the company vision which makes it very difficult to manage."
bad,"I have read a lot of sales books in my days and one thing that I know Staples is, that is a carrot and stick company.  They show you the carrot but never give it to you no matter how successful you are, they just keep hitting you with the stick."
bad,"I have to say, that I have worked in a call centre environment for most of my working life, and this call centre was not all that well organized.  I also was not really paid fairly for my skills that I should have been, when other new people were coming into the company who had far less experience were being paid more."
bad,Management only cares about how you sell their warranty plans and well how you get them to their sales goal.
bad,"Always got stuck doing manager jobs"
bad,"Great job for a high school senior, or someone in college. Minimum wage, which is expected of most retail places, but decent hours. The job itself is really easy, which made it fairly enjoyable. The customers were the worst part, especially if the Staples is located near local higher end businesses, you get a lot of grumpy self-entitled business folk."
bad,The general manager was not a pleasant person to staff or customers!
bad,"Got hired to be a supervisor, after hired I was turned down for the job because the gm's bother needed a job."
bad,"The staff was great, I had some terrific customers. However written policies were not often followed by upper management, communication was frequently unclear, and the benefits looked a lot better online then in reality. "
bad,"There is no chance for growth personally and professionally. You work 33 hours each week and are paid minimum wage. The job is too mechanical, no flexibility. "
bad,"As a manager I had to manage through fear (according to my district manager) who did that as well. Our job was always put on the line for everything we did and in all honestly, it was never a pleasant place to work, "
bad,"I worked for Staples for over 3 years, worked my way up the ladder into Management. During that time I had several GM's and was praised by all of them for my hard work and success. Then during a massive GM transfer, I got a new GM. I had heard nothing but bad things about them from the store they came from, and it was all true. During my time with that GM our stores employee turn around went through the roof, people quitting or getting fired left and right. The worst part is that corporate looks at this like it's improving the store, but it was only hurting it, and the rest of the employees moral overall."
bad,"Depending on who's is the manager on duty, I could be the only sales person on the floor for an entire shift, or I would be buried in customer computers that needed to be worked on. Other times I would have help and catch up on all behind work."
bad,I do know the staples i worked at was not organized and they where kind of rude.
bad,Most of the employees there are very friendly but the problem comes when you try to get out of your department and advance further in the company. If you are a good seller like I was they want to keep you in that position because you are making the company money. I took a job at Staples in their EasyTech department so that I could gain experience in the computer tech field. Once they found out that I was a good seller and even though I was hired to work in their computer department they wanted to keep me on the sales floor because that was were they felt I would do the company best. I was never given the opportunity to see where else I would the company good at.
bad,"A typical work day at Staples Promotional Products includes devloping and growing relationships with clients of top key accounts for the company. I not only speak with these clients verbally on the phone but also through email and face to face contact. Ive worked there for almost 7 years and have not only gained great relationships with my co-workers but with my clients as well. Ive grown top accounts from only a few hundred clients to currently over six thousand. My clients not only call me to place orders and get information but call to invite me to their weddings, baby showers and other events they have going on in their personal lives. Establishing and building these relationships is no doubt the most enjoyable part of my job."
bad,At times an exciting place to work. Always found co-workers willing to help in any way they could.
bad,Very little pay for the hard work that is expected of you every day. Their equipment is always breaking down and the management always blames the employee with miss batches and wouldn't listen when several employees were trying to explain the mistakes their computer systems were tally up at the end of the day and we were always told the computer are always right and then they would let us go.
bad,"Co workers are great to work with. proudction talk with each others , maintenance is on ther own"
bad,"I have enjoyed working for the Staples Copy Center as both a Copy Print Pro and a Copy Center Lead. Production was my favorite part of the job. The downside of this job was management and scheduling. The eight years that I have worked for this particular Staples we have had five different General Managers. Each had their own way of running things. Scheduling was horrible. No one should work alone during busy hours. Although I have great multi-tasking skills and did well working alone, customers were unsatified when having to wait such a long period of time while I assisted other customers. This should not be allowed in any job."
bad,"This is the only company that I've ever worked for that when you make a sale, small or large, you can't get the goods to your client as promised or on time. Working in this position got to the point of being laughable."
bad,"As an Easy Tech Technician, you are constantly expected to perform two very different jobs at once. You are needed behind the bench working repairing computers, and also at the same time expected to be on the sales floor meeting numbers. Service times get delayed from the constant distraction of the sales floor, especially during the times when there is no sales support from other associates. 20% of the job is sales, 20% is resolving technical issues, and 80% is dealing with customers who are angry that the service on their computer isn't finished yet. Also, the schedule is very different each week, no sustainable rhythm, and no guarantee you will have enough hours to pay rent. One week you have 37 hours, the next you have 15."
bad,"My store was (and most others are) minimally staffed, so all employees are expected to float around departments as business dictates or to cover breaks. This is especially inconvenient for the techs who have a special skillset and have many more responsibilities. Many times as a tech I found myself having to repair PCs as well as ring up customers and help customers on the sales floor."
bad,Hours are okay its a retail store so if you worked at one then you kno what its like at the next one.
bad,Staples is like any typical supply store. I stocked shelves and helped customers for minimum wage.
bad,"Only worked for little while but was an average experience. Some coworkers were nice some were not, others expected more out of me even though I was new there. Overall the company is not bad to work for just the place I worked at involved too much politics so decided to quit."
bad,Difficult to deal with a lot of external work associates. Inexperienced employees are hired in order to pay low Could be a good place to work 2-3 years from now
bad,"Staples is a fun workplace.  The pay is very low and management sucks.  They push sales and expect you to sell without commission as an incentive.  If you're not selling, your hours will not reflect."
bad,"The store never had any security cameras and was often vandalized probably every day. They had the cameras from the Fort Smith store but didn’t wanna pay the $6000 it would take to install them but they excepted $42,000 in losses per year. Somethings wrong with that!"
bad,Very unhealthy place to work. it's Very disorganized and lack of opportunity and growth. Very racial profiling threw out the wor j place along with favoritism and misleading of what everything to convince people to stay.
bad,"One of the most uptight and obtuse work environments I have ever experienced. "
bad,"The job description was totally misleading in regards to work hours you will work at lease 9.5 to 11 hours every day therefore their is no work and life balance what so ever which causes for a unhealthy life in the long term. The pay is very subpar for the work that the divers are responsible for completing. There more concern about there budget than ensuring there brand is represented in the community in which they serve. i.e. when you're in training you will only get a hat and a shirt, no rain gear, no vest, no pants etc.. this does not give the new employee the mindset that you care about them nor your brand. Most importantly is they will never keep the amount of drivers they need with the long hours (everyday) and the pay scale. The management needs to show more concern about the employees then an empty truck at the end of the day. I pray these comments will make a difference because overall there are some good people that work there and they deserve to be able to rest and spend time with there families and received better pay."
bad,"for a part time job its good just to make some cash if you're in highschool, would not recommend the job for anything else."
bad,Great place to work until you realize they don't care for their employees and only care about getting numbers. Although i suppose that depends on the District manager you get.
bad,"I wouldn’t recommend at management level. The focuses are constantly changing, and there is constant turnover in the sales manager/supervisor even General Manager roles.  The general rule is “turn em and burn em”. Very disorganized and culturally deficient."
bad,Basically everything you don't want while working retail. Intentionally under staffs registers and demands that you keep the line non-existent while still making warranty sales and rewards member sign ups.
bad,"Partners with management to set sales goals and targets. Ensures team understands connection between store financial success and bonus programs. "
bad,"During my time with this company I, and many of my coworkers, have had issues with our management. We don't have enough staff to cover the store and the manager puts all of that pressure on the associates we do have. Many of the new associates come and go due to the unrealistic expectations and pressure placed on all of the store associates. The company overly stresses about rewards program sign ups and protection plans. The most satisfying part of the job is being able to help the customers obtain the tools to complete their tasks but we do get many customers with unrealistic expectations which is common when working in retail."
bad,"Good for beginners but if you have a lot of experience, it will not be used.  Crazy turn on a dime culture with no real direction.  You should only take a job here if you understand its only temporary."
bad,"they will short you hours so you don't work 40 even working mandatory  overtime. you will work mandatory OT early in the week and be send home  with  6 hour at the end of the week  or less so you don't get overtime. its a dead end job with nothing to look forward  to, they make up new positions , you bid and interview for them only to do away with the position  3 months later and demote you back to where you started . training sucks  , you'll never get a good  performance review because supervisors only talk to you when you are not meeting their numbers ."
bad,The pay was decent but not worth the day to day aggravation. Outdated equipment. No safety regulations. Immature management. Unnecessary overtime. Inconsistency through the entire warehouse.
bad,"As a Print and Marketing Associate, I expected the work to be hectic but very rarely was there more than 3 hours of working with coworkers and doing orders and walk in orders by yourself is awful because rarely are there patient and understanding customers and getting yelled at by customers is awful."
bad,"Enjoyed work at staples in 2010-2012. Got good training, got promoted, had attentive management.  Went back 4 years later. Culture completely changed.  No pride in work, store was more like fancy Walmart than computer office supply store. Forced to work specific job ONLY. Personal initiative discouraged. Manager good but aloof to issues. Assistant manager egotistical insecure immature moron. Second assistant manager VERY capable but kept from promotion. I resigned  the first chance I got."
bad,"the work place is alright at best although they expect unrealistic warrenty sales on their products and give you terrible hours to achieve it, so due to that you get talked to frequently as to why you havent achived said goal in the small 4-5 hour shifts at night."
bad,"They  cant keep workers, discriminate with colored people, they play favoritism with certain employees. management is not interested in keeping hard workers.  And equipment doesn't work.. some supervisors are lazy. The job is easy, but everything else sucks."
bad,"Staples was the one job that I hated. Like any other company sales and numbers drive the business forward. Unfortunately, that was all the company, and store manager cared about. There is absolutely no track for development, all managers are external hires. This job is for someone who wants to be a robot, stand there and recite the same line to customer after customer, all while being micromanaged."
bad,"I was a contractor brought in to help with a very specific set of technical assistance to their vendors.  I only left because the manager I worked for was a horror show.  She was either incredibly capricious or bipolar.  It created a horrible work environment, and within a month of being there learned that I was the fourth person in a year to have the position, with all the other candidates either quitting because of her treatment of requesting to be moved out from under her management.  One of the contractors I worked with (we were segregated from the rest of the team) had my position before I did and was the one who requested to be moved.  My boss regularly derided him to his new boss and anyone around her, including me.  He was a hard worker, did everything to the best of his ability given the VERY limited training we were given, and she trashed him for any small error or initiative he took to resolve and issue.  This was NOT the norm in the rest of the organization (from what little I saw), but other managers were very aware of her behavior and nothing was done to curb it."
bad,"You have to get along with the managers if you want hours. There’s a lot of favoritism in Staples and managers are rude, they hate talking to customers about any problems."
bad,The company is ok if you need to learn.  It however can be very wearing.  The company changes weekly and sometimes hourly.  The hoops you have to go through can be painful.
bad,"Staples does not value employees. They would pay you less if they could find people to take it, even Walmart pays more and expects you to know less."
bad,"The managers make it hard on employees to take the time they need off. Considering most employees are part time and no overtime is allowed now, it was difficult to see how cut throat the environment was on the employees who had other life matters occurring. Luckily for me, I was there long enough to be able to balance my work life with everything else, but the pressure was on as I was reminded on a daily basis I was lucky to still have the job and shouldn’t ask for time off when everyone else was too. Because of this stressor, it was an easy decision to do what wa sbest for my overall career and leave that harsh environment."
bad,I've loved working for this company. Good working environment and a good learning experience. I've learned a lot and have enjoyed training and working with new associates and watching them grow.
bad,Staples is a great place to work for college students looking for a flexible schedule and a non-demanding work environment. The tech department has more goals and responisbility than the office supplies department. The goals are sometimes unrealistic depenting on store traffic and location.
bad,"The customers fear the store and that says it all. I gave my carry agitation about my job. The stress came from managers who couldn’t schedule hours right, hire enough employees, or take responsibility at any point or cost. It was exhausting and I am a excellent employee. I am extremely dedicated and was disappointed so one day the regular toxic behavior was coming towards me and  I told them to find someone else to close tonight. ALL 3 store managers were there and none of them said anything for 4 hours."
bad,I would sit at the register all day and greet customers. When it was slow I would help stock shelves and the candy in the front. I would also answer customer service calls.
bad,Multi billion dollar company ran with no thought of the future or its employees that make it all happen. Under appreciated for the larger role that you take on to make things work.
bad,Management is not experienced in what the employees do so they cannot resonate with them. The warehouse gets extra hot in the summer and extra cold in the winter.
bad,"Had a great supervisor the first year. A real leader. Once she changed shifts it was down hill from there. The management now is incompetent. Trying to make tweaks to help our production that only make things worse. They keep people who are worthless and that in turn makes us lose the hard workers because they have to pick up the slack. What the employees think doesn't matter(even if they ask us), you are made to do things you don't feel safe doing and if you work really hard and have the best production numbers you are rewarded with tic-tacs. . ."
bad,"Staples would rather have quantity over quality.  Have gone downhill in the past few years, "
bad,"not a fair place to work in terms of career advancement, but they will work around your school schedule. Management depended on the manager that would be on shift for the day; 2 out of 3 were great but the bad definitely outweighed the good in this instance.But, the employees were definitely like a family"
bad,"Since being bought by Sycamore, management is afraid to make decisions!! they have now announced that there will be NO raises given for the year and that more layoffs are imminent! Again, this makes for a very stressful situation everyday."
bad,Brown nosing seems to be the only way for advancement.  New technology exposure is based on your luck to get selected to the right project.  Silos limit your marketability by limiting your experience working in other areas related to your position.
bad,Nothing to comment on. Would not join the company at this time. To many of internal issues since going private. Management is constantly looking for the next big thing.
bad,"Staples had its days of slow pace/fast pace, but the management was terrible, since the day I was terminated unfairly, I never once came back to work for this Staples company."
bad,"After being acquired by Investment firm and being taken private, they have a lot of re-structuring to finish and figure out.  There are good people there, they are just going through a major change which leads to a lot of mid-level people having no idea what is going on."
bad,Really bad place to work. In about 15 months there were maybe 40% of the same people working there when I started. Company rules were changed to get rid of me who worked hard for them and got good reviews. Not recommended at all.
bad,"The company is great, no complaints. Unfortunately it really depends on who you have as a manager. Some can be unreasonably harsh and borderline rude. Understand that if you are doing this you have to sell "
bad,"Staples has new owners and these scumbags in the grass laid off an entire team selling premium memberships to businesses.  These teams were brand new and didn’t even get a year to prove themselves.  These snakes in the grass didn’t lateral transfer the laid off workers, you had to reapply!  They said they didn’t have enough positions which was A lie. They hired new workers.  This investment firm fired the CEO too.  So beware!  If you’re not a kiss butt,  i wouldn’t apply here!  My manager couldn’t manage her way out of a paper bag!"
bad,i loved working as a tech there but the job is overwhelming it is not worth 8 bucks hrl plus environment  is down the drain lack of knowledge and customer service training
bad,odd hours and management was poor hardest part of the job was the lack of formal training and being expected to know everything .hardest part was working on your own and expected to do the job of 4 other people
bad,Was hired to open new copy shop. Very slow the year I was there. Learn a lot about digital copiers and the retail office product world. Wasn't easy not knowing your next week schedule until 4 days until it started.
bad,The pay is too low for the work that is expected.  The benefits are not affordable since the pay is too low.  Need a second job to provide for a family.
bad,"The job is basically stock shelves, occasionally get screamed at over issues that have nothing to do with you, and get yelled at by management because someone on the other side of the building bought a printer without ink and now its on you. You basically run around trying to reach sales goals set by upper management in the company as they make outrageously bad business decisions."
bad,"I read up on the job prior to accepting the offer... I am glad I went for it even with the things said about the position.... But for all the stress and extra amounts of work forced on me, it became worth less and less. My checks began to feel like nothing and I was truly starting to be left with nothing. This position is very very overwhelming when management doesn't do its part"
bad,It was amazing at first till they fire me because my register was short 80 dollars . People have told me it was because they were trying to find a way to fire people since other staples were closing down .
bad,Unfortunatley the job was not what I expected in terms of pay and promotions.  The management struggeled to keep the rules and regulations enforced.  Fellow employees were great to work.  The store had difficulties reaching company goals and therefore was always at risk for closing.
bad,"I would not recommend working here managers are allowed to do as they please which is usually against company policy, you are poorly trained and expected to know all about the procedures of the company and it is very stressful because customers bark at you for the managers mistakes. The electronic systems that they want you to use to make the money (cash register, etc) are slow and out of date and an inconvenience to customers."
bad,As a copy and print associate I was given little to no training then expected to run the department by myself (which explains why the department has such high turn over). I was passed up for promotions because I was told I was too young. I ended up being the go to person to call in whenever they needed help on the sales floor or in the print department and when my yearly review came around I was given a $0.10 raise and was told it didn't reflect how much I was valued.
bad,Learned alot about technology and devices. The most enjoyable pat of the job is educating a customer about a poduct you normally use on a daily basis.
bad,Over all I like being here. Many upper management changes  and uncertainty in direction of company was the cause of stress. The team was a lot of fun!
bad,I didn't enjoy working here as the management was so awful. One manager loved to start arguments with the customers and swear at you (the employee). Whereas the other one enjoyed sleeping with one of the underage staff.
bad,"The company is closing stores.  I was hired to manager the  Winston Salem store.  I moved to that area for that purpose only to find out they had not renewed the lease, the company had been bought out and they are closing a lot of stores."
bad,"Worked in electronics department."
bad,"There is literally no department that I could recommend to another person and still be able to sleep at night. EasyTech and cashiers are taught to trick or force customers into purchasing protection and additional items when they clearly don't want it (i.e. ""no doesn't realllllyyyy mean no""/""there's no such thing as no""). Office Supplies employees are overworked and given tasks with impossible time frames. Copy Center Associates are verbally abused and are stressed to the point that work actually suffers and employee morale = 0. Hours are inconsistent, ranging from not enough to survive to working four to six hours past a scheduled eight-hour shift due to insufficient staffing."
bad,"Regular retail job."
bad,"I was a Copy & Print Centre Lead and I enjoyed how every day was a little different. I loved the job itself. "
bad,The pay and hours you get from staples is not enough to live a normal life. Advancement to full time or higher position is nearly impossible which you have to wait till someone retires or quit staples.
bad,A typical day is very stressful as people do not work efficiently and no reprimand for actions.  Seems like upper management does not care about their employees concerns.  System has many issues and do not get fixed.
bad,"I appreciate the experience. I happen to have wonderful supervisors whom were easy to work for and allowed you to balance your work and family life with minimal stress."
bad,"They kept you busy doing a variety of tasks, even ones not concerning your qualifications.  The advancement opportunity were for the ones that the managers liked the best, not based on performance."
bad,Work hours for part time employees tend to be inconstant and fluctuate without any rhyme or reason. This makes it a challenge for the employee to plan their personal finances.
bad,"i worked in the staples copy center on herald square before it closed down. while there i enjoyed my job. simple, easy and i was quite good at it. my coworkers were helpful when it mattered most."
bad,"Staples work life was good the day i joined, but i started noticing differences. The management doesn't care about you. They care about how long they can sit in the back and do nothing and when you ask for them they will yell at you. They play favorites and will tell you that you don't work as much as the other person when you are sweating and know you worked your butt off. The co-workers are good they are friendly and help out whenever they can. The hardest part of the job is honestly management. They bicker and yell for you to do something when they have already given you 10 things to do and you are almost done with the first item when they say why isn't this done yet. The most enjoyable part of the job is when your are joking with your co-workers"
bad,"In the beginning I enjoyed my job at Staples, but now I dread every day I go in. We are incredibly understaffed which makes it so stressful with all the responsibilities I have to do in a shift. Often times I don't have adequate time to get things done while having to make sure I help customers. There is too high expectations to get rewards and square trade signups each day. When I close, I never know when I will get to leave which stresses me out."
bad,"While I do admit there were opportunities for growth and maturity, I found the sales culture to not be my style. For the most part, the performance standards are a little unreasonable for the sales associates given the pay and training they are provided. "
bad,"Its been some time since I moved out of Staples.  Therefore, this review might not be relevant.  The environment was very hectic and stressful."
bad,"I worked for Staples for 2 years. Was told I was getting a promotion about 6 months in...took another year to get it. Management makes empty promises just to keep you around and you do not get paid nearly enough for the work you do. DO NOT TAKE THE INVENTORY SPECIALIST JOB. This job is both physically and mentally demanding and you are completely on your own. It does not make enough for the toll it takes on you. Also, if you are a woman, the men will get paid more than you. This company is terrible and treats their employees like scum. They will use you and lie to you. Overall, just don't work here."
bad,"The company as a whole does not support the store staff, your home life matters very little, if you have kids trying to get time off is like pulling teeth. I did enjoy the people i worked side by side with, great group."
bad,"Really dead store, not much action. Not enough hours or hourly pay.Staff kind of makes fun of you. Will throw you on register by yourself the first or second day."
bad,"The copy center at staple is a very fast pace environment.  It can be stressful dealing with the public, but if you treat customers with respect you usually receive respect in return.  I enjoy designing and working on the computer.  The most difficult part of this job is explaining to a customer that their job my take longer than they expect it to, because of work load, or their job inparticular."
bad,"Having worked for Staples for 7 and a half years, and having been a team leader for more than half that time, I can safely say that Staples is not an employer I would recommend to anyone. Whilst the job has its good points, over the time that I worked there continued cuts to staff budgets have seen the workforce shrink and the workloads increase. Pay rises are nigh non-existent, and recently the company took the short-sighted decision to make two thirds of store managers redundant, requiring the remaining managers to look after three stores each on a rotating basis."
bad,hours are flexible and that's a great benefit.I appreciate being able to go to an appointment and then being able to run an errand or work from home.
bad,"Staples is a good place to work, and a great place to get started.   there is a lot of work, and your job is almost always secure.  but the pay is on the lower end, positions pay below industry averages."
bad,I had a hard time to move up and not a fun place to work. Management needed improvement but the business eventually closed.
bad,"They train you in most departments of the store, but you are mostly behind a cash register and not allowed to leave the front. If you are lucky and apply for the copy center you will get to do some projects and hands on work, depending on who you are it might be enjoyable, I enjoyed it."
bad,"First two years were great, have had two new managers since of which the first one didn't know what he was doing, and the second one has no people skills. As a company, it's priorities are in the wrong place and it is a very demoralising place to work. This is not just my opinion; also the people I work with and people in other stores."
bad,"It is retail, what do you want? The hardest part of this job is having to apologize at least 100 times per day for something that is entirely NOT your fault. For example, the computers are VERY outdated and crash or freeze quite often. In an environment that pushes associates to fast and courteous, you can see how this would pose a BIG problem. The associate is beyond aggravated with the computers thereby coming across as not only slow, because the register froze, but also rude."
bad,"I worked in copy center, frequently with no back up so my days consisted of being entirely responsibly for the whole department, which when it gets busy is simply not possible at my store. However managers never respond to my radios for help with either a belligerent customer or even a manager override."
bad,"A typical day is coming in and expecting nothing to be done that you left for your night crew. "
bad,"Your average manager will generally be good but will depend upon which location you work at. The best part of working for this company is that its very flexible with your personal life and if you are using it as your second job to another Full/Part time job. The bad parts of working for this company would most definitely be the lack of benefits, the lack of actual hours given to all stores, and the large amount of time it takes to advance through the company."
bad,"typical day: busy mindless work "
bad,"So Staples is a great place to work,  the people are friendly and the work/life balance is very good,   I have never had a problem flexing hours or working from home when their is a storm or my daughter had a doctors appointment.   The people, for the most part, are happy to help out and are very friendly.   "
bad,"You must not be afraid to ask customers about add-on, Square Trade, eRecipts, Rewards Cards.  You have t show results.  Worst thing is that corporate keeps cutting back hours even though the number one complaint is that there isn't enough associates on the floor.  Customers tend to be needier than any other retail environment I've worked at."
bad,"typical day at work consist of taking incoming calls, escalations, no help or management ever available. Basically doing management work while management laugh and talk about employees"
bad,"As an employee for 7 years, I was promoted regularly and received regular raises. However, a ""regular yearly raise"" would typically be anywhere from $0.10-0.25 per hour. Not worth the stress of the job itself because if you are a performance driven person like me, you will be very disappointed with the staff that you are typically surrounded by that typically don't care about their job and are only there to collect a paycheck."
bad,"My work schedule is the only redeeming quality of this job. I am m-f, 8-4 which is nice but most everything else sucks. "
bad,Fun environment always something new to learn and do. Management changes to much in a couple months span. No real benefits is welcomed/
bad,company is to big to be efficient and is expanding into an area (print) in which they have no expertise
bad,"30% of work day necessitated follow up, redo, rework of activities expected the previous day."
bad,"I've been with Staples since 2004.  I have been in many different depts and steadily moved through the call center.  When I went through training it was good and then you learned your job on the floor.  Anyone was willing to help you and you could succeed.  However with every company that grows unchecked the situation for the employees always deteriorates.  To be fair the recession did not help things but I think some of these things were in the works before.  Workloads have increased and pay has stagnated.  3% raises (if you are lucky) do nothing to help you survive.  The lower management is not really the problem.  The problem are the executive level management who are so removed from the rest of us.  They went and changed our decent benefits to high deductible health plans.  How is a $3,000 deductible for a family plan afordable.  We get bonuses.  They will close the center and force you to use your vaction time or not get paid for the day.  Their HR is a mess.  If you need a job you will get experience.  However do not make this your long term career.  Do not expect to have a chance at management as they do not hire from withinn.  Do not expect to get proper or additional training.  Us them for the experience and then get out.  I kinda got stuck and now I can't leave.  Don't let them steal your soul as well."
bad,"When I first started working for Staples, I was a front end associate. Without my knowledge, I was then directed into being a copy and print pro. I am sure this isn't the most stressful job out there but if you want a stress free work environment, this truly isn't for you."
bad,Fast paced environment. Expect a lot of work and not enough support..Low pay...
bad,"Management cares about sales numbers. My experience was that if you do not reach those numbers they aren't interested in you and will slowly drive you out by decreasing your hours."
bad,Answer inquiries and place orders for American customers over the phone.  Use computer effectively.  I learnt their phone and computer systems.  Management listened to calls to make sure guidelines were followed.  Co-workers were generally helpful and friendly.  The hardest part of the job was a dry mouth from talking all day.  The most enjoyable part was that I was very good at it.
bad,"As Business Consultant on Duty, I had the opportunity to sell printing and marketing materials to customers throughout the store.  Personally, my store knowledge allowed me to also assist customers with technology and office equipment needs as well.  I regularly would oversee and take care of product placing and display set up."
bad,The coworkers are good to work with. Ive learned alot when it comes to warehouse and maintenance skills. The management is ok.
bad,"On an ordinary day in the office, I interact with sales representatives, customers, and co-workers located in the Production area."
bad,"Some of the managers treat you like nothing, even the leads too, some of them are very disrespectful and no one does anything about it because they have seniority. If you are part time you only get hours if other department have the hours to give or if there are full time opened positions and you still may not get the position. Put it this way....it's not what you know it's who you know."
bad,"Great environment with the other store associates, but the management really cares about themselves."
bad,"Company is doing good compared to other major compeition.  Lots of new lines of business.  However, office supplies are dying.  Since everyone carries these items now it has been very competitive."
bad,the co workers were an excellent part of the job however the job in itself was horrible constructed by poor management
bad,"Only during certain seasons was it busy, so hours was limited."
bad,"I was a red-shirt back from 2001 to 2003. I really wanted to be a Web Developer at Corporate in Framingham, but after more than a year and a half there, when I had the opportunity to go to Corporate from the Natick store, the General Manager at the time (who thinks the TV show Jack A_s is a good show.), wouldn't let me go because he said my customer service skills were too good. : ( "
bad,"as the Service Delivery Administrator for the drivers, this was a miserably boring job. "
bad,"A typical day at work is very stressful. Managers tell you you did a good job regularly but eventually it gets very exhausting to have to juggle so many things. The company is going through some changes right now which left a bunch of our valued associates in limbo, which I see as a desperate measure to save the company. They changed our 401K benefits from a month to month to a year to year so if you don't work with the company for a full year, they will not match any money you put into your 401K. Co-workers are very over worked but most of the time can look past all the work to have a good time and engage customers in a positive manner. Hardest part of the job is always being told you have to be happy. All jobs have become very exhausting and it is seen on everyone's face."
bad,"the title says it all. I will edit the comments to be more specific without panning the issue completely after I hear back from somebody I have left a message for. We had plenty of notice that the end was coming, but only two days with the specific date of termination."
bad,"What started out as a fun, challenging, and rewarding position as a Easy Tech at Staples quickly became a position where everyday you are evaluated not on your customer satisfaction or how much you got done, but how many warranties you sold, and how much tech dollars you managed to bring in. Profit margins and revenues are fine, but when you are brought in told that sales will determine extra hours and later on threatened with violations for not selling enough warranties in a month quickly detracts from the experience. Its disheartening to be told that you aren't living up to ""company standards"" because you can't convince enough people to pay for warranties, and not on the fact of turning a customers day enjoyable and receiving praise for how helpful and attentive you were with them."
bad,"Worked as delivery driver, mgmt focused was on just meeting numbers, whether it was done efficiently or not, just meet the numbers and they where happy."
bad,"Everyday I was constantly reminded about we did not meet our ""numbers"". As an Easy-Tech associate I fixed computers and loved it. I did not however like lying to customers about computer problems and explaining the bogus warranties that management wanted us to sell to the customers. If not for a few co-workers I enjoyed working with I would have left much sooner than 2 years. Management was pushy and conniving, always threatening to cut hours and fire us if we did not meet our extremely high goals. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the management about selling warranties. The most enjoyable part of the job was the actual work, I really enjoyed fixing computers."
bad,"My days range from 8 pm to 3am or 10am to 5pm. I enjoy throwing load very much, the activity and physical demand. Register and sales is not my first choice but I am well at it. The management is good and still learning and molding a team. I have not found a part of the job that is hard. I enjoy the pay check."
bad,"a typical day involves consulting and going through the process of producing what the customer (s) need. most days, I learn a new trick to doing something more efficiently, and faster and in the manner the customers need them."
bad,"At the time I worked for Staples, I was working my way through college. I started out right away with a specialist position, but they would hire management that had no knowledge of what Staples had to offer or even retail experience."
bad,"I think its a good place to work for the right person. If you don't care what hours you work, then it's perfect for you. Pay and benefits are decent."
bad,"With other big name electronics sales places, Staples only real time to shine is during back to school season. Or when someone needs an occasional ream of paper or a box of paper clips. So on a daily basis, it was slow and boring and micro management came into play. Then instead of promotions, demotions started taking place. If you need cash, sure. Otherwise, nah."
bad,typical day at work would be customer service all day long. The hardest part of my job would be the truck!
bad,"If you want to be a manger in retail, look elsewhere because there is no support for mangers."
bad,"It's better than being a red shirt on the floor. Print and marketing gives you license to mess about with programs on their computers and print yourself a bunch of stuff, so that's pretty cool. Downside - boomer customers who can't understand technology. A self-service center with cheaper prices because it's self serve, which you will have to make full service for almost every customer. They just can't figure out how to print their own stuff and you can't not help them."
bad,"Some of the staff was really good and would bring in food and baked products to share with employees."
bad,"Some of the people that work there are absolutely amazing, and some make it very difficult. It is a retail job and the culture of the work environment is generally that people do not want to be there when they are at work. When this is shown at the management level as well, it makes it hard to stay focused or driven especially when the management do not know how to communicate properly with their team."
bad,"This is just a retail job, do not quit your life for this place and keep an eye out for an actual career opportunity. This company will not be around much longer."
bad,"My store manager is great, my direct sup is great, my coworkers are great, but corporate pushes us way too hard for the wages we're given. I work in the print and marketing dept, and the new district manager has never even worked at Staples before and he wants to make all kinds of changes because he thinks he knows what's best. He's driving all of our best employees out because he wants to boost profits to line his own pockets with his bonus, while pretending it'll have a positive effect on us because we get a bonus too! But despite hauling ***, my ""bonus"" last quarter was about $8 because of the way it's calculated. It's just not worth it. Customers are rude and entitled 90% of the time and are often verbally abusive. There's no room for growth, we're chronically understaffed-- if one person calls out, we're thrown off for the whole day and usually the next day too with trying to catch up."
bad,"I must say I have learned a lot through working for Staples, but most of that has come with adjusting to constantly changing management, juggling very needy and impatient customers, and having to run throughout the store assisting colleagues not only in my department, but across the store. The staff does help each other whenever possible, and many customers are polite and reasonable, but many will get very upset about variables that are out of your control."
bad,"My time at Staples was spent staring at the walls mostly. The brand is going down the toilet and no one is coming into the stores. The only time of year we had more than three people in our warehouse sized store at a time was when University students were handing in their thesis and needed somewhere to print and bind it. Other than that unless you were on the DHL delivery counter, you had nothing to do most days."
bad,The company lacked structure. I learned to be independent and work in a fast-paced environment. Management was lacking. Workplace culture is non-existent. The hardest part of the job was trying to go to work.
bad,"My experience with Staples was, for the most part, tolerable. My job was largely customer-centric and goals oriented. The company set very lofty sales quotas and metrics that were mostly unattainable in the low traffic location that my store was in. This made pressure from upper management on my store very frustrating. The other associates and lower managers were all great to me, but the general manager was horrible. The general manager constantly encouraged immoral behavior from his assistant managers and associates in an attempt to hit sales quotas. Overall, the job is not worth the high strung environment because of the low wages, specifically in my store."
bad,Manager was burned out so he was lazy. Another key holder was lazy. Assistant worked hard. Working with the lazy mgmt made for very stressful day. If you worked with the lazy managers it just made being understaffed because of corporate not allocating enough hours.
bad,I can't recomend this company but maybe things have changed.  Online retailing was taking a bite out of our sales and the executives jumped from one get rich scheme to the next within months of something not working.  They sell great technology but don't use any.  We had to re-boot the registers almost daily and hed the worst network in any place i have worked.  About 1/2 the staff enjoyed their job and it showed.  We couldn't attract talent with the low pay so we spent most of our time training people for their next job with higher pay.
bad,"Easytech Expert, a typical day at work consisted of completing work orders for technical repairs on customer computers, assisting customers with making purchase decisions on computers and electronics, restocking products. Managers were always on employees' backs about sales, regional managers would occasionally appear to tell us literally verbatim that we would ""be standing in the unemployment line"" if something went wrong. Abusive, stressful, a dollar an hour."
bad,"I love the people which who I worked. But the balance salary/effort was bad. It was really a rough experience, but I will always remember the friends I met."
bad,It was a fun place to work but the management was terrible. Neither the store nor the sales manager would immediately help the cashier when asked even if their was a long line behind both registers. The sales manager was terribly racist and would make inappropriate remarks about customers over our walkies. On top of that he was disrespectful to employees by not giving them the courtesy to even learn their names except for the select few FEMALE employees which were much younger than him and would flirt with them. I'm sure not all staples are like this but the one I worked at was just horrible.
bad,"If you're a people person, and into sales, then working at Staples is genuinely a good place to work. I'm naturally introverted, so it does cause struggle for me. The management above the General Manager of the store have a tendency to micromanage and make tasks a little more difficult than they should be. The job, itself, is actually pretty good. It's the ""extras"" surrounding it, that kind of weigh you down, to be perfectly honest."
bad,"Overall, Staples isn't a horrible place to work, it may just be the store. Corporate really does seem to care and make decent decisions since it's a small enough company, but I am not satisfied at my location. "
bad,"Staples used their employees more like equipment. Assign everyone a number and them do everything and anything to increase revenue and gains. The final blow from Staples came while employed at Alpha, making deliveries for Staples when they terminated our contract and gave their freight to another carrier. They were the cause for our department laying off 14 people."
bad,"I work on the retail part witch is struggling.  It was a good job but now they are slowly running the full time people out. Staples is replacing with a temporary company, so they don't have to pay benefits."
bad,Staples was merely a part-time opportunity for me as it is for everyone who works there. There is minimal opportunity for advancement within the company
bad,I would work sometimes 12 hour days while going to school and still have to open the next day. Sometimes other employees would call out and I would have to stay and pick up there hours too.
bad,"Constrictive,employees are anonymous,all employees are rated on statistics only,speed of answering calls rather than quality interchanges between customer and customer service personnel"
bad,"company is close down"
bad,Was told that I would work 7am -3:30 pm. I’ve never clocked out no earlier than 4:30pm and I start every day at 6-6:30am. Was told that going out of town for a day or two was “occasionally”. Truth is it’s a very frequent thing. Multiple out of town trips a month. Even have had multiple in a week. Hard to juggle everyday life and make plans when management throws extra hours at you last minute and even tells you 1 day ahead that you have to work on the weekends.
bad,"Just had poor work experience and with management in the Nebraska store but the North Carolina store is better. not judging, if you want to work here then be my guest. Manager picked favorites and when i transferred i was suppose to get a 75 cent raise"
bad,Staples has grown very fast in a short time. They have been focusing on change without looking at the impacts. We need to look at driving change with suggestions from the front line employees as they are the ones doing the work. We may retain more people if they were listened to.
bad,"Great people to work with. Very knowledgeable and friendly. The associates are always happy to give good information, and answer any questions the customers have."
bad,They don't have a bigger picture view of the company. They are very much based on the bottom line and how much they can save. They don't supply enough staff or cut certain helpful programs to save money in the long run.
bad,Job position constantly threatened due to unsustainable sales metrics. Forced us to sell protection plans to customers that did not want them. My manager was great but it was obvious the world was placed on his shoulders by Staples Execs. I hope they have let up on the stress levels they place upon their hourly wage employees
bad,"Very busy"
bad,I worked for staples for almost 3 years and the job in itself is easy and great. They work with you especially since I'm in school but wouldn't let me move up to management no matter how hard i worked cause of me being in school. They hired a lot of young people like 19-22 and the environment became high school like. They formed their own cliché and spread a lot of rumors and drama. By the time I left I wasn't upset at all more relieved.
bad,Company doesn't give you the tools to succeed. Even if your more than qualified for a position managers will stand in your way instead of helping you move up.
bad,"Advantages:"
bad,"While I originally got this job through a friend, I initially liked management, especially during the interview. Once I started training and then eventually transitioned to making sales on my own, that's when the manager started getting really personal and insisting that I only got my job because I was a woman and that I should smile more and that would make the old men want to buy more things."
bad,Staples is an ok place to work for if you have no desire for career advancement.  The changing culture has given way to instability and stressful work environments.
bad,"only worked 1-2 times per week, the manager couldn't make equal hours for each employee, didn't make an official schedule for me i had to keep calling the store every week"
bad,"Mostly laid back culture - very cheap when it comes to compensations and employee benefits - no holiday parties or any other morale-boosting activities to give an example.  They have been laying off left and right, so I wouldn't recommend it.  Uninspiring upper management to say the least."
bad,"this was not the best place to work "
bad,company was just bought out by Sycamore partners and they cut the printing sales department by over 70%.  no one understand why you were let go or why they kept you.
bad,They wanted you to up-sell every customer that walked in the door. i worked in computer tech department and had other co-workers that didn't even have a tech background. its ridiculous they put people in departments that don't have the fundamentals because its all about selling a service. the easy tech service was horrible and half the work like virus removal was done remotely online by a partnered company. there is a lot of internal bull with this company
bad,"I learned that it is very difficult to move up the ladder because head office hires the managers and they look for manager experiences from other retails rather than promoting someone within. "
bad,"Staples doesn't train you, doesn't answer your questions and doesn't listen to you, they just ask you to do a job and don't actually care how well or how poorly you do it. Management only cares about pleasing those above them and beyond visits that occur once every couple of months the stores run in 3 different directions."
bad,A company with a poor corporate culture poor compensation and no innovation. This company will be bankrupt soon they invest nothing in employee growth have no plan for the future and do not value intelligence and innovation. If you like no future this is the job for you
bad,In the last ten years staples has gone down hill with Customer service and product knowledge. The employees are not trained like they where ten years ago and pay has gone down too.
bad,"I enjoyed the freedom the company gave me in developing my team. Unfortunately they do not reward achievements no matter how much improvement you make. "
bad,"I didn't spend too long here, but I'm glad I didn't. It did not seem like a very fun place to work. Everyone typically showed up, did their hours, and left. Not much culture or community to be had."
bad,"Hands down the worst benefits of any company that I have ever worked for. Especially if you're married with children.If your spouse is offered insurance at his or her job and they decline it you are charged a monthly fee. Then the deductible is through the roof and they pay $0 until you reach it. After you reach it they pay 80%. "
bad,"A typical work day is between 8-9 hrs. Doing the summer its very hot, and there is a bad mosquito problem. Staples Memphis FC is poorly ran, the spider webs decorate the walls. When it rains, it also rains in the building, some parts of the building looks like a pond.  The management team does not give Supervisor any direction, there is also not structure. You will hear the FC manager say he is here to set you up for success, he does not have a plan, the employees does not respect him at all and they ran the building. Majority, of the staff is from the FC Manager home town Itta Bena Miss. Staples does have good benefits and that is all"
bad,"I enjoyed most of the time I was there as a Cashier. Then different management came and it wasn't that great after a Amazing manager passed away. The 'section"" managers had problems trying to manage, and I became unhappy very quickly."
bad,A varyed day with various targets and challenges. The targets of selling allow you to develop you and your colleagues skills. The trainingwas left to yourself to work out which was difficult but in the end a fulfilling task-as you learnt all aspects.
bad,"Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut... but get more done ?? Managers have skeleton crews and stores cannot operate the way they are designed.  Very stressful for everyone."
bad,"Bought out and before that happened, they were looking to cut people loose. My guess is they will close 100+ stores in the coming year because of the  Private Equity Firm that bought them. Upper Management will ge rich, associate will loose their jobs ."
bad,"Staples was a job I picked up in Summer of 2016 for some summer employment and maintained through my Fall semester and partway into the following Spring. Originally, the job was solid. Expectations were understood and, while training was very minimal, I managed to get a grasp of what I was expected to do."
bad,Working at staples has its ups and downs. Management is all over the place and not staffed correctly. When they closed a numerous stores a lot change in the environment affecting many of the surrounding stores. They need to work on staffing and keeping management from flying all over the store.
bad,Forced sales culture at cost of integrity. Constantly reminded of sales goal shortcomings and forced to offer inferior products such as liquid armour. Culture varies greatly from store to store.
bad,"Assisting Staples corporate customers, sales reps, distribution warehouses, vendors to coordinate furniture deliveries and assemblies. Loved the co-workers, but not enough money."
bad,"This Company is losing money all over the place.  They don't understand why, but won't ask the employees.  If you do say something, then they don't listen."
bad,"*Managers and Supervisors have no regard for my schedule needs or preferences"
bad,"Staples is a retail store.  It can never be anything more than a retail store, and yet it freqently tries to be your friend, or your mentor.  They don't give sufficient hours, their wage is weak in this economy, employees get treated poorly by both management and customers, leading to a hostil work environment."
bad,A decent easy part time job to get you through to a better job. The low pay really makes this job frustrating for all you have to do. The workload can be easy or impossible with almost no incentive to complete the job.
bad,I enjoyed working with the other local staff and interacting with my client base of 750 accounts in Southern Alberta. It is had to have a positive review when you have been recently restructured after 7 years.
bad,It was a great first job out of college and I enjoyed the change of pace environment from what I am used to. There is a great company culture with a lot of training and getting better within the role of sales.
bad,"Pros: "
bad,"opening and closing the store, daily briefs, often under staffed, maintaining a positive approach to deliver results through my team. Target focused to drive sales on all KPI's. I enjoyed coaching my team to maximise performance."
bad,"Typical day at work consists of assisting customers both in-store and on the phones. With this position, I have learned to diffuse situations and empathize with customers to ensure that they have a positive experience. The management at Staples is somewhat hit-and-miss. The turnover rate is pretty incredible here. In the time I have worked with Staples, there has been a total of four different managers. The same thing goes for coworkers."
bad,"good place to start, bad place to end.  Gain the experience and apply it to a better company.  teaches skills in time management, crm and sales structure"
bad,My typical day at work being a technical sales associate/technician was the same every day and very repetitive. I would walk in and be told to stock some shelves and do inventory pull list. only 10% of the time i would be engaging with customers about tech items in the store . Management is terrible they won't even change the label on a computer that's not even in the system and on top of that the computer is being displayed and shown to customers when they can't buy it.
bad,"I interviewed and was hired for Inventory Specialist but ended up being ""sold"" and convinced on doing the Copy & Print area for a while to learn how things worked in that area and then after a couple weeks would start training for Inventory and move into the actual position I was hired for. This never happened--The store manager makes for a great salesman with convincing lies and empty promises. My position listed on the employee self service website magically changed from ""Inventory Specialist"" to ""Copy & Print Associate"" after just a few days."
bad,This was only a maternity cover role that unfortunately was put on notice of redundancy one week after starting so it is difficult to really be able to comment
bad,"A typical day at work is normal. I have great co workers and managers. I Just really wish I could receive more from staples. When it comes down to my pay and benefits, I'm not satisfied at all. Our benefits are limited to the amount of hours I work per week. I am not permitted to work according to the corporations weekly hour limit, which is 25 hours per week per associate. My weekly pay is not enough for me and my family to survive on."
bad,"Working at staples is an ok job if you are a student or retired and looking for some extra income. However, if you have ever had a professional career or made use of your skills, you will find this job a joke. The computer training is some of the most uninteresting and incomprehensive of any job I've ever had. Most training I've had takes a couple of days to a few weeks. This took me 6 months. The management does not value your skills or what you know. They don't care how you do the job, they just want it done. If you get a job an an EasyTech associate, they will have you doing everything. They will push you to make sales to the point that it's sheer madness. If you think you'll get any kind of experience, or time working on computers, think again. You will get very little of it as they automate the process. If you do have an opportunity to work on someone's computer, they will pull you off the job to go help another customer that didn't need help in the first place. This would be understandable if it happened once it a while. However, it gets old when it happens every minute. Therefore, customers are unhappy because the work on their PC's takes longer than the 3 day turn around time you're supposed to give them. You'll have to bear the brunt of the customer's anger. At times, some client's PCs were there for over a week. If a customer comes in with a rework, it's supposed to be NGD (next day guarantee). However, the managers will pull you off the job to make sales. The customer will return the next day and again you'll have to bear their fury for not getting the work done."
bad,"If you ever worked at convergys, or liked working at converygys. Then Staples would be great for you. They were a good company to work for, all about the customers. Then when a New Manager gtook over, it all became about the bottom line, and forget the customers, and the staff. They are disposable."
bad,Une organisation ultra centralisée qui freine et frustre le collaborateur. Des équipes compétentes mais restreintes dans un rôle purement opérationnel.
bad,"I loved my job at Staples but my Store Manager was very rude to me and very disrespectful to our customers. I was a cashier and also worked in Copy Center( hardest part of my job). I always completed my tasks and my online training assignments. My customers loved me! I always had a positive attitude and a smile on my face."
bad,"This company continues to get worse each year.  If you want to do everybody else's job while the store is completely understaffed and the managers are sitting around, this is the job for you."
bad,"The company would be a good place to work if they paid employees a livable wage and did not try to manipulate employees by insulting their intelligence.The store I worked at had decent management so it was tolerable. A typical day included running around like a chicken with its head cut off trying to serve customers. Be warned there is no clearly defined position at this company. Even the Managers' stock shelves. You will be hired as an Easy Tech but you will end up doing anything and everything. Your feet will hurt a lot from standing all day you will miss breaks and management will pretend they did not notice it. It is best to use this company the same way they use you... for money. This is a good job for people who have no choice, need temporary work or a student. It is not a career by any means."
bad,"Our store was great when I started. Was promoted due to hard work and was overall a good experience. Our store then was knocked down a tier due to missing budget by a small margin. This eliminated several jobs and left us with a skeleton crew. Managers promptly left the company and our store turned into a nightmare. Not enough hours for associates to do their jobs, stressful, nothing organized. Terrible situation to ever be in. Staples is a declining company and should be closing many stores soon."
bad,"The company has forgotten that is the employees who made them successful and are more concerned with profit. They say they care about the people and have several so called associate programs but there is nothing behind them, it is purely to make the associate think the company cares."
bad,Its a starter job that's it don't come in expecting to make bank. Not a very hard place to work but they do expect you to do more than what you're paid to do
bad,"I was a Supervisor for almost a year.  I liked the hours and days that I was scheduled.  The management is not supportive of the supervisors, even though you're still a manager it doesn't feel like it.  There's a lot of micro managing and my manager told me that I needed  to figure the job out for myself not to ask her how to do something ( there are video's but not a lot of one on one).  They don't like it if you ask a lot of questions and not a lot of patience.  I really didn't have a good experience there.  I was a store manager for almost 10 years so I know how to properly train staff, be compassionate and have respect to others especially when they're new.  I wouldn't go back."
bad,"I worked at staples for little over a year in order to get some actual experience I could put on my resume. I was a trained technician with multiple certifications, but I was paid a little over $9 an hour and I live in NYC. Also management was pushed by their superiors to ""create"" pc problems at intake, and asked me to exaggerate computer problems. The reason i left"
bad,My position was outsourced off shore.   I would not go back to work for this company.  Many of my co-workers left before and after I did.  I did not get the feeling staples was pro employee.
bad,The people I worked with were hard workers and taught me everything quickly. The hardest and best part of the job was the customers. There were very friendly customers as well as unhappy difficult customer.
bad,"I was responsible for all the tech repairs at my store as well as assisting customers with their tech repair needs. I worked with people to diagnose the problem and help repair their computer, printer, or home network both in store or on site. The difficulty was that it was difficult to give customers a fair price for repairs based on what were company policies. I often felt we were overcharging for repairs that took me little to no time to complete. I loved the people I got to work with and thoroughly enjoyed the work. I also made very little money for the amount of technical work I was expected to complete."
bad,"Worked as an EasyTech associate where I would help customers find the perfect computer for them. I would tell them about the specifications of the computer to really find the right computer for them for what they were doing. Additionally, I would work on computers and repair them, whether it was data transferring, virus removal, PC tuneups, cleaning, or formatting. I was also a cashier and helped customers in a timely and helpful fashion, in addition to keeping track of a till."
bad,"Always a lot to do. Never run out of tasks to do. Great customer Service skills a must for this job.  Get to meet a wide variety of customers, especially this location being very close to the airport."
bad,Staples is a great place to work. My DM is a great person to work for and makes it easy to come to work every day. Labor is starting to get tight which makes every day problems more and more challenging. Staples is starting to shrink which is eliminating opportunities to advance. Overall great company to work for but need to start looking at other opportunities.
bad,I worked very hard for minimal pay and was rarely ever acknowledge for working past my hours and even through breaks.
bad,Time for a new opportunity using my diverse skill set.  After seven years and several roles the opportunity to drive change and create profit through my experience became limited.
bad,"My duties consisted of uploading and unloading the truck then separate the merchandise by departments, inventory and returns, stock merchandise, worked the sales floor and customer service."
bad,Typical work day 8 hours. Inventory and Sales associate for electronics. Co- workers seemed very nice but dull. The hardest part of the job was inventory knowing where everything is. The most enjoyable part was the unscheduled breaks.
bad,"Management greets me as my shift begins to discuss daily and weekly goals.  I read over previous shift's notes on orders that have active projects.  Email is used to check for new web submitted orders.  As customers come in, I politely greet them and if working with another customer, I assure them I'll be with them shortly.  If I'm working with many customers and fall behind in my work, I page for a co-worker to assist me - it is a very fast paced environment and the ability to multi-task is a MUST!  Customers are usually very grateful and appreciative of my assistance."
bad,"Staples is the typical company that values money over customers.  Skeleton crews are the norm at nearly every location.  With the incredibly low wages, it is hard to remain productive when Staples already doesn't have the amount of people required to do the work."
bad,"Co-workers are joyfully to work with,never a dull moment in our department(seeing what we have to procure day in and out).  Manager are knowledgeable on what they are doing and backing up our department. Hardest part of the job was not know when our department was going to be eliminated when Corporate Express was acquired by Staples in July 2008 and Staples finally decided to migrate the system to Staples system and move the procurement department to the HQ in Framingham, MA on October 2013."
bad,"If you ever have work for staples the first thing is that supervisor or manager dont care for employees..really poor management and every time you tell your supervisor to solve a problem they always come with some sarcastic answer."
bad,"I hate to say it, but working for Staples was probably one of the worst experiences of my life. The Store Manager was remorseless, blaming anyone they could get their hands on for the mistakes of a few, even if the difference was three days worth of shifts. They didn't follow procedures or guidelines as laid out by corporate, had me in the system as full-time, but only offered me part-time benefits, When offered ideas that could help increase our efficiency and sales, they responded by shooting me down, stating that there was no way that it would help, only to implement the same ideas a week later and take the credit for it. The employees themselves seem to be nice people, but management certainly left something to be desired."
bad,"I've worked here for two years and it wasn't all that bad throughout those two years. "
bad,It use to be a good company to work  for but not anymore...they are restructuring and its a mess
bad,Staples offers great benefits to their part time employees but the hours are not very consistent and neither is the management.
bad,it was good and alright when first started but at the end they were not supportive. mainly favouratism was taking his toll.
bad,"A typical day at work I ring people out, take out the trash and ink, returns and damages. My co-workers I really don't talk to I like to get my work done."
bad,Stock shelves
bad,-Cold Calling-by phone and by walk in. Min 200 leads a week
bad,A very fast paced work place. Staples is proud of quality work on a shoe string budget. Staples trains the assocaites to task while being aware of what is going on around them CUSTOMERS are the main priority and they are very proud of that. I really enjoyed working with the team there everyone was very pleasnt and hard working.
bad,not the best place to work. unless you like working long hours and dont have a life.
bad,"It’s a place to work and learn, however people will keep coming and going if the wage is not reviewed upwards as it’s not enough to cover cost of living."
bad,"If you’re not used to working at a fast paced for 8 to 12 or more hours , then this job isn’t for you. Think of your shift as a cardio workout the entire time.If you take the 3pm -1130 pm shift you will not get off on time. Some days you will get off at 230 -330 am (often)& some days you will get off early (rarely ).The work schedule isn’t consistent & the pay rate should be more. It’s nice having Sat & Sun off. Staples do offer medical, dental, vision & 401 k benefits."
bad,"I have worked as a print and marketing associate and the department's supervisor."
bad,The job isn't hard. and you just go through the motions there. The management can be very rude and speak badly of employees. But they're fairly open with scheduling which is nice for going to school and working there.
bad,"The job at Staples is great if your just starting out they don't require any prior work experience and the pay starting out is not bad but, they don't offer much as far as raises go also the management can be a bit difficult to get along with especially with some of the Sales explications, and you will more then likely have to work most weekends nights and holidays which is to be expected with any retail job but all in all if your just starting out it's a good start but if you have some work experience and are looking for something more permanent then I would stay away"
bad,"During my employment at Staples, I have learned how a corporation is  is managed and how to communicate with a company. The work place at Staples was that everyone was friendly and willing to help when help is needed."
bad,Staples is not the place if someone wants to advance in a profession. I've learned that for a place like Staples to thrive in the future is to keep a select few of managers because some are to confident in their position that they think their superior.
bad,Would be a great job if you like being overworked and if you are picking your locations are usually not pick ready. You would most definitely have to do mandatory overtime every other day. Management doesn't care except maybe 1-2 supervisors. Part time would be great if you are in school and wouldn't have to worry about overtime.
bad,My employment with Staples was a high stress-environment during my pregnancy. I was constantly running around and fixing other employee's work--as well as doing my own--doing managerial work and not getting paid as a manager but still expected to do so much more.
bad,"At first glance I thought I was at a good place, but I soon found out what a cut throat culture Staples has created and it only got worse after the company was purchased by a private equity firm."
bad,"It should say it all when they changed the name from Staples, Inc. to Staples Stores. They're closing stores and phasing out everything but their website."
bad,Required to help customers with 100% care. Many different roles available from retail store and no retail stores. Min wage paying position and very low wage increases.
bad,"Working with Staples for me has been overall negative. Being forced to sell items to customers whether they need them or not is a facet of retail, but Staples takes it too far to the point of punishment if not every single customer is offered a sale, even if it's a child at the register. Hours are flexible but they will force you to work longer hours on days you were scheduled. "
bad,"From managers to skilled technicians to salesman the expectation is perfection and thousands upon thousands of personally created additional sales, with literally no reward for success."
bad,"The sales culture at Staples is above all else. If you thrive in a sales environment, it may be a good fit. Each position throughout the store has different sales behaviors they must achieve every shift."
bad,"General Manager And Assistant Mangers We’re Awesome, Loved The Co-Workers Very Team Oriented And Caring. Supervisor Was Ignorant And Mean. She Was A Show Off"
bad,"Wonderful workplace for the most part, the store manager does a good job providing days off per requests most of the time, but if not requested multiple times typically it is forgotten."
bad,"Good place to work, I enjoyed going to work everyday, and enjoyed the people I worked with. The customers were generally pleasant and understanding. easy job at the Copy Center."
bad,"Staples is not a great place to work because they don't encourage their employees. They pay very little and expect a great deal of work. even though I was doing a lot, I was still asked to do more."
bad,Looking back on the years working there its like any other traditional corporate job. Starting from the ground up though I was able to grow substantially with the right drive.
bad,"High expectations set on staff + stores with no support provided. Long hours expected to cover deficiencies with no compensation."
bad,"Staples provides good services, and incentives to customers.  Benefits for full time employees are fairly competitive and support those serious illness events that can occur."
bad,"Im a new employee and started yesterday. They made all the new people go on the floor with out any knowledge of what to do, I had to figure out things on my own. I load 2 trucks by myself simultaneously. Management was rarely around.  Its very demanding and time consuming, Dont apply unless you want all your time spent loading trucks or whatever."
bad,"Used to be a good company - after being sold it went downhill fast.  Now a toxic atmosphere.  I wouldn't consider any reviews prior to 4/2018.  Good officce space, poor management.  Normal business hours."
bad,"The people there that you work with make the job, though the job itself is a very stressful one, trying to get a day requested off is like pulling teeth, and there are very few people who work at a time, at times, there are only 3 people who work."
bad,I didn't love working for this company because I felt that many of the employees they hired were not motivated to work so I ended up doing a lot of the work myself which made things difficult.
bad,"The work environment as well as my fellow employees worked very well together and made the whole experience pleasant. Unfortunately, due to the store's location, the expectations for sales were very unrealistic and hurt morale when we were told if we didn't make the sales there would be repercussions."
bad,"It's a typical retail job, even as a technician. Stock shelves and help customers. Nothing particularly challenging, but also nothing too interesting."
bad,"What can I say about this company the pay and original introduction to culture is great, but does not live up to expectations. Training is hit or miss. Some individuals seem to have a lot of time invested in them while others are overlooked. Work/life balance is supposed to be important, but you are looked down upon for trying to leave on time a couple days."
bad,"It was a classic retail experience. General Manager got relocated, District and Regional Manager got fired after a high traffic store closed. The employees were lazy and had negative attitude."
bad,"As with any retail company, Staples has a boatload of metrics for which stores are held accountable. Many of these metrics are impossibly high for how few hours a store gets in its weekly payroll budget. If you're lucky, store management will acknowledge these hurdles and do whatever is possible to make things work. "
bad,"Inferior management.  Management doesn't seem to know what is going on or how to help you perform well.  New employees under a month are second guessing if their job is secure.  My current manager doesn't know the answers to any questions and tells everyone on the team to ask another colleague how to do something.  I loved working for Staples until I received a ""promotion"" (no pay raise, lowered commission structure, and more work) and switched to a new boss.  Now I and several others are ready to run.  Since October/November, five people have left.  If that doesn't tell you how miserable management is I don't know what will."
bad,"Things were never really in order for it to run smooth. The most reliable will really be out to work while others talk and call you to the front. You will pick up after other's intentional slick and the supervisor will make sure you do because the person leaving it for you will make sure of it. Its a routine thing for people to leave something they could have finished at the end of their shift, but as you are working, you can't sit something down for one second without them telling you not to leave it because it's on your shift."
bad,"A typical day at work never left me feeling personally satisfied. Often unrealistic expectations constantly hang over the heads of employees -- every day -- and if that isn't enough to stress you out, customers can often be impatient and uncooperative. There were far too many angry customers at my counter due to the failures of the corporation as a whole. Those same expectations also hang over the heads of the managers, and it makes very tense environment. The hardest part of the job was meeting unrealistic sales goals. The most enjoyable part of the job was the rare moments the day was slow and customers appeared to be in mellow temper. This job is not as easy as Staples old motto would like you to believe, and it is not recommended that you rely on this job to be what puts bread on your table."
bad,"Mostly a boring place to work, so if you're okay with standing around and doing nothing for majority of the day, go for it.  Otherwise, the low pay and scattered work hours will make you want to find something else that's more beneficial."
bad,I work at Staples don’t get me wrong I like the company but management they are so  dumb when I work there I was harassed several times I repeatedly to management and they didn’t do anything about  it
bad,"A division composed of false promises to promotion and increased pay. As the employees begin to increase their revenue as a whole which benefits their pay, the company has and continues to change employee compensation plan to keep income levels at controlled low. Advice to college grads- Get in and learn from the experience but understand this will not be the promising gold mine. This position will simply benefit as a resume builder. Get your 18-24mos and run!"
bad,"Staples is a company very obsessed with running at barebones, you will have very few people to assist you. (usually 4 associates scheduled at a time) There is also a very big weight put on sales skills without any bonuses or extra for said sales."
bad,This Job allowed me to learn and move around many positions throughout the store. I was able to start on cash and the move to stalking aisles as well as running the copy center. I was able to learn to deal with business owners and party planners helping them market their events and enhancing the profession look of their business.
bad,"The job culture and the core values of the company were very good. There was not too much room for growth, there was a lot of dysfunction and dis-organization there."
bad,"Very unprofessional, rude, favoritism, no coaching or feedback on performance. They do not follow thru on what they promise on hours, time, and pay. Filing a complaint with HR, does not get you any where."
bad,"Staples is a company of immediate change and turnover. What I mean by this is it is almost like they do not think before making MAJOR changes. A new system was implemented with very little training for one of the most important roles! Right after this, they tell employees to be aware that your job may or may not be here tomorrow. Their changes seem to be haphazard and thoughtless, yielding concern for anyone employed under their practices. The management is just as frustrated which has a trickle effect on the rest of the employees therefore communication is ineffective. Use caution and ask probing questions when coming on board with this employer. (Note: This is at the call center level, not the brick and mortar stores)"
bad,"Long hours. Pay was mediocre. Management was just as bad. Very dog-eat-dog atmosphere. Scheduling was always an issue. Unless you are The GM, you only get a 30 minute break. Even criminals get an hour lunch."
bad,"They are trying to ""revamp"" this program but we all think they are really trying to eliminate the program all together. People are being fired left and right, the managers are on edge and almost abusive at times- it's a toxic environment."
bad,"When I worked for staples back in 2015, there was three changes in store managers in less than 6 months. I actually did not mind working there but the pay, I believe, is unreasonable."
bad,I was pregnant when i worked here so everyone was real nice and was really considerate about my condition. I worked the front end . So my job was pretty cool.
bad,"Management is extremely poor in this organization.  Staples does not have a clear direction for which it is trying to head.   If they clean house of Management, the company would be in much better shape."
bad,Work is easy enough and enjoyable but the installers end up paying for the management's poor planning and customer service. They also just laid off a bunch of people.
bad,"This was my first part-time job, starting off as a red shirt associate. I received the typical downtown Chicago customers; angry with attitude, impatient etc. but it was nothing I couldn't handle. After about nine months, the GM promoted me to (then copy&print) Print and Marketing department. That itself was a whole different story. I feel as though Print and Marketing is its own business but is not treated as such. We make up for 78% of the stores budget but do not get the proper assistance from store managers, and I have also heard this from other Staples stores outside of the Loop. I would not recommend working at Staples unless you are completely immune to vulgar customers who, in my experience, will spit at and throw things at you when you tell them your policies and how the job taking process works. Staples has set the bar way too high and is nowhere near willing to lend a helping hand to help us get there, especially with the new CEO."
bad,I hated my experience at staples. It was a horrific experience. The management at my old store was terrible. No room for advancement and they restricted me based of my speech impediment.
bad,"Very laid back at work. Not much going on, just saying hi to people entering the store and standing at the till. Management was having constant problems with people leaving due to lack of hours resulting in little pay. Coworkers were very friendly however employees needs weren't accounted for."
bad,"I learned a lot working for Staples, but I can't say that I agree with some of the decisions coming down from corporate nowadays.  If you don't mind working in sales (regardless of position), try it out."
bad,"I enjoyed the time i was there as a copy center expert. My staff was filled with great older as well as younger employees. I independently worked with customers in the copy center, and USPS/UPS center."
bad,"Staples, well you know a very traditional big company. If you want a secure job, at this point,  it will not give it to you. Since they are cutting head account."
bad,"Very customer service oriented. Overall duty is fill shelves, keep floor clean, and priced.."
bad,"staples was often a busy environment,there was a fun atmosphere the majority of time with the rest of the team,throughout my role here i had many new experiences dealing with customers and learning to use tills etc, i enjoyed working at staples with the other members of my team."
bad,"A typical day at work consists of a mostly customer service driven atmosphere. Though the better part of the day is dedicated to providing outstanding customer service, I was able to learn quite a bit in terms of retail stores and how they operate. Management is often times moved around amongst all of the different locations and can often times have completely different ways of running the store. The ability to multi-task and accept constant changes in both management, as well as staff members was one of the most difficult parts of the job. However, being able to provide the customers with efficient customer service was one of the more enjoyable parts of the job."
bad,"Longest job I've ever had, pay was low, incentives for a while, then diminished. Learned how to self manage, maintain, and run entire furniture department on my own for 2 1/2 years. Co-workers some were immature, lazy, and not motivated to work. Hardest part was adapting to change in job culture. Fun part was taking advantage of the company, hiding furniture that was on clearance for your own low price benefit (i.e. original cost of nice glass tower stand would be $179, got it for like $10.00 on clearance). Managed to take advantage for the benefit of myself after working honestly and very hard. Greedy company, CEO's and executives only care about themselves. Sorry little raises every year like $0.20 to $0.25 cents a year if anything. Fragile place to work. After I left, they suffered dramatically. Vice President of Marketing or something like that only gave me a dollar gold coin that which anyone can get, instead of giving me like a $100 store gift card, all I got was recognition."
bad,"Fun work environment, everyday is a learning experience, fun employees, the hardest part of this job is if you make it harder than it needs to be. Enjoy working with employees, we all become friends over time."
bad,"For the knowledge you are expected to know to the upkeep and other things about the business its not worth it. I was not even given the minimum amount of hours through out the week and I was expected to sell unfairly, not on a needs basis as I intended."
bad,"I did not have a very pleasant work experience here. I felt like it would have been a lot better, but my expectations were not correct. The people I worked with were very kind and would love to work with these same people. The people I worked under were not very positive."
bad,"A typical day involves running around doing many tasks and helping customers. I have learned a lot and was able to move up in the past. Management for the past few years have been mediocre and lackluster. The hardest part of the is trying to find time to ""actually do my job."""
bad,"job goin to private contractors drivers out of work soon,hard work,management good,nice coworkers,make 50-60 deliveries a day,learned better customer skills"
bad,"I have worked with Staples twice in my working history. My second experience was not a good one. With all the changes in the company, it's taking the life out of the Staples brand. Not satisfied. No job security or advancement within the company."
bad,Labor intensive. Low concerns for safety and workers feed back.. Supervisors and management are plesent people to work with.
bad,This job wasn't a nice job. Didn't really particularly care to much for this job
bad,"Managed 50 associates in a delivery operation to major corporations, small businesses and residential customers.  Worked with many dedicated professionals in our operations.  "
bad,"Staples is showing its age, and growing pains of a company trying to catch up to the modern retail environment."
bad,management had poor communication and lacked efforts to improve communicating with different styles of employees.  Forcing employees to work through lunch breaks
bad,"I love my job at Staples, however the company is unbalance in payroll. I am in management but I am paid as a regular employee at $9.70 per hour. I am still asked and expected to do my job without any pay increase or even a little appreciation. I love my coworkers."
bad,Over all the company is ok minus all the cut backs they have been doing. They expect more for less and I wouldn't recommend this company to any friends or family. The management is horrible.
bad,"I enjoyed working with Staples, I was a computer technician, made the store I worked at the number one technology store in the country, met the president of Staples, got Associate of the Month for the local store and the district, but then they fired me over something stupid because someone else wanted my job."
bad,"You can easily become a manager with this job, if you stay on time of your job. I love it, just heat working nights and weekends all the time."
bad,"Staples is a great company. Extremely strong. I worked with the most professional people in my entire career. Incredible group of Account managers. Loved working with every one of them. I was number one in the state twice. In the top 15 nation wide twice. The job was great."
bad,"Responsible for providing customer service, consistent with our Copy Promise standards. Regularly print everything from color reports to oversize vinyl banners, business cards and flyers. It could get overwhelming at times but we all work together to meet deadlines."
bad,great while still in school. coworkers are great management is terrible
bad,"It was a retail job, what can you really say? The people you work with are awesome."
bad,"Na Staples o pouco tempo que tive na empresa não aprendi nenhum aspecto em concreto, apenas aprofundei o meu conhecimento sobre algum material da loja."
bad,"After clocking in a typical day is spent taking customer orders and contact information, then running jobs on appropriate machine. When the next shift clocks in, update them as to jobs in progress and waiting to be picked up, then take short break. Co-workers are mostly young and easy to get along with. Management is reasonable, occasionally tough when necessary. Hardest part of the job is juggling time and workload. Best part is the feeling of completing projects."
bad,Constantly put under a lot of stress repairing customer pcs with no real reward. Making mininum wage area pay for work that is equal to a shop manager being paid 15-20 per hour. Although great for school scheduling.
bad,"Typical day at work consists of taking in and producing orders from walk in customers or job submissions via our website/email. At the job I learned: the value of time management, skills needed for customer service, and the value of organization. The management team at Staples is effective at executing corporate goals/initiatives, however they can be short sighted and not always realistic in their demands. The co-workers at Staples are for the most part friendly and capable of doing their jobs, however there is little emphasis on organization from both the co-workers and management. This leads to a very chaotic and less productive working place. The hardest part of the job is trying to correct the organizational flaws, as well as time management and prioritizing jobs for when they are due. The most enjoyable part of the job is producing jobs to the satisfaction of the customer."
bad,Very political work environment. Co-workers are decent individuals but upper management doesn't see the whole picture. High expectations with low benefits/compensation.
bad,"Staples, was a good place to work for. I got to know the customer by name and could call by name when they came into the store."
bad,Responsible for managing all aspects of the print and copy center. Set and obtained monthly goals to meet profit and loss projections. Developed weekly and monthly action plans that were executed through the coaching and development of my people. Implemented all new and current company procedures to ensure a 100 % excellence in operations. Built and established solid relationships with customers to ensure the copy and print center continued its sales growth. Responsible for sales canvassing of the surrounding area to find and land potential Copy and Print Center clients. Responsible for the rollout and execution of monthly promotions to drive sales in the print center.
bad,The Copy and Print Account Manager Position is a nice concept to the offering of services Staples can provide its commercial clients. However its structure and how the position is set up in terms of resources and support staff makes it cumbersome and eventually frustrating to execute activities that will ensure success in the position.
bad,"pay and advancement are not frequent or hefty,the company rewards workers for certain things,good company"
bad,"Working at Staples was alright for the most part. I was hired as the department manager for technology."
bad,"They have a really poor system in place at print and marketing. Your constantly being bombarded with customers while your trying to fill orders. Very stressful environment. Wouldnt work here for minimum wage, not worth the stress."
bad,The place didn't require much effort not much going on.  It is a failing company with nothing left to give. Work flow is slowing down every week. There isn't much future left
bad,"Corporate most interested in numbers thus management was forced to bend rules... passing that onto employees, especially those of us in management . I managed the print and copy center and exceeded sale expectations significantly. Customers loved me as I did, them. I never had a complaint. Corporate kept taking away equipment and I still kept numbers up, but worked like 3-4 people. They wouldn’t update equip. to match competitors . They expected our store to be a hub when the spokes had better equipment, thus pulling work loads of other stores  very frustrating. As a simple cashier, I’m sure they didn’t feel the sting and would rate store higher."
bad,"When you first join the company it's a grand experience. You get plenty of hours and every opportunity to succeed and thrive. Folks will help you learn and dont mind answering your questions and train you. But, unfortunately I'd call this the honeymoon phase because after that it becomes a problem."
bad,"Selling goals shift constantly and often unfairly. Upper management cares little about larger issues facing a given store (short staff, unresponsive demographic). Often expected to complete work outside pay grade or job position."
bad,"Its absolutely not going to get you anywhere. The pay is spectacularly average and the hours are non-existent. The stores hours are determined by the Print and marketing department and distributed with priority to the managers/ supervisors. You are expected to hard sell a minimum amount of  protection plans on merchandise like printers, computers, and furniture. If you don't your hours are dropped. This is not a commission based position just something you are expected to do. Same with the Staples credit cards. Hopefully you can find a gullible mom during back to school to sell one to per week!"
bad,The company has payroll issues. They did not put in direct deposit paperwork so didnt receive pay on time it caused financial problems for me and my family.
bad,"standard big box electronics gig. "
bad,"I understand how retail life is, but Staples is constantly understaffed and the volume of labor needed leaves everyone doing the work of multiple people. The turnover is awful and associates constantly call in."
bad,"The job would be great if the required talk time on the phone with existing book of business wasn't completely unreasonable.  They expect us to call the same customers over and over and ask about different product categories.  In some cases, we are doing more harm then good just so we can make our talk time."
bad,"Like most large retail stores, if your hired at Staples your expected to know how to do every job. I was hired as an Easy Tech, which based on my interview and job description, you would think meant I just worked on the computers when people brought them in. You would be wrong. The most emphasized part of the job by management is selling warranties and computer accessories on top of any computer you sell. They actually got mad if you sold a laptop and couldn't force the person into buying a warranty with it. You have a specific goal to hit every quarter, and it's very difficult to meet. 90%of the time you aren't doing anything related to computer repair or even computer sales. I've had many shifts where I spent the entire time on a cash register or taking inventory in the back to school section because we were too busy and there just weren't enough cashiers on the schedule. When you do get a computer repair problem, it's almost always an old person (because seriously, who else would bring a computer problem to Staples?) who has a simple problem you could fix in 5 minutes, but you have to charge them the $70 consultation fee because. I get it, you're on the clock and Staples doesn't provide free services, but I can't tell you how many times I've had to tell some little old lady that I have to charge her a ridiculous amount of money to help her get into her email, and that makes you feel like a horrible person. You get a very small raise every year, and if you can put up with everything for 2-3 years, you'll probably be promoted to a manager, but that job doesn't look much more"
bad,The only positive things about working at Staples is the pay (which they continue to raise because they can’t keep people) and some of the lower management.  The quotas you have to meet are so ridiculous that no one does their job correctly and management lets it happen.  Extremely stressful.
bad,When i started  working for this staples there was a Manager and  a Assistant manager. But with in a couple month of being there the Manager  left for another job and left the place in shambles with left the Assistant manager pulling her hair out. Not to long after she left after draining our store account we finally got a new manager and he is great the the store is starting to turn around for the better .
bad,"Team met for lunch and happy hours etc when in proximity to allow for a great environment when at work."
bad,"working at a corporate office you would always have to allow changes. if you don't allow changes and keep on the same pace, you will not be able to catch up."
bad,seasonal holidays are really busy and hard to handle but team work makes it easy specially when everyone is communicating and customer needs are taken care of.
bad,"sit and process orders talk on phone to pmac and customers"
bad,Good place to work.A lot of Howard university students shop there for supplies.Can be fast paced at times.Good people with great customer service.Great scenery being that the location is uptown DC.
bad,Very large turnover for B2B sales. constant changes with in the company. They will often change sales goals. lots of write ups and turnover. The small business sector  sales people aren't given the tools they need to suceed.
bad,Part time positions were taken too seriously. Part timers were taken advantage of and guilted into staying late or picking up shifts. Responsibilities typically were unrelated to any future career goals.
bad,"Staples only hires part timers, you have to work there for atleast a year or more to be even considered to move up. If you are 18 and in school great first or second job for that year, but anyone older, would not recomend, pay is almost a dollar above minimum wage."
bad,"Ever since Healthcare bill bye bye part time insurance. Managers vary from store to store. Some good ones. Some bad ones. I've Had my fair share. If they trust you enough, you might have to help your manager with some of their task, with a slight or no increase in pay/overtime. Oh did I mention part timers only work a max of 25 hours weekly? Also, Staples is also very Customer Service-y. If you're okay with that, then go ahead apply. If not, Staples may not be for you."
bad,"I worked here part time when I was transitioning from York, PA to Royersford, PA.  It was a great opportunity and was a great introduction to retail sales."
bad,"Staples tries to treat their employees reasonably well, but it is still clear that either they do not have the funds to do so or are simply unwilling. ALL employees, not just those in sales positions, are required to meet a daily quota of sales requirements, ranging from getting people to sign up for the free membership to selling a certain amount of extra product (i.e. a ""market basket"") with any technology sales."
bad,the manager are nice no favoritism good with solving problems but the company is like fedex ups and all other delivery companies but the company moral is better
bad,"It wasnt my first job as a driver, i used to drive routes for ice cream under another contractor (also underpayed). Time is crucial and you must have high knowledge of your roads and surroundings."
bad,"Part retail, part computer technician, a reasonable work environment albeit the employees don't seem to be valued by management, EXTREMELY anti-union with the hierarchy caring little of the store-level employees. all the pressure of commission-based sales with none of the benefit with an hourly barely-above-minimum-wage paycheck."
bad,"I gained great experience in supply chain and supply chain cross functional teamwork.  My coworkers in Broomfield were talented, dedicated people.  They always helped make me better at my job.  The hardest part of this job was wondering how much longer it would last.  The factors contributing to the mass layoff at the Broomfield office included the declining office products market, and the blocked attempt by the US Government of the buy out of Office Depot.  I will miss my Broomfield co-workers.  They were the best part of the job."
bad,"bad  communication skills between management and employees, poorly organized. did not receive adequate training for my position. didn't receive enough hours to make descent pay."
bad,"I joined under the pretense that I would be given full training and work my way up from a £5.13 starting wage (I was under the age of 21) to a more desirable salary as well as being promised with working my way towards being the head of the business machine's department. "
bad,"As everyone has different experiences at their place of work, I would prefer to withhold my opinions regarding the company. Suffice it to say, we face the same problems other large retail chains do, when dealing with a serious lack of man hours, and steep expectations, despite the lack of said man hours."
bad,Little help of paper work to foreigners to immigrate. I heard the news that Staples  recently lay off 700 employees. So be prepared for your second career.
bad,"Work began at 5 am, M-F"
bad,"I do enjoy the work I do at staples especially all my customers, super friendly. The only sad part is that staples is laying all their drivers off this fall 2015. I just hope they know what their doing."
bad,"Constantly trying to reinvent themselves to no avail. They seem to have lost track of what their niche is. Managers, District Managers and Regional Mangers contradict each other on a regular basis."
bad,"Everyday was focused on excellent customer services.  Working at Staples taught me how important listening to the customers needs is the key to producing great customer service to the customers."
bad,Great environment. Always learning new things from daily easy tech support
bad,Co-works are great to work with but Company is not all you are is a number to them I worked in DC Putnam for 6 and a half years than I went to work in Killingly DC and after 6 month I was let go because Killingly you have to work in a unsafe way to get your numbers
bad,"Things were going well until they started an aggressive sales policy. My store manager literally yelled at me because I didn't try to sell all our services to an elderly lady (she already had spent a lot of money and I personally had been to her, and her son's, homes doing tech work)."
bad,The employees who do more don’t get recognized or get a higher pay. You can barely pay for your phone bill with 9$ an hour and the respect for the employees is very low.
bad,"I currently work at staples and wouldn’t really recommend it to anyone unless you can deal with careless supervisors. Other than that, easy work other than the physical labor so make sure you can sit for a max of 45 minutes a day (full time without over time) or 15 minutes a day for part time. Good money too. Not worth it for some, definitely worth it for others."
bad,La gestion n’ai pas de mise et les façons de faire doit prendre des nouvelles mesures et vite sinon la concurrence prendra le dessus.
bad,"There's a reason Staples doesn't excel as a company: they don't hire great talent and can't retain great talent when they do. It IS possible to right this ship, but most of the upper management has been here forever and are stuck in this mindset of ""this is how we've always done it"". There's no way the company can compete with that mentality. There's also a lot of weight put on seniority and age at the company, so if you're a new hire (a somewhat experienced one) who comes in with a passion and fire to turn the company around, you are mostly stifled and held back and essentially told to wait your turn. That mentality is what I feel will be the end of the company and it's ability to retain talent."
bad,"The positive attitude was projected by Co-workers that assist in building relationships with people."
bad,unreliable coworkers makes for a few doing all the work not everyone is treated the same with same rules too much policy and red tape not enough personal treatment you are just a number
bad,Staples is definitely a teenager’s job yet there were a lot of older workers. The pay is only $9.00 hourly I believe but it’s very relaxing to work there because almost no one shops there due to the company’s over priced merchandise. Good place to work if you don’t have a lot of bills.
bad,Not run very well but i guess they were going through a merger at the time.  There were too many changes occurring at the time and not enough clear direction especially in my department.
bad,"Staples has management issues, unlike many retail jobs. Decisions made in corporate often don't reflect the reality in stores. Stores are often lacking the requisite employees to get jobs done in time"
bad,"Within the first 2 weeks i had to work alone (even one of the managers told me i wasn't supposed to work alone until a month or two of trained experience) and I had to cover an employee who was there for over a year, who soon decided to just stop showing up. The Gm was rude, didn't take suggestions on how the employees could improve (dismissed giving us actual training outside of learning on the spot during the job), and gave very little training  overall. Your training had to come from on-the-job experience which is understandable to a degree, but based on some orders we had to get done, it leaves the employees confused and made us spend way too much time figuring out how to use certain settings on the printers which led to wasted time and delayed orders. one manager will rush you out if you're closing just because they want to go home, regardless of how much work you have to get done for closing. I pretty much have something negative to say about all of the managers there based on poor management and lack of assistance. unless you desperately need a job, i couldn't recommend this one from this branch."
bad,"I had some major issues with having pay properly delivered. Missed out on a month of pay I had to work very hard to get even after I left. There were also issues with the general manager being present and effective, however, it was a decent job for the summer."
bad,The scheduling was a big problem at my location. In addition the turn over time for employees was so fast that it was a constant struggle to be properly staffed causing individuals that stuck with the company to be overworked.
bad,"I enjoyed my time at staples and was able to learn a great deal, but the wages, inconsistent hours, and tight metrics made the job more stressful than it was worth."
bad,The company used to value their associates as much as their customers. There has been a significant change over the last few years. Declining sales due to online competition has caused unrealistic and constantly changing goals. Work/Life balance is non existent.
bad,hours were fine at the beginning but got worse as time went by. Corporate made very bad changes which made more than half of the employees leave. Pay is not that good
bad,"get to work and go to the cash register, begin to clean the area that nobody else has cleaned. management wasn't good like to hire relatives and make it more convenient for themselves and harder for the other workers, most enjoyable part was leaving on time"
bad,"I became very depressed over my time at Staples, it was right after they went private equity and there was minimal job security. We never knew which team was going to be fired each week (it went on for a couple months."
bad,"if you do not start out as a product specialist, your opportunities down the road are slim to none.  a detailed path in merchandising is laid out for the specialists, for everyone else its Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome."
bad,My day at work consist of pulling pallets and placing them on the warehouse shelfs with a forklift and some days i would have to use a double walkie pallet jack to select items from off of a sheet
bad,The atmosphere of staples was stressful due to the manager always breathing down your neck. however good place to gain knowledge of being a cashier etc.
bad,"It may have been my store specifically but the management team were mean to employees, especially regarding sales. You could never make mistakes so it was not a great learning environment."
bad,"Good people to work with, but Staples does not like to promote in-house.I have been overlooked for many promotions and pay increases do not come on a regular basis."
bad,"i had such a difficult time working here, the management above me was a joke. my people under me couldnt do anything that they were trained to do. never got to enjoy my one day off a week that i was supposed to have off because i would have to go in and fix others mistakes."
bad,"The company has made a lot of changes recently, some not for the better but other things are improving. Its a very on and off again kind of pace with a friendly staff."
bad,This company has moved many positions off-shore within the last year . Hundreds of positions impacted across many departments. Recently went from a public company to being purchased by a private investment group.
bad,I would recommend this job to someone that is very into technology. I enjoyed working here just for the experience but this job isn't something I would invest working for a while.
bad,"it was fine at first until the company started loosing money, then jobs were lost co workers was getting there jobs discontinued and I felt it was a matter of time before that would happen to me."
bad,The environment was crazy especially during back to school. The management had poor communication skills and the training was almost nonexistent. Im glad I left.
bad,It was an okay job but slow the day seemed long and thr managers were always busy and lots if orders came in so that's the only thing to pass the time away!
bad,"A typical day was a large influx of people coming in and out of the store through the entire day. As a cashier your responsible for all in coming calls, for deliveries coming into the store, greeting every customer, stocking the store, assemble some office furniture all while balancing checking customers out at the register and also helping doing online orders. Put simply the cashier is stretched too thin and isnt able to give the customers 100% of their attention which detracts from their experience."
bad,"The direct manager was great to work with, hard and heavy work throughout the shift.  Keep your mouth shut and do the job.  Most of the co-workers will get along with each other."
bad,"Although I was nervous and this was my first proper job, I was put in shipping/receiving instead of the position I had applied for. The management was friendly, but I was unable to retain interest in a job that consisted of 75% box opening."
bad,I was hired as Operations Manager for a brand new store that vastly exceeded their budget. I was terminated 2 weeks before the end of the fiscal year for violating company policy. I found out that the company did this on a regular basis to keep from paying out bonuses.
bad,"You are selling a $299 membership to do business with Staples. Do not be fooled, it is not easy. Good luck. I am on the job hunt! Training is joke and for people who have never sold anything. They do not train you on the product or how to do the day to day tasks. Pay is about $40k-$43k, which is low for a territory manager. If you don't have a degree, this is a good salary. Car package is a joke. I replace tires and put thousands of miles on my car and they don't pay for gas or insurance."
bad,"was not given a fair amout of work hours"
bad,"open store tasks daily, work inventory specialist tasks of daily order every week per lists maintain inventory control daily by doing daily / weekly tasks."
bad,"customers are nice, learned a lot of sales techniques and how to talk to different people. The overall management is fairly poor to be honest, not understanding how modern businesses work. Hardest part of the job would have to be passing the time, sure there's always things to do but when there are no customers in the store, you can run out of things to do fairly easily. The thing I love most about the job would be talking to customers and selling to them, I take pride in what I do and try to get the best deal for the customer as well as the store."
bad,"part time stepping stool job for sumone in school,requires full time on part time schedule, overworked enviornment , very stressful because of short staffed,company tries to save money at the sake of customer satisfaction, and safety.compensation raises are little to rare.rules and policies are made as they go, can change day to day with no warning."
bad,Continually growing company. Good benefits and good atmosphere to work for. Vested time with Staples will pay off. The company rewards there people which work hard fairly.
bad,poorly managed. management staffed with bosses and not leaders pushed the goals that kept them in good standing as far as runnnig the store in review no commission for pushing for watch sales
bad,There is no interest in discussing this employer. The experience is one that I wish not share. Better training and employment hiring procedures should be a focus.
bad,My gm doesn't know how to set schedule. They're always making changes throughout the week. Tends to argue on the sales floor. Doesn't perform the best under pressure.
bad,did not enjoy working here. new tasks were introduced every month or two and pressures too. this is highlighted by the fact that they never increased pay.
bad,I only worked for staples briefly. it was productive. Customer service. make copies. laminations. stuff like that. It was a little fun. wish I worked there longer.
bad,"During my second week at Staples, I had started my internship from Rutgers at Passaic County's Intoxicated Resource Center and knew the importance of putting the majority of my energy and time into the internship and not a temporary job."
bad,"You share desk with people and they penalize you for you not being able to log on to the phone on time because they do not have enough desk for how many employees work there. Sometimes you wonder if the leads there know what they are talking about, and unless they have done a system update their software is horrible and loops you around."
bad,Shift work without set schedules. Management more like babysitting. Understaffed stores interruptive of tasks and customer relations. Little growth opportunity.
bad,This was a good job for kids coming home from college for a summer. Not hard to learn the job and also always the workers to learn skills such as driving a fork lift that can help them get a job in the future.
bad,"The company was big on customer service, at one point the customers felt overwhelmed. Overall a great company if you have never worked for a big box company."
bad,A typical company that keeps nearly everyone as part time to cut costs. Worked with a great bunch of people and will miss them.
bad,"The job itself was great, aside from no room for advancement, and a poor management style. Hour cap made it hard to get enough hours to make it worth staying."
bad,"great job for high school student not good for long term experiences, no room for growth, hours are slim to none September is the busiest month after barely pull in any hours no full-time positions hardest part of the job is keeping up with selling protection plans"
bad,"lots of infighting between the supervisors  a very toxic environment. conveyor systems constantly breaking down, not fun."
bad,Overall the typical day at work was rush for most things when in Copy Center and making sure stock was available on the floor when in other departments. While there I did learn more things about actual print procedures. The managers were either over worked or didn't care what happened. The co-workers were either content with their job like a few I met or were there because it was what they could get and just did the bare minimum of what was required. The hardest part of my job was explaining my limitations and having a boss that didn't care as long as the job got done. I enjoyed the interaction with customers and the satisfaction that helping them brought.
bad,"Okay, basically, Staples is a company that I would not recommend anyone to work at. At least not at this store. Management is absolutely terrible. They'd much rather sit in their office talking about tv shows and eating pizzas then assisting customers or answering pages. Extreme favoritism, and if you're not a favorite, you best be prepared to be yelled at daily for the stupidest things. The people who work at the store, besides management, are some of the greatest people that I've ever met. I loved the store, and my co-workers, but the mistreatment from management overpowered the good. If you mess up, even a little, you will without a doubt be yelled at, and talked down to as if you're a child and completely incompetent. Also, if you like not taking lunches on 10 to 12 hour shifts then this is the place for you."
bad,"breaks are not scheduled. and can range in time from day to day. the work is fast paced and very physicaly challenging. basically, the workers are worked like dogs for peanuts"
bad,"Worked as a resident technician. Alright for the experience, i personally do not enjoy sales i prefer to help people. If you want to sell and get people to buy stuff this is the job for you."
bad,"Just meh, good first time job or in school job. Pay was pretty decent for a student and the management was well put together. I definietly recommend this as a first time job :)"
bad,The management staff were professional but the pay rate and hours were not secure enough.
bad,"Some days were okay, but management wasn't really that great."
bad,Customers make the job worth wild. I learned how to train employees on policy.
bad,Great place to work once you learn how everything works. Laid back atmosphere for the most part. Great place to work on your time management skills and coping with co-workers (Good and Bad).
bad,No respect for its own employee.one of the worst organisation to work
bad,"It's a very fast-paced place to work. The company is always looking for incremental sales and margin opportunities, which allows merchants to think creatively and come up with new ideas. This is great until support teams get involved, at which point there's too much red tape to get anything accomplished."
bad,"It is a very slow environment. You will have little to no customers your whole shift, and at the end the managers will yell at you for not making the store quote. It was a horrible place to work at."
bad,"I found that atmosphere in Staples was awful, and seriously under-appreciative of employees."
bad,Staples was a great place to work.  The downside is that they are joining the rank and file of so many of our country's larger corporations and shipping many of their jobs overseas -- which seems very UN-american.
bad,"On a typical workday I would start by restocking shelves until customers started walking in, and then assist customers. Management acted like they didn't want to be there, and did enough work to get by."
bad,Enjoyed customer interactions and my co-workers. Did not enjoy push to sell products that customer didn't want.
bad,"involved in leading a team of associates in attaining corporate goals, interacting with customers, and problem solving"
bad,"Very detail oriented job. A lot of work with little pay. Your basically the heart and soul of the store, when things aren't in the right place it all falls back on you and your ZB ( Zero Balance) counts. Co-workers at my store are pretty cool."
bad,"I only worked for them a few days. This was a contractor job. I worked for the Taxes, and was only there a few days for working. I was not needed after a few days."
bad,"A lack of appreciation, bad management and very little chance for upward movement in the company. Demands that never get responded to and a ""push it off until later"" approach to management."
bad,"In retail, management is always in and out. It seemed as though most of the managers hated their jobs, therefore they sometimes took it out on the employees. The store manager let's a lot of people get away with things and is very selective on who he likes. There are certain people he will talk to for hours, and then there are others who he will never even blink an eye at."
bad,"Tell us about:"
bad,Repeated Work daily
bad,If you like to work hard and dont care about the money.Then this is the job for you.
bad,Il y avait beaucoup de clients et trop de choses à faire en même temps. Je n'ai pas vraiment aimé travailler durant la période de la rentrée scolaire.
bad,I'm a department manager that runs the register. I've been a supervisor / keyholder with said company for over 8 years and everyday was different from the last. The management and co workers are well trained and diversified. I myself have been with the company over 14 years. The most enjoyable part of the job is consulting consumers on the office supplies needs whether its electronics or non electronics needs. There really isn't any hard part customer service takes priority and that's easy.
bad,very american way of running store stock ordering team talks and selling were the main focus small management team also with team leaders ran store with 10 staff in total hardest part of job was learning all the new products and how they worked best part was turning round a poor performing store to a good place to shop
bad,Bad attitude by older employees. Not a good company to work for.
bad,"I learned a lot while working at Staples. I had worked in an electronics retail environment before so the transition was not too difficult. But, I learned something new every day. Management was disorganized which led to various scheduling issues."
bad,I called in sick 2 days in a row & I had enough sick hrs. to cover me but the secretary put me down as unexcused for 1 of the days so I was fired. Their attendance policy is very strict & unfair. You only accrue 2 sick days a year. It gets very hot on the 2nd & 3rd level during Summer.
bad,It was a very enjoyable place to work. Team members were fantastic. Manager has a hard time keeping his mouth shut about personal things that are talked about in confidence
bad,Very bad HR team.  Operations team are very miserable and unhappy and think they own the company.   Front end team are treated poorly.  Very understaffed and employees overworked.
bad,"Decisions by the Corporate hierarchy make all the decisions and not management who are just given orders to fulfill. Wages are low for what they expect from their employees and benefits are nominal. Enjoyed working with the people there but there is always pressure from above on everyone. Continual education on training and service and sales, sales, sales."
bad,"Worked here as a part-timer for 4 months. I can't say I enjoyed it much..."
bad,I didn’t enjoy my time. It was what I applied for but I just wished I wasn’t on register so much. I didn’t want to be on register the whole shift. I wanted to help on the floor.
bad,"this company is very slow paced, by the books. too much down time at the location i was at. there was not much customer traffic coming into the store making it very slow."
bad,Job is good for a first job but not much after that.I started in order to get some experience and I have gotten that but I don't intend on staying here much longer.
bad,"Earned #1 rank in NorCal division in development of new customers (2003), implemented new programs for product replenishment to streamline supply & efficiency, managed key partner relationships, provided presentations and web-based training to enhance order processing."
bad,"Great company  - however, they are their worst enemy - no processes in place - focus is constantly changing.  The product is great - but ability to execute is subpar - support staff is not appropriately aligned with sales team - constant conflict and turnover in support personnel."
bad,I enjoyed the people I worked with. They really help me to understand how to do the certain areas that were needed. The most enjoyable part of my job was talking to my managers and how helpful the co workers were.
bad,There is always a checklist of things that need to be completed by the end of the day and one must work as quickly as possible in order to complete the list.
bad,"A typical day at work includes stocking shelves and helping customers. I learned that I really don't like people. Managers are friendly, coworkers are great. The hardest part of the job is having to tell customers you don't have something in stock (many yell, like it will make it magically appear. Co workers are the best part of the job hands down."
bad,"At Staples my responsibilities include counting the safe every day, opening or closing the store, making sure the team members are happy, and making sure the customers are happy."
bad,".Open Store- get registers open for the day"
bad,"Staples is a good ""retail"" job, I need more structure in my work schedule. I also need a better balance in work/life schedule"
bad,"A typical day for me would be completing a Zero Balance Walk, cycle counts, RTV's & RTW's, planograms and price changes.  I also would assist the managers in any capacity that they may need.   The hardest part of my job for me was spreading myself too thin.  I not only did my job to the best of my ability, but I also jumped into assist my co-workers whenever they needed help. The most enjoyable part of my job for me is not only do I regard my co-workers as my family, but also, I love meeting the many customers that come into our store."
bad,Contrary to management Staples was a productive and fun franchise to work for. Our store had different goals to reach dialy to either match the competing stores or surpass them.
bad,"I loved working in the copy center. Honestly, if it weren't for the store environment I never would have left my job. I got to make people's ideas come to life, and that was fantastic. It was a lot of work, but it made the time go by faster."
bad,"The typical day at work for me was providing excellent customer service as the cashier, offering plans, rewards, keeping the front of the store cleaned, and organized. "
bad,they have the worst security ever and blame it on the employees and most of their superiors are too strict or uptight not a fun environment. There's a lot of favor-ism specially with the district managers.
bad,"The staff is terrific but the General Manager is the sole reason why employee's quit. She will make you look terrible and embarrass you in front of a customer only to make herself look good. She piles on too many tasks in an unrealistic time. She does not express appreciation from her staff. When she it is her day off you can actually breathe in the store and you can focus on the customers needs,"
bad,"It’s a nice place to work for getting experience. Management is not much appreciated for your work. "
bad,"Not much is expected each day, have to go into work knowing that it is a part time thing. Mainly young co-workers, management turnover pretty high. Employees move in and out a lot."
bad,"•	Worked as a retail office supplies associate. Assist customers with information about the product to upscale sales and satisfaction within the store by correct policies and procedures of Staples. While using the to scan the products by the serial number and organized by our store department.. In charge of updating the price tags advertisements specials so that customers were informed by saving money on any particular merchandise. Help promoting technology devices such as ink cartridges and other etc for the customer’s needs as well. Lifting heavy equipment for advertisement in each department including unloading merchandises from the trucks "
bad,"There have been a lot of recent changes to this company that really ruined the work environment. They overload you with work, pay as little as possible and don't allow for negotiations on raises."
bad,"There are several departments to choose from -- redshirts [general customer service], copy/print center [think Kinko's], tech [think Best Buy]. You can move up to management, but they are often underpaid and overstressed. Those who do well are rewarded with relocation, with or without their consent. Team leads are paid under $10/hr."
bad,The job it self is not that hard. The hours are long but it keeps you busy. I lunch room has an ok verify of food but not that much. People are nice and helpful.
bad,• Led the store to top of district in products sold
bad,Every one is nice but the 12 hours days are not for everyone.Its very hot in the summer in the warehouse but nice enviroment every one helps each other.
bad,Challenge et formation aux seins de l'entreprise très avant-gardiste. Une mise à jours des connaissances sur les produits et nouveautés informatique et une ambiance de travail encourageante.
bad,"Everyone was friendly, clean and outstanding store, customers were super sweet and funny"
bad,typical day was making sure truck was loaded every day heading towards route and making sure clients received delivery in timely manner returning and finalizing paperwork at end of day
bad,Decent job for a high school student no room for  advancement thru company. Not much else to say about the company. Good second job
good,"They would not specified gender orientation on certain individual to all the crew, which in turned created problems for everyone. Also participates on certain adult games, to which many felt intimidated."
good,"The staff members that worked above me bullied me, which made me quit. Management took no action. The shift wasn’t bad and the hours were perfect. But the people I worked with sucked"
good,It was a OK to work there at first. Then you realize that you go no where in the company. At the staples that I worked at. I needed a job at the time.
good,Staples is not an employee friendly company. The company is cheap and inconsiderate. Pay is terrible.Very flexible work schedule. Able to work at different stores.
good,J'ai apprécié faire mon stage mais jamais je ne voudrais travailler a cet endroit à long terme.
good,"This company will squeeze the life out of you. It will work you hard and to the bone for little compensation. In fact there are TRAINING VIDEOS dedicated to you multitasking and juggling customers, always depicting yourself on your own. (which you always are)"
good,"If you plan on moving up in a company, don't go here. Not worth the time you put in it. They want to compensate you nothing and expect everything from you while your fellow co workers are overly lazy"
good,"It was a ok workplace environmentally ok, but ethically not ok management stealing from there, and job security was not stable"
good,"I wasn't being challenged enough and management highly under trained"
good,I took in a leadership position I wasn't being paid for and was fired because I stood up to being bullied after I made numerous reports to upper management..
good,"A typical day starts around 6 am and goes until all parcels were shipped timeline usually over 12 hours."
good,Staples is going through a lot of management changes and therefore the environment is unstable.  It was once a company with a clear direction.  With layoffs every few months the environment is not healthy. The company is in a good location.  it has a gym and a cafe. Overtime it should settle down.
good,It could be the best job. But the management is not good. The HR is not very good more for the upper management. They trick you and take your time so they can have a hold on you to make people be at work.
good,"No good for students, unrealistic selling targets and intimidating management, no opportunity to progress, they only want shelf stacker s. Not alot of holiday"
good,"I have worked for many locations, Some are great and some are terrible. Copy center is extremely stressful, and without the right team and management support it is very difficult."
good,"When I first started the job environment was very proessional. There was a recent change in management, thus the work experience faltered and the hours were very limtied.I am seeking a Career not just a simple Job! I want to focus more on my skills than sales!"
good,"A difficult place to work.  Supervisor is not interested in her employees with few exceptions, poor training techniques leave much to be desired (I was left to my own devices on a ninty-day trained job position after a week), and there is a lot of underhandedness that exists between departments and fellow employees.  I was fired twice from this employer; once because I wanted to volunteer to help out at my church, the second was three weeks after their corporate office required me to be re-hired because my dismissal was against their policy, and I was subsequently written up for 'mistakes' that I apparently produced (most of which I was not there for; fired first time).  While there are quality employees there, I would not advise anyone to seek employment there unless there is no other choice.  Impossible to get any kind of hours there."
good,"A typical day of work could be this... I changed your schedule last night why aren't you here? Oh no, I didn't think to call to tell you that I changed your schedule. Then when you get to work you get a write up. Oh than if you catch a employee cheating the company by using sales and coupons that have expired you will be set up to be fired because he happens to be the lead tech manager. I guess that would be the hardest part of the job. Most enjoyable part, I worked there for a long time before that guy was hired and promoted and started stealing my sales and plans. The stealing started before the promotion. Oh and I was a top tech sales person and the district manager seemed to appreciate that. Anyway today I turn in my shirts and look for employment where someone wants a employee that likes to sell and do well."
good,the gm of the place treated me poorly and made my work experience a nightmare. the other management treated me well and its sad i have to leave. had to inform corprate of problems that have been going on and was not changed. greatful for the other too managers but the gm made it a bad place to work at.
good,"Unexpected job duties not attainable"
good,"Duck your head, don't call hr or you will be threatened. I worked in 2 different stores where the bosses had slept with employees and given them favortism. Don't let then write you up for stuff you didn't do. An example would be, being off work with pneumonia and getting written up for something that happened because you weren't there."
good,"I can only base my review on the store I work in. The management in my store sucks. Very rude to employees and customers. Constantly have problems with scheduling and other store problems. The pay, hours, and results they want does not add up. You get no recognition when you are doing right, only get told everything your doing wrong."
good,"their priorities is their numbers and not their workers. some locations are different than others, the one i was at was fast paced with rude customers."
good,"Stress"
good,Staples was great until we got the new manager who is verbally abusive to the crew members and then makes fun of people. Like he did me when I had a heart attack and nervous break down due to his unwillingness to work and refused to help in my department or anywhere when needed.
good,"It is a good place to work if you really want a part time job.  You can learn some good stuff, and take advantage of the discounts.  Other than that it is a high turn over business."
good,"The company over the past decade has been through ups and downs and changed management frequently. Becuase we now are a private company there have been drastic changes made since Christmas 2017, including the resignation of the CEO and the company's future is really hanging in the balance. I have had amazing and wonderful opportunities to grow and gain valuable experience including getting my Associate's Degree while working here, but I think there is too much chaos and change, creating a lot of nervous employees and insecurity on what the future holds for the company as we look to the future."
good,got fired for making a single mistake. months later I read an article in the local newspaper someone from the store stole 7000 and I was just a casualty while they were trying to weed out the real culprit.
good,nothing the have closed.. they way they told  the employee on how they were closing and still hiring was not fair  to the person that were hired. it was very unfortunate.
good,Salary expectations never realized.   The promise of opportunities to advance were not true.  The promise of opportunities to work on tech bench full time after some retail sales experience were not true.
good,"The pay was not very good and the hours were not good also. I did lots of customer service, cashier work and stocking shelves, and doing inventory. overall I didn't work there long."
good,you feel that you are just a number and they treat you  that way . If you want tell human resources your supervisor will make you feel in a way way to go and not say a word
good,I worked in the copy and print center so it was constantly busy since we were close to the United Nations in Manhattan. The customers were very impatient and rude.
good,It is very quick paced. There is not really any time to sit down. The people I work with are great. I enjoy my co-workers very much. There is not a whole lot of room to grow for me. The hardest part of the job would be learning how to multi-task and prioritizing. The most enjoyable part of the job would be learning all the different equipment.
good,"I stocked shelves, managed cash at cash register. I helped customers find merchandise throughout store. I cleaned the store's bathrooms. Made sure inventory was properly stocked."
good,I worked here for two years and it was the hardest but most rewarding experience of my life. It thought me that you can not please every customer. As well as even when you are not appreciated you must do you job at the best of your ability.
good,Not really a great place to be at.  You don't have a set  schedule of what time your going in everyday or what time you will be leaving .  When it a day to work overtime they will let you know a hour before your 8 hours is up...
good,the store has too much work and the management was bad at giving positive or negative feedback. they really needs to change the management at this location
good,"I've never felt so disrespected in my life. The manager was the rudest most hateful human being Ive ever ran into in my life. She never talked to anyone with respect, she always demanded things be done. It is understandable that you are the boss but this is Staples that the U.S Navy."
good,"My day consists of associates who like to argue over everything."
good,"Productive busy atmosphere, poor management, decent pay, friendly staff, not enough hours, job requires multitasking and often working alone due to poor scheduling and the fact that the store is understaffed"
good,management at the facility in which worked was terrible. there were no benefits for anyone but full time employees. there was little to no organization anywhere within the company. they have a very high turn over rate do to the in effectiveness of training and selection of employees.
good,"I learned how to pick things up and put them down at the Staples Warehouse and that is it. I have also learned that power put into the wrong hands can cause mass disruption in a company. This should be a place to work only for people looking for a short term job. It puts a toll on you physically and the management does nothing but talk down to you. The best part of the job is the fact you're purely on your own and you just go about your work. The worst part is you are treated as a number, not a human."
good,"it's just another big business job. no opportunity to move up. You're no longer a tech, you're just a sales guy. The pay is horrible and you're job is always on the line if you don't sell"
good,"was usually busy but not too eventful.  i learned how to build furniture, how to sell items using customer service, how to shrink rap and use a box compressor.  i never really interacted with management too much during the co-op program.  my co-workers where very friendly and helpful.  hardest part of my job was trying to help customers find certain items in the store that where not labeled in the isles. the most enjoyable part of my job was learning how to build the furniture."
good,"The job is quite routinely, depending on what department you are placed. I am placed in the busiest department with the most stock and customer to tend to. A typical day would include pre-sorting delivery for myself and others in training, putting delivery out on shop floor, coming on tills when needed, selling reward ad business accounts, and serving customers. The managers give good direction as well as helping out the associates with delivery and customers when they are available to do so. My co-workers work well as a team and all have a good relationship.  Skills i've learnt whilst being at this job involves time management, data input,stock control/replenishment, and a development of communication skills. The hardest part of the job is doing the delivery in the given time as there is always the same set time limit regardless of how much delivery has arrived. The mod enjoyable part is interacting with customers."
good,SDtaples has changed and they do not respect their employes and screwing everyone over.
good,"When I worked for staples it was ok a lot of hard work. Computers, cleaning , sales"
good,"I am unimpressed with the store-level scenario regarding management restructuring and some dismissed concerns brought to the general manager regarding coworker conduct. Until recently, compensation and benefits were better than most in the industry. That is changing. Working there has taught me that I can tolerate more unequal treatment and inconsiderate behavior from superiors than I previously thought possible. My excellent customer service skills have been honed still further by the frenetic pace and lack of aid available to those working directly with customers. We would often joke that the uniform should include roller skates because walking between tasks ate up valuable time. With a few exceptions, my coworkers were good people and willing to work as a team. The team has now been more or less gutted by corporate-mandated restructuring and the store manager's inability to respond thereto effectively."
good,"You will work hard, you will not get raises. You may get promoted to full time, but then you'll work really hard, and no reward."
good,"As the sales lead, I made sure numbers and goals were met. I made sure all the shelf's were stocked and properly priced."
good,"A typical day consisted in opening emails and checking the electronic customer logs (ECL) for orders placed online. Assisting customers with their copy requests. We produced a lot of wide format and ink jet projects. There was always an opportunity to learn new things. Particularly the different filing methods for photographs electronically, and which program to use to open certain files. Management was motivating and worked to train and develop my core competencies. Management lacked the ability to back employees wherein a policy change in store procedure that angered the customer, usually left the employee taking the heat for that customer's dissatisfaction, with the new procedure. My co-workers were always available to assist or offer suggestions. There was really no ""hardest part"" of my job. However, the ""most enjoyable part of my job"" was the interaction with customers. The rich  diversity of the customers was challenging and rewarding."
good,Helped all customers with their copy and printing needs. Enjoyed working with coworkers and enjoyed helping people.
good,A typical day of work would be trying to find something to do to stay occupied.  The hardest part of the job was trying to stay awake and the enjoyable part was interacting with co-workers and educating ourselves on the companies products.
good,On a typical day at work you will come in contact with challanges that will make you go above and beyond. From being at staples I learned to be more people friendly. The management at staples can sometimes be the reason why the job is so stressful. A lot of times the management is placing blame upon associates for things that go wrong during the work day. Mostof the management is friendly and helpful but there is always that one person from management who feels the need to make the work day more stressful. The enjoyable part of the job is that you get to interact with the customers and help them out .
good,"It was a very difficult job, very difficult product to sell. At times I felt like i had to be deceptive to succeed. However after a year or two of working here you feel like you can do anything."
good,"This is a great entry level job that will act as a bridge between beginner retail and professional work. There are many metrics to meet, strict rules to follow, and very detailed expectations to meet."
good,"We once had a great Management team. Then about 2 months ago they moved them to another store and we apparently landed the rejects. The new manager spends her time gossiping with other Supervisors. Schedules people out of their availability,  there's never anyone scheduled to work the floor anymore, during back to school season. We got a whole 1% raise."
good,"The part-time employees are amazing, the management staff is a joke. Pay scale for supervisors is, in many cases, less than part-time associates. Don't work here if you want to make a living wage."
good,"Was a great experience, I got them through a busy season. Staff was great most times as a team. Management could improve on the trickle effect of how a team runs, and proper training before going out on the floor would help many in future. "
good,"In my interview I was promised that if I stayed at minimum wage for 1 complete year that I would be able to get a substantial raise and be able to make the wages I was requesting. When my year was up, my review went very well with a lot of positive comments but the raise they wanted to give me was 5 cents. It was a slap in the face for the time and effort I had given. I would always accept to cover shifts for people that called out sick or just didn't show up."
good,"Too much working in other departments(ones that i have not trained in) and do not pay any extra. The pay is NOT worth the stress and headaches caused by working their. Constantly feeling like if you do not make a good sale with every customer, your jo was in jeopardy."
good,I was only hired on as a temporary employee.  Management was understanding and helpful.  The workplace culture was not very friendly and difficult to form teamwork.
good,Staples is good for college students as this place is not a very time consuming or labor intensive job. Do not recommend for long-term job as not much room to move up inside the store.
good,"I was never comfortable at work only because I did not feel like I could grow from just being a cashier because I was never given opportunities to learn how to do other operations. Also if I would meet my requirements for selling a promotion we would have in store, I was never given what was promised."
good,"With the new higher-ups at Staples, came a new overly competitive attitude. They wanted to change too much in too little of a time frame. Also the management needs to be reevaluated."
good,"I would never tell anyone to work at this facility. If you are not a suck up, you will not get very far in the company. Also, I seen so many hourly people come and go because performance. The bar is set very high."
good,Alot of people working at this company and lots of different positions. Compensation and benefits were very good compared to most companies. The hours and shifts were bad especially having a kid and adding in the mandatory overtime
good,"I enjoyed working at Staples when I was working there, but the manager was so unprofessional, he was rude and wasn't willing to really work with me. I couldn't call in if I was feeling sick I was pregnant at the time and worked nonstop."
good,A decent job to start at when you're young but that's it. Horrible corporate decisions have thrown Staples into the ground. Management is hit and miss
good,"A job with higher expectations than pay, and an overall toxic work environment. Breaks were frowned upon and being available to come in on a moment's notice no matter how you were scheduled is the expectation, despite the lack of available hours for associates. Expectations were sometimes contradictory and there was nothing in the way of training or consistent management."
good,"short hours very push when come to new and old items getting sold"
good,ok company to work for. I do not want to add a review about this company because I do not have anything I want to see about the company I have worked for.
good,The manager wouldn't hire more staff for the store. There were times when we had only three people to run the whole store. The manager would get upset if we left after 11 pm when we had to clean the whole store with not enough people to do the closing.
good,no balance in work hours. very physical demanding. managment does not work well with employees. does not recognize employees that go the extra mile. lots of turn over
good,After achieving 4th largest growth in the nation in Technical services my bonus check was a staggering $5 dollars before taxes. This was because the store as a whole did not meet its overall sales goals.
good,"This is a job with a highly corporate atmosphere. So it is what it is."
good,not always know what to learn or advance to same work every dayno vision presented for future activities. communication between supervisors and worker minimum
good,I think its a typical sales job.  Long hours with a lot of standing.  Selling plans is a must.  Management will work with you on your schedule.  Does offer some benefits.
good,"I had 3-4 bosses neither had a similar idea of my job and how it should be handled, was never given proper training(certificates/training seminars).  Manager consistently skirted her job and even avoided situations that in my opinion demanded the General Manager to take care of."
good,Even though this was a summer job during my younger years. I did not enjoy the management here as they did not offer good training and chance of growth were pretty low.
good,Pay is horrible and there is so much work with no organization. I would recommend to work at staples if you needed a job but other than that don't do it.
good,I worked in the copy center.  Lots to learn but fair amount of training.  I have no desire to return there but it is good for people in school.
good,"Days tended to be rough and busy but it made for a short work week. The hardest part was the the other employees in my department weren't willing to work with me on getting the work done. They always called out and never showed up, basically it was a mess for only me to clean up."
good,i love working in the copy and print department.But the pay isn't worth the bad attitude you deal with from impatient customers.Maybe if you are a copy and print supervisor it may be worth it.But regular copy center employees are minimum wage......Its just not worth the money to be mistreated.
good,"Very stressful environment. Loss prevention was a daily routine."
good,"Very poor management.Co workers are great."
good,Don't get paid enough for all the things we have to to at this job. I have plenty of job experience but it doesn't seem to matter they start everyone at a low pay.
good,"Cashier , low on employees , hardest part of the job is to get customers to sign up for rewards , management is kind of unorganized and rude, I enjoy the hours,"
good,"Part-time employees get 15 minute break in 5 1/2 hours. Nose to the grind all day long. Feel more like a slave rather than a place of employment. Have a 2 minute walk to break and 2 minute back to your job. but you don't leave your job till bell goes off and have to be back when 15 minutes up. Actually you get 11 minutes in 5 1/2 hours. management walks around like guards all day no talking, if you go to water fountain they look at you like your crazy. Worst place I ever worked.."
good,"The knowledge I obtained in Professional Technology Product Sales, Retail Staff and Merchandise Management and Building Business Relations were instrumental to professional growth."
good,"My typical day at work consistent of a chart with specified detailed tasks that needs to be completed by an estimate time. My tasks would consist of Customer service, inventory, make sure all merchandise is put on sales floors, keep sales floor cleaned, greet customers, and ensure the satisfaction to our customers.The management is really laid back and also power hungry demanding so much to be done yet they don't put the effort themselves. Hardest part of the job is fulfilling our tasks on sheet which is timed while also helping out customers on sales floor ( office supplies) and helping the customers for the department of furniture as well. Enjoyable part of work was time would go by fast and schedule was good since i would by leaving work by 2pm."
good,"A typical day at work includes sales and merchandising, coaching, repairing and installing computer components. Also, signage must be kept up to date, and correct. Since I have been working for this company, I have learned that the value of an employee is measured by how many hours they are willing to work by doing other jobs that are not related to their job title. Employee development and promotions are extremely difficult, and may take a very long time for many associates."
good,"most of the management does not support you."
good,"A typical day at work was trying to keep busy. I cannot say I learned a lot on the job except where some of the stock was located on the sales floor. "
good,Serve as Cashier
good,Good enviriment to work. Metrics based company. Sales driven organiztion
good,The management staffwas very poor. I went to them in regards of harrasment I was experiencing and I was made out to look like a liar.
good,"Some stores are great and have good management in place, but the store I was in had a very verbally abusive manager, and even when reported to HR, the problem continued to persist."
good,There is not job security there. The managers watch over you like a hawk. The co-workers are like a family. The hardest part of this job is the amount of gray areas in evaluating us and they stopped all the incentives to reward the associates and just expected the associates to just want to not miss.
good,Uncomfortable environment to work in & requested to fulfill non-job related task.
good,Thee day is long because the customer traffic is very slow especially because I work the evening shift. The management is ridiculous and they don't train you but get upset when you don't understand something
good,"Let me begin by saying, my co-workers were all great people, and really good at their jobs. I had at most 3 good managers, and unfortunately they are all gone from the company. The others were bad at leading people, bad at treating employees like people, and decent at their job in terms of sales. I would go in do my job, and leave. The management did not make me want to come back to work during the hectic times. I had managers ask me to stay longer, but I would rather not stay and come in the following day. Of course this was before my managers were forcing us to take breaks, and leave when your time came up. The three years I worked there, I have seen at least 2 mass quitting. I'm talking a majority of the store leaving. I can safely say it's not because of the Back to school crowd, it was all because of the managers. The best part of working there was most definitely my coworkers. They made an annoying soulless job easier."
good,Good first job but bad management who made me feel bad for leaving the company for something else after my friend quit. Bullied my friend until she quit and racist
good,"I really enjoyed working for Staples for my first year with my management team! Then, out of nowhere, management changed and now we have a horrible, inconsiderate and downright rude manager. He is insensitive (despite publicly declaring the opposite), disrespectful and talks down to people (including even the UPS staff). He deliberately preys on insecurities and anxieties to promote disciplinary action with unjust cause, then pressures you into having conversations you would rather not have. Management makes or breaks a company and judging by the 3 recent vacancies after the arrival of new management, I would say this speaks for itself. Find a store with good management if you plan to stick around."
good,Staples is not a career is is more of a get in save your money get some experience and get out! They do not care about their employees only the 10’s of thousands of dollars you need to make them per week!
good,"The company itself is good and cares about their employees. However, their hiring and training for store management is horrible. I have worked in three different locations and they're all the same. You won't be treated well and you won't be paid well even as you're promoted beyond minimum wage."
good,I was supposed to be in the print department and instead once i got there they put me as a cashier. Manager was rude and had an attitude problem. If manager didn’t like you she lowered your hours alot.
good,"Staples is transforming, but at a very slow pace, and with no inclusion of the employee experience in the mix.  Tasks are continually added and labour continually cut back."
good,After working for the company for 14 years it’s time for a change it used to be a good place to work but not so much now
good,It's not worth it unless you live close the management sucks and its stressful everyday because they dont know how to properly manage. Everyday it's something different they want to try and you dont get it your basically done
good,"Working in the Print & Marketing means that nothing is typical.  If you are opening shift, you make sure all machines are ready to go, and dive in with the first job needed and/or customer who needs help.  Mid-shift you just jump in and help the opener with jobs in progress as well as assisting customers.  Closing shift, you complete production jobs assist customers and stock machines.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with some co-workers who are hard to work with or do not have the aptitude, lack customer-service skills, are rude to customers and/or are just plain bossy.  Also when customers complain, management will 100% always side with the customer (even if the customer is obviously incorrect/volatile).  The other part that is very difficult is dealing with people who do not even want to try the copiers for one copy, which is basically keeping you from production as well as not making deadlines.  Management provides mixed messages as far telling you to as keep the customer happy, but don't spend more than 5 minutes helping in self-serve helping them.  The best part is the creative aspect, assisting the majority of great customers, and the fast-pace makes the shift go by quickly."
good,"I had some nice co-workers there. That's for sure. At the same time, there were some nasty one's that looked at you weird when you made a sale. There was a lot of pressure, right off the bat. It was fun helping customers, but not as fun trying to push them to get something they don't want/really need to reach a target."
good,"Man lernt sehr schnell und sehr viel, in eigener Verantwortung wird auch viel Raum für eigene Ideen und gestalten der Verkaufsfläche geboten"
good,Initial training is a joke. You're shadowing top performers and expected to catch on. Books of business changed far too often. Staples didn't allow for actually managing the books of business.  They were more concerned with KPI's.  Compensation plans changed at least 4 times in a couple years.  It's a hot mess. Sycamore Partners bought Staples and it's starting to get back on track.  A lot of realignment and cutting down on workforce.
good,"Staples has been in a constant state of flux for the past few years.  The current work environment is not very positive due to too much uncertainty and fewer opportunities to advance professionally than were available in the past.  Employees are being asked to do more work, for the same money. No pay raises or yearly bonuses have been given in the past few years, yet layoffs have almost doubled the amount of work expected"
good,"They don't really care about you as a human, only the numbers you get them. High stress, high turn over in this location as well. I also noticed that very few females work there, I wonder if they left due to the same pressure put on them.."
good,higher management barley came in and when they did they seemed  very negligent in day to day operations thus resulting in huge misuse of company time and inability to get and maintain work.
good,"Long days. Not paid enough. Upper Management pushes ridiculous metrics. Long hours. Not enough Staff. "
good,Management is very unprofessional. They are not family oriented. Don't care about the workers only the work. Not enough fans in the summer. U work under strained situations.its cold in the winter and you never know when you will get off work
good,"Working in copy and print we had our waves of busy times but no matter what the project was my supervisors always felt a need to criticize any aspect of the entire process, making it difficult to feel motivated to want to produce more."
good,"I moved to Virginia in effort to seize opportunity, what I saw was management excited to literally end people's careers and bring new blood. I worked 12 hour days 5-6 days out of the week. Work was fast paced and competitive to say the least. There was a lot of bad attitude and habits. Everyday at Staples you felt expendable and if you didn't perform well enough to their expectations you were replaced. I was all too eager to leave that place behind. In fact, they sold all their assets to taylor communications."
good,"Fast Paced Environment"
good,Raises are not even the cost of living and don't even cover the increases each year to medical benefits.  Casual work environment and they allow shorts in the summer.
good,"Company was a strong good company, but too many people were promoted that didn't follow the intended Rising Star Program path. They had openings, but already had people in place for roles."
good,"This was a really poor job because the compensation was very low and the management at my location was incredibly rude and unsupportive. The issues with management led to high turnover, poor sales for the store and a general discontent throughout the store. It was not an enjoyable experience."
good,"A typical day at Staples would start out pretty slow. At noon throughout the week days it will usually start moving faster. While there I learned how to operated registry and process customer purchases with the utmost courtesy and in a pleasant manner. I did not have a good experience with management. In my opinion they were quite lazy and at times extremely disrespectful employees. They ere also very inconsiderate of everyone's time by not allowing you to take a brake or leaving important things for you to do until the last minute before you are scheduled to leave  The hardest part f the job was dealing with difficult customers and trying to stay calm at those moments. The most enjoyable part of the job interacting with my coworkers, they made the time pass quickly."
good,Had a good group on employees but management isn't trained in all aspects and is unwilling to support the team fully. I often found myself in need of a manger to fully provide a customer solution and they were unwilling to respond.
good,Besides management the customers make you hate this job> Too the fact being the pay is so low and the hours an=rent nothing . it makes you dread it. they only care about who can cover a shift . they really can caeless if you have an emergency.
good,I've learned a lot in staples in the past 4 years and i will say its a great place to work but im not happy about the raises and security or the company. Theft is our biggest threat since we don't have no security. Talking to customers and making the sale is one of my greatest strengths. The management is good to a point and can be improved.
good,A day working at staples can be either calm or chaotic within seconds. I learned never to expect the best or good from the people I worked with in order to avoid disappointments. The management was tolerable. Hardest part of the job is working with co-workers who find it easy leaving undone projects behind while leaving no notes on what needs to be done.
good,"Nothing worth going crazy over, positively or negatively. The company honors their commitment to paying you as well. There are plenty of opportunities that are better, this is exactly what it is...a job."
good,I was trying to gain computer experience which could lead to a better paying job in the IT Field. But Staples IT department which I'm referring to the Easty Tech's arnt a 100% IT Technicians. I was the lead IT Technician at my store but the other 2 Technicians did not have like any experience working on computers. Most of the jobs were done by me and when I was on shift I was required to oversea the floor as well and constantly pulled away from working and fixing the computers. We had a deadline of so many day from when a computer had to be serviced. It was hectic juggling between helping people on the store and running the cash register when the line was busy and then finding time to fix computers in a 6 hour shift.
good,Organizeing and Stocking office supplies at every aisle. I learned how to communicate well with customers. I enjoyed helping customers with fast friendly services.
good,discussion in meetings but never put forth a plan to resolve problems.  They just move on and the same thing happens day after day.  Never a plan of action for improvement.  They hire people without any experience and a lot of people that are temps
good,"The management was poor, they  were not there to provide guidance . No advancement was available, the work hours and stress to preform at peak was stressful. the building was never a climate controlled  building"
good,"Hours change, days change, pay sucks, little stability, understaffed and overworked. I can't stress enough I would not recommend this job to anyone unless they were my enemy."
good,"At the current location of Staples that I work at, I find myself underwhelmed and lacking motivation. Getting rewarded for a job well done is a rare thing, especially when the tasks you do might be some that are hard to notice. There is a lack of training and not enough meetings to discuss expectations."
good,Working at staples was one of the worst jobs Ive had so far. Only one manager made my stay worth while. At first I did look foward to going to work then after a while it just got on my nerves having to go to work there. I did not like it at all.
good,I worked at the Clifton Park location after transferring from another store. The store was cool. But the managers have filthy mouths to the younger crowd that works there. They need and want jobs because they are high school students so they take the foolishness! But the managers DO NOT have to talk to them in the manner that they do.
good,Too much stress being here. Customers are always rude. management has no idea what they are doing and never properly trained you for your job. They push too much to pressure customers to buy protection plans that don't even work and making them register for store credit card and lie about how low their credit score could go down
good,"manager has his favorites and favorite certain associates over others, doesn't care about all associates very rude to them and ignores their questions he's happy only if he gets good numbers for BPH and KIP ,  flirts a lot with younger women and makes them uncomfortable and they wont complaint due to them needing their jobs"
good,"Employees lacked the fundamentals of work lines and pay was not enough.  Not through training which was inadequate and unfit for the work.  "
good,"Deals with lots of customer service and catering to businesses, gained experience to bring with me in the future. Hardest part of the job was dealing with the poor management. Most enjoyable part was seeing repeat customers."
good,"The typical day at Staples Warehouse results in the equipment breaking every night and at least six thousand orders in print. Working at Staples Warehouse, I have learned how to pack the boxes correctly and pick the right products. The management is the worst. Once you try and talk to them, the managers just shake their head and do not follow through with anything. There is too much favoritism. The hardest part of the job is when something breaks down, it is very hard to complete the orders in a certain time. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the people I work with."
good,Very depressing environment. The managers were quite mean and the other associates did not enjoy working there. I was also paid less for being an easy tech because they switched my departments without proper training.
good,the store manager is very unprofessional and likes to talk down to people. the hours suck and they want you to be involved even when you're not on the clock
good,"Doesn't care much for employees.  Does not take employees feedback overly serious.  Long hours and workload with little to no appreciation. "
good,"Okay place not really a career. Management is okay. it doent pay enough in my opinion, but no retail pays enough to deal with crazy customers. People are unbeleivable"
good,"The best part of this job was placing product on the shelves. Setting up polygrams, exciting new products. Used a hydro jack to move items off trucks. Some truck drivers were very nice and helped remove items onto the warehouse. Lots of reports to do everyday, products in too many different areas. Lots confusion if a customer asked a question while taking count of items. Computer needs to be updated, lots of steps for one report. Not enough help on the floor. Get called for many different task, If I was putting stock away, called to help with cashiering, or go to get an order which was placed on line. Very confusing. Unable to complete one task at a time."
good,"Horrible company if the management is bad, ok company if management is good. I had the unfortunate experience of the former, and it made me leave my job of 8 years."
good,Loved the customers and learning about the numerous ways to make life easy. I was recognized for employee of the month and many other sales achievements.
good,I've worked for this company for years and have dealt with poor management from supervisors. But overall it is a great place to work in terms of pay and hours.
good,Decent job for someone straight out of high school or extra money in college. Small store feel. Not much potential for career
good,"Staples was an okay place for a part-time job. The idea of moving ahead within the company or getting any type of full-time employment seemed unlikely, and nearly impossible. While the managers worked with us, it was hard for them to ensure the rest of the team was working as well. This lead to getting all the worked dumped on to a couple of people. The hours were choppy, and not consistent. It made having a social life very difficult."
good,"The store manager is a great guy, the other two managers are friendly a very helpful. But the sales floor manager looks like she 40 but acts like shes 17. she has her Fav 4 people that she goes out her way to make sure they get all the hours and they make they most overtime when everyone else would be pulled into the store managers office for going in to overtime. The best part of the job was the customers and helping out the store manager. But Staples CEO should look in to his store and so called managers."
good,Typical Retail Job 10% of the staff does 100% of the work and the remaining staff does nothing but gossip and blame others for there problems.
good,loved the people hated the job constantly changing its policies and benefits.I was with the company for 5yrs the first 3 months i got 3 raises then at the end the most i got from a raise was .17 cents. The last straw was when a highschooler fresh out got paid the same amount as me when ive been there for five yrs when asked for a raise or compensation i was declined manger said i had to wait til next yr for a promotion.
good,It was a great position to learn new jobs to do in the warehouse. I became a certified forklift operator with this company.
good,"Part time staff are usually given 4 hour shifts. The reason for this is to avoid giving staff a paid break. The wage at Staples is the bare minimum for all employees. "
good,"Took up a job as an associate. There is very little guidance in the store. You come in, do your job, and not much of a return other than a paycheck. "
good,"was lured in for possible job growth, but the management team in any store barely did anything and held the supervisors accountable for running the store, meanwhile the supervisors are there to help the management team manage"
good,"They are a good and stable company.  Associates and management are fun to work with.  I came from the corporate world, time management is key in this type of establishment."
good,A typical day at work is managing several orders and one time. Balancing old time lines and creating new ones for first time customers. I learned to constantly think on my feet and how to create a very detailed priority list. Generally we work one person in copy center at a time and we interact on a very limited basis with the other employees due to always being busy. The hardest part of the job is cleaning up after a fellow co-worker who has failed to preform their job efficiently.
good,"It's the typical hostile retail job. The management didn't care for the employees and would reprimand us for the slightest complaint. With ever present threats of getting written up or ""corporate"" coming down on ""us,"" every day felt like I was stepping into a mine field of shame and discouragement."
good,"I love computers and technology. I really enjoyed working on the tech side, but I hated working in office supplies. The company requires great performance from its staff, but is not willing to compensate for it."
good,Staples is a high stress work environment and the stress is not worth the pay until I transferred stores I would revive text messages at home about the store which was never  part of my job contract I could never leave the store at the store bit would always follow me home and the store I worked at before the transfer was not mange well.
good,"Wonderful way to get foot in door and experience under your belt if you've never had a job before. Very slow business now a days. It can be harsh not to have a single client for the long hours you work. No advancement opportunities. They will promise it for years on end. Prominent employee of 12 years got a -slight promotion shes been vying for upon 13th year of work.... Low pay otherwise, for hours worked"
good,Work is very busy everyday and I am an excellent multi-tasker and I can work in a fast paced environment. I do not have a hard part to my job but the most enjoyable part is working with different customers.
good,Staples has taught me how to manage multiple projects at once and prioritize tasks while still giving outstanding customer service. I have learned how to overcome obstacles and make sure the customer receives the necessary information to insure they are making a well informed decision on their product and/or services. Staples requires all of its employees to meet a minimum weekly sales driven goal and others more depending on department. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I help a customer find the information they need because I asked the right questions and get the customer into the product or services that are right for their needs.
good,"This was my first job i was 16 and in high school, so i was excited about working and making my own money. I washed dishes and ran the cash registers, took orders. i learned that i was doing a lot of labor for min wage in 2006. management was not the best, co workers was fun and very helpful. the hardest part was being 16 having to work late and get up the next morning for school trying to complete homework you couldnt finish on the bus or on your 30 min lunch break. the enjoyable part was just to have a job and keep customers coming back so i can get another pay check!!"
good,"A typical day at Staple is busy  with calls from the customer and meeting. you will have a lot of conference call and  a lot of research. "
good,As per last Staples review as returned to them at a later date.  Nice people - salary lets them down making you feel undervalued
good,the company is a good one to work for but the hours are minimal and I need more than 24 hours a week.  A typical day at work is standing at the register for the entire shift checking people out.  i don't get to move around a lot so it can get boring.  The most enjoyable part of my job are the people that I work with.
good,"Retail Job."
good,"Same managers, poor culture. Knit picking and micromanaging. Under valued employees. Zero tact."
good,No room for advancement and more concerned about dress code than fixing customer's computers.
good,"A typical day working as a Copy and Print Associate at Staples began with clocking in and talking with my co-workers to find out the necessary information on any print order details they took in that I would be finishing up. For the rest of my day I would produce copies and prints for customers as they came into the store or submitted orders on our website or through email submission. The managers at my store did not know how to do any of the work in my area so they were never very helpful, they didn't give me enough training before I was left by myself in the Copy and Print Center to work  and figure things out as I went. I enjoyed the work I did as a Copy and Print associate and I liked my customers. I did not get work with my co-workers very often, only one Copy and Print Associate worked the second shift. The hardest part of the job was working without enough training. Because I worked alone most days I had no one to ask if I ran into a task I was unfamiliar with, and since no one else was trained in the Copy Center besides the person working the shift I sometimes didn't get my breaks on time; if at all. The most enjoyable part of my job was creating prints, from business cards to enlarged photos, I enjoyed printing beautiful graphics that made the customers happy."
good,I got to help the drivers with merchandises and load the truck. I also enjoyed exploring the city of new york.
good,I worked for this company for 13 years and they changed there ways and made things harder on the managers and associates in the end and the sad thing is there customer service ended up suffering because of it
good,This company has a very high turn over of employees due to lack of training and management skills.
good,Management lacks perfessionalism and knowledge of store procedures all across the board. Their training process of new hires and the continuing training of employees is a joke. In this company its figure it out yourself and hope you catch on quick. Management also has very poor communication skills between management and associates. Management belittles employees as well as loyal and future customers on a regular basis. These are the reasons as to why over the past serveral years Staples of Athens has had such a high employee turnover rate.
good,"High stress, low pay, finding responsible team members next to impossible."
good,Fast paced environment with not enough help to complete tasks. Dicsrtict Management and higher do not acknowledge good hard work with tools provided
good,"A typical day at work is helping customers, assessing needs and helping them find exactly what they were looking for."
good,Go to work doing same task everyday easy work. Management placed certain rules like when a selective few employees can take there break/lunch ect. Also vulgar launguage was used to demand what employers should do. So i say not professional.
good,"This place, although I was seasonal, was not a place I may want to work at again. It's slow and some of the employees are not an ethical bunch. I didn't like watching the techies dig through the private computers of others to talk about things they found. The management also seemed to care little about the fact that their employees stood around talking about World of Warcraft all day."
good,As previously stated management turnover is high. This is a very by the book company. They do not hesitate to write you up or fire you for anything.
good,"Staples only has a short period of the year when they are busy, back to school. So for most of my time there, it was horribly slow and the hours dragged on.  But the sense of community and openness everyone had made things a little better, we were all friends and were always able to chat with one another."
good,"Staples was a good company to work for straight out of high school. They only offered 20hours a week. Overall my coworkers there were great, but management was unprofessional."
good,"not very exciting experience, slow most of the time and i dont think stocking shelves for a couple hours and day and then standing there is very fullfilling"
good,"The job was stressful, but with the right staff, it was fun. Management went down hill which is why I left. I do miss it. I would recommend because it was a good experience to have."
good,they doon't know how to treat they're employee's. they speak to them disrespectfully.cashier's barely get a break to eat. they managers are disrespectful.
good,"The company wants you to do well as a cashier, but other employees don't want to ring at a register even though management says they are supposed to, I'm burnt out do to this"
good,"The particular store I worked at had little customer traffic, and will close next year."
good,"I put a valiant effort on establishing and designing a selling culture in my tech department, along side my Sales Manager. Due to the previous supervisor in my role I also had to redesign how the operations in my department were executed. Day to day operations were atrocious. We were able to lift the department to having consistent celebrations about goals being met. The culture in the tech department is heavily sales driven. Sometimes it seemed like the customers best interest was not in mind, so the hardest part of the job would be coaching the associates through the ""No's"" they would here from customers, because they would worried about discipline. However, I would show gratitude for the behavior itself and conduct role plays to help overcome similar situations in the future. "
good,Way to much favoritism if you weren't a yes {butt kisser } they did not want to deal with any issues you might had one manager was great but the two you have to work under are terible it is there way or nothing they made it very diffacult to work there certain days if you were ones they liked then they listened to your issues if not you were treated wrong
good,"-You learn through the success and failure of the team."
good,"Ive seen the pay scales and you are all better off elsewhere, the minimum pay at least in Illinois is starting at minimum wage of $9 Tech associates start at $9.95 an Inventory Specialist's pay scale is, Minimum $9.70, Midpoint, $11.00 Maximum $13.55 which is FAR BELOW anywhere else. You do a lot of extra extra work and heavy lifting by your self. Its not worth it at all."
good,"Got experience with customer service, Usually was the one with the most credit card applications, learned what offices usually need. Met a lot of great people."
good,An environment filled with dedicated associates looking for ways to provide customer satisfaction even if it required extra work and time to achieve it
good,"I've been working a part-time copy and print employee for almost a year. the management has suffered and decreased in quality through the time I've spent working here. The hours, especially in my personal staples, are terrible. They change them without consent or a heads up and everyone seems to just treat this as the norm. And working there is a no mistake type of environment with strict repercussions. Maybe that's just specific to the management team in my store but I hear that many of the surrounding staples in our area operate poorly as well. I do understand my position as a print and marketing associate is a high-stress position. But I do feel like this is something many can get around once you know how to handle and deal with the downright awful array of customers print and marketing have the pleasure to serve. (not everyone is evil but you get a very hefty amount of mean people who outweigh the normal customers. People want their prints!) It's a decent first part-time job but not a great full-time position."
good,"Each store manager is able to interpret the management of the store in their own way, particularly if they meet sales targets."
good,I started as a receptionist and was promoted to Payroll Coordinator.  I learned a lot from my HR Manager but then the culture changed and it wasn't a good place to work any longer.
good,"More responsibility for a $2 premium"
good,Staples can be a great company to work for if they would get District Managers that are trained to do their jobs right. Human Resources is a mess at this company. When you report an issue to HR they go tell others and it’s back to store level with everybody knowing
good,"How can you go about someone who did their job by completing it and yet having to stick around to help the other departments who lack in the work area, or are slow pickers, or just individuals who lack at everything because this job isn't for everyone. Staples has a thing called BPH, Boxes per hour. meaning you have to scan and pick a quantity to meet their standards. Now there would be individuals who surpassed their standard goal and their where those who did not but they still didn't care about making the job fair to everyone. The culture area of this company was nice people, but there was some racist people inside the company."
good,"no advancement, poor hours, limited hours, poor pay..management was not concerned for employees only the bottom line. assistant manager became verbally abusive."
good,Staples was a great place to work when I was there.  The last few years it started to get harder to deliver because all the pressure to sell a few items.  Then all of sudden there were a lot of managers doing unethical things to hit the numbers.  The company did nothing to the management staff that were doing the unethical behaviors.  It is really tough to work with that mentality.
good,great job to start you off in the world but not a place you want to stay for long. this is an entry level job and should not be considered long term. Run
good,"It was like any other store, they pushed employees to sell product and to try to get customers to sign up for rewards programs and emails. I worked in a college town so it was mostly students who worked there and they were alright."
good,Northing to say worked longs during back to school and holidays. Pay was low and management was not very helpful at times. A lot of kids working so didn't about work.
good,They did not give you room to grow. They passed over a co worker for advance several time and the only way she got it was to transfer to a different store. I was demoted because they changed the qualifications for the job and instead of training me they put someone else is the position who was a key holder but had to learn everythinf else.
good,Would not recommend unless you absolutely love sales. I worked with an amazing group of people but management was really lacking. Corporate kept changing quotas and how we were compensated.
good,"The way things are is that you'll get a certain product shoved down your throat, Liquid Armour."
good,"Where I worked was a startup operation so it offered a lot of opportunities to learn to new things.  We interviewed, hired, and trained the entire staff for the facility."
good,"The store where I worked was closed a couple of years ago, but when i was there, the store manager was awesome.  The two assistant managers would have better served the company by working somewhere else.  The job was fast-paced and you really needed to know your department well to assist customers with accuracy.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with the assistant managers.  Each had their own agenda, and one of them even tried to get employees to do stuff after they clocked out and the store lights went dim.  I learned a good deal about how ""not"" to manage a team."
good,A typical day at work is basically meeting and greeting customers. Assisting these customers with any questions that they have. Management was okay. The work place was always busy due to the fact that there was a college around the area where a lot of students would come. Hardest part about the job was when the store gets busy and we're almost always short handed on staff.
good,"part time student job, ws a pretty good after school job.  Learned a lot about retail and sales.  They trained floor staff on selling and customer service frequently"
good,"Good working environment. Depends on you to get along with your co-workers and your supervisors. Sales quota driven even if you are not in sales position. This may be due to stores competing with each other."
good,"Very demanding, customers was sometimes super rude. Manager always cuts hours and the pay isn't that great. was just a little part time job for me but i loved what I was doing which was the copy and print. the only thing is it would only be 1 person working in that section with a line full of people."
good,"the hours i work are great However, the pay is way to low. Plus they only give yearly raises and they are also very low to nothing. They tend to take advantage of the ones who work hard. By that I mean I started only wanting 3 days a week and now up to 5 days because they can't find anyone to work there for such little pay. I am currently looking for a new job."
good,"A typical work day at Staples would be working to make sales calls, handle customer issues, plan, do reporting to management.  I learned more management type skills.  Staples was not concerned with a work/home balance. They only cared about how much each employee could produce. The constant changing of commission plan and  company initiatives.  Working from home was the best part of the job."
good,On a typical day at Staples you would come in sign in on the computer get a radio check in with the MOD then either create a pull list or deal with truck.
good,"not very supportive when it comes to managment"
good,"There are too many GM's, DM's and above who have been in the same role for 20+ years. There is no opportunity for advancement to justify to part-time associates making just over minimum wage that it is worth it to stick around. Turnover is horrendous. The old school entrenched people have been around since the company was a stack it high let it fly showroom. Upper management is trying to instill a sales culture, but this won't happen without some serious house cleaning."
good,"I was a manager for two years. Staples corporate quite literally have no idea what they're doing and demand more and more giving management less and less tools to give associates hours and therefore meet quotas. I've seen managers crack and break down and quit from understandably lacklustre employees (who wants to work hard when you don't get hours?), vicious customers and even more vicious quotas and somehow even MORE vicious district, regional and loss prevention managers. This job sucks."
good,"This job is retail. If you go into it expecting more than, you're kidding yourself. They even pretty much force everyone to work pretty ridiculous hours during holidays, so you can barely see your family."
good,Terrible experience due to lazy co workers. The management would give out task to be done and spend half hour listening to the easy tech complain about there job and take my co workers to help them leaving me short handed.
good,"Although I enjoyed my time at Staples, this was the most mad and  busiest business I ever worked for."
good,"The atmosphere at staples is similar to working with family. When it came to problems or concerns having to do with other associates or policy it can be hard to be heard. Also getting problems resolved is next to impossible, but the people that work there are great."
good,"Staples is a pretty relaxed job. Sometimes it is busy if there are offices and financial buildings around. Most of the coworkers are laid back. Aisles are long and tons of restocking to do will keep you active."
good,"Staples was a part time job that filled a gap.  It was a time when there weren't any jobs.  Rather than not work, I took what was available which turned out to be working at Staples as a sales associate.  I was happy to have work and put into practice the lessons of my father...do the best you can even if you are cleaning a toilet.  I hated the stocking and the constant pressure to ask customers ""may I help you"".  It felt as if I was harassing them.  When the time came that I let my Manager know that I was leaving, It was reassuring to know that they were willing to offer me more money to stay...I must have done something right...But, sales just was not my thing."
good,"This place is simply cut throat at the leadership level. Everyone preaches teamwork in the meetings but, at the end of the day its every man and department for themselves. Long hours every day and overtime is forced due to staffing"
good,I learned to communicate with different cultures and other people. The difference in prices on certain items. A typical day at work was constant customers in and out.
good,"Starting off at staples was okay at first. Good pay off the bat and a good experience. Although, over time it became stressful and repetitive. The management team made poor decisions, and sometimes it seemed like they didn't know what they were doing. The technology and conveyor systems are old and run down and will ALWAYS break down. Same goes for the equipment given to complete a job. They ask for ideas to make the process run smoother but they will not listen. They are more worried about saving money. The hours are unstable. You never know when you are going on breaks or going home. they will give you lots of overtime when it is needed but at the end of the week they will cut hours so you may not even make 40 hours. It is a good job for a younger person but if you have a life outside of work or a family, DO NOT work here."
good,work there good but the ppl are great  and thts all...also the place is working people coming in out are  buyingng stuff busniess is always good and never noproblems
good,"Kan ikke uttale meg grunnet taushetserklæring"
good,"I used to work in the copy department as a copy operator doing copy of documents, print out files scanning documents, doing fly, customer service answer the phone etc."
good,This is an ideal job for teens or students in college who DO NOT need a stable income otherwise don't waste your time trying to kiss management butt to get up the ranks
good,Majority of my time at staples has been very enjoyable. Recent changes coming from the new ownership has caused a lot of unnecessary stress and worry about job security.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of assisting customers in finding merchandise and making purchases. I learned how to be polite, kind, and have great customer service. Management was posistve, respectful, serious, and calm. The work place was always busy and fast paced. the hardest part of my job was meeting new people and dealing with new and different personalities. The most enjoyable part of the job was experiencing how a retial business operates."
good,"Depending on your location and who you work for , it is either a decent job or horrible one. I worked various locations. One store i loved working at because of the manager and coworkers. The others i disliked for same reason. Its a decent starter job if you need experience. There are chances for advancement into management within the company even if they dont happen often."
good,The hardest part of the job is getting direct precise response to emails and where report that is with another team. Too many systems and not enough explanation on how they work and what changes were made without notice.
good,"Wages were minimal, no advancement opportunities or wage raises.  Compensation for work done is unfair.  The management got on us for not pushing warranty or extra add-on sales, and not servicing every customer."
good,Work about 23 hours a week expect hard labor for no return. Seems like the pay is great but no real career opportunities with this job. I do not like the pay  I don't like the environment.
good,"A typical day at work, is dealing with employees who continually call out sick or do not show up for work at all. Management have little organizational skills and the store falls behind on things that need to get done. There have been huge hour cuts and the employees are required to get more work done with less time to do it."
good,This was a decent job to get started in a B2B sales position.  Company invested a lot of money into their employees for training.  Hardest part of job was cold calling and getting appointments.
good,No matter what you do for this company its never enough.  Starting pay is too low for the bay area so its hard to hire.  When you speak up you get a write up.  They promise and won't delivered.
good,"Cashier, Merchandising, Customer Service"
good,"The coworkers that I had became like family. The GMs kept rotating one after the next because surrounding store kept closing. The GM that would come in to replace the other one would be worse than the one they were coming to replace. We were pushed hard to up sale everything. The corporate monster kept wanting more every day. They started cutting job positions. Mashing 2-3 different people roles into one! Since the GMs were paid on salary, they were more obsessed about their beach vacations than keeping the store in decent shape. The crazy demands from the higher up, rude customers and vacant managers drove many associates to look for other jobs. We didn't have enough employees so we were basically working with a skeleton crew everyday. Worst experience ever!"
good,"Its a great place to start working and the people are wonderful, however the environment and culture of Staples is something that needs attention. The way they go about certaint things in management is off putting to say the least."
good,"It's overwhelmingly hot (workers faint and ambulance has to come for them) and the job is repetitive, boring, tiring, and very competitive. Management is cut-throat and very defensive, they accept 0 suggestions (although they constantly ask for them). Very strict attendance policy that gets applied selectively by HR."
good,"You are constantly going after moving target in terms of sales, such as ink to printer attachment, computer sale add ons, and a variety of other that continuously change to the point that customer service and in stock suffer. "
good,The job position is very reliable with good hours and a moderate amount of training provided to work the job smoothly. The management places work load unevenly between employees and favourites are a common occurrence with disregard to employee performance.
good,"Its an overall good company to work for, the training from my experience wasn't the best but it was easy to learn and pick up. The customers are a little hard to work with at times but this job has taught me patience and understanding."
good,"The management at Staples, at first seemed very together and well organized. But as I started to work there more, it was clear that Staples didn't have their stuff together. The manager had no idea what she was doing and had no idea on how to run a store, and all of her assistant managers were stuck doing jobs that weren't theirs."
good,"Only management gets full time and if you're lucky enough they may inform with any situation that could be difficult."
good,"The job isn't hard to do day in and day out, sure you have some problem customers. But many of my customers I know by name and it's feels like I have become part of their family. The hard part is having Management breath down your neck cause you didn't get something done."
good,"Decent high school job. Current store manager was uncouth and would lie to get a sale only for the sale to return 2-3 days later and then we would have to do a return. It was basic inventory management, customer service and tech support as an Easy Tech. Nothing to write home about and nothing that I would attempt to make a living from."
good,"After working at Staples, I observed it to be a company that is on its last legs, so to speak. The management was not very good; there appeared to be no interest in process improvement; very little room for advancement; and a feeling of discord in the facility."
good,"cashier, built  chairs, put away stock, helped customers with furniture, also ordering from another store transfer, or online ordering, same with pens and other supplies."
good,"The pay is minimum wage but the pace is not overwhelming.  The staff is great, but employee replacements are continuous.  People tend to move on if they find something better."
good,"Prepare projects for printing, document scanning and enhancement from start to delivery.Download jobs from email or print queues, size, sort and finish.Set up quality controls for work accuracy.Reply to first level end user calls to identify problems, run test copies and know machine status.Its good atmosphere for customer service and interacting with customers."
good,"Depends on the day or month a lot of stocking I do everything but cashier,management is very laid back people to work for.co workers are mostly minors.Their are no hardest part of the job except for late August what we call Back To School.The most enjoyable I go at my own pace no pressure."
good,"Continuously train staff, ensure a presentable sales floor, assist customers with technically needs and questions. Improve the sales for the EZ Tech department"
good,"typical day at staples consist of very little communication from management and other figures above. The management positions are held by multiple people with very subpar attitudes and are very hard to get along with. There is very little room for advancement and very little increase in pay, if any at all. There is no type of bonus on any occasion. The enjoyable parts of the job are being on the road alone away from the managers that make you feel threatened for your job."
good,Picking orders into a box. you learn how to record stock. hardest part of job is working 12 hour shifts. enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people]
good,"The managers seemed as if they were bosses, not leaders, and we needed leaders. When in a need of help, they would either not know anything or they would tell you very little. I found it very stressful and it started effecting my personal life."
good,"I would punch in then have to find something to do until they printed out a batch of orders for me to do, usually an hour after I got there.  Then I would try to help other people just so I wouldn't finish my work to early.  If I finished to early then I would have absolutely nothing to do and they might tell me to just go home.  Then I wouldn't get my 40 hours."
good,A job where advancement comes far and few between. The working environment is kool you meet a lot of nice people ..i just dont believe that there is room to progress and advance unless you are already in a management position
good,it was a good place to work the only problem i had was some of the employees didn't care didn't show up on time putting strain on the whole team
good,"Staples is a fun working environment, sometimes. It is often very disorganised and a lot of stress is put onto under payed and over worked managers. As an associate i found that this stress gets released onto me and my colleagues, creating conflict and lack of motivation in the staff."
good,Excellent fortune 500 company. Invests in their employees. Great team of people to work with. Flexibility to work from home. Ability to make a good income.
good,"This job was alright. Nothing great. However, co-workers were nice people. Management was terrible. There wasn't much equality."
good,"At the time I was there we had a crew that just blended great together. Almost all has changed since then but very happy I had my experience there. Fast paced and pressure to meet numbers for district. However, still better that most retail stories I've heard."
good,Staples was a very laid back job. Management was very lack and didn't give much direction. Though after about a week of being there I knew what was expected and didn't really have to interact unless something new was to be done. It was a lot of stocking and rearranging of product. Hardest part of the job was trying to stay busy. I enjoyed my co-workers.
good,"if you are in right team then okay place to work otherwise do not think to join this place. There is no learning path and management doesn't know what needs to be done. It is firing company. People will not respect what skills you have, management can ask you to work on anything. Big NO"
good,Easytech sales combines selling tech products such as routers and printers with the intellectual stimulation of pc repairs.
good,This job was attained when i was still in high school and was never meant to be anything more than a stepping stone. It was good for developing customer service skills and implementing knowledge of IT into the work field.
good,The management was all over the place. It was an interestingly creative job working in the copy center. If you like to work with computers it's a good job to have.
good,"Like any other store, a typical day includes helping customers on the sales floor and stocking shelves. However, there has always been a consistent lack of communication between managers, and more importantly, Corporate. Each manager would assign completely different tasks to a single associate, and then wonder why all of it wasn't completed. They also understaffed the store at the most important times, and it would often lead to all associates staying well over an hour past closing time just to recover the store. As for Corporate, the numerous requests for new or additional equipment such as vacuums, flatbed carts, two-wheel dollies and ladders went completely ignored."
good,"It's a typical retail job. Management forces you to sell, sell, sell & if you don't your hours get cut, that is unless your full time. I have a few really good coworkers, & one manager that is pretty good most of the time. Otherwise management is management, if district is giving them a hard time, then I get what comes after that happens. I'd say the hardest part of my job is the sales, I mean I'm a techie person not a sales person, sure I can do $1000 dollars worth of tech work each week but when budget is $3000 and I'm the only person in my department bringing anyone in, its kinda not gonna go anywhere. As far as enjoyment in my job that only comes from when I get to go do on-sites, or actually tech work, which doesn't exist anymore because we outsource everything to some third party company THE MATRIX... I don't mean to come off as a person who is just negative about my job, like I said it's a typical retail job, and yes its an ok place to work for now."
good,worked in the copy center a lot of stress for what you get paid and you get harassed a lot not worth the stress you have to clean take in orders they are always on you to upsell everything even if the customers flat out tells you no they still yell that you didn't do your best to upsell
good,"Management is pushing the associates to work harder especially the store I work in. For example, my store (Volume B) gets 2 workers at busy times where as other stores (Volume C) get at least 3 workers"
good,"Either you're knowledgeable of the Print business or have a background in Promotional Products or you're willing to spend countless hours learning and ever changing business.  You work hard at finding new ""qualified"" prospects, then ask for permission to sell to them after you've submitted your first order.  Then, lose the customer due to no fault of your own OR you manager won't approve the account and you don't get paid.  It isn't easy and the compensation is $15,000 below what I was told I could earn.  Hopes and dreams you'll ever stay long enough to earn $60K."
good,very up beat on feet from 8 to 12 hours. its all about production and sales. the management is poor they don't care for their employees. the co worker are okay. the hardest part is the time you can be at work half your day and have come back within 5 hours.
good,A typical day involves helping customers find various products throughout the store that fits their every need and checking customers out at the register.
good,"They put too much pressure in every employee to exceed the company expectations, but they don't have any consideration for the employees. We don't receive any bonuses if you make our pace or if we meet the warehouse goals. In summer it gets really hot inside the warehouse, like 115 degrees. They don't want to install a better a/c unit for us. I learned how a Office Supply warehouse works, how to pick customers orders, learned about their computer system. The management don't help the employee like they supposed to. If you have a personal situation, they don't give you advise about what you can do within company policy. I have good co-workers, some of them are willing to go above and beyond helping other co-workers. My hardest part of the job is work for a company who don't appreciate their employees. I enjoy the fact we have music inside the warehouse."
good,Management expects you to pick up slack for other employees without discipling them. Asking for raise is pointless because you will only get about 5 to 25 cent per YEAR. Overall this company only carries for the GM and thats about it.
good,"A typical day at work consists of producing orders, taking orders, customer care, order supplies, call customers, and supervise. I learned different programs on the job. Management was never consistant. I had a new manager every one and half years. The hardest part of the job was so many duties to fullfil for one person. The most enjoyable part was the co-workers."
good,"I loved Staples when I first started there two years ago.  Unfortunately management and the corporate culture changed.  They have done away with full time positions below supervisor and manager, and good luck getting one of those positions.  There are people in my store who have been there for 10+ years just moving into management.  This job is sale, sale, sale.  Forget customer satisfaction and actually doing what you were hired for, just get out there and make your numbers."
good,Management was terrible. You worked extremely long hours including nights and weeks.  Expense budgets were tight.
good,Poor Work environment due to lost merchandise nothing was placed in a specific location poor management.
good,"If you get the right position, such as mobile sales, easy tech, or copycenter, Staples is a great starter job. I had expected more career wise, but there just isn't much opportunity for growth. The pay is low, which is to be expected in retail, and the benefits used to be great, not so much anymore. Compensation for bonuses now comes in the form of Stars Points, or as we call them ""staples fun bucks"", to be used on an online catalog of..junk. No more cash."
good,"- co-workers - nice people"
good,Too many people come and go. No opportunities for advancement.
good,"Staples was my first job coming out of high school. They were a great starter job because they allowed me to gain some work experience and were flexible in their hours so I could attend college as well. A typical day as a cashier at Staples was to clock in and greet the customers and give them a fairwell while providing or directing  them to the service they needed during their visit at the store. The environment was friendly and management good, however, the pay and benefits were limited to full-time staff only. My stay there lasted about two years and ended so I could start branching out into a different field of work, one with more room to grow."
good,"Enjoyed working there and helping customers, the most enjoyable part is when a customer loves the end result of their copy order."
good,"I currently monitor 24 stores in my region to ensure that they are following all company and policy's.  I partner with the DM and RVP to ensure that all stores will meet their shrink goals. I have also been on the DotCom side of the business as well, overseeing fulfillment centers in the northeast region to control loss and shrink in these buildings.  I know how to juggle a lot of balls in the air, as this is part of my job, to make sure that I can deliver positive results."
good,"Poor management;  Poor decision makers kissing up and playing CYA to corporate who are too out of touch with people in the trenches who really know what they're doing.  Corporate talks about contributing ideas and speaking up, but employees are afraid to do so experiencing backlash from direct managers."
good,"I was a cashier for a month before being promoted to Team Supervisor. While I liked the slight pay raise, it was not enough for the amount of hard work I was putting in. If you want to work at a dead-end job, have at it. I loved the supplies Staples sells, but some of the employees and management are just simply...bad."
good,I did not enjoy working for this company. Compensation is very low. No commission for sales yet quota based and highly competitive. Managers have no formal training. Would not work here again.
good,"•	Assist customers in product selection					"
good,"The people that worked at Staples were like family, always there when you needed them."
good,love to assist people with there purchases and sell warranties
good,Great place to work until this past year. Communication between store level and corporate office has broken down in the last year; making it difficult to manage the business efficiently and effectively.
good,"As an employes they are not too bad to work for, phisical and mental job at the same time, doing the floor as well as the scans and invintory"
good,A very typical warehouse job. Very easy. Same thing day in and day out.
good,"People who works there are nice people and are willing to help. Management push for sales a lot. If you are the type to love to make sales, then staple is for you."
good,The most enjoyable thing about working for staples is the positive enviroment
good,"Copy center manager, ran copy center made sure things ran smoothly. Trained cashers and copy center associates. Took care of deposits. Opened and closed store when needed."
good,"While the company does try their best, there are bad apples in the group and they seem to not be able to leave the corporation. Decent company to work for, though. Do NOT try to work for this place and attend college full time at the same time unless you wish to have it come back to haunt you."
good,Company is undergoing rapid change which is mostly negative. Computer repair business is shady at best.
good,This job wasn't the best it we do-able but nothing you will love to do and move up in as far as advancement. Management wasn't very good the store was always slow.
good,"If you want to get started in retail this is the place to go. Easy to get hired and easy to move around within the company once in the door. Lots of opportunity to learn printing services, tech services and general merchandise. Management was a bit confused and was going through a  lot of turn over."
good,"Staples has requirements of each employee, however each store is managed as per the Store Managers personal preferences.Interpretations of policies and procedures is fluid to the point of being ridiculous."
good,The company is not making the necessary changes to expand the P & M dept despite their previous promises and the fact that we are meeting and exceeding weekly goals almost every year.
good,jadore mon travaille chez bureau en gros toute fois tres demandant compte tenu lage peux elever de la majoriter des employes et la solicitation constente demploye et client .toutefois sa bouge vraiment et jadore ce roulement on ne sennuie jamais . le bureau chef comprenne rarement ;la realite en magasin. ce qui rend toute demande ou changement venant de leur part jamais ideal.
good,The work is grueling and the managers don't respect you. They never tell you if you did a good job and never seem happy with your work. Short term job only.
good,"I had no issue with Staples as a company, and the managers (for the most part) worked with my school schedule. There was not a lot of room for employee advancement, as they always hired managers from different companies. I loved my job, and my clients, but management became so horrible, I couldn't stay any longer. Wish the company cared more about their retail thassociates."
good,"This is all before some recent leadership changes, but the leadership at Staples Promotional Products is highly questionable. The HR team is unsupportive of equity, despite it being a major focus for the headquarters. The leadership team is antiquated and didn't know how to understand best practices or standard statistical resources to prove value. They tried to do everything they could for free and I think it has cost them dearly."
good,"Decent place to work if you're just starting out in your career. Need strong work ethic and good cold calling skills to be successful at this job. Flexible schedule and they have a great training program,"
good,"The manager at my store has blatant favorites, he had other managers from the store he came from move over with him and he lets them get away with doing nothing and blames everyone else on why things don't get done. He also does nothing to solve rude behaviors at work. Other than the management I like everyone else I work with and they are friendly and fun."
good,Overall good place to learn and work at. Upper management does need to look at the talent it has and look to see what the business is driving. Lately decision are made from up high not really looking to see effects it would have on customers and employees.
good,"This job requires mostly being on your feet, and doing a lot of work. The management doesn’t care so much about you, and like most corporations, all they care about is money."
good,"I've had great managers who made it fun and educational and I've had terrible managers who complained constantly while bossing everyone else around. It just depends. If one of the managers quits the whole store culture can do a complete 180. "
good,"fairly routine work day, inbound customer calls for the entire day. Take orders, up-sell, handle returns and customer complaints. Athere to time schedule. Working as part of a highly productive team"
good,The company's expectations can be unrealistic and create unnecessary stress on its employees. Usually good employees and managers (when not too stressed about the company's expectations)
good,"the job asks for a decent amount in the sales department even though commission is not provided nor bonuses no matter how much you make, as long as you sell what they want you to sell you only get to keep your hours"
good,"Was a fun place to work when under old management, new management has enforced stricter policies and does not encourage results. Whether you do well or not, you only hear about the instances where you do poorly."
good,This place was always behind somehow. But the people you work with make it worth it. Every year they do a massive reset for the whole store. That can be a real problem for everyday customers
good,"Staples is a fine place to work as long as you have the right management leading the team, which was a 50/50 in my case. When I was first hired the general manager was terrible, using shortcuts for their own gain, being rude with customers and employees, and generally making it so it was a toxic workplace. After her the general manager was better, and made it a more fun place to work, although the hours and the fact that to advance in the company you have to push insufficient product after insufficient product onto customers in order to meet metrics, was very discouraging."
good,"If you are a beginner, this is not the place to start working. "
good,Typically worked as a cashier. Helping customers check out along with answering any questions they had. Worked as a team to complete every day tasks to provide an excellent costumer experience to shoppers.
good,"Stress through the roof, management always on my back, get better or else, the managers are not trained to manage people. They are good at sales, lets make them managers."
good,They expect you to do the job of too many people in one day.  After a couple of years you are capped out which means no more pay raises.  Cost of living keeps going up but your paycheck does not.  Absolutely no overtime allowed.  This job kills your body and your spirit over time.
good,"There is a lot to learn here and ample fo growth opportunities."
good,Att i vuxen ålder åka runt och leverera block och pennor passade inte mig. Som tur var så var det ett vikariat på sex månader. Kul att träffa vissa kunder andra var mindre roligt.
good,"I had an issue where the GM lied to me in order to get me to do a more involved job (copy center) for my current wage as an associate. When I called him out for this, he took my schedule down to 5 hours a week. Other than this one incredibly off putting and horrifying treatment, the coworkers are great and the managers below the GM are great."
good,"Its a very fast paced working environment and with this job it has helped me learn my potential and my limits when it comes to meeting the customers needs. The hardest part about working for this store in particular is the manager, I've never had any problem with any manager. The store I worked at previously have always enjoyed my presence and appreciated my hard work and efforts and all the work that I have done has been great but for some reason this current manager is trying to cause unnecessary problems. The most enjoyable part about a usual work day for me is pushing my limits and improving my skills each day."
good,employer gentil et agreable mais la place est plutot sale
good,"It's a little boring from opening boxes all day. Other than that it's pretty chill and laid back, unless it's around a holiday. At least 2 days of overtime."
good,"It is very fun working here, but the management is not all that good. The store is also a high risk store, meaning a lot of merchandise gets stolen and misplaced."
good,"good job for beginners needing a new job "
good,"Assisted customers in printing department; created various posters, books, and other stationery items. The hardest part of the job is working countless hours and not feeling appreciated; management was ok; workday was unpredictable"
good,"I ended up working for staples for a much longer time than I originally anticipated. I had heard the job itself had high turnover, and as a result of hearing this, along with other reasons, I knew I would be adding to that turnover soon. "
good,"Working there is great the copy centre is small and you get close with your other copy people but when it comes to management getting involved they can intimidate and bully you everyday that you go home crying,"
good,"If you are looking for a little extra cash Staples is a good option. The store I worked at had poor management. I worked in the copy center and when it got busy, it got really busy. It takes strategy and teamwork and FUNCTIONING machinery to be successful in the copy center at Staples. I never called out or took vacation and was never compensated when leaving. I hear they give $2000 towards tuition but you have to ask for it. In addition you get star points and you are able to purchase items with it."
good,This company will soon fade because of its disregard for its employees on its store fronts. Its greatest fight against the online giants is the customer service of speaking face to face. However the company consistently takes away hours makeing giving customer service near impossible.
good,"For a first job it’s alright. "
good,Staples is a great company to work for especially if you looking for advancement there's plenty of opportunities. Please stay away from the order picker position especially full time 2nd shift. Mandatory overtime everyday which is fine however due to high turnover expect to work alot of hour's Management and supervisors are terrible favoritism to the max which makes the job harder than it really is.
good,"While I have worked at much worse locations, the company is very short sighted on what it takes to get the job done. They are numbers driven and rarely take in the human factor needed."
good,"Throughout my 1 year working at Staples, I honestly enjoyed working with the people I work with. They made coming to work enjoyable, fun and easy-going. This was actually my first retail job. I've never had a retail job before and I honestly, learned a lot just by working retail. I learned about sales, metrics, pull-lists and knowing how to provide a good quality customer service. However, there is one downside; the change of management, especially at this Timonium location. Out of the four store managers I've worked with, only one knew how to keep the store running and keep the store organized and up-to-date with planograms and such. This store manager I strongly dislike. This manager never leaves the office unless it is a manager override. Other than than, the manager stays in the office and plays on their smartphone or sleeps in the cash office. Also, the manager never helped the team with Back to School and we are left organizing and tidying up the store while he indirectly takes the credit for it. I would love to stay at this location but with the most recent manager, managing the store, I cannot bare to keep doing a manager's job plus my sales associate job while getting paid very little (even though I work part-time) or not be recognized. I personally feel that the morale is low at this location due to the fact that since  the store manager doesn't do anything, then the employee's motivation to work goes low, which leaves the store a hot mess."
good,"I worked for Staples for 10 years. Straight out of high school, I started as a sales associate. I built display furniture, helped customers, and had fun with my co-workers and managers. Always eager to learn, I rose through the ranks. Sales associate, to furniture, to inventory, to team supervisor, tech supervisor, operations supervisor, and finally, sales manager. I had my hands in every aspect of the store and often took the leading role. "
good,I was happy to work there however over time things change and it led to me leaving for other opportunities. Thus leading me to work at my current job at Burlington.
good,on register at times multiple registers at one time to keep the lines down. worked in copy center as well. enjoyed the fun and challenging tasks i took on while employed here. we were like one big family and always helped one another out
good,I worked there 10 years and kept advancing but they laid me off. They paid new people with zero experience more. Management hates letting people work from home.
good,"Help customers find what they're looking for and up sale if possible. "
good,Pay is to low and hours are to minimal for the assign tasks and you don't get enough time to complete tasks that were assigned because you have to help customers first then try to make time to also finish task
good,"I was disappointed with the job, mainly due to what I felt was a lack of training if you didn't have the technical background and not all of the managers were as responsive as others."
good,"They were flexible with my school schedule, which was great. The hours weren’t the best and they didn’t have many full time employees unless they were management. There can be a lot of downtime some days and other days there are many customers. There seemed to be a problem getting a manager’s attention when needed to help customers. It could take at least 15 minutes. The pay was just above minimum for Pennsylvania, and if I wasn’t a college student living on campus I wouldn’t have been able to live off of that salary even if I was full time."
good,"It is a decent entry level job. You'll be doing lifting, selling and customer service based tasks. Most stores are smaller staffs than most companies so you tend to work hand and hand with everyone."
good,"Not much room to further yourself. No benefits. Management gets frustrated easily, even though there is not much work to be done. Shift really depended on who you were working with."
good,Only certain individuals have a career path in Staples.  Staples always seeking cheap labor and has transferred most of the Shared Services Center jobs to India for CHEAP LABOR.
good,Working at Staples as a sales associate really left the impression that you are just working there for the money.  Management does not interact with you well.
good,Currently working on a SKU affinity project to improve pick to voice density	Also working on a project to decrease walking distance per pick zone to increase productivity
good,Show up check-in with security and get your scanner battery. Clock in don't be 1 minute late or your fired. The managment are like most big companies however they tried forcing me to work past 12 hrs.
good,"As a cashier and greeter, I enjoyed working with the public.  I was very overqualified for the position, having an MBA, but that was not considered in my application and compensation.  I was limited to the immediate area around cash registers and had no freedom to do a variety of work."
good,Great company to work for overall.  My department was full of conflict of interests.  One of the senior buyers managed to hire all her friends.  There is fraternization and unprofessional behavior.
good,"Daily I worked with my customers and helped with questions, concerns and issues. I would also work up furniture quotes and help with pricing on their products and any other order needs they had.  I loved working with my customers."
good,"If you love a fun working place. Meet great people. (Co-workers and customers) Its a great place. The interview was very in-depth at the time of my hiring. I went through two managers. Now management has changed and completely went to garbage. It’s more a fend for yourself now. The uniform is black sneakers, black pants (I can’t remember whag specific kind) and they give you a few shirts. Different color depending on the department you work in. The pay wasn’t all that great. You start off at minimum wage at the register. Merchandiser is I believe $9 and tech I believe is 9-10. You do all your training online. And the cashiers call you up about every 2.3 seconds if they have more than one person in line which becomes very annoying. When I first started working there it was amazing. Then management switch and it just went down the toilet. "
good,"worked there for 4 years, and saw at least 5 managers come and go, while i was the one employee that stayed. I had been paid minimum the whole time i was there."
good,". typical day at work is slow placed most of the time"
good,"Dont expect a lot of growth."
good,"The work environment was quiet, heads down and attention to detail. Everyone was focused on getting the purchase orders processed in a timely manner.  Limited personal interaction with co-workers and other departments , even during holiday celebrations. I enjoyed the way we all helped one another when we was presented with a challenge and no supervisor was available, team work."
good,Life always brings change it is how we choose to receive it that matters.  The current situation has been coming for some time and should be no surprise to any of the long term employees at Staples.  It is and has been a great place to be.  It has been stable and has served my family well for almost 2 decades.
good,it was a very easy and low stress job. it did not take much training and I was able to comfortably complete all tasks i was given during my shift. management was friendly and easy going
good,"Staples is a decent place to work if you're working with the right people. There are very few good managers, but the rest are horrible and make work hard to be there. If you have a good team to work with though then it's a pretty good place to work if you're not needing much pay. They are not competitive about pay in the slightest and will not pay you much no matter what your experience and the raises they give, if you get any, are not very big. I am having to look for a second job to pay my bills, especially since my hours range from 15 hours one week to 32 the next."
good,They will pay you just enough to suffer through a lot of the bull they put you through. Some will stay because they either have no choice or that's just what they are used to.
good,Good for a part time job. If you are looking for a good part time job with okay pay Staples can work just fine. There is sometimes struggles with scheduling.
good,"They came to offer me a nice job with a nice salary and then laid me off after 11 months. worked long hours and non stop e mails. "
good,Change is continual at this company. . Every year is something new. Every year there are layoffs. Internal candidates are restricted in pay for job transfers and external candidates will be paid more
good,"Great place for entering the working world. However, there was no opportunity for advancement within the management structure I had experienced. The pay was minimal, but it was tolerable considering I was a student. Definitely not a desirable position for someone who needs to sustain their livelihood on their own. I loved my interactions with customers on a daily basis and even enjoyed the tasks that I was assigned."
good,"Staples is good temporary job, but the compensation for what is expected of its associates is not high enough in the long term. The main focus of the job is to sell warranties, open credit card accounts and have customers join the rewards program. Tech services and sales are also emphasized at Staples."
good,Staples wasn't the best place to work but it was nicely paced work place nothing crazy. the hours were also good very flexible they try to work with whats best for you.
good,"I worked a gruelling night shift picking orders when it was still Corporate Express."
good,It's a good entry level job to work on certain skills such as sales and customer service.  I worked in the technology department so I always took the time to learn about new products that were available on market.  I used that knowledge to help me sell product to customers.
good,"No intention to career advancement, once you excel/reach the top of your role, they keep you there with no intent of promotion. Work is to come before anything. Management is a tell-coaching type, not an ask-coaching."
good,"I no longer work at staples for medical reasons.  They were suppose to continue working there after surgery, but they did not even bother to find me a place to work after I became disabled.  What is fair about that policy.  Don't get me wrong we had a great fun and productive time working there.  And right after that everyone got cut to part time, because of obama-care.  Staples did not want to have to health insurance, etc.  Cost to much on their end.  The management was so so.  There were a couple of good managers there, but only a few."
good,"Staples has very good pay, however its a very stressful place to work. Management doesnt seem to care about the affairs of the employees, whether personnel or work related. There is no culture due to everyone worrying about everyone else's work ethic. However the benefits and pay are very good, there's not much else going for them"
good,Staples is a good job for someone one who is in high school or college. You get some experience about sales and retail. The good thing is that you work part time or full time.
good,"I feel i worked hard and my work ethics were highly unnoticed. I always picked up others slack, I feel I was not paid for all that I used to do. I got fired intentionally."
good,"Depending on the location and the management team, you will either like it or despise it. However, do not expect to be treated fairly in my opinion. The pay is honestly not worth the labor involved and there is considerably less recognition from the company vs. anywhere else I have worked. Its been 8 years and I still never received anything for my 5 year anniversary, NOTHING! I could actually go on, but the main reason i stayed there as long as I did is because I appreciated and respected my General Manager."
good,I felt it's been really fun working here and it has expanded my interpersonal and communication skills. The only downside is that I do not know if I will be garanteed position and I came in wanting full time but I'm working only part time.
good,"Working at Staples helped me improve on my communication skills, as well as my people skills in all aspects. It was a very productive, team player environment."
good,The management at my Staples location was horrific. They truly had no consideration for their employees. They did care about your school schedule and in response they worked around the shifts to make sure employees had off for school.
good,"On one hand, it's a good place to start and to begin developing skills in customer service and in other general labour tasks, as well as a good management team that is willing to listen (depending on location, of course), and naturally job security. That, however, is where the pros end. Hours can be cut without warning and it can be incredibly difficult, almost impossible, to make any progress up the corporate ladder, and throughout my almost three year employment I only made ten cents more than minimum wage."
good,"A typical day at work would vary on the position that you are in.  If you are working in Office Supplies, your job is to assist customers on finding what they need.  Constant management change ruin all the fun at Staples."
good,There was little growth opportunities. They were flexible in scheduling for college students. Offered bonus opportunities in sales positions. High rate of employee turn-over.
good,"It's a typical retail workplace, with KPI's, targets, and pressure from management everyday to hit targets. Minimum wage salary and they hire a lot of under 21's to keep wage costs down. Its very hard work mentally for very little gain."
good,"Terrible managers. The managing staff, with the acceptance of the Tech Supervisor was terribly disorganized and relied on their staff to pull the managers weight. Also, as if it was high school, the managers liked to talk poorly about different staff members frequently."
good,"My reviews are based on a rough year long experience at a location with no general manager for 8 months (and a rotating leadership model in a supervisor position) you can ""hold down"" your position and generate calculable changes within your REGION by highlighting the metrics the company cares about. Analyze you team and fill the gaps at the front line; don't allow the top down politics to alter your focus."
good,"i learned a lot of computer fixing skills and opporunities to help co-workers. The store managers are often very nice people who just would like the basic work day out of you and enjoy your company but any higher management looks for perfection, I'm sorry if you want perfection you need to pay your employees more."
good,"Busy and not enough training provided to produce expected results.  Pay not worth the hard work and stress involved, need better training and pay incentives to motivate employees. Do not have many full-time positions."
good,"I worked as a cashier team member and I liked the position but a lot of down time, easy job for anyone. Had one of the worst managers was very lazy."
good,Staples Inc. is a decent job for someone looking to make a few extra dollars. It's not really ideal for someone who is working to pay bills and what not. You'll work with some good people and you'll work with some nasty people.
good,If you can hit your weekly and monthly goals for selling tech you will be golden and have no problems. You have a lot of responsibility like managing the sales floor and all computer that need to be examine and repaired as well as sell cellphone plans.
good,"Not a bad place to work.  Typical retail atmosphere, always adequately staffed.  Low pay.  Every associate is register trained.  The only hard part is the back to school season."
good,the managers off the bat are rude. and the general managers is a creep and makes you uncomfortable. they tell you you are working until 10 and you dint leave until 10:45 every night.
good,not that clean of a work place management was alright seemed nice not much room for advancement but good for a first job a typical day at work included working cash regiester and helping customers
good,different people to work with management is not that great the work load is not much only when receiving new shipment. The pay is minimum wage and the managers really have to do literally nothing but paper work.
good,"When I applied, they were hiring just about anyone because the turnover rate was so high. Staples is great if you need a job NOW, not so great for planning for the future. Terrible pay and no benefits."
good,"Worked in the copy center loved the job.  Didn't get much help when needed from the managers. Also they would change the schedule without telling me.  I also worked as an easy tech associate and I learned a good amount about sales.  Staples did expect you to sell insurance plans and other attachments.  If you didn't the sale is considered a failure.  The job itself is actually not so bad the only problem is the management.  When it comes to the copy center the management (for the most part) is clueless, but they expect you to know everything after watching some close to useless training modules.  Once you get the hang of it though it's really a great job.  If there was sufficient training and back up form management my rating and review would have been much different."
good,"Great training, great incentives. flexibility. Good brand. Advancement wasn't merit based. Always changing commission structure. Closing down stores.."
good,I enjoyed my time at Staples. Was able to enhance my technical skills and became more of a talkative person. Great job for a high school kid to first couple of years of college.
good,The people are genrally ok to work with but the training and management is not great. There isnt a great support amongst staff. The hours are not to bad but there is not enopugh hours and the contracts are not good either. not easy to get a full time role. But the is the opportunity to grow with in the buisness.
good,I was an Easy Tech Certified Technician. It was a fun experience troubleshooting customers computers. Not a hard job if you are well diverse in computers. Management was unprofessional. Lots of solo shifts so learning the ropes fast is a must.
good,just checking computer to get them running learned about Microsoft office and how to fix computers from viruses. no hard part of the day when working at staples and I enjoy working with the people I work with.
good,Staples is a nice place to work for a part time job not a life time placement. Management is nice and pleasant salary is mid-line and the hours are difficult to plan around.
good,Working for Staples for 7 years I've seen a lot of things.  you get the experience of knowing that Staples is truly a business and their main concern is money and not the employees
good,"A very repetitive job, with no change"
good,"A typical day at work starts with me coming in and waiting about 15 minutes to have a manager point me in the direction of what needs done. Once I get started on the task I usually end up getting pulled in other directions that the manager wants me to complete before the end of the day. "
good,The managers are fine but some of the customers are rude or even yelling. I have learned how to talk to customers when they are yelling at me.
good,I am not satisfied with Staples Management. There is lots of politics going on in management. Store manager never keep on his words.
good,"Working at Staples is a good well-balanced job. A typical day at work is clocking in, standing at my register checking customers out, going to break, working some more, and then going home. I've actually learned a lot working at Staples. I mostly learned about work ethics. Management is great at the Staples where I work. Everyone is nice (for the most part) and very knowledgeable. Co-workers are nice too."
good,"partime employee didnt really got to know anything about work ethnics, no benefits were given nor salary or hours added"
good,Good organization with good mid level people. No additional perks. Decent salaries. Commision plans change often. Hardest part of the job is there is not much room for creativity.
good,"Staples SDO (Service Delivery Operations) was hard working, but fun environment with good pay. Staples closed the division in most areas, out-sourcing the work to cheaper sub-contractors;"
good,"No two days are ever the same"
good,"Associates and customers are great, but the GM of the store is very unrealistic and expects too much to be done with not enough help and in a short amount of time."
good,"A typical day at work consist of serving many customers and trying to sell the best product for their needs. Selling warranties and installations are key as well to a good sale, I learned how to serve the customer with perfection. Management is an issue with the company I find because every manager wants something different and it confuses and aggravates many employees. Co-workers are awesome and always willing to help others and know how to work as a team."
good,I enjoyed working there and learned a lot of things that I never thought I would. I would do inventory cycle counts as well as planogram layouts for aisles. I worked the register as well as product knowledge being the best in that department.
good,I learned a great deal from my experience with Staples and  I appreciated the opportunity. I believe the company will continue to do very well
good,"The work is decent, but they don't pay very well and the current mangers there are terrible to work with. The politics within the company aren't very tolerable either. Try to stay in line if you decide to work here."
good,"O dia na Staples começava, por preparar a loja bem como saber os objectivos diários e ao longo do dia fazia para superar esses mesmos objectivos."
good,"Pluses: "
good,"- interaction with customer"
good,Learned a lot about technology and how to improve customer relations. Worked long days by myself. Co workers were great. Hardest part was remembering all of the functions of the technology. Best part of the job was working with people I liked and having an understanding manager.
good,"Management is horrible, Hours are horrible, work environment is disgusting unorganized i do not recommend it. working there will make you  miserable"
good,This wasnt my favorite job and they often passed me up for advancement when i was the most qualified and experienced. My coworkers were very laxed and pleasant to be around.
good,"Help customers with sales on products. The pay was  not good. Since, hours vary. Sometimes I would get only 10 hours a week. The  working environment was okay.I just did not make enough hours to survive."
good,"I would come in, great all the coworkers as i walked in, got ready for my shift. stock product talked about new product that was coming to the store and/or had just arrived"
good,"A typical day was to come in, check in with what's going on concerning tech sales and plans. Then if we are doing well, continue and if we are doing bad then we have to step up and try our best to sell more."
good,"I was part time and young at the time of employment.  There wasn't much room for advancement, but I enlisted into the military in the end.  Much better."
good,"One of the worse places I've worked"
good,A typical day was Standing for 4-5 hours running a cash register or taking phone calls for minimum wage.  The only good thing about this job was the changing customer.
good,During my time at Staples I learned a lot about costumer service and also developed skills in the copy and print center. The hardest part about working there was the management staff was not very enjoyable to work with at times and were rarely accommodating to their employees.
good,"I was hired as a part-time cashier at staples. After, three months of being hired as a cashier I was giving the opportunity to get hired as full-time associate. Working for staples for eight years it helped me to be a team-player, organized, meeting deadlines and be able to work with people."
good,"While working at Staples, you have to greet each and every customer or else you get reprimanded for it. The customer comes first in this workplace, above everything else. Not many hours are given and the pay is barely above minimum wage."
good,Staples is a very demanding work environment with minimal reward. However they do provide some training in there computer and copy center departments that can benefit you in other career choices.
good,"I thought this place would be fun for someone with IT background to work in, but it was the complete opposite. I was more focused on sales, then actually fixing the computers because I didn't have enough ""background"" or ""work experience"" at Staples to be working on things full time. In other words, I had to work there for so long to actually be doing the IT work that the others were doing."
good,"This was the worst part-time job I've ever had. It is a low paying job which is expected since it's retail but it is also high pressure as employees are under constant pressure to get customers to sign up for Staples rewards and other extras. The manager at this location also regularly degraded employees in front of customers by saying things like ""it's not rocket science"" whenever a new employee made a mistake. While other Staples locations may be great, I would not recommend working at the Goshen, Indiana location."
good,"Flexible hours, great place to acquire multitasking skills. It can get extremely hectic at times. Co-workers are great company. Love helping people."
good,"I've worked at Staples in multiple departments for the past 3 years. Staples is a great place to start off your working career, just to get your feet wet. If you're working another job or attending school, it's a great way to get a couple of dollars."
good,"Came in at about 4 pm, we ring out customers and do our customer service duties. At the end of the night we box and hang up ink and we take out the trash, after this we leave but managers do not stick to their word on letting us out at our time of scheduled release after all our work is done. Rides for associates who do not drive would wait outside for as long as an hour after their scheduled time to go. Management is not very responsible or professional either"
good,"Staples was fun and always something new. The pay is low, hours are few, and management is awful. The benefits are great and the staff typically gets along and helps each other."
good,"working is fine just no room to make full time"
good,Don't get a lot of hours or even the hours I was told I would get when I was hired. I don't see any chance for advancement or even encouragement for learning or training by management.
good,"I would oversee print production to ensure customers receive quality jobs done right the first time.  Resolve customer requests and concerns. Train all new associates to the copy and print center, plus ongoing training for all new products that we were offering."
good,"Staples as a whole was a good company to work for, they train you properly, and urge you to learn as much as you can. The hardest part of the job was we didnt have enough associates to help all the customers that would come in."
good,"Enjoy working with and developing associates."
good,"Not Great, not horrible. I don't have much to say about this company."
good,"I loved most of my coworkers, they made it a great place to  work!"
good,Building a strong sales culture. Company should continue to grow by offering flexible recruitment advertising products
good,"Staples is struggling to reinvent itself right now in a tough economic environment. I was a store opening specialist, and was recruited to open a new market in Memphis. After opening 2 stores within 2 weeks of each other, the decision was made to pull out of the market."
good,"Challenging but an easy line of work, not much career work in terms of progression."
good,"Typical day: very busy"
good,"I love working with people and the public.  I have a lot of repeat customers and I enjoy making their shopping, customer service and printing experience enjoyable."
good,"in at 6:30 and leave when route is done and route changes daily. learned a lot of ways to get around town and many short cuts. supervisor was always letting us know he was in charge and had unrealistic goals.he was hard to talk to and was always on the offensive. the coworkers were the best i have ever worked with. good family men. just wanted to get job done and go home. the hardest part of the job was mainly working in all types of weather. hot or cold, rain or shine we delivered. the part i liked most was seeing customers day in and day out. having a great relationship with all of them."
good,I work on cases in between phone calls. I learned to multi-task while handling a heavy call volume. The hardest part of the job is the pay. The best part is my co-workers
good,I enjoyed the work but lots of overtime. learned how to work in two departments. Love to work with my co- workers. Job was not hard to complete.
good,Very bad mid level management. Store managers have way too much control. Very stressful work culture. Too much politics and favoritism at GM level and up. Company has great concepts and good pay structure. Enjoyed my time there but was given false promises of promotion and when time came they forgot me.
good,Staples is not worth your time. No hours and and the pay is horrible. There is no part of this company that will keep you there and you will not move up .
good,"A typical work day at Staples consist of coming into a positive work environment having productive conversations containing different ways to improve S.O.P Stander Operating,learning different ways to complete the perfect order. Communicating with co workers take constructive input and positive feed back from my counter parts.Dealing with constance change brings some difficulty, working out solutions presents some of the best times working for my last employer."
good,"Low wages, mediocre incentives. If you like sales, this could be the perfect job."
good,Fast paced and challenging sales enviorment. Focused on sales and customer experiences.
good,"Every day, my primary function is to develop people. It can be training, tightening skills or bringing to light creativity.I create a nurturing and inviting environment. Company goals are set on a daily basis. There are challenges in coaching a team. It is not easy to deliver a message and have everyone receive it the same way but by having people reiterate what their perception of my expectations are this helps to clarify and set the tone for the day. We work together as a team and know that we have to lean on each other to get the job done. It is not a one man job to be able to run a business and the weakest leak can destroy us."
good,I deal with 50-100 accounts this involves managing all aspects of the customers account
good,"i learned how to ring at the registers and a little inventory work. Normally i float, which means i help out on the floor, by restocking shelves and customer services and helping at the registers.  my co-workers are great to work wit and some mangers. i enjoy helping out customers and making them feel great when i found what they are looking for."
good,"I worked in the Copy Center department where I worked 1 on 1 with customers for all their design and printing needs. This by itself was enjoyable to me, however management always made sure the department was understaffed and when there is a long line of customers and 1 employee, things would get very stressful due to the 1 on 1 nature of the position and how long the line woul take to move."
good,"Depends on which store you are at, my first location was very close and tightknit and we were a family. My second store was the polar opposite."
good,Corporate Enviroment.  Work Life balance can be difficult.
good,"A typical day consisted mostly of administrative work, following up on orders, preparing meeting materials, managing my Outlook calendar, attending appointments, cold calling, and data entry on Salesforce."
good,"  When I returned to Staples after my medical leave I returned to a different company. I left as a highly regarded General Manager. I returned as a new Sales Manager. While I was gone the companies sales strategies changed a great deal. The sales philosophy was based on suggestive selling when I left. When I returned the company was using a performance based management with checklists of what you had to suggest to each customer depending on the item being sold. If an associate or sales manager fell below their goal consistently they were put on notice and terminated if the result didn't improve to company standard. I like having standards I need to meet to be considered successful at my job. I don't like being told I have to start firing a bunch of talented young people that were doing their jobs in a difficult situation. I am now looking for a company that offers me the opportunity to finish my retail career working for a company that I believe in and respect."
good,Copy and Print Center was one of the most fun and tough department to ever work in. Co workers was more like family. 
good,unappropriated management and it hardest job ever. it is good for temp job not for full time
good,"need to be a freind or family member to advance. Its a ""who you know atmosphere"""
good,Experience differs depending on the Manager.
good,"Was bounced around between cashier, customer service, isles, and stocking. Sales at store became bad and part-time workers suffered due to cut back on shifts and hours. My fellow co-workers that I'm still friends with now, didn't enjoy their time with the company either."
good,Great Company for a young teenager. Advancement is slim and compensation is min wage.
good,This is just another retail job. If your looking for a retail job that doesn't allow you to have time with your family than this is it. Its great when your single but if you have a family its not.
good,"So, I enjoyed working at Staples at first. It kept me busy (which I like), but the compensation for the amount of work was severely lacking. Overall, I would say it is a good job for a student or part time worker, but the advancement opportunities just weren't there."
good,Employees who move up within the company are not compensated nearly as well as those who come in externally.
good,"My typical work day would consist of me restocking the shelves of pens, paper and your typical office supply stuff, I would help the customers find what they needed to make there home or office a better work place for them. If we didn't have what they were looking for I would call another store or order it on line, I would help carry there big items out to their car when nessecary. If needed I would cashier if the lines got to long. Evenutally I became lead cashier"
good,"My day at work is being manager on duty which includes observations, coachings, interacting with customers. Spending time in copy and print area talking to customers in person and speaking with customers over phone to try to find out more about their business and needs. Meetings with assistant managers and keyholders on a daily basis. Setting goals and expectations and holding associates accountable to their behaviors to selling. Always setting the example of being a great leader when it comes to customer service."
good,this was for the most part one of the best jobs ive had. i had a few people under me that took care of the department when i was in the field. i had to teach three people that were under me how to do a lot of the things that had to do with setting up the computers to taking them down and selling them and tips for selling them
good,I started here as a sales associate to learn about the product and sell product replacement plans and warranties. I later had the opportunity to be the greeter responsible for greeting people and checking their reciepts and their goods bought.
good,"A typical day at work was stress due to the manager, co-workers were pretty nice though"
good,"I find that this company does not allow for enough employees and should be more active about getting a full staff. They also appear to be highly unfair about pay in that they pay new employees more than those who have been there longer and have more work experience. The hours are also very long in such that most full work day are roughly ten hour days not the average eight. I also find that most employees get a job at this company and at about six months decide this is not a place to work for. There's no benefits unless you're a manager and that's because your forced to work at full time. All other employees are part time and thus do not qualify for benefits. Moving up the ladder is easy enough, you simply wait for someone to leave and up you go. Overall I find this company to not be well organized or well situated to operate the way it is set up."
good,I had a good time while working there. But they didn't seem to think that people had personal lives.
good,"Staples has flexible scheduling, offers tuition reimbursement"
good,"Staples trains their employees to be very helpful and upbeat characters.  However, the company could not care less about the environment. The prices are above average, especially in the print department.  The copy center is not very affordable and often sends customers working on smaller projects elsewhere. On top of that the equipment we use (like the printers) are not the best and do not compare to the prices."
good,"I enjoyed working and performing the duties assigned.  The company was going through internal restructuring prior to and post a sale of the firm into the private sector, making job security challenging."
good,"Quiet environment,small group of teamworkers,own pace,nice break room good coffee,we clean up after work is done and trucks drops off load from truck."
good,"The people are great except the management is wonderful but since I've been there, there has been 3 different managers and none of them have been able to do much in one field or the other it seems like it's slowly getting back on track though."
good,"Staples is a fine place to learn some of the ins and puts of the retail business, however, management could use some improvement. Most of the management there are lazy. They will sit around while you work and criticize you for not doing enough. There are no leaders there, only bosses."
good,this job is for collage student who is looking for weekly income. if you like a fast pace environment this job is for you. Good luck on your search for employment
good,"The job struck me as a pretty standard retail job, with all of the pros and cons that come with it. Expect to spend most of the day stocking shelves, working the register, taking phone calls, and talking with customers. They want you to sell expensive items as much as possible, and encourage customers to sign up with Staples' rewards program; your performance is rated primarily based on how many expensive items you sell, how many positive surveys you receive from customers, and how many customers sign up for Staples' rewards membership."
good,This was my second job and I really liked it toward the beginning but as the time went on the management started to get bad and everyone felt uncomfortable working there
good,"The Job isn't stressful and if you work with friends, time goes quickly."
good,"Staples runs on a skeleton crew. The easy tech is required to speak to everyone who walks by a computer & walk each customer to their desired items. You also do all the facings, vaccuuming, while assembling office chairs, covering cashier breaks & keeping items stocked on your half of thr store. On busy days its a job for for 3 people but you seldomly have that kind of coverage."
good,Good first job. Was able to work at stables while going to college with flexible hours. Had a great working environment. Managers were always willing to help.
good,"Push us to get more business but we only get the minimum paid."
good,Was a decent job paid well.  Gave time with family on weekends.  Only problem was how management ran things.  Management lacked communication and were very disorganized.
good,"It's okay for a start, the people were chill there, the general manager had his ups and down days, but would still make up excuses. Write ups here are over the dumbest things, like not wearing black pants. He constantly would threaten to write you up if you didn't do what he said.  Made friends and acquaintances who"
good,"I was offered a district manager position with another company shortly after I started as a department manager with Staples.  I spoke to Staples regarding advancement only to be told it wouldnt be considered for at least 5 years.  I accepted the other position.  "
good,"It was a decent place to work, pay wasn't bad, atmosphere in Staples was good, always had something to do, got to learn about new products that we sold at the store"
good,Everyday is completely different. Everyday a district manager will come with a daily routine that is different weekly and daily. Only the consist information is about customers.
good,"Working at staples was a feel good job. I loved helping people find what they wanted. A few months into working I was put into the technology portion where I knew absolutely nothing. I was never properly trained, so I had to teach myself. Supervisors were usually never to be seen if I had questions, they only butted in if I was in the process of a big sale where they would harass the customer on adding onto the already big sale. This would usually tick off the customer and ruin their whole experience. If you’re not going to properly train me, don’t come behind me and try to take over my sale. However, this doesn’t matter because there is not commission on sales ( no clue why ). After a year, I was awarded with a insane 15 cent raise, which awarded all my hard work. 15 cents does not make a difference, and is not what will make an employee want to stay. Overall, I had a decent experience working at staples, but management needs to change. Not saying all managers and supervisors were terrible, because I had a good relationship with a few, but to the others..."
good,"Good management, but, low wages and hours in my under staffed department  didn't make it financially worthwhile for me. Probably a good job for someone fresh out of high school."
good,"If you want to be an associate here, know you will not get many hours unless you are willing to work past your hours and if you want to be a manager here, know that your responsibilities extend far beyond 'supervisor duties'"
good,It was a great job however its very long hours when you do stock and they can be very disorganized. It was a new store that just opened so it was a very good job
good,"• Management can be better - not much attention payed to scheduling or employee’s lives (you pretty much have to sleep, live, and breathe Staples)"
good,Drive over  one million  miles  of safe driving worked there for 26yrs 6months no all task for there warhouse process an delivery  operation . Always  try to be the best i can be as a individual an team player.
good,"early morning schedule restocking shelves and assisting customer"
good,"Dålig arbetsmiljö, lokalerna inte gjort för så många människor."
good,"I’ve been working at staples for two years now, there are great coworkers, decent management, horrible pay in cpc, and definitely hard to get raises and etc."
good,I feel like there are a lot of people working that do not care to put forth any effort and because of this in order to meet corporate standards there are a few people who pick up the slack for the rest of the employees. I feel that certain people advance because of time spent with the company even if they are less suited for the task.
good,"Typical day involved stocking all the shelves in all the aisles, unloading all received freight, providing customer service to patrons and giving register help"
good,"I had fun helping customers with their printing needs, however I did not enjoy working with one individual because that person made it more difficult for me to do my job."
good,"It was great working with such diverse group and how we could all work together on a daily basis to complete given tasks. Each person had an unique personality but everyone put together, we made a great team."
good,"Competitive sales goals, Long work days at times, Great people to work with. Lots of turn over with employees, could improve with more meetings for underlings to keep people informed on changes and have a better employee recognition platform."
good,Management typically is uncaring and will expect you to go above and beyond for them.The culture for most stores is low because the goals for each store is not possible maintain.
good,"Company values are a lie.  Accountability is lacking.  Management has their favorites and stick with them even if someone more experienced has a differing view.  They like ""yes men"".  Arrogant as to their way is the only way, EVER.  New idea's are heard but very rarely tried.  Everyone works hard, and are mostly good people but if you have a good work ethic, your exploited and expected to pick up the slack of those that don't."
good,"I had a very confrontational store manager, and it was not a fun time for me. But managers have changed since I left, so things seem better whenever i go in to shop."
good,"- They do not help with school hours "
good,This was my first job out of college. I had the BEST manager. Unfortunately she is no longer with the company. I did outside sales here. I loved not being in an office all day every day. The downside to this was selling office supplies. People don't really want to talk to you or take you seriously.
good,A company In transition and not stable. Lots of changes and being driven by private equity investors. Office environment is average and culture is unclear. Lots of politics and managers are not properly equipped.
good,"The likelihood of enjoying Staples really depends on the culture of your own store and who is managing it. It can be a great company, but for management there is no work/life balance."
good,"At Staples I learned a lot about customer interaction, selling and pushing products to others but mostly the handeling of freight, breaking it down and stocking the store. I Actually enjoyed selling products and ideas to others but it was very hard to unload palletfulls of items completely by myself while also putting them out on shelves all within the Staples timeframe. The job is not bad but the pay does not hold to the tasks and the people who work there are very dramatic and act as high schoolers, including management."
good,"Great Company at first.  The Private Equity Firm that acquired Staples a year ago has limited direction to the U.S. Retail team.  The direction given, is to attain results through extensive use of their exempt associates.  Limiting payroll for proper coverage and task."
good,Unless you are a manager or a specialist or a tech you will have stagnant wages and work harder than everyone else. Full time work is not possible for associates here. You must be a people person to succeed. You must learn to BS customers to “save the sale” as product stock is low. Prices inflated so you must emphasize the services you can do. The copy and print center is where loyalty is earned. Replacement plans are a joke. Nobody will show up. Usually if anything customer gets card to buy a new one instead for value within warranty. Managed by jerks.
good,"I worked there managing the Copy and Print Center. I was promised promotion to assistant manager if I did well with Copy Center. I broke company records, was highest grossing copy center per capita in all of CA (per Staples) and received the crown jewel award for 36 consecutive 100% score mystery shops. Apparently I was too good to promote because an associate from a different store was given my management opportunity."
good,Great place to start a sales career with many different opportunities to sell many different types of products to many different size customers. Digitization and Amazon are strong threats to the company and industry.
good,"Too stressful to work there , was not gettibg paid enough for my job title never got a raide . Always a hassle if waned to go on vacation. Unreliable employees ."
good,It was just stressful and very pressuring. Higher ups screaming every day at store manager which snowballed to everyone getting yelled at over unreasonable sales goals.
good,"Selling and inventory of the store, turned into inventory "
good,"pros: awesome dedicated co workers, we were like family and looked after one anther when we needed a shift covered etc. i loved my job and i am very good at multi tasking and dealing with irate customers. you have to have a strong mind for this position because at times it can get overwhelming. also its good to have the skill of working in a high paced high volume work environment. me having strong patience made it easy for me. but overall having a graphic design background made it easy and fun for designing."
good,"Working at staples was a good first job opportunity, with a great environment, and amazing co workers to be able to work with. Physically demanding work due to lifting merchandise."
good,"This job was challenging and rewarding but at times management sometimes didn't know what direction they wanted to take our store. Unfortunately, this store was one that closed down due to poor sales but my department was one of the best in the state."
good,"I usually worked by the printing station, made photo copies. Worked with customers to determine their needs, and then recommend the right product to solve the customer’s problem.Maintained selling floor, providing for a positive customer experience. Kept the stock room and inventory in a neat and orderly fashion."
good,Staples were a good place to work with the difference is that young employees would have to go to school the next day so I was one of the few that stayed for projects.
good,"Competitive and challenging work space, great discounts, reasonable amount of time for break, built communication skills, meeting new people, also learned to be a team."
good,There was no room for advancement because it's such a small business. Managers do not reward work well done. I felt unappreciated as an associate who does their best.
good,"Staples seems to want to recruit talent but isn't willing to compensate accordingly. In my time with the company most of  the skills that have learned have been self taught. Management does not mentor which is a shame since there are many qualified individuals within the staff that just need some guidance to become that next level associate. Management speaks that they need mentorship but fail to provide their own. Once the company went private, a lot of  changes have not been positive on morale."
good,"I've worked in 5 staples stores. Managers are not carefully chosen and at one store i had 4 different GM's over the course of 10 months. They typically have flexible hours but you will make minimum wage and will be very lucky to get 25 hours, if you aren't a manager. Most associates average 16 hrs. Job security is fantastic though, like I said, I've transferred 5 times across 3 states."
good,"Most stressful job"
good,Staples is a hard place to work in Print and Marketing  There is very little assistance in how to do things on the computer making it difficult to perform some of your daily duties
good,Decent summer job if you need a source of income. The customers were usually very friendly however management kept only those they found to be favorable.
good,"Overall the company is not bad. The pay is fair, Insurance is average, Some teams can work remotely, The company has active and engaging leaders. Management... No comment."
good,"I took the job as a young guy when still in school. Noone seemed to care, not even management, which made it hard for me to care. "
good,Overall a fair part time job  keeps me busy I learned a lot about office suppies printers labtops different subjects in copy and print paper different color prints
good,"Staples gave me my first real job. I have generally enjoyed my time here. I did receive a promotion after about a year. However, the training is lacking and I taught myself many of my job functions."
good,I was there for a long time and was a victim of the last layoff of which more are to follow. It's not the same company it once was. Being purchase by a private equity firm may be the beginning of the end for Staples.
good,"The company as a whole had good vibes and I learned a lot, but my personal position within Staples I would not recommend. Management was unprofessional and not helpful. The best part of the position was my team and the clients."
good,"A typical day at work at staples is very stressful dealing with customers, coworkers and managers. I learn a lot every time being around everyone. So many new encounters every shift is life changing and a new experience for me every time and I look forward to it. The hardest part of this job is having co workers who don't have the same work ethic as you. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers who make me smile."
good,staples as a low cost provider has minimal payroll to run the retail stores. Upper Management on the retail side has a high pressure on hourly associates to sell all kinds of margin rich products and services. Assistant and store managers are constantly under pressure to improve sales. The most enjoyable part for store associates is their repore with the store supervisors and managers. they get recognized for great performance.  The hardest part of the job is trying to balance operational expectations with the sales and service demands with little staff.
good,"The company is very strict on policy, the managers make time to ensure that you have a balanced schedule but nothing else. Sales are forced and you feel obligated to push extras on customers even though they do not need it."
good,"Okay company to work for."
good,"Its a decent place to work as a student looking to make some money, however, no room for advancement or hours despite being a veteran associate. Managers are decent with being accommodating, however good luck getting hours as the company is strapped financially."
good,They did not pay well for commission type jobs and sales they expected us to secure for no additional compensation. The managers tried their best to be reasonable though.
good,"Although my immediate manager is caring and flexible, upper management is not and are old fashioned. Older/more seasoned employees treat newer and younger employees poorly. This also goes in hand with that they don’t see change as a positive thing. The morale is low due to the layoffs and going private.The office was relocated from a nice building to a small building and no more cubes which causes discomfort in a place where the culture isn’t suited for an open office layout. "
good,only recommend this job to people who don't plan on staying long and looking for something to get them by until they find something better. this job are for young adults looking to pay thier phone bill thats it.
good,Good company to work for. Work life balance improved over the years. Top leadership did not seem to have a sense of direction. Top management lost focus on what made staples great.
good,"They are consistently changing, not enough stability from Top of management to the managers in stores. There is always busy work to do not actual sales or cashier or even Copy center, or whatever it is called these days,  you are trained in multiple departments because there are not enough employees. It is great if you are in high school or college for a part time job I would not recommend being full time."
good,"Wouldnt say it was a very good company to work for, always squeezing the most out of their staff which are on very little pay. Company ended up going bust in 2016"
good,Just need more hours and more advancement opportunities. But overall it is a good job. I like working with customers and I enjoyed the job I did as a cashier and the people were good to work with.
good,"At the time of working there, I was very young and had the opportunity to invest in stocks and I did. I made a nice amount of money in my investment in addition to what I earned there."
good,"It's a great place for a first job or entry level experience. The pay is bottom line and there's a flat line management, meaning very little no advancement opportunity."
good,Staples Warehouse was a broken system with poor leads and supervisors...The job didnt care if we had breaks or not and the leads never did there jobs to help
good,"Very fasted paced job. Management wasn't helpful, People were always stressed cause never knew when your day was gonna end. good pay, decent benefits."
good,I was able to work on my own. I knew what I had to do and worked it with having to wait for someone. staples didn't pay well and it was hard to advance if you didn't know the right people. over all it was a okay job until I was laid off I planned to work until retirement.
good,"Staples does what it does and shoots itself in the foot. It gets rid of good people who make too much to make room for cheaper labor. You are overworked, underappreciated, and constantly overwhelmed. It's retail."
good,"this place was a learning experience for me. at first my manger was nice but then more you get just to the place , the more rude of a person he is . no manger should be that rude"
good,"If you're promoted from within and have worked your way up, you should leave and come back and make $20k more."
good,A pretty straightforward workday. There are often procedure changes that aren't always communicate well. I learned better time management.  The office setting was often tense and divided. Hardest part of the job was the often failing ERP. Enjoyable part was often the people in department.
good,"Based on multiple locations I've worked at and have interacted with, the collective vibe of Staples is crooked in management and biased in favor of employees who follow that pace."
good,I have learned to use all different printers and fix some problems too. I wanted to have full time opportunity but not getting due to couple of employee only full time person.
good,Sales staff is a great group of people to work with. We work well together to get the job done. The assistant managers are great people to work with. I've learned a lot from the assistant managers I've worked with.
good,"Working at staples has been typical of most retail work. Most of the people I have worked with were competent with some minor exceptions. While you don'y earn any paid time off the managers I have worked with will work with you to try to give you your desired time off,"
good,"I love working there, but I'm not getting the hours needed even after I ask repeatedly. The management is nice and well respected, they always have something to keep us busy which is very important for me. they're understanding of the hours and when theirs an emergency."
good,Was responsible for daily pull list first thing in the morning. Then had to do a zero balance wall of the entire store. The worst part of the job was when the truck was delivered and had to be broken down.
good,I spent most of the day balancing between computers and customers. I advanced quickly because of how fast I learned and how willing I was to learn more.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was i was able to work in all departments where needed to help multiple customers with their needs. was not allowed to work Full Times hours as needed to maintain a decent paycheck.
good,"Staples is an okay place to work as long as you understand that when overtime is needed, you are expected to work overtime no matter what.  As long as you don't mind working hard and sweating a little, you can do well and there is always work available and you can move up quickly if you want to be promoted."
good,spend most the day clearing various jams on conveyors and helping operators when trouble pops up. trouble shoot conveyors systems and make repairs as neccessary
good,"Working for Staples is just like any other retail place. You cashier, you stock, you sell merchandise, or you manage. It's pretty cut short. I hated working there, it was boring and people thought they were better than others."
good,"Work is the same loop everyday with no chances. even with so many trainings and understanding at many tasks that they teach you, they will not let you move up in ranks. The staff is manily either fired, quit or they transfer to other places in order to move up somewhere and it makes it very difficult to work with so many stressful hours and not enough people. The pay is very great but you manily live at your job doing the exact same thing with no possible way to move up."
good,"Poor Sales Management - Quill management had no Business to Business experience, ineffective field support, relationship development, or ability to compete in the electronic acquisition market."
good,"My Field Sales Director was Excellent. And starting pay was good. "
good,"Days are long and the expectations are way out of reach even when you exceed at typical metrics"
good,"While at Staples Copy & Print, there was always a ton of stuff to do. It doesn't help that you're in the NYC area right next to FIT and some students tended to come at the very last minute, which was always the most stressful and specially so during FIT finals."
good,"As a supervisor, every day was a challenge. I very much enjoyed doing some of the same, yet many different, tasks throughout the day. "
good,There was a lot of favoritism in the district. Some managers didn't even know what they were doing. But in my store we had a lot of hard working people.
good,"Dealt with good customers on the route and helped solve any complaints with the company, if possible. Learned to interact with a variety of people and businesses."
good,A company that looks to hire people for life and expect them to stay while only earning minimum wage. Even if you do perform well you are looking at no more than a quarter raise a year. Makes it hard to live in 2017.
good,"Staples is a good job to start. You learn a lot about retail and you interact with a bunch of different people and co-workers. The best part of the job is definitely the co-workers in my opinion. The customers have to be the worst. The amount of attitude you get and the denial when you try to make a sale is insane. I can say this job made me hate people. Aside from that Management can be a pain due to their bosses constantly being on their neck about selling a product that doesn't even work. But once you get a hang of things, everything becomes simple and easy... until the new people come in."
good,"I worked in the Easy Tech area of the store where I was the only female in the department. Sadly, I didn't stay long because the ""men"" employed in my department at the time were extremely sexist and didn't think I deserved to work there because I was a female."
good,"Low pay, low discount. over worked doing more than asked in job description. never enoug time to finish work after store closes. inventory is the worst time to work."
good,I've heard good and bad stories from other stores and I have good and bad ones from the store I work at. It all depends on the store and the store managers.
good,I would recommend this job to a person just out of high school. It teaches allot about human communication and hard work. This is NOT a carrier choice! In retrospect I should have worked there for no more than three years! The inconsistent hours and stress are an emotional trap!
good,"Good starter job for younger teenagers."
good,Abide by managerial rules and guidelines and assist customers with exceptional customer service.  Being able to help others as needed and have a broad knowledge of the store's products and services.
good,"I worked at Staples for two years. However, I never advanced in the company, not sure why. A typical day at the job involved me cleaning, sorting or doing office supply."
good,good place to work bc you do work from home. however they just don't care much for there employees if they could they would only staff 1/2 that is need and expect them to do the work over 50 and to do all of the overtime. they don't really care if only 5 or 7 people are doing the work as long as it gets done. No one gets punished for this either
good,"Staples was more for highschool students and elders who are complacent. I definitely gained a good amount of knowledge and work experience and skills. Although it was a good starting place, I needed room to grow and make a better living financially and there it was really hard to do so. Staples isn't a place to get comfortable at, and you need to make sure that you know all of your work rights because they don't have a strong union. However, you will run across a few cool coworkers and SOME customers."
good,District Manager input was very micro manage focused. The company is on the right track for making people focus on the customers and the work life balance is good for the associates management is required to do a great deal of tasking when they should be developing their team and focused on customer service.
good,Working at this company you learn how to print and set up jobs. As well as learn how to do finishing and operate bindery machines to complete customer orders.
good,"I enjoyed my 18 tenure at Staples - although some of it was not always the greatest adventure.  I liked the fact that I had different things to do - the job was not ""mundane"" at all and there was always new things to learn."
good,Elder reps highly intimidated by new college grads. Created a poor moral and awkward work environment. Pay was great and weekly however training did not prepare well for the day to day job.
good,The enviroment is fast paced and can be very exciting. Changes are frequent and at time challenging. Must be able to multi-task and network with various departments to maintain smooth transitions.
good,"A typical day there was decent. I learned how to never burn bridges and leave a job on good terms. I learned how to work hard at everything that i do. The raises i had was only 10 cents or less. I was ""Employee of the Month"" a couple times also. The hardest part of my job was talking to people and asking them questions because i used to be really shy. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the great people that used to be there."
good,"I enjoyed being able to work from the comfort of my home day to day. That made the overall experience better. Near the end of my time there, they were making massive cuts that were hitting the whole company."
good,"There is nothing really exceptional about it. If your working in office supplies, you do an average amount of work for little pay, and it's only good for a temporary basis."
good,"I am happy to have met a variety of good people at this job. Opportunities in promotions were given to me, but I denied the opportunity because the pay raise did not match the obligations and responsibilities. Therefor; I am seeking for a new job in a competitive company with opportunities for promotions."
good,"While the opportunity for advancement was limited, I enjoyed the customer contact. Particularly enjoyed learning the various machines and the creativity involved in producing a quality product. The job provided the opportunity to learn new skills."
good,"The Managers aren't that bad, the store i worked in was an express store that was badly under-managed and understaffed. poor break times. also, under my hiring process, i did not sign any documentations at all, did not do any certifications and didn't recieve my employee ID after a week of employment."
good,"Everyone is welcoming when first joining a store."
good,"While helping the customers is the best part of the job, having to worry about your job if you don't meet sales numbers is definitely stressful. You could do great one week and down the next and they are down your throat."
good,"Set Schedules. Almost impossible to get a 1st shift position. Decent start pay but it barely goes up. Only $0.25 a year raises. Management varies per department, most of it not great IMHO. I've learned almost all there is to know about the operation. Not much room for advancement. Company itself isn't doing too well. Stocks are low etc. As long as you show up on time and do your job you it pays fairly well and isn't the worst place to work. For the qualifications needed to obtain a job here it pays very well for high school diploma work."
good,"Staples IT is not an IT job but rather what they call a saleperson that works in their electronics department. That is fine but do not use it as a way to attract people to the job that like working on computers to have them sell printers and ink all day and reprimand them when they do get to work on a computer because it ""isn't their job"". Actual IT work is done offsite via another company licensed with Staples. total scam p;us you never work more then part-time for very little money and if you go into management you get full-time and $1-2 raise so definitely not worth the stress."
good,The store mangers were great but the higher ups have distanced themselves from what actually happens in the stores.  The people I worked with were great and the job fit what I was looking for.
good,"it was a job, thats all i can really say about it, i fixed laptops and sold ink for printers, thats about all i did there, i sold more printers and ink than anything else"
good,"Staples is a large corporation with great benefits.  The company is currently having some financial uncertainty given a changing economic demand in their field and they are forced to make some difficult decisions which resulted in my termination.  Many of my daily tasks were predictable, but I enjoyed the problem solving tasks or things that were not as predictable the most.  I enjoy analyzing data and trying to find a better solution to benefit the company.  The hardest part of my job was finding the balance with prioritizing tasks, but I was able to overcome that by analyzing the process and urgency of each task and addressing them accordingly.  Staples offered great benefits and the management was both knowledgeable and approachable.  I was given the several opportunities to learn new systems and expand my trouble shooting abilities throughout my time at Staples and overall, I would say it was a great company to work for."
good,"It  was a good environmental place to work, friendly very helpful and cooperative. My job was replenishment and stock products by their own code, scan the UPC. The hard part of this job was to keep the percentage, and the fun part were the breaks"
good,"Not getting to build too many planograms, and getting stuck to do the same old tasks that might not be that important. Sales days would be approaching and new planograms must be built, but the manager proceeds to make workers work on the regular tasks instead of working on future tasks that will bring prophet to the company."
good,"When it comes right down to it, making sales and earning your numbers and budget for the week are all that matter, despite being told otherwise. In fact, it seems as if everything you're told to do by management completely clashes with the demands of higher management or corporate-level requirements. Management focuses on customer service, but corporate focuses on meeting budgets and numbers."
good,There could be a lot more training and hands on help in this role. I believe this is a good first sales position to learn what you like and don't like about outside sales for a large corporation.
good,"Staples very much a reactive workplace as opposed to being Proactive.  A long downturn in business caused by a vicious circle of errors and poor judgment and no investment in experience.  That said they employed me for over 15 years culminating in over 5 years as a General Store Manager"
good,Nice environment but not very organized due to management. Was thrown into my position on my second day with no training.
good,At staples I would do all deposits and safe balances. Count out all tills and run the Customer service desk. I really didn't have any difficulties with this particular job. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the clients.
good,"•	Meeting and greeting customers"
good,"Overall, people were great as well as store management.  Retail is challenging in itself, but during peak volume such as Back to School and Black Friday, work life is a lot more challenging.  It's difficult to maintain a life outside of work when you're working 8-10 days straight."
good,"Very demanding job, not recommendable if you have to travel long distances as your typical day ranges from 10-14 hours."
good,It is a retail business and as such the wage is average and there is no real job security. It is more suited to a younger range of employees.
good,It was a productive job when working in the copy and print center. Learned a couple computer systems and how to work some of the printing machines
good,I would arrive to work 15 to 30 minutes early and clean the restrooms... Once the doors opened I was to stay near the register to assist customers with checking out and finding the product they were looking for and to get them the assistance they needed... It wasn't a bad job but that is all it was a job... With three kids to support by myself and Staples made it nearly impossible to support my family only giving me 15 to 20 hours a week... I am looking for a career and Staples wasn't getting me there... If management had kept to their word and promoted me I would probably still be there...
good,Working at staples was very educational as well as stressful when dealing with upset customers. As Technology grows with computers and printing you advance by learning new softwares and equipment on a dailey basis.
good,"manager was sub par and liked to belittle associates on the sales floor in front of other associates and customers.  the company was good.  great benefits,tuition reimbursement"
good,"Open store, run daily reports, check payroll and all cash office duties. Set up daily cash tills. Front end customer service. Training new associates. Receiving our trucks. manage all freight crew. Back up in the copy center, back up the front end. Put freight out on sales floor."
good,"Much of the work at staples revolves around customer service and manual labor. I was hired as an associate there that does computer repair, however in the end all that I was doing was trying to sell services and putting out product. "
good,"Flexible when it came to weekly hours as well as fun and entertaining coworkers. Workload wasn't too much, but management was a bit pushy at times and took it out on the employees when dpt wasn't what they hoped and would even pit associates against each other every now and then to try and boost morale when it did quite the opposite. Rude and entitled customers every now and then, but most were generally nice."
good,Great company on store level. District and higher management seem to be out of touch with day to day store life. Vistors from headqauters would have liitle traing on stores ops.
good,"This company has totally changed in the 7 years I have worked for them.  Went from great place to work and really enjoyable, one of the better retail management jobs, to no appreciation and no job/home life balance."
good,"My job is not only to push sales for the store but also to train and cultivate people to the next level. Over the 11 years I have worked for Staples I have learned many things from different managers to pool together and pull a little from each to put towards my management style.  I have worked every department and the enjoyable parts are the customer and associates, as well as the tasks.  Multi tasking is another aspect of the job I like as well no one day is the same as the other no matter if you try to plan them that way, and that's what makes the job fun"
good,"very annoying , requires you to always be on your feet !!, and I'm not stressing the fact that you must be smiling at all times , no excuses"
good,I love working with clients in the copy center. But I feel that the management doesn't care about the copy center workers. We have to skip lunches and no breaks because 95% of the times we working 8 hours shifts alone.
good,Good local management. Staples states that it promotes from within but I am skeptical. I like the people I work with although too much red tape when it comes to disciple of associates for not doing what they should be doing.
good,The environment and co workers were amazing. But the management could use some work. Great benefits. I learned how to operate forklifts.
good,"The company as a whole is ok, but due to the recent changes the work atmosphere hasn't been productive. The transportation department does not consider the family life of the employee."
good,"occasionally get some interesting computer works/projects, but it compares well with typical retail positions, I have had a worse jobs for sure"
good,"over all at the store level the company has management and co-workers that are easy to work with.  At the corporate level however, the company is very greedy, dis-honest, and does not care at all about any of the employees physical or mental well-being that work at store level"
good,"It's fine if it's your first or second job. To get you started with your experience, working at Staples is fine. I've acquired many skills that will further benefit me in other fields."
good,"A typical day included working in the copy center and using the computer to design projects for the customers mostly in Microsoft Publisher and Adobe Photoshop, as well as operating the cash register. I've learned how to deal with people in the best manner, and how to handle them when they are angry or upset. Management worked around school schedules and personal lives pretty well. Management, at times, seemed unorganized and not able to lead the team. My co-workers were hardworking individuals who had Staples in their best interest. The hardest part of working at Staples was having to self-manage at times and getting managers to help you when asked. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to meet many new people and learning how to use different computer programs."
good,"Not to busy. Learned printers laptop and tablets, some phones. Management is okay, co-workers don't stay long. Hardest thing is inventory. The most enjoyable part of working here was the customers."
good,"I was hired as a Cashier, then the company changed us all over as Sales Associates. It wasn't too bad as a ""sales associate"". My job was to check out people, maintain front end and what not. Unfortunately, the job was not always so easy. There's usually an opener shift (8-4) and a closing shift (2-Close) employee. Rarely there's a midshift (10-6) and usually it's new hires being trained by one of us. As a opening shift employee (I think it's easier than closing) your job is to do the morning paperwork and input the rewards into the system. (Which is usually done during the slow hours when no customer is around) When I did them I usually showed up to work 10 minutes early (before the store opened) to do it. "
good,"My background includes serving as a technology and office supplies associate within a retail environment. Currently, I have been working at Staples as a technology associate since 2011, where my responsibilities include: selling items such as laptops, computers, and other electronics. Also, I helped to inform customers of product specifications as well as with buying decisions. On occasion, I also perform services on customers’ personal computers such as diagnostics, virus removal, and software and hardware installation. "
good,There was no order with scheduling or sick leave. Only one person working at  time. Management has no respect for work-life balance.
good,"Diverse company with room for growth. "
good,"I was employed at Staples for 6 years and reported into 4 different managers. While all the styles were very different, only one provided a good work/life balance - which was very important to me as a new Mother. I ultimately decided to leave Staples for opportunities that would better suit my experience and professional goals while allowing me to balance out family responsibilities."
good,"retail sales,motivated employees, I learned to multi-task in fast paced retail environment.  I feel the quality in staples is very good but they increased product prices to a higher value due to lower sales, people really noticed."
good,"I spent my day prospecting for new business, cold calling, setting up appointments and meeting with prospective clients. When meeting with the prospects I would talk about our program and how it could save them money on Office, janitorial, IT supplies. My management is fairly supportive. I do not work with my co-workers on a day to day basis because I mainly worked from my home. But they are always there if I have a question or a problem. The hardest part of my job is trying to explain to customers that Staples sells more then just office supplies. The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting new people and helping to save them money."
good,"Rarely got my breaks, the managers were never around to deal with customers issues, as the lack of organization at this store created friction between employees and managers. It was a hostile work environment filled with inappropriate banter and conversation from our managers, from sexist to racist remarks, calling out of work due to sickness was like being asked to be berated relentlessly the next day at work. "
good,"OK to work there, but they need to change how they treat their employees, management was alright."
good,"I would say If you are starting your career with Staplesfuture then trust me you are at the right place. I n this company you will get to learn lot of things & you will get a good exposure in early stage of your career. But company is not a good paymaster. You ll get salary on time for sure. "
good,"High expectations of employees, fast paced enviornment. Not very understanding with personal life."
good,I will not work for Staples again. Even the local forklift dealer refused to repair the MHE. My first day on the job I locked out 50% of the lift equipment due to the condition of the lift chains. The list goes on
good,It's minimum wage. I get paid for standing there. My coworkers are cool. My job is boring and not using me to my full potential.
good,As a cashier we had to do returns and exchanges as well. The work wasn't really difficult but since it was an office supplies store it was a little difficult to remember where small supplies are located especially when a customer asks and you don't know where it is. The management was ok and the coworkers was really nice.
good,"No commute made it better. Hard to promote into management, I was told by management that I was to good with customers to promote to managemnt"
good,"I thought working as an easy tech at staples would be a good way to keep my skills sharp and earn some money. But I spent my time running registers and answering phones and trying to sell service plans. I took the easy tech cert test and passed but heard nothing about actually doing any tech work. I have a degree in tech and I have many years of pc repair experience. Oh well the test was super easy like they were afraid someone would fail it. "
good,"You are provided with a lot of options to grow and are allowed a lot of ownership to learn as much as you can. Compensation is very low, and expectations are very high. The best part of the job is being able to create a great environment for your associates. The hardest part of the job is performing with an under staffed team while tasking, and very low pay."
good,"Most of my time working here was spent either at the cash register or working in the receiving location. My training was completed in a few days and I went to work right away. Unfortunately, the store was severely understaffed and the rest of the employees had to make up for that fact. Management was scarce and the few superiors for whom I worked were so busy that they did not have time to check for quality of work. My co-workers were very easy to get along with and were very helpful. The most challenging part of this job was having to learn where most of the merchandise went (due to the specific UPC's used) and the sheer quantity of diverse but similar materials. The best part about this job was that it was never truly busy so the stress level was diminished due to this fact."
good,if You Need a steady  with OKAY pay...and really really bad Management but overall cool co-working staples! dont do sales if u want to keep ya job long but if you are a good sales men you a king to them and can get away with m#rder
good,"Staples was a great company, the customers and some of the staff will be sorely missed. However the General Manager was flighty to say the least. She had no control over the store and on many occasions left the store in the lurch while she called off or worked easy schedules. I wish things could have gone better, but I had no control over that situation, and made repeated complaints to her individually, and the upper management."
good,Unless your just out of high school dont bother since the pay and training is laughable.
good,"Staples keeps telling its employees we need to cut back and make sacrifices but jobs are constantly sent offshore, staff is laid off, and more work are assign to those who are left.  Yet upper management doesn't seem to be affected and the CEO takes millions of dollars in bonuses as the employees who make sacrifices and perform all the hard work are denied bonuses and are given low annual increases."
good,Dias com muita pressão por parte dos responsáveis para conseguir atingir a meta diária de vendas. Aprendi que a satisfação do cliente garante com que o mesmo volte mais vezes. Por parte da gerência há um foco muito grande em se conseguir vender. Grupo de trabalho muito bom e funcional. O poder satisfazer e ajudar os clientes a saírem satisfeitos e contentes com as compras efectuas era o mais gratificante.
good,"A typical day at Staples would be filled with a range of challenges to over come, from Customer related issues to changes with the Business."
good,"Staples was very good with being flexible with my schedule because I was in college. I really enjoyed that I had days to myself to catch up on assignments and etc. Overall, I am not too fond with this company. Staples isn't and never will be the company for me. I don't fit in. A typical day was being isolated behind the register for hours not being able to have the opportunity to become familiar with changes of the store which became hard when customers had questions about specific products. The rewards program was partially beneficial but 80% of my customers would always complain about recycling ink but never receiving their rewards. The protect plans were confusing. People though buying the plans meant you can bring your product back to the store when you couldn't. The 10% associate discount sucked, may as well pay full price unless you have a huge purchase. Management played favoritism. Only time I spoke with management was for authorizations and nothing more. Don't go into this business looking for friends because sometimes retail can be like High School. A bunch of adults talking about other associates rather than accompanying their customers! Management was also LAZY. All they did was sit on their behinds while the associates tried to juggle too many things at once. The most enjoyable part about the job was leaving your shift. You aren't paid enough hear and they expect you to be their slave. Others will have different experiences but this is mine."
good,"welcoming customers, collecting payments, perfect for first time workers"
good,"As far as retail positions go, this job was okay. But limited opportunities and wages have forced me to look for work elsewhere."
good,"A typical day at work for me was dealing with stock in the warehouse section of the store and bringing it out to the sales floor and placing items where they belonged. I also helped get office furniture to some customers vehicles. The days seemed long, the work was tiring after a while, always on your feet the entire time, and while the managers were helpful, I found it to not be some place I'd like to work at again. It just isn't my type of work."
good,Having to multi-task to produce job orders handel phone calls and web orders was a typical day. I enjoyed the people who came in on a regular basis. The difficult part was not meeting your deadline.
good,At the Staple's I worked at management was inconsistent  but the pay was okay for retail.
good,"The job requirements are to explain technology to customers to get them to purchase. Other requirements were inventory, stocking shelves and janitorial needs at the end of the night. I've learned how to word my explanations to the average consumer, so that they understand the most complicated tech in the most simplest terms. My co-workers were a nice bunch for the most part. The hardest part of the job was understanding different management methods from the various managers that reported for duty. One manager liked things in one order, the other like them another way and things at times were conflicted. The best part about my job was learning about the latest technology everyday all the time, and explaining how tech can really help a person who was none the wiser before he walked into the store."
good,Left due to lack of opportunity for advancement without having to consider relocaton
good,"I began work for Staples Rego Park in it's infancy. The store had just been built and went through several management changes. Somedays we didn't even have a manager which made goals, tasks, and helping customers more difficult. But overall it was a great experience and it was a fun, more laid back environment."
good,"Staples is the kind of job you have to be in shape for, you must come prepared to work hard. There's a lot a lot of stretching, straining, bending & heavy lifting involved when working in the bulk department. Its not really about fun as much as it is about strategy, getting the job done in a quick & safe manner."
good,paper is out.  pencils are out.  it's all about mobility and change.  staples will not be around for too much longer.
good,"Great experience, but I felt I was not compensated according to the amount of work I did, Often times I would be over whelmed and the rest of the store would be empty and I would have to request assistance rather than the managers sending additional support. "
good,"Seems to be okay from the outside, but from the inside you find out that company is full of a bunch of hypocrites and liars."
good,The ignore any existing skills you have. Someone with a computer related degree and training may end up cashiering for over a year.
good,"A typical day at work would involve helping customers with any questions and concerns. I was responsible for unloading trucks and working the freight, if the day called for it. Most days i would cover breaks and do back up cashier. I built chairs and sold furniture daily. i also was trained at the copy center, so i guess i could say i was a well rounded individual at this company. "
good,"The coworkers were pretty cool, customers were decent but management sucked [back in '10]. Not sure what it is like now but a typical day consisted of sales, organizing tags, making and taking calls from customers and learning about the new products they were selling."
good,"Staples is a good company, but they do not seem to understand how a sales environment is supposed to be & people do not feel safe in their positions. "
good,"Typical day was coming and checking the tickets on the computers  that were being fixed and making sure they were on schedule. In my down time i sold computers and help people with hardware to purchase. The management at my store were not very good. I loved my coworker. Hardest part, making sure time deadly things were done. Most enjoyable was working with diverse people"
good,"Staples is a nice place to work. A typical day at work is about average and everybody tries to do their fair share of work. I have learned a little about how to diagnose computers. I have got plenty of customer service experience. My co-workers are good and cooperative, we have a pretty good team. The hardest part of the job would be maintaining the stores presents and keeping it looking nice because the computer work is what I enjoy and the team is awesome to work with. The most enjoyable part of the job is the team."
good,"Working for Staples for over 4 years, and in different periods... Staples as a company has changed a lot, especially with the economy. They do not hire full time much any more, or offer full time employment to many. It's been a roller coaster ride with the company. I have witness MANAGEMENT losing their positions due to reconstruction of the company, so job security isn't high."
good,"It was OK to work at Staples, made a lot of good friends, but some of the management staff left a lot to be desired."
good,"To keep it short, the people that I have met working there are great however the ""restructuring"" that is currently taking place makes almost no job offered worth the pittance that is payed. I actually enjoyed the job prior to the management cuts and labor reduction. The company seems to think that cutting its losses is going to save them money. No bonuses, no help from the upper levels and even less help from the upper levels."
good,"I dont enjoy working here. a typical day at work is filled with stress, rude customers, bad management, and employees constantly calling out so I have to take on a heavier workload."
good,Staples is a decent company to work for. I've been with them for over 10 years but the company has grown away from taking care of the associates that have been with them. Management is often hired from outside the company when in fact they have great associates that have dedicated years to them but often look over them to hire from the outside. They have gone through many changes that seem in the best interest for customers and associates but at times seems like they are more interested in their bottom line. I really do enjoy working with customers and co-workers though at times management gets too personally involved in our lives. I've seen much favoritism over the years as well. I wish the company could have been frozen in time 3 years ago.
good,"Just not a great place to work to be honest. Bad management, bad money, no benefits, no hours."
good,"In my current position, the primary focus is on the costumer and their satisfaction. Our goal is to have every costumer leave having a pleasant experience, whether they make a purchase or not. The means of accomplishing this range from stocking shelves efficiently, keeping the store clean, greeting all costumers and solving problems they may have. There's always a total solution available for the costumer's needs, sometimes requiring inventive approaches and lateral thinking."
good,"I hate this place with every fiber in my body. I wish I never started working here, it makes me want to vomit every time I punch in."
good,"Ok but , not excellent."
good,"I would check my shelves to see if any product needed filled.I would shot a pull list to fill those empty spots,attended to customers request about varies thing's.Cleaned the store at the end of shift if I closed."
good,Very high paced and fast environment. Must be independent as upper management are never on the same page and expect different things from associates. Very little advancement as retail industry is on the decline and so are the wages paid at Staples.
good,"I started my day by reading the job board. I then started in finishing , starting with the hot jobs first. I performed cutting , binding ,stitching ,"
good,theres not trust within the management but everybody still keeps a positive attitude
good,"A typical day at work i would start in the morning open up with a manager, get the shop floor ready for the store to open. Once opened i would deal with day to day tasks like serving customers dealing with problems and stock replenishment."
good,"This business was an experience for inventory counts. Didn't mind the job, but didn't like how I had to document people for everything little or small thing they did wrong. Would have rather coached them."
good,Very easygoing workers. Likes working with customer and each other.
good,"So working in the copy and print center at Staples was anything but calm, between printer problems and five hundred page orders there was always something going on in the print center. Depending on what shift you started on your day would be either more or less busy, but it was always busy."
good,"PROS: Company benefits are exceptional, Annual salary increase though small is conducted annually."
good,"typical day at work helping customers all day with different inquires, shelfing different items and products, learned about customer service and how to deal with all types of people, management was good, co-workers were friendly and hardest part of the job was nothing really and most enjoyable was putting a smile on customers faces."
good,"Staples was an ok job, but the pay, benefits, and advancement options for the amount of work done as a Resident Tech / Certified Onsite Tech, and basically doing the Lead's job were not nearly justifiable."
good,It's great place to start career. Students and beginners will learn how to work in retail. Working with customers directly is also a good experience for beginners.
good,"Flexible hours, some respectful employees, at times my manager came in to work with attitudes, got smart when asking questions for customers he was barely even there to see what was going on with some of the employees. And the shadiness  that was going on behind my back. Tried to even talk to my manager about the situation but he seemed not interested"
good,"I didn’t really feel like part of the team, never really got any opportunity to move up. I liked working with some of the people there but some of the time the customers would make work there miserable if management wasn’t already."
good,"A great place to work with friendly staff, sometimes stressful but overall a great environment. the day consists of selling stuff to customers and attempting to build a connection."
good,"a good job to learn how retail works and reaching company goals, but not for long term. Depending on your department, you may learn more skills than in another department"
good,This company is very set on numbers. They also value their customers and look for a full solution for the customer.There is not very much job security. They will allow for advancement but the job security in advancement is little to none.
good,"I enjoyed working there with the team I was apart of and the customers, I enjoyed helping. I wouldn't mind working there again. I feel as though if I was given  a second opportunity I could advance further in the store and in helping the company."
good,At first it was fun then they started cutting my hours till they had me working 3 hours a week. I was the first person everyone saw coming into the store and leaving it.
good,"After being with the company for 5 and a half years, I have literally held every position the retail stores offer (Sales/ Customer Service/ Receiver/ Copy Associate/ Technician/ Key Holder)."
good,Pay took a year to increase 40 cents. The company needs to pay better or turnover rates will be too high because of student employees coming and going.
good,"Staples FC is a good place to work for a few years, but as the years add on the more dysfunctional and the work place politics sink it to be more discouraging to want to be there more, and no place for a career investment for you to want to be there any longer then you want too."
good,"Constant changes, laying off departments by the dozen. Never know if you're up next. They had period ""staples financial reviews"" they make you watch and mention our huge debt and how much we're under budget."
good,I had a poor experience with Staples as I was lied to about the obligations with the company. I was told I would be doing 75% repair and 25% sales when in reality it was 95% sales and 5% of stocking and registers
good,"love the customers and the staff, great opportunity to coach train and build sales. The company is rebranding its self and doing a wonderful job of creating a new culture"
good,"Good for high school kids, but anyone looking to advance quickly should look somewhere else. They'll outsource management jobs, so once you make supervisor you're basically stuck."
good,"Staples is a strong retail environment and moved more toward a suggestive selling environment. The pay is more conducive for students, you would see a higher pay when you moved into a supervisory role."
good,"I've learned talking with customers just taking the extra time with them can make finding a item for them less stressful for them and helps with their shopping experience, builds trust, and they end up coming back. Seeing a customer come back and building a relationship over time and seeing how their business grows brings joy."
good,"Used to be a nice place to work, but not now. There was little turnover and we had fun at work. Come in do your job, make calls and sell stuff. Now the consultants, analysts, and micromanagers have a metric for everything for every second of the day."
good,I don’t like the working environment of staples.people would not communicate at times and that is what I don’t really like about it overall. Chemistry isn’t there.
good,"Days are fairly standard once I got adjusted to my area, which took about a month. In the tech area they are focused on making sales with customers, so do your best to fulfill that otherwise management might want to move you to a different area."
good,Management was horrible and very mean. I enjoyed the job itself but not the management as they were constantly criticizing and made staff feel stupid. I believe that has changed now.
good,"I was at staples for almost 3 months and I'll go off my experience. my store was fairly sized and constantly dirty. Nobody was giving roles when it comes to actually cleaning the store and my GM was cheap as H*** and never wanted to use the stores money to buy products to clean ,such as a new vaccum (probably cause it eat some of his bonuses) Our store was so dirty we even had rats for a few weeks till he finally did something. That aside, the main thing they look for from you is how much you are making in ""service plans"" for the store. Service plans are basically warranties plans and they expect you to get a decent amount every day which is unrealistic. If you don't meet your quotas after awhile, they heavily cut your hours. I was in a really bad dry spell for 2 weeks and went from 34 hours a week to about 13. If you do sell a ton, your hours are safe but you get nothing to show for it. No commission, no end of the month bonus like Bestbuy, nothing! You are also responsible for technical work too like on costumer computers,  which I was excited for, but most of the time you just connect it to an agency at a different location and have them work on the computer for you remotely. you do very basic stuff like doing the initial setup for new devices or data transfer and configurations. Boring stuff. Overall not the best place to work, my store was poorly managed and I didn't get paid well at all but what I did like about this place was getting to know costumers and help them find what they need and most of my coworkers were fine for the most part. I say work at Bestbuy if you can,"
good,"Staples has been a decent place for me to get a good understanding for what is possible in a retail environment."
good,"I found this job depends heavily on management. I've had some managers who are more relatable, and others who breathe down your back with every move you make. Didn't feel very appreciated by most of management. I'd say overall, not terrible, but if you can help it, don't stay for more than two years. It's at that point where they try to overwork and underpay, and really start to take advantage of you. Job is very secure, but unless you dedicate your life to the job, you will not advance. People are great, but you have to break through that initial cliquey sort of stage."
good,"Started off As cashier, it was easy. Moved up to price auditor & not so great. I’m constantly Asked to help out & back up cashier way too much. Takes a lot of time away from my primary job. It’s suck more because no one helps me in my position. So if it doesn’t get done it just piles up on me. There’s never enough staff so I keep getting interrupted. Definitely not worth the pay."
good,A typical day at work would be for us to just try and sell anything that was electronic or technical with a warranty to make our sales numbers go up. The day mainly consisted of cleaning anything dirty or restocking empty shelves.
good,"Working at Staples for 11 years really placed a stress on me that only was taken away by leaving the company. Far too many responsibilities with little compensation, recognition, or reward.  Management was poor, and upper management in the company changed for too often. The company doesn't have a clear path or plan to success."
good,"Managers are great people who can teach a lot to you, but there is a noticeable gap between corporate and these managers. Non-competitive pay, unrealistic sales goals with no motivation to reach them, and somewhat decent hours."
good,I'm not one for upselling or the idea behind it. It's a numbers game and it's easy to get to the at this store. It's a good way to get experience in the tech field for the computer industry.
good,Staples created a great program to sell their product. Great talk track and good training.  Unrealistic ideas of what was actually able to be provided to the customers.  Probably one of the best introductory outside sales B2B jobs you could have.
good,"Customer appointments 50 per month"
good,"A typical day at work involves replenishment of stock, updating inventory, printing price tags, effectively merchandising stock to drive sales and dealing with customers to find the items they require.  "
good,"I left because of low wage. If that does not bother you than it is a great place to be. I enjoyed my time, good luck. The shirts were very comfortable."
good,"worklife balance in my group was amazing due to Director input"
good,"I worked in print and marketing. I absolutely loved my job, working with people and the printers was fantastic. I picked it up quickly after starting as a cashier and flew through my training. However, it felt like being in high school all over again. The GM was fantastic and a good guy, and most of the shift managers were awesome, but it was all drama all the time. It was exhausting."
good,The company is in a transitionary phase where they're not exactly sure what kind of a business they want to be. Depending on the kind of person you are this could be a benefit or a drawback.
good,"Staples, Inc. is an American multinational office supply retailing corporation. It currently comprises over 1,500 stores in North America. Headquartered in Framingham, Massachusetts, Staples also does business extensively with enterprises in the United States and Canada, and as Staples Business Advantage."
good,"From logistics (transport) warehouse and website issues, many ongoing issues, for many years, cause many problems, however management does not have interest to fix things to improve business and be competetive with the likes of AMAZON"
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the customers. I am a people person by nature and being able to help the customers in guiding them to the correct technology to fit their needs was very rewarding.
good,"Overall, working at Staples was a pleasant experience because I loved working with my co-workers; however, the work schedule was not very flexible. The training was basically learn as you go."
good,"Hard working"
good,"Most employees are great"
good,"I enjoyed most of my time at Staples in the two years I worked there. It was a good job for my college schedule and my managers were always willing to work with me on when I need certain days off. My wage was adequate enough. Most coworkers until the end were friendly and I never felt disliked by them. Most everyone got along and the real conflict would be with customers who don't want to listen or sales goals."
good,"If you keep to yourself and like taking orders from people who wont do it themselves, hop on board. Pay is low for the work load, hours are iffy. Lots of infighting, turf wars it seems despite working in the same store!"
good,"I enjoyed my position because it was generally fast paced workload on average. I learned how  operate photo and print software to satisfy the customers needs and wants. The workplace environment was usually pretty calm and friendly, but I would of preferred that certain positions such as the print & marketing position got a higher pay grade than it did."
good,"This is a good job for those who are in school. If you are good at selling and making up a pitch to ring in a good market basket, this is a place for you.  There are rarely opportunities for overtime. This is a very fast paced job. You need to be 100% in it to win it. Jobs may include: cashier, sales associate, stocking shelves, inventory specialists, print And marketing center, occasionally cleaning the bathroom, selling the Staples More account aka a credit card, selling protection plans with chairs, electronics, furniture. Cool part is you get a 10% employee discount and an additional 10% off if you buy Staples brand merch."
good,"The workplace culture is good and diversified. What I enjoyed most is the people you are surrounded by. They always try to help you achieve your goals, and bring out the best in you. Your team members are always trying to promote you to the next level. With this comes some pros and cons. Upper management does not always promote you."
good,To many people want to be in charge. Dont listen to employee complaints. Some teamwork.  Some good people that want to make Staples great but those are the ones that leave.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of maintaining a clean environment by cleaning facility floors by sweeping, mopping, scrubbing, or vacuuming them, including cleaning and sanitizing restrooms/bathrooms by using established practices and procedures such as mixing water and detergents into containers to prepare cleaning solutions daily to perform routine and comprehensive custodial maintenance of assigned facilities including emptying wastebaskets into pickup containers that were picked up trash from designated areas including tearing down boxed cardboard into trash compactor. I learned how to manage my time by keeping up with the pace by being able to maintain a clean environment. I received great helpful tips of advice from management by them giving me a layout plan on how I should manage my time to get my duties done in a timely fashionable organized matter. The workplace culture was diverse and equal because it gave employees of different backgrounds and cultures an opportunity to gain experience that they may have or have not had prior to working there. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep the breakroom maintained clean and organized on a regular basis because no one seemed to care about keeping it cleaned and organized. The most enjoyable part of the job was that I was able to keep myself active on a regular basis where I was able to make my work day go by quickly."
good,"The work is not that difficult, it is a very fast pace job and may be tiring at times. During summer season is very hot in the warehouse. There are fans but barely will feel them since you will be moving constantly. Water or Gatorade will be provided if temperatures are to high. The big disappointment is the lack of management, for my experience it showed very unprofessional manners, no respect to employees and it seems like there is a preference in the work environment.  Somedays are better than others, but like any job as long as you do what you're supposed to, then you should be fine. The staff (non-management) for the most part are great, I never had any issues. We tried to compete in a fun way and make each others day, always caring for one another.  That was the only thing that pushed me through my day."
good,Working at staples can be fun with the right people. Team work is essential to success. Staples is very goal driven and about the numbers. Goals are given not based on the community the store is in but on what the top stores numbers are and what they believe we should be doing in order to make profit. Puts pressure on those in management to perform as well as get the staff to do well. My store had the highest turnover in the company in my 3 years there I’ve seen complete staff changes little over 100 different people. Not to mention pressure from outside vendors to do stuff they need done on top of store needs.
good,"Fast paced and a fun job, but management at the higher levels  kept making the experience less enjoyable, expecting more for less. The constant puss to make the company more money became more blatant and transparent as time went on."
good,"The job/work itself is fine, and the hours i work are manageable, but the managers don't hold people accountable for their actions as much as they should, and my co-workers tend to goof off without any fear of repercussions from the managers because the managers are often goofing off as well"
good,"I would not recommend this company to work for as it is still going through major changes and many job losses."
good,Staples only trained me of the cash register before they put me at the register by myself with no help. they only train you in one part of the store and just expect you to already know how to do everything to their liking.
good,If you are looking for an entry level job then staples would be a good suggestion. It is easy to learn and fun to help people while you are on the job.
good,"The employees are great and everyone was caring. Upper management can come down hard on you if you make a simple mistake. Once it slowed down, they laid off a lot of people. They will either work you like a dog and lay you off."
good,i was hired to be assistant manager in training for the Tech department. I have a degree in Computer Science so I thought I was going to be fixing computers and setting up networks. Instead the guy i was suppose to replace was doing all the tech work  and they had me stocking printers and selling office equipment.
good,"The managers were not treating me with respect, rather they treated me as a slave and looked down at me as being inferior to them.  I am not inferior to them.  I am a loyal and conscientious employee who was flexible in the times of the week and number of days and hours of the week the managers required me to work, often times on short notice.  I always arrived at work at least a half hour prior to the time my shift was to start, and if requested, I would clock out when my shift was over and donate my time to cleaning up the store and stocking shelves.  On the day I decided I've had enough of being treated with disrespect by my manager, I clocked out prior to the time my shift was over and was fired for clocking out prior to the time my shift was over.  At this point, I was relieved I was fired because it was my intention to quit.  I am glad and satisfied with myself for standing up for myself, and have no regrets and hold no animosity toward the manager who fired me.  I choose to tell the truth to anyone rather than tell a lie."
good,Staples was a great company to work for. Would recommend to someone starting their career. There has been some volatility in the market place due to online competition.
good,"At first I liked the company but my last year there they laid a bunch of people off company wide in the printing department which is what keeps the company going. Also they closed 4 stores in my region so it was merged with another because the company is.loosing money. They fired people, made currently employees pick up there work for the same pay and less hours. Not enough tome in the day to do it all and not worth the pay. Also fired a lot of good employees."
good,Ik heb binnen Staples veel mogen leren op het gebied van Sales.
good,This job was stressful. I worked in the copy and print department and customers would demand their orders be done same day or within an hour. Management was rarely available to assist.
good,"At Staples, a typical day consisted of clocking in, checking customers out, stocking, and cleaning up when closing. It is a pretty easy job, but there are setbacks. First and foremost, the management seems to be average, with at least two in the store every day. The workplace culture is semi-relaxing as we all help each other out with any given tasks. The hardest part of the job is trying to meet the sales goals. The most enjoyable part is that there is flexible scheduling."
good,"Here's what it's like working at Staples:"
good,Staples is one of them companies where you dont grow at a fast pace environment and its a place of retail like other places where you have to earn your next position and wait for it
good,All of your coworkers are really nice. There are days when everyone brings in food and some coworkers will even bring in donuts to the morning shifts.
good,I was hired to fix some stores as the GM but was not paid what I was promised and the culture that they have all over the stores is talked about but they don't live by those principles
good,The equipment in the copy department was bad and always braking down. They never had enough help in this department and only offered low hours per week
good,The managers cared little for the employees and were very unprofessional at times. I was part time and worked full time hours without compensation and the job was very stressful.
good,"Wasn't great, wasn't bad. The worst part were the random hours, and trying to convince me to come in on days off. Everyone was nice enough, however the managers were terrible."
good,"Good place with flexible hours, but you had to pay for training up front and were not reimbursed. You also had to pay for long distance calls and were not reimbursed."
good,"Staples is an okay company, but as the office product world continues to decline, it has become worse.  Poor management, pressure to sacrifice quality for productivity, and cheaper tools causing problems have all created issues."
good,"Was very fun, pretty easy and good environment. Manager were very fun to be around and worked with you if you were having a hard time, overall so far my favorite job I've had."
good,"Started in tech department and worked my way up to Operations Supervisor. This position actually in Lakeland, FL. Loved my job except management was not the best. The job was a little bit of everything with a lot of responsibilities. Went downhill in the end and I was terminated after 3 years on bogus allegations."
good,When youre working that place shouldnt only be your job but also some where you look forward to. Everyone should be treated equally not through favoritism.
good,Show up in the morning start up copy center machines run full prep. review orders and begin working. This is a good starting job for Retail but you cant make a living working here.
good,"A typical day working at staples is clocking in and helping out in different departments this including janitorial."
good,Staples asks a lot of their employees and they must be cross-trained in many areas.  At times the workload is overwhelming.  Customers in my store were very demanding because it was an upscale neighborhood.
good,"Slow store with inadequate help."
good,Exspect you to do other jobs with out time to finish required job. I have no problem helping the team but like to finish my job requirements also. Might be for others.
good,"Fun job, but understaffed, overworked, and underpaid with generally absent management. Normally solo-operating entire print center, including self-service machines and UPS drop offs with no formal training."
good,My division was sold to Taylor Communications so my job no longer exists at Staples. The manager I had and most of the upper management were either eliminated or went to Taylor. I have no current knowledge of jobs at Staples or management.
good,"I applied to be in the Print & Marketing department, however it has been 3 months since I've been hired and have not been to that department (despite the managers telling me that they would get me there). Each shift, I am at the register and considering that the particular store I work at has a low volume, the days can drag. I have not learned anything new nor have I utilized the skills I posses. It should be noted that my experience is  entirely independent and does not represent the company as a whole."
good,"It was an ok working experience not much to do, sometimes very demanding and overall the Staples that I was employed had few employees and we was over workedx"
good,"Should you find yourself at the Print and Marketing Associate position , you will be subjected to juggling a large quantity of projects while also entertaining anywhere from 3 to 7 customers at the same time."
good,"Worked in a staples print hub, typical day would often entail having to print many different jobs from many different branches of the company. Pay was not very competitive, but the work was overall enjoyable"
good,"The fellow coworkers were nice and management was well done, however there are very few full time positions available and part time hours and pay were very low."
good,Typical retail environment.  Different managers and staff with different areas of problems in each store that a roving technician had to work in.  Twenty years would of seen a lot of changes.
good,Working at Staples as a sales associate really left the impression that you are simply working there for the money.  The management does not interact with you well.
good,"I did enjoy working at the Staples location in Hanover, until we got a new General Manager in I believe Febuary. He's rude, and exxtremly inconsiderate. His little side-kick is supposedto be the Tech Supervisor but doesn't even know how to fix a phone. They're both very shady and unorganized. So many assocaites have quit since they've started. They're hopefully going to get what coming to them soon."
good,I worked in several departments of the Staples store. It was fast paced and we were short handed. To do well there you must be able to go outside of your comfort zone.
good,"there is some favoritism involved where some people are reprimanded for something small while others don't see any reprimands - the company focus changes every other month and goals for employees constantly change and it throws off the balance of ""what the main goal is"""
good,Not a bad part time if you're a student. Pay is okay. the hardest part was that you were expected to work hard for little reward. Bonuses might as well not be a thing and neither is moving up. learnt a lot about selling.
good,"The location at which i worked at for Staples, the individuals were like family. We helped each other out no matter the task, and treated one another how we wanted to be treated. We defended each other in situations where customers became disrespectful and lifted each other up."
good,"wear multiple hats, enables working many different skills to be developed. The many changes the industry is going through in timing with the private equity takeover has caused a decrease in opportunities."
good,"objectives already given out start of shift. great people at the workplace."
good,It was a great place to work for.  Unfortunately business changes as they went private and eliminate jobs and areas of the company.  
good,Working at staples was interesting. A typical day consisted of trying to make sales for the store. We would have to try and sell basic protection plans for high priced items and screen protection. The management at staples located in Framingham was poor. I personally felt like the hard working employees did not get enough respect as the managers would sit and not do much ( with the exception of a few). The culture and atmosphere was friendly and easy going. The hardest part of working at staples was having to deal with impatient customers who were in a hurry or had a problem with a past online order or a faulty item purchased in store. The most enjoyable part of working at staples was that i helped out many people with tech problems and i would enjoy seeing the smile on their face when my work had been completed on a faulty or broken machine.
good,"While most of the people you work alongside at this location will be great, the GM makes working there a miserable experience. GM is extremely inflexible with schedules, frequently disregards availability (regardless of how much heads-up is given), does not inform employees of benefits they may or may not have (paid-time off), and is a generally rude person to interact with."
good,"Scheduling was a nightmare.  There is a no accountability for employees who did not show up to a shift, and everyone else on the crew suffers.  I felt as if they thought I was still a child the way tasks were given to me and my associates."
good,"I really enjoyed helping create posters and booklets for the customers. I enjoyed helping customers check out, look for supplies and getting customers' orders ready in the Copy and Print Center. I loved to make stamps, also."
good,retail work with a great management team. Limited personal growth potential once reaching the management or full time level. Good company and good people
good,"This was years ago, but I was actually written up for attending my classes on a day that Staples said that I had to be a work. I told them that I HAD to attend this class since it was vital to my career choice. It's a good idea to learn how to do injections if you are going to be a medical assistant, right? Well, it went downhill from there..."
good,I enjoy working for Staples and the benefits are amazing. The downfall is we were just bought by a private company. They are doing a lot of layoffs and have completely changed the compensation for sales. Not a fan of not getting paid for extremely hard work.
good,"STAPLES was a very cookie-cutter retail experience. It did not allow for much leniency in policies from sales, to service, and customer interactions. While most of the team were very enjoyable people, some of the management lacked knowledge or care for customers, pressing sales until slight irritation. It did not make for a desirable work environment."
good,"I'm not really sure what to say other than it's a great way to make money for high-school and early college kids. The management at my location wasn't so great but then again, it's retail. The work isn't too taxing, they'll work around your schedule and the pay is pretty much what you'd expect. I never felt overworked or underpaid for the work I did at this job."
good,Calling book of business to generate leads and build rapport with clients.  I have to coach other Account managers to generate leads as well to ensure we work to grow the book of business YoY.  I attend trainings from different Manufacturers to learn more about their variety of products.
good,Pay is competitive and usually coworkers are friendly and fun to work with. Some ruin your time and take every sale possible from you and blame others for their mistakes. Awesome service and great products. Easy to learn no matter the job.
good,"Work-life balance can get a bit out of hand"
good,"I worked for staples for 1 year as a cashier, I had a good experiance with staples in the beginning, everyone was super nice and I learned a lot with the training they provided, over the year I wanted to move around to a different position/ department and I was promised so, I worked hard and did more then expected as a cashier but in the end did not get to move departments because I was good at my job... The management would not move me because I was good at my job despite my requests and preferences, I quit due to being bored and not gaining further experiance"
good,Environment will push you to grow and achieve high levels of results.  The impact for those who achieve will be advancement and strong earning potential.
good,"Since staples was sold it has gone down hill. Management, direction, vision....all of it has changed for the worse. Culture is not very good anymore and they are pushing people and talent out the door."
good,"Typical day at work, going on 2-3 appointments, cold calling, creating new lead generation, management has changed significantly. The hardest part of the job is finding a balance. The most enjoyable part of the job is the culture within the company, very rewarding when you helping a company save money!"
good,There is a lack of communication with the management team which means the associates get information very last minute. Our store manager is a boss and not a leader and does not have people skills nor does she show appreciation towards her employees.
good,"Years ago it was fun and tolerable to work here, now its a very basic punch in punch out kinda job. The people are nice to work with, the company has settled down into what it believes works best so its nice that all the little changes are over with... other than that nothin much more to say..."
good,Working at Staples was very hard. The Management wouldn't listen to suggestions. I worked 10 hours a day Monday-Thursday and then 8 hours on Friday.  I worked in different departments. I tried to relay that I wanted to work in specific departments but it didn't seem to register with my management team. I was unable to preform one of the jobs they gave me and they told me to quit. Overall I didn't have a positive experience with Staples.
good,Staples was/is an ok place to work. Very low pay compared to the things we do especially in the print and marketing department. My time at staples has been filled with high and lows. Which is why my rate is average nether really terrible or really good.
good,An OK job if you don't mind selling protection plans on o most everything. With sale goals to have to reach for while also having to push for rewards sign ups
good,"usually my days for the most part includes, stocking and cashier work. since I closed usually i have to clean up the store, grab karts, and put stuff away."
good,"Never on time with any reviews or raises, was supposed to have one after 3 months, never received it until month 7 which at that point i was already leaving this job"
good,"Working at Staples is a good first time job. the application was easy and it was a quick hire, but there is little chance of advancement and the roles that you are giving at times is meaningless. As a customer service associate/cashier, I was also janitor, sales rep, floor worker, mail receiver, and meant to get sign-up for insurance on products and well as credit card sign-ups. at time I felt under paid for the amount of work that I was doing."
good,"They can not retain good employees because they are not willing to invest in pay.  Below the management level, in many stores they do not hire full time in order to save on benefits."
good,"Worked 8-10 hour shifts, learned how to pack orders, very hot environment. The staff was very nice and helpful, the warehouse was very clean and well organized."
good,"This a great job for someone who is still in school or college, or first time job.Management is suckish, hours are too. You do a looot with little pay and no overtime allowed. You only get 10% off as benefits.  Not recommend if your over 20 unless your management."
good,The store has to many managers and it makes follow orders very confusing on top of that it seems like all of the higher ups just blame everything on the people at the bottem
good,"The ideal job for a high school graduate. The pay is low at the minimum wage and yearly raises consist of 5cents to the highest 35cents. Mostly hires part timers, full time positions not really available. Even as a manager the pay isn't great."
good,"Use to have so much passion for the job, but it all change, they cared less about development and more about profit, took away any chance of work life balance."
good,Working at Staples has made me more responsible I've matured a lot more I've grown to appreciate customers that are understanding and respectful to all employees.
good,"Staples Business Advantage has a great go-to market strategy for acquiring and maintaining clients. Great internal support teams and customer service. Highly recommend for interning or recent graduate, as you will have excellent on-boarding."
good,"Overall working here is boring and your assignments are very repetitive.  If you're young and interested in a part time then this is okay, but compensation is very low."
good,Poor management and no structure. it pays good but the sometimes want you to take on more responsibility than your job description requires.  benefits are good
good,"enjoyed working here during my days as a student, nothing really hard about working at staples other than bringing heavy boxes from over stock. over all good experience"
good,"Structure not set up for career advancement for associates. Are not able to create customer loyalty as to much turn-over. Huge influx of immigrants, hard to maintain store culture."
good,Learn a lot of useful skills to build a good sales base. Management is a bit out of touch and there is a lack of communication between internal support.
good,"Staples can be a very good place to work, depending on the store you decide to attend. Although the certain goals they would like you personally to meet as well as the store as a whole are just ridiculous. Also the management isn't the best. Neither are the advancement opportunists. I asked my manager multiple times about advancement, and he always gave me the same ""I promise I''ll get to it"" speech and he never did."
good,"Extremely difficult to advance, company does not promote within and talent is not appreciated but company is stable, provide decent pay and plenty of benefits."
good,Poor management but the money was ok for my position.  Very stressful and that's why I left.  Way too much stress for a Copy Supervisor position and too much expected for the pay given.  Great benefits and we did get holiday pay.
good,"Staples can sometimes be a very busy job and keep your days feeling short, but the people at staples can sometimes be very drama with gossiping amoung other and that can make the wok place uncomfortable in my experience."
good,"A Staples é uma empresa com um clima muito agradável de se trabalhar, porém precisa ajustar sua meritocracia e peca com falta de plano de carreiras."
good,"When I started here, I thought my main goal was to help customers. Turns out I needed to push ECP sales."
good,"They really try to work around my school and family restrictions. A great place to grow as a person and gain work experience, but not a place to stay for super long. The biggest current issue is a lack in communication between management and staff. Hopefully it improves with time."
good,Horrible management. Calm place to work at there are not too many people who visit this staples. They barely give hours. Did not enjoy working here at a
good,No real issues with the job except for hours and pay which is not the fault of management but of the company  as a whole. I would recommend them to anyone looking for a starter job.
good,I found that the company did not care enough for the people that work there.  Associated went years without a review or wage increase.  I also found it was disorganized around back to school time.
good,It was a good way to start learning about running a store.  I enjoyed working in the store and the people that worked for me.  Great day to day customer service environment but terrible bosses that visit the stores.
good,This job was a good start up job it paved the way of my print career. It teaches you about print production and how to handle a high customer volume base.
good,"Staples Corporate Headquarters is located at 500 Staples Drive, in Framingham, Massachusetts. They are an international company, with retail and online selling outlets."
good,"Associates where expected to sell sell sell. A lot of time was spent on training for the upsell. Ask questions, listen to your customers and provide what they need. Expectations where high and you where held accountable to delivering on those expectations."
good,This was a dynamic workplace.  The interactions among the employees and customers created many good experiences and a few less than good experiences.  I learned that I could change the work environment to benefit my position.  This was reinforced by some management sent by corporate to help bring up the bottom line.  I was commended for my efforts in organizing and leading the efforts necessary to increase the success of the store.
good,"Working at the Copy Center has taught me how to multitask better, but only because you are on your own and thrown to the wolves.  Machines constantly go down and need repairs, supplies are not always there, the online production center is not cooperative at all, and overall it was just a bad experience.  Everyone in the store is afraid to go over to the Copy Center because they see how tired and stressed the employees over there get.  Breaks do not always happen and we are lucky to even get away for a lunch."
good,"Staples was an ok job the customers we're really nice and so were my co workers, the workload was that hard to handle and everything was easy to do the only flaw was Management was terrible."
good,"Good staff and friendly faces. However, it's a smaller copy center than it should be for the amount of work that goes through those doors. It's a great place to work if you can multi-task, build customer relations, and have an understanding of basic graphic design."
good,"Its a retail position, usual retail complaints and opinions. "
good,"When I first started I was pretty happy being on the team that I was on.  The job was pretty busy, and I do think they could compensate way better.  The software seems pretty reliable, but the culture definitely does not prioritize its employees.  Some calls and interactions are rough because they are business clients.  Schools, government offices, and all sorts of businesses order from Staples.  Good work experience.  A lot of pressure and volatility from competitors like Amazon."
good,"hohes Potential am Markt, wird leider nicht konsquent ausgeschöpft ( Retail )"
good,I was given the opportunity to establish my customer service skills more and learn more about computers. I was also able to build my management skills at a young age.
good,"I worked at two separate Staples stores in Utah. As in any business, there were great differences in the stores I worked in do to management. Both mangers though, were willing to train well and work with my schedule. The job was low pressure, but very rewarding and there was room for advancement and improvement if one worked hard enough and sought it."
good,"Staples as whole is a mess of a company. My store, however, was a big exception. The general manager is one of the nicest people you could meet, and is willing to go the extra mile for customers and employees. The issues I have sit directly with how the company treats employees and how much of the work they took away from the technicians by adding a 3rd party vendor to do most of the work instead. This takes away valuable work experience from aspiring computer technicians all for the sake of attempting to earn more money. Not only that, they give employees a pittance of a wage and as just as little hours to work. They believe in the more workers and less hours for each method and it fails most of the time. It's difficult to get work done when you only work 4 hours a day for 4 days a week. There's no continuity to it. Overall, if you want to learn at a slow pace, this could work out. However, don't expect it to get you anywhere as advancement is essentially non-existent unless you're upper management."
good,This job was a good place to work if you can live on a six foot leash 40 hrs a week.. you have  no freedom to be yourself. It is a call center environment and it is not for everybody. The pay and benefits fit my life at that time
good,"I was able to advance quickly at Staples.  I learned a lot about the strategies of managing employees, while working with some wonderful people and customers."
good,Liked my time there.  Some good people.  Hire from outside for management positions. Internal promotions were few and far between. Cliques amongst the levels of employees.
good,Although I needed the pay it was not a very fun job. The staff was shady and the managers got on me so much for taking breaks I was entitled to.
good,You multitask throughout the day with little time for anything else. This is a very fast paced industry so you must know how to multitask exceptionally well. I always enjoyed assisting consumers with product knowledge and closing the sale by properly qualifying them.
good,Staples bom trabalho de equipa dava me bem com os colegas aprendi muito bem as minhas tarefas. ...
good,The staples i worked at had pretty good workers and managers. But lacked in team work and also there weren't many workers which made it a bit more difficult to work there. But it is not a hard place to work at when there are enough people in each department.
good,"As a sales associate in office supplies, your typical day is stocking product on the shelves and assisting customers on the floor. "
good,"Typical work day consist of managing customer issues, completing orders."
good,"While I did enjoy how friendly the majority of its employees were, I must admit that I was also very dissatisfied with how disposable those same employees were. Very little leeway was given to uncontrollable circumstances. I once worked with an employee that worked in the printing department. Besides how hectic and understaffed the printing center is on a daily basis, the district manager approved of illegally copying and printing newspapers. It may seem silly, but it was made a law for a reason. While most can't even think of what one could possibly do with a copied newspaper, that doesn't change the fact that it is a law. The employee was against the printing job because of that very law. The district manager told him to do it anyway claiming it was in the interest of the customer. I'm pretty sure it could be ""in the interest of the president"", and while i can't imagine anyone saying no to the president, it is STILL illegal! It's clear that Staples Managers are above the law when it comes to lining their already fat pockets with more cash. All this while the other employees are barely getting by on the poor unstable hours, and therefore being forced to get another job just to get by."
good,"A typical day can vary, but it's like most retail stores. There's always something to do, the main one is to serves customers but also stock rotation and management as well as cleaning and tidying. If you're good at selling then there is chance to sell technology. "
good,My overall experience working with Staples has been a transition for me. I graduated with a marketing degree and my goal was to really expand on my marketing skills. It has been a learning curve to be able to work for Staples and be a sales consultant however I am ready to make a transition into Marketing.
good,"I live and breathe sales. I love selling. I am a high performer with a track record of excellence. Corporate culture, micromanaging and low commission at Staples are not conducive to sales professionals performing at a high level. I enjoyed closing large accounts and I learned how to master B2B sales."
good,Not many customers during the week a lot of down time and putting material or supplies away or backroom duties or floor duties
good,"A typical day at work includes stocking shelves and approaching potential customers.  There is much to be learned in regards to technology, computers and printers.  The management is a tricky situation.  Most of the managers are very easy going, making for a very comfortable workplace environment.  However, two of the managers, who happen to be higher up, can be very discouraging at times, making for a very uneasy, up tight  and uncomfortable workplace environment.  The hardest part of the job is living up to these managers' expectations, being that no matter how hard you try or how well you perform, there will seldom be any recognition of achievement and always plenty of ""areas of opportunity""."
good,Staples is a large company in decline. Due to this cuts are made to the general worker and poor decisions are made at the top.
good,"I was new to Technology before this job, so taking on the Easy Tech title was exciting and challenging. I enjoyed that aspect a lot. I had a bit of an issue with the management but was still able to focus on serving customers, which is what was most important."
good,"A typical day at Staples involved standing behind the tills and processing transactions for customers, organising stock, photocopying, binding, printing at the copy centre, refunding items, walking up and down isles asking if any customers need assistance etc."
good,"management is unorganized, difficult and the treatment is sub-par."
good,"fast and easy way to gain experience, driving MHE, picking packing, etc. they expect you to work as much as you can and as fast as you can."
good,the company is great. you will learn different types of sell every other week. Helping customers is fun and exciting. the managers are fair and understanding. They will train you until to you get it right.
good,"The job itself was pretty good. However, at the specific Staples I worked at the management was poor. I was one of three employees that quit within a month because of the way management was treating employees."
good,"This job teaches you a lot about how to interact with different customers, and how to relay their specific needs with a product that you have in the store. The friendly atmosphere allows for an effective way to sell but also have fun while doing so."
good,"Boas condições de trabalho"
good,"Staples was not a very enjoyable company to work. I worked as a tech and was responsible for selling all kinds of attachments and products. I had to repair computers and sell further services to customers such as software. The hours were great in the beginning but since Obama Care kicked in part time employees get 15-22 hours a week rather than 30. Unfortunately, that still meant working 3 or 4 days a week with shorter shifts. This makes it time consuming and limits your ability to get a second job. The people in my store were great, upper management was very unresponsive to support for the stores if it didn't have anything to do with sales. Staples has a lot of potential and hopefully they soon realize they need to support their people."
good,"Staples was a decent job, and the co-workers and management were all incredibly nice people. The work itself didn't offer very much, though. Depending on the task, I could either be helping someone find a specific product, are checking out at the register. Often it was very slow. The busiest times were back-to-school, which required lots of customer service and cleaning up at close. Although the work was personally unfulfilling, it allowed me to transition to living back in Texas after living in New York for a while, and the managers were all incredibly friendly."
good,Amazing place to work especially for college students who have a crazy schedule. Provides up to 25 hours to part time associates.
good,"I enjoyed working for Staples because there was always new items to learn about and to educate the public with.  Hours were not bad, considering that we closed at a good time.  The management were very easy to get along with."
good,Decent place to work. Understaffed. Managers don't communicate too well. Co-workers are awesome. Multitasking is a must.
good,My work team was incredibly friendly and enthusiastic however the compensation at this job venue was lacking and provided very little for job advancement.
good,I had some of the greatest managers. They always acknowleged good work both at job and personal life. Staples was supportive when my wife passed away.
good,"A typical day at work would include:"
good,"I worked for Staples for over a year, and the quality of the workplace deteriorated significantly over that year. There is plenty of room for advancement within the store, but management does not acknowledge the needs of the employees."
good,"·	Department management including: associate supervision, completing project deadlines, stocking inventory, logistics, sales display, and cashiering.  "
good,"It is a fun enjoyable place to work every one is so kind and forgiving, though there is areas that do need improving, either through costumer relations and organizational areas that could be a bit better."
good,There's never enough people working. The management isnt very strong. There is room to move around but isnt a lifetime job
good,"job was not that bad just the people that ran it, fast paced long hours was the good part. do miss it. the best part was being MHEO for almost 11yrs."
good,"Repetitive functionality in a slower-paced customer environment."
good,"Show up on time, assist customer fix computers, networks, troubleshoot, virus removals, selling, stocking, organizing, prioritizing, working with a team, mentoring, and anything else that needed to get done."
good,It was hardworking environment always on the tip of your toes to find other gas station prices and change to meet or beat the others...
good,"A typical day at work consists of working on the tills, putting through customers transactions, refunds and exchanges. Also working on the Copy and Print for customers, this includes printing, scanning, copying, binding, laminating and creating canvas'. As well as following through with planogram changes and rearranging the store and keeping the store tidy and presentable. And most importantly helping customers with their needs and requirements around the store."
good,"•	Provide custom designed solutions for each client to help achieve their organizational objectives. Expert in brand building and promotional marketing. "
good,"I learned a lot of different sales and customer service techniques."
good,"A typical day was communicating with customers. Returning items back to there correct place. Handling cash, credit cards and checks."
good,"Staples is a good company to work for if you are interested in middle management.  Position not challenging enough for high caliber candidates.  Very customer centered, with great metrics to measure this."
good,"-Unorganized work area "
good,"If sales were down, associates where sent him leaving a skeleton crew to manage the entire store. Although I enjoyed the customers, corporate was out of touch with what it takes to run a store."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job I would have to say has to be interacting with the customers. I enjoy working with the general public and Staples allowed me to bring smiles to individuals faces.
good,"My typical day at work was me on the register checking customers out. I would also help them if they were looking for a specific product. While it was slow I would stock items, check expiration dates on food items, box ink, spider wrap electronics, etc. I usually kept pretty busy. Some of the people I used to work with, including the general manager, was very unprofessional. My co-workers were typically pleasant though. The hardest part was trying to help some of the upset customers. The most enjoyable part of my day was being able to fulfill a customer's needs. I would make sure to include coupons if they were not aware of them."
good,Menial task take up most of your day. Answering customer questions and directing them to the location of the product is another big part of the job.
good,Was told that i wouldn't make it to any supervisor position because i didn't kiss up to the store manager. Very long days i was the only one there sometimes and worked all areas of the store even in copy and print.
good,"This job was something I had obtained through a friend whose position opened when they left for the military. I had originally been hired for copy center, but they left me on front registers a majority of the time. It felt like I had to beg to be in Copy Center, but usually because I was more passive and avoid confrontation, they'd schedule other associates instead of implementing some kind of rotation. Not sure if its the same way at other stores. My co-workers were friendly, but very clique-y."
good,Management left me in the dark on occasion and never 'officially' completed my training before putting me up to duties such as cashiering and tech support.  I was able to make it a long and I did have plenty of on-the-job training.
good,"Although coworkers were great, I was promoted to management with no experience or training. I was told it's either sink or swim. I enjoyed working there as a sales associate, not as a supervisor."
good,"Typical Day started at 7 am and ended at 6 ( on a good day)"
good,"The manager was not a part of the work environment, only a figurehead. Assistant management was non existent. Promise of training and advancement were empty and invalid. Other employees were the highlight of the job."
good,"The issues I had with this company, particularly this location, was that policies were not always followed. I am one to go by the rules, and it bothered me that management didn't care much, or it seemed like they didn't care much for the rules. I and many before me who have worked there, felt no one in management had our backs, and the customers, though majority of the time were great, there were few who went out of their way to let us know where our place is (one customer had told me once that I was nothing but a lowly worker in the pyramid). I did my best to move on from the difficulties of the job. I was never one to mistreat anyone, no matter how bad the situation went. My breaking point, though, was when I had a customer threaten me, and management failed to do much about it. I did not feel safe at that place anymore, and I felt, especially after word was spreading that the whole incident was my fault, that I could no longer work in a place that failed to make their employees feel at ease. Those in management have good hearts, they are good people, but I just felt the way they handled things in the work place was just not right."
good,A typical day is pretty busy talking and working with the customer. fitting them and ringing them up.
good,Love working at a customer service store. It is awesome that I am surrounded by technology. Always welcome the challenge when an ''on-site'' repair is requested by the customer. Very good teamwork skills.
good,"I come into work almost 30 minutes early everyday. As I come in, I take care of things that weren't taken care of that night. I would empty the trash, wipe counters, file papers and track orders. I would also review the ink and toner wall. Normally there would be ink in the wrong spots so I would place them in their correct spots. While doing this I greet each customer that walks into our flag ship store. Providing customers with the direction they need to go to while walking to the second floor. While cleaning I would ring customers until the next cashier comes in. The management at Staples is not that great. I would complain almost 3 out of the 5 days I am working that products are not put in the right place. When I come back to work the job is not done and the place is still a mess. I would need to do my job first and then another co-workers job second. A manager should make sure each employee is doing their job correctly. They should not rely on only one associate to complete everything. Sometimes I think the $8.69 is not worth the 25 hours per week. However, I love cleaning and organizing things. I love helping people and receiving feedback on my hard work (which I barely do). I love restocking things and the environment I work in is well respected by our loyal customers who knows our names and faces."
good,I work with a great team of managers and coworkers and love what i do seeing people leave happy and satisfied.
good,"Delivering to customers was the best part of this job, meet good people, the work itself was hard and physical, (had to carry paper to where the customer wanted it and sometimes it went to many diffrent places in the building)"
good,A typical day at work can be hectic or slow but it was always a great environment to work in. Learned a great deal of how to handle when it gets really busy and gained multitasking skills. Hardest part is dealing with displeased customers that were very angry.
good,"Work in business development efforts. Combination of sales and special projects. Called on prospective large clients. Was a ""Subject Matter Expert"" for major presentations with other departments. Consulted with manufacturing for process improvement.Work with material suppliers qualifying new materials for labels. "
good,"A typical day of work includes stocking the shelves, orgainizing the aisles and helping all of the customers.  I learned you have to be observant of your surroundings @ all times.  Management has an agenda.  It was a new store and most of my co-workers were not enthusiastic.  The hardest part of the job was dealing w/ co-workers who didn't know their place.  The most enjoyable part of the job was looking @ all of the new items coming into the store."
good,The job itself was fun and enjoyable. Management was very inconsistent and not trustworthy. Scheduling subject to change on daily basis without employee notification.
good,interacting with diffrent cultures and learning new skills is always a great thing.
good,Dealing with different type of customers has helped me with my customer service experience. I have learned alot about copy and print. My co workers are great we are a great team. Management has had its ups and downs but right now we finally have a good management team. The hardest part of my job will have to be that after 1 year and 3 months Im still part time. Th best part of my job is my coworkers and my customers. Im a people person so all the different type of people that come into my store make it worth working there.
good,A typical day at the warehouse would consist of morning meeting to review the previous days production. This was a temp position but by the time a month had gone by you knew everybody and was a fun place to work. One downfall was that you only had a 1/2hr to punch out go to lunch and stand back in line to punch back in with no food onsite. The managent was more into gossiping than doing the job at hand.
good,Staples is great company to learn and grow with. You are challenged to run your own business and move quickly. Any decision that you make should always be backed up with your financial analysis. Management tends to be very hands off and slow in making decisions. Co-workers are great and Staples promotes a team environment.
good,"Management was not always nice. Horrible training to new workers and then punish then for it. Co-workers were nice and friendly, boring easy job most days, nice customers very low pay but paid weekly was a plus."
good,Good company that needs to focus on core customer base. Loved working with the associates and customer. Many un-controllable metrics that need to be met can make it stressful from time to time.
good,electronic sales associate selling computers printers etc
good,Scheduled to work 5:00 to 9:30 did not get out until 10:30- 10:45. Did a pull list asked customers to check their upgrade availability and restocked the shelves.
good,"It's hard to say how I really feel about this job. I've been with Staples only a year but I've had plenty of ups and downs. I've had two positions at this company; I first joined as an EasyTech Sales Associate then I got promoted to being a Resident Tech. The first half of the year everything was great. I had an awesome manager who was patient and I'd like to say he taught me everything he knew because he was that great. I really did learn a lot from him and from this job in general. My coworkers were good too but then everything changed. "
good,"Lots of being on your feet. No work advancement for good work ethic. I worked hard everyday, and was faster than anyone else. But no advancement, instead I was laid off a week before my 3 months was up."
good,way to much pressure from management to sell products that are useless to our customers
good,Not a bad place to work if you are interested in part time work.
good,"There certainly isn't much room for advancement if you're not willing to spend at least 2 or 3 years waiting for it. That being said, the management was pretty fair in their treatments and seamed to reward hard work when/if they noticed it."
good,"I loved my customers and my equal level associates but management had some issues, especially in the gm department. Work hard for 2+ years and got no advancement but was told I would.  Got discriminated against and had harassment issues from an associate who didn't get fired til their second offense."
good,In the early years when Staples was focused on Customers and driving the business and we could staff the stores and reward associates it was fun. As years went on and Staples lost it's focus and started to struggle in the marketplace the cuts started and life in the stores became almost unbearable
good,"Working at Staples was my first job in retail. I joined staples a year ago on the search of a new challenge. It was a new working environment for me which I settled in very well and got along with my colleagues. Providing good customer service was the main skill I had strengthened as well as working as a team and with my own initiative. This gave me good independence skill and motivation towards success. Understanding the job is necessary and most of all meeting the targets of the day are vital. I have experienced many things by working in retail; different types of customers, understanding customers, communicating with customers and how to approach customers. “Treat the customers the way you would like to be treated”, this is my motto, which I have had in mind when I began working in retail; it has helped me understand customers. At staples presentation was important, keeping the store immaculate at all times and getting stock out was a daily task for me but most of all serving customers and making sales was the main target."
good,"Love staples but the general Manger in Franklin ""TH"" is nothing but a slave driver that dosen't want to reward his associates for what they do."
good,"I supervised some really good people and most of the other associates I had contact with were wonderful. I went through significant training in Lean Six Sigma, 5S, leadership initiatives and assessment. I loved training associates in Smith Systems Safe Driving, Handling Hazardous Materials, Material Handling Equipment and helping them work smarter and more efficiently. The most challenging part of the job was being asked to fit square pegs in round holes. There always seemed to be a disconnect between expectations and regional reality, but we made it work."
good,"If you have a good manager, that makes the world of difference and I have been lucky. However, when there are projects going on, be prepared to do what it takes to finish - could be 60 hours a week for weeks at a time."
good,The location I worked at had horrible management and horrible pay they also never had enough people to cover positions most of the time. I worked easy tech and always found myself doing customer for 4 hours at a time out of a 7 hour shift. With freight in the back I had to put up I never had enough time to finish it in the given time period.
good,Overall Staples is a great place to work. The type of work is very rewarding and the customers are great. However management does not take their job very seriously. They rarely come over and offer to relieve to so you can take your break. The management does not schedule coverage and shifts according to the hours we are most busy. In the copy and print department there are very few(3) employees with many shifts to fill and management stretches their employees so thin that they become stressed mentally and physically.
good,"Customers are generally nice, somewhat decent."
good,The best part about my job is working with the people here. I have made great friends.
good,"The environment started off good, but then changed. They went to a production and political way of doing things."
good,Management was horrible; the sole reason for which I resigned.
good,"There is a lot of errors; the workload would be so easy if everyone would play their proper role, but , no one can play any role because there is always this constant battle of  inconsistency."
good,"It is a high pace job.  Production standards are favorable to veteran employees and less favorable to new employees.  Information needed to complete job successfully is hard to obtain and training is not standardized.  Success depends on luck and tricks learned by experienced trainers.  Some trainers are less helpful than others."
good,My job allows me to work around my university degree and provides me with a fun work environment as everybody is really down to earth and friendly.
good,"Not a whole lot of leadership, managers stay in the office and leave associates to fend for themselves."
good,"Onboarding new hires, coaching, all levels of management, consistent problem solving."
good,"Fair place to work, was laid off because they went with a new model of less managers more supervisors."
good,"A typical day entailed helping customers find products, restocking shelves, cashier duties, making hourly deposits, and till counts."
good,"I liked it, but it was also my first job, so I had nothing else to compare it against."
good,This company is good but they do not put much value in great workers. Often the best workers are overlooked for subpar workers. The hinder promotions to save on payroll.
good,"Loading, pulling, and packing orders. Maintaining a clean work enviornment. Management was terrible. Co workers were great people and hard workers."
good,lots of betrayals your not a person your a thing for them to use as they see fit. GOOD LUCK
good,Was a good company but is going through a lot of changes and will have issues for a while.
good,The managers were nice and the coworkers were fun.  The days dragged on usually as they have comparatively low customer traffic in the store.
good,"Associate relations was most of my time for 700+ employees between two locations.  My staff within HR was great they always assisted to help meet deadlines with payroll, benefits, orientations, etc.  Most enjoyable was creating employee functions for their families to attend and seeing the smiles on their faces.  Employees were always comfortable approaching me my door was always open to them and I would never turn anyone away.  The hardest part of my job was terminating employees.  Although they knew it was my job to this day when I run into them on the streets they still approach me and treat me as a friend."
good,"Work started with cleaning up the mess left by my co-workers and doing so trying to not miss any customers who may have needed help at the time. Management team was very nice to the point where co-workers took advantage of them, which made for a work environment filled with resentment. The job was not hard physically just emotionally draining when management was unwilling to listen to suggestions to improve work environment."
good,The job was easy to do and directions were easy to follow.  My only concern was the young mentality of some of my coworkers
good,"Staples would be a better place to work if the management didn't always preach about sales and market basket.  Also, don't let any of your family members or friends purchase an extended service plan under your employee discount.  If you do allow this, tell the family member they can't take the service plan back or the management will threaten your job."
good,Staples has a special place in my heart. I have dedicated 6 years of my careers to them and it was a great run. Typical work day is to make people smile and feel welcome. There are dynamic workers in that company and lots of training resources.
good,"Great people to work for, great people to work with."
good,This was a great job before all the cut backs. I went from 40 hours a week to about 23.
good,"good company, management team, poor pay, lots of tasks and stress. Not worth it for the pay."
good,good place to work. It was a short contract. Not enough time to really have an opinion.
good,Management lacked communication & leadership skills.
good,"Management is somewhat mismatched in delegating tasks, the systems are changing quite frequently, and aren't very efficient. The company itself is a great company to work for, they could just use some improvement."
good,"Restocking, sales and customer service, product demoing, copying, POS, freight break down."
good,"Typical day at work was something I looked forward too, new ideals and angles for growth and sales. Being creative, finding the need for individual customers. Learning how to set a bi-weekly or monthly planner and making it effective and staying within the time spent on different goals. Management some stronger than others on knowledge and teachings. Enjoyed my co-workers. Making my quota across the line of business. Landing new customers and upsales."
good,find a better job than this. pay and benefits suck unless you or a manager.
good,"The work here wasn't bad at all. What made working here in fact enjoyable some days were the awesome co-workers I had. Although there was a lot of back talk, shady actions, and bias, the benefits made it worthwhile for a little while. There is time-and-a-half, scholarships for college students, paid holidays if you are there long enough, and even health and dental. But on the other hand if the assistant manager didn't like you, you had no choice but to endure her wrath and kiss your benefits good bye. She played favorites a lot, and it is very noticeable to other co-workers. If management doesn't like you they'll cut your hours, while making you work at personally inconvenient times, just so that you'll quit."
good,"I liked working for Staples, my duties were all about the customers."
good,"I would have days I really did not want to go into work mainly due to management. I felt that for the most part the employees were treated unfairly. I was even put on the spot one day in front of customers and employees. My co-workers were the best part about the job, other than interracting with people of course. The hardest part of the job as a cashier was the constant pressure put on you for sales. Cashiers were not only expected to juggle phone calls (answering questions and transferring calls) but also getting customers through the line in under 2 minutes while answering the phone, putting in rewards card information, selling warranties and other various items, offering the store's current sales, and it all becomes very stressful. On the floor, where there are employees that have no time limit with their customers, this would be much easier. If the cashiers did not sell enough product or warranties, our hours would get cut down."
good,Staples is truly a top retailer that caters to its customers. From day 1 employees are trained with a intense focus on customers.
good,The company does give you a lot of training which is essential when you are starting a career. They are patient with you and allow you to learn as you go.
good,Packing and shipping ordered product. Picking the ordered products off the shelf. Marking the shipments for customers.
good,Fix computers.
good,"love my job. hated the politicts of management, they have favorites, listen to gossup rather than the real deal."
good,"My co-workers really didn't work that much they had played and talked more. My typical day at Staples was long and always had one co-worker complaining about things I was doing,he always said I was making mistakes and never told me what they were. I learned how to count my register,how to use my register, to use credit cards and checks. I also learned how to use gift cards and put money on them. Management wasn't that great,a lot of times the manager would fool around and swear instead of being a manager. The hardest part was understanding some of the people that came in and being quick. The enjoyable part was seeing the little kids that came into the store."
good,The former managers there were great. They made working there fun and productive.
good,Responsible for the delegation of tasks required to maintain office supply dept. and keep team focused on quality customer service and increasing sales.
good,Productive large company and they expect alot out of their associates.
good,refer to resume
good,"It wasn't bad till they switch GM and then it get alil worst they start cutting hours, they give u funny look but not all staples store are not the same."
good,Colleagues are very nice to work with. Not much opportunity for advancement it seems.
good,I loved working at staples I just wish they paid better the work that was done there was amazing there was a great team. I Loved it there.
good,"I wish Staples all the best for the future but management of the Fulfillment Centers from the RVP's up change their priorities on a daily if not hourly basis. Mid-level management feels abused while trying to keep up with aggressive goals. The staffing strategy is increasingly relying on fewer associates and more temp agency staff while expecting increased quality, productivity and turn over rates. Staples has many good attributes and there are opportunities for associates to move up, but the corporate culture definately has changed for the worst since Sycamore Group purchased them."
good,"Taking in computers for repair, and mobile devices. Diagnosing customer's issue with software and hardware. Checking inventory, placing products on shelves. Counting the safe, closing the store, going over returns reports, customer satisfaction and de-esculation with upset customers."
good,I worked there for 10 years and I really liked it and then they started cutting the employees hours I went from 40 to 30 to 25 I really couldn't make it back in those days
good,Staples was a company that encouraged advancement and employee development.  Since the company went private the focus is more about the bottom line and less about the people that work their hardest to ensure profits.
good,"The Aberdeen store keeps most workers at part-time. The pay is low and the benefits are minimal. The work environment is not bad, although at times they push aggressive sales tactics over the customer experience."
good,"Fast paced environment   Management overall is good with the exception of few old school managers, micro managers. Outdated as they don’t easily allow telecommute"
good,"I was very excited to work at staples. It was easy, I had a set schedule for every week. Some people may hate getting up in mornings but it didn’t bother me so that’s why I worked morning shift. I was always working at cashier or in the back unloading & breaking down product. The management was just getting a little hectic due to getting a new general manager."
good,the people made working there better. I would not have stayed there nearly as long as i did if it wasn't for my coworkers. Not a bad job for a student
good,"Treated fairly with respect by all. My co-workers are the highlight of my day, they encourage me and always help when it is needed. They make work feel like less of a job, and more of a place I like to be."
good,its a starter entry level job maybe for students only part-time available. It is flexible if you are currently in need of a second job. It's not a hard job with the exception of being understaffed sometimes at peak time.
good,j'ai aprecier travailler chez bureau en gros. le seul bemol c'est leur manque de flexibilitee.
good,Staples was a great working environment and was very fast paced. There was always something going on with changes in merchandise and price cards and everyone is very helpful. Management was great at my time there.
good,"I work for Staples for 10 years I started off as a cashier down in Texas and I quickly became the copy and print center supervisor which I absolutely loved that job, was at that store for7.5 yrs & moved up here to Oklahoma and I was not excited anymore, due to the managers. they were very unfair with basically everything they were not good managers! I gave up a 10-year career because of the managers"
good,"staples is a very fast pace environment. a lot of work for the night shift. usually it’s 5 trucks per one person or more, depending how fast you can move."
good,"diversified, fun place to work.  Co-workers become your family.   If you're on the right team with the right boss, you can go very far.   Be sure to continually add value!"
good,The job was to repair computers and phones and sell services. Pretty simple and fun but corporate meddled a lot and managers cared only about profit and did not work with you on schedules unless you could close.
good,"Staples hires new employees at a lower pay rate than average in my area and are expected to do more as well. Most likely you will be the only one in the department working regardless if you are a supervisor or not. The Manager on Duty will only assist the front end and resolve customer issues. Often you will have to leave your department to assist your copy and print center. Sales of service plans provide you no benefit except at your yearly review for your raise, if you make it that long. Benefits include a 401k and a health savings account, that's it. The best part of the job is struggling with all your fellow employees"
good,Didn't like working there when company moved into new build people was not nice was always telling thing to manager  things was not true no working together lack of communication
good,"Working at Staples has its ups and downs just like any other company. However I find it very hard to succeed and move up in this company. I do enjoy the flexible schedule but I'm just looking for a better opportunity,"
good,"I liked the job, but at the end it was a bit lazy. Just the same and same questions again and over again with almost the same salary as my first day with them."
good,It was fun working on computers and learning more about them. Work was made easier by having fun to talk to co-workers to pass the time when doing nothing else. Many customers came in weekly or so and would be very nice and chat about interesting things more often than the other side of customers (the no patience rude ones)
good,"Very fast paced, can be stressful dealing with customers. I have learned a lot in my years at Staples however the job I currently have I don’t receive adequate pay as I do all duties that Managers perform."
good,"The overall work was easy, and didn't take much to get used to. Not much in the way of advancements, or job security. I worked there for a little over a year and worked with probably 40 to 50 different people in that time. The turn over rates where ridiculously high."
good,"Staples warehouse is a standard workplace with bad management and rude supervisors. Minimum work ethics. There is often a high work load with less workers. Good for people who want overtime hours,"
good,"My overall time with Staples was positive, the pace is fast and the work is challenging but rewarding. the individuals who make up middle to upper management are overall good people."
good,Not much to offer those looking for advancement in their careers. Great place to start to learn the job world and gain vital customer service experience but not much else to offer.
good,Nothing too insane. All I did as a sales associate was stock the store during my shift. I had to go from the back and open boxes and then bring everything out front.
good,"I really enjoyed the atmosphere at staples, I enjoyed the role I played within the team. currently I have been extending my resposabilities."
good,"Staples afforded me the opportunity to gain invaluable supervisor knowledge within a fulfillment center environment. While I enjoyed the vast majority of those I worked with, management would consistently push associates past the breaking point, demanding long hours, and overloading the FC with more orders than was feasible for the amount of associates available. Employee appreciation from management level was few and far between. While not the worst place in the world to work by any means, I do not recommend supervisor level jobs for those who wish to maintain any semblance of work life balance."
good,"Be ready to work 12 hour shifts because they are extremely understaffed. It would be a great place to work if they can get their management together. They also need a better recruiter because the one they have calls you once and if you don’t answer that’s it you can call her multiple times and she won’t pick up. But they do have great benefits like life, health,dental,vision, and even auto insurance. And their starting pay is not bad at all plus all associates get along very well."
good,I loved working remotely for Staples.  They do offer that.  They are constantly hosting events for the employees.  They are very structured on time.  You get dinged if you clock out 1 second early or 1 second late.
good,"Montgomery NY location "
good,"I learned a lot especially as an outside hire. The recent transformation of the company has led to many positive changes."
good,"The manager at Lake Mary Staples is awesome, and all of the co-workers there get along very nicely and there’s not really any tension at all. However, Staples company itself is a very money-hungry company that doesn’t give its regular associates any sick days, paid time off, benefits, and only gives a 10% discount on things you might buy. Also they push for up-selling all the time with no commission rewards."
good,"The store I was hired at informed me of their imminent closing just two weeks into my new job. There was a lot lacking in terms of management and enforcement of rules, as well."
good,Was hired as a temporary associate and met some awesome people. The team was very nice and laid back but communication and management was eh. You’re kind of just thrown into the job without a lot of help or explaining on certain tasks. I was forced to call in one day due to my car breaking down and they made it seem like they understood. Instead I was “let go” without any sort of phone call or notice and got my check in the mail lmao. Also don’t work here as a temp unless you’re ready for long 10 hours of manual labor..
good,"PROS:"
good,"This job taught me so much. The sad part is Corporate will never be satisfied. They just want more and more. Corporate pressures management on upselling and squaretrades in an unorthodox manner. The signage corporate team is very unorganized, every sign they give in the que gets printed. Time is spent breaking apart signs and organizing. Then getting to one section to realize this new signs only difference is the expiration date changed from 2018-2030(something like that) or that the sign was under the promo. Wasting cardstock,ink and time! It’s almost like Staple corporate signage is so bored that tasks they create waste time of employees in store, at least during BTS season. If corporate gave more people a voice, such as your employees that see everything first hand and keep your business moving  things could be better. Instead, there is more time spent searching for new employees because the good ones get tired of being overworked,under appreciated and lack of hours. Every manager where I worked had good intentions!  It is not their fault since they are following the chain of command. Corporate will drown you with tasks.  I hope they’re better off without me because I am better off without them. My relationship with staples is “Love &Hate” they brought out the best and the worst of me. This is  about corporate not my hard working colleagues."
good,"The Sales Associate position at Staples mainly entails helping customers find what they need while also keeping the store in tip-top shape. Peer employees help the day go by without trouble, but much of the time spent during a typical work day can stem from helping 5+ customers at once to doing absolutely nothing."
good,"I did learn a lot at Staples. Bookkeeping, money accounting, cash register, tills, and other behind the scene accounting procedures.  The pay was not the greatest for all the responsibility."
good,The job is alright. not bad hours if your in college.Management is very heavy on unrealistic sell goals. where if your not selling enough you could be fired.
good,In just the short time I worked at staples I learned a lot and was a easy fast pace environment. It was easy to catch on. They always made sure breaks were taken which is great for employees.
good,"As Staples it was very good but back at the end of November 2016 we were sold. "
good,"So I worked there for a handful of years. Worked in several stores, and was promoted a few times, even took a demotion when I moved across the country. The quality of work seemed to change dramatically from location to location. "
good,"Good company overall to work with, No stability in Management. Company going through major changes and makeovers. "
good,"I learned a lot about managing a heavy work load while juggling customers. In my experience with the company, my ability to be a team player was challenged and grew immensely."
good,"Overall the company is not a bad company, but the store i work at i must say that there isnt enough staff ever, so having a problem with job security is fine, now let me tell you about pay, ive been working there for 1 year, i never got a pay raise, and i brought it up to my managers and they said they will take a look and i never got it and its been a few months since then. The management team always hides in there offices and don't do any work and tell the associates what to do."
good,the pay is ok for the work. Management is constantly asking for more. even if some of your metrics are doing fine theres always one thing they will pick on.
good,I left due to no advancement opportunities and pay. If I wanted to advance I was told I would need to relocate and at that time I was not able to do so.
good,"Very stressful job, people are very rude and you just have to use your customer service skills to smile though it . Management is wonderful and the people who work there are also great."
good,People are great. So work environment was great. Hours are fixed so no employee is allowed more than 25 hours a week. Less than that if you are a student
good,Hectic work environment poor management great pay good benefits long hours very clicky on the inside room for advancment overall its aflip of the coin worth a shot
good,"I stay at the cashier station all day. I don't really have a chance to get to know coworkers. Personal discussion between coworkers is discouraged. I learned how to get out of my comfort zone. The hardest part of the job is frustration coming from new services, promotions, surveys, etc., etc, I cant remember them all."
good,"As with all client service jobs, interacting with customers is the most difficult part. However, when a job forces you to continuously annoy customers with credit cards, rewards memberships, and other offers that quite frankly aren't the best deals, working here can get draining. A lot of the customers that arrive are on time shoppers and usually never come back until back to school shopping. The regular customers are already subscribed and to be frank, new customers doubt the validity of rewards as many have reported they don't receive any benefits at all. Some even say because they don't come to staples so frequently, being a rewards member just adds junk to their email. Rather than focusing on having a true client experience, it seems like a race for who can sign up the most people a day. When those quotas aren't met, employees hours are cut. Working here for a while I understand the importance of meeting these goals however, this is not my career and merely a job to stay afloat while being a student. Employees should be able to work and interact with customers without the fear their hours will be cut or being fired because they couldn't sign up people for rewards or credit cards. If it wasn't for being a desperate student, I'd pass on this position."
good,It's a lot of learning in a short amount of time and fast paced environment. Depending on who you're working with and which manager is on duty it'll either go by fast or drag on forever.
good,"when I first started it was pretty fun and interesting then after getting comfortable in my position management changed their whole attitude towards me and wasn't putting that happy go lucky act anymore plus didn't help nun of the high up management including the stores GM didn't care about their job or about how the store floor was doing. ended up deciding to call it quits once every day after about the first week I would ask my supervisor and sales manager what I need to do for the day and the answer I would get every time would be ""he** if I know just go find what needs to be done"" so very poor management sadly since staples has been getting to be known as  one of the companies  with highest starting wages and suppose to be great work environment all around here recent."
good,"The General Manager sets the tone and, if you have a good GM then you'll be all set. If you get an inexperienced GM, you're probably in for a ride, to say the least. If the District Manager does not like you, hang it up. If he/she does like you, stick with it; you'll get promoted."
good,Great training I learned alot while employed at Staples. Excellent training program. Made life long friends while employed there. It wasn't a stressful job
good,"Whilst working there for almost a year I started out with a really great manager and then she was transferred and we were given an awful replacement in return. I cannot recommend working there as she has her ""favorites"" and if you stand up for yourself and strive to do what is right she will attempt to smite you down. Management is unprofessional and sadly a joke. The coworkers are a dream, however, the management treats them like slaves. I wish I could recommend this place because I used to enjoy it but there was only so much I could take before I had to move on."
good,I worked at staples for the summer and it was a decent experience. The management of the store needed some improvement. I stocked products on the shelves and assisted customers.
good,"I'll describe my day at work today:"
good,The company needs a lot of work. From management to the workers. The building could be a lot cleaner. For all the work that’s done break could be longer.
good,"I worked here for the summer as a student in the co-op program, there was not much learning on the job other than basic organization and how to quickly identify and sort similar looking items based on SKU numbers. A nice place if you do not mind standing for long hours and can lift heavy objects with ease."
good,"regular working schedule "
good,this is a very typical retail store. they will work with your schedule. all floor employees are part time and strictly held to a 25 hour work week. overtime is rarely approved.
good,Good for beginners and as a second job but not great for advancement unless you are doing the management track.  Even then its comparable to most other box retail stores.
good,"Work hard, Do not make friends with managers."
good,Its a good store to be in because most days when its slow all you have to do is stocking and maintain the store neat and clean. But when it gets really busy sometimes you don't have time to ask any managers because they are busy as well and you are on your own. Depends on the store I had to clean the bathrooms every time had my shift and other co-workers left without letting anyone know. Stocking in some times can be a bit but when its back to school their is so much stocking you have to move a lot more than usual and heavy lifting.
good,"Most days are you helping customers find what they need in the store and direct towards the items they may not know they need."
good,Great staff to work and learn with. Always a lot to do and different types of jobs to keep you occupied. Great benefits and team building events for employees. Very fast paced.
good,Extremely boring place to work at unless its September. Other than that it seems like a never ending work day. Like every job a couple of good associate and couple of crazy associates.
good,From a management perspective culture was too loose.  Those that were not performing well were kept on too long.  Recently moved in to a better building.
good,"Supervised printing department, upon restructuring the company the job duties changed, and it was turned into a sales job. Having to make cold calls to customers with no pay/joy change."
good,"I enjoyed the flexibility of the job, however I did not feel that my manager could guide me through the next steps of my career. Overall great first job out of college but it is hard to make over 100k"
good,"A typical shift for an associate is 4-8 hours, and for a manager 8+.  Only managers are allowed to work more than 35 hours per week.  Managers must meet certain sales quotas consistently to keep their jobs. The amount of hours given to employees is based on store sales. Unfortunately if sales are down, there is not enough staff scheduled to operate the store.  This is common making inventory hard to manage, and causing ridiculously long waits for customer service at Copy & Print, as well as the Tech. Dept.. Seasonal new displays are often months behind schedule."
good,"Very cut biased management, that if they don't like you they cut hours. Very difficult to get a job afterwards due to high demand of having multiple years of retail experience."
good,"My typical day at work consisted of reviewing orders for the days deliveries/installs, loading the truck of the upcoming days deliveries/installs and completing the deliveries/installs.  I would then prepare furniture for upcoming deliveries/installs for the next few days.  My responsibilities included but was not limited to maintaining the cleanliness of the truck inside and out, daily inspection of the truck, maintaining cleanliness of my work area including the warehouse and reporting to my supervisor before the end of the day.  I learned all the programs necessary to receive in new inbound furniture orders and would cover my supervisors's role to an extent whenever he was out for the day or on vacation.  My workplace culture was a little stressful due to the people I had to work with on a daily basis.  The hardest part of my job was some of the overnight installs we had for certain customers on occasion.  The most enjoyable part of my job was the flexibility and ease of the work."
good,"Staples was so so boring. All we did was sit around and wait for things to be misplaced. The staff were also boring. There was nothing to do in my downtime, and I was never offered a break."
good,"This job was ok, it required a lot of overtime and was very fast paced. I liked my fellow coworkers. This is not a climate control warehouse so the summers were brutally hot."
good,"typical day can be fast and easy if everyone works."
good,"* A typical day at work - if opening, I would open, sweep, clean and vacuum the store before we opened for customers - I would set up each cash register with money - throughout the day, I would help customers find products they were looking for, I would stock/block the store and assist customers with any problems they had or things they were confused about"
good,Lot to do learn and customer. To many managers for a small store so one never knew who to go to with issues. had lots of good people but getting to advance was not in the cards for most.
good,"When Management was changed was a  un-enjoyable place to work. Was good in the beginning, but got progressively worse. They closed the building.  Hard work."
good,"Before Sycamore takeover, company valued its employees and were concerned and understanding. Ever since the take over, our department didn't get yearly merit even though we were in profit. Expediting department has been finished and the jobs are now being done by sales coordinators.... less pay more work..... pay is absolutely not competitive. The good thing is that we have work from home option and sometimes there is free lunches and raffles. over all managers are good but you will find a few people who will complain about you over smallest of things."
good,"The staples I worked at was a balanced work environment and had a really good staff/team that helped shifts flow better. The job duties are very straight forward. Depending on your department of work, your tasks could range from being on the sales floor, ringing out customers, working copying and print, or helping customers find supplies/materials"
good,i get there i get no employees help work area get back up lack supervisor trianing its mostly look and learn kind of training just wish there were better managers and emploees support.
good,"I started as a computer sales member, and worked my way to Department Lead. People were friendly to work with and I did learn a lot working there. They had a few classes on PC repair to help the team members, which I took full advanage of."
good,"Staples has a great reputation for having a family style work environment. Although they do some things with this in mind, other's are way off the mark. You will only stay in management's good graces if you do exactly what they want, when they want it. Otherwise, if you go against the grain, you will have issues and there will be obstacles put in place to shut you down quickly and without too much fuss, and it is not something that I am comfortable with or used to. Great pay, competitive package but management needs work. People leave managers, not companies, and in my situation this rings very true."
good,"Staples isn't terrible, but when I worked there you couldn't go over 20 hours if you were part time so it's not a very sustainable job. I left because I needed to make more than minimum wage."
good,"Staples has been an interesting place to work. Our days consist of working out as much of any new inventory we recive. We help out any customer who comes in asking for help whether they're looking for a certain item or a question about a product we sell. Employees would talk with each other to pass some time but overall there is always something to keep you busy. During back to school, it's difficult to not feel overwhelmed when dealing with a never ending line and abnormal work hours."
good,"I did not particularly enjoy working at Staples. The culture was not great, structure was haphazard, compensation was ok. Overall not a great experience."
good,This was a part-time job I took after working for Kroger.  The pay was higher and the hours were better while attending West Liberty.  I left to attend West Virginia University.
good,"Staples was what you would think it would be, a job with minor inconveniences created by misinformed customers, mostly though printing and marketing, and I was responsible for characterizing things and portraying an image of stability."
good,"over all it was a good job, but the lack of hands on training really hurt my work till figured it out on my own. and the managers were okay most of the time."
good,Good learning experience coming into the workforce.  There was always something that had to be completed so always had a full workload.  Required quick pace to keep up.
good,Staples was a perfectly fine place to work especially as an entry level employee. I would say that they taught a good many skills needed to progress to more advanced positions elsewhere in the world.
good,"The company is solely interested in making sales, nothing else really matters. I was more interested in building relationships with customers and creating repeat customers, the work environment did not allow for that kind of relationship."
good,as long as you are meeting the minimum expectations your fine. some basic product knowledge of office supplies helps to engage the customers and gain their trust so they will bring problems to you looking for solutions.
good,"Staples was a great company to work for, but the pay was what is to be expected from a retail job. Also worked at the wa"
good,Great starter job where you learn the basics of customer service. The workplace culture is professional and the hours varied to work around a college students schedule.
good,Working at Staples helped me at a time when I needed it. The company Staples does treat its employees well. I felt left out a lot due to cliques there.
good,"My typical day starts at 6am, when I arrive at the Hub my Delivery Truck is usually loaded. I usually arrive at my first stop around 7am and proceed to deliver Staples Products until around 3pm Monday-Friday."
good,We always seemed to be understaffed and other employees were placed in odd positions to make the store run properly.  Employees were then unable to complete their work.  The upper management would never let us have more hours to fill these shortcomings and the store on a whole would suffer.
good,"Although sometimes stressful the job can be rewarding in the fact that you will be able to make new acquaintances as well as building your network of people. If you have a team that knows how to operate well together the job is not that bad, it is actually a fairly easy job once you are coordinated enough to juggle what you need to do for store purposes while giving excellent customer service."
good,"(A review of Staples only - this does not include my views and opinions of the change over to Office Outlet)"
good,They need actual management with a format so there sales people can actually make sales and hit quota. There was never management their to guide you in any direction.
good,"daily store operations ,communications to the associates and daily goals ,review sales results and opportunities ."
good,This job Is very time consuming. You are required to work a minimum of 10 hours per day. Some General Managers want you to even work on your days off.
good,"Multi- tasking enviorment"
good,"Moody and Sometimes empty, but when busy it is plenty of excitment  with customers. you will learned customer serives well but the pay is not great at all."
good,"okay job for people who are still in school , not for someone who has bills to pay. the schedules were never consistent , the manager would sometimes forget to put up the schedule so you wouldnt know what your working for the following week until the last day of the current week. its retail , they expect you to do more but pay you less. alot of favortism, they shove down your throat to get the insurance plans on every electronic item a customer purchases and if you dont, they jump down your throat for it. its good for temporary until you get tired of the nonsense that comes with a retail job."
good,"Good place to work that pays well. Like any corporation though, higher ups are rude and seem to only care about the high expectations they give employees over sales. Management isn't on the same page at all causing confusion and stress throughout store."
good,"The customers are great and so are my co workers. A great atmosphere and great customers, flexibility. There is not good hours, not good with work advancement."
good,Great place to work. Managers I had there at the time were awesome and very hard working. Coworkers were very friendly and helped other employees when they needed help.
good,"Over the past 10+ yrs, Staples has been a great place to challenge yourself and grow your career.  Like any other big company, much of the culture is driven by the department head.  I have enjoyed my time at Staples immensly, but am concerned about the future direction of the now private company."
good,"I was promised a position in the ""fast-paced"" printing department but due to a shortage of staff I was trained as a cashier. I had no problem with this as I am willing to help out wherever I am needed, however, I was there for several months and never once stepped foot in the printing department. I was also bored the entire time I was there as I could not leave the register to help with stocking/cleaning nor was I given any sort of busy work to keep me from wanting the day to end."
good,structured retail environment with positions that will keep employees busy. Must have stamina for on the spot customer service. excellent supervisors.
good,This was a good company to work for. The workday was always busy and full of extras to do. Most of your day was dealing on the computer and phone with  other companies.
good,"From the outside this place seemed great, and the people seemed awesome.  Very friendly and always seemed willing to work together and help out, but it only takes one minor mistake to cost you this job, and that isn't bad in itself, but the management claims it has nothing to do with the mistake."
good,"Looking to advance my career.  I'm a hard, dedicated worker who has been working in sales for almost 2 years.  I feel like I am ready to advance my career in this field."
good,i only did work experience so there wasn't much to it. i learnt to do the basics and people showed me what to do. i worked for 2 weeks straight and give me a good insight into the retail world.
good,"Staples was a good gig to learn about Sales and strategies out of college. I learned a lot while I was there about being a typical outside sales rep.  Cold calling, sales force, proper business etiquette, etc.  However, this is not a role I enjoyed, particularly because no one really cares about their operational expenses.  It's such a small part of what a business does, that it's often brushed to the side by managers.  Even if saving the company 10% by switching to Staples, they would often not see the value in switching and having to implement a new vendor.  This was the most frustrating thing about the job.  Also, mandatory call days were the worst.  You felt like a telemarketer.  Calling from 8-5 to line up meetings and having to deal with rejection after rejection.  The company moving forward has increased quotes and made it harder to reach commission.  I saw the writing on the wall and got out to do something I was passionate about.  It may sound crazy, but I wasn't super passionate about selling copy paper."
good,very fast pace extremely hard work good pay long hours making delieveries  to  businesses and homes all types of office supplies//////////////////////
good,"When I was employed at Staples, I ran the register and stocked shelves, as well as assisted the customers in finding their purchases,  "
good,Load and unload with fork lift product to be distributed to other store fronts. Inventory management and product loss. Pull specific orders for stores.
good,"Sales was brutal. GM constantly pushes square trades and reviews video footage to make sure every item that qualifies is being pushed. Any other job there seemed about average for retail, just little incentive for pushing square trade other than your name on top of the list and a fist bump."
good,"During my tenure I had team of very professional and seasoned members, that would product a level of support and product knowledge that was second to none. A great team to collaborate and facilitate account planning sessions, to have provide an awareness to our clients, of the breath of products that we could provide."
good,seemed very laid back. management didn't really interact with crew. never got 8 hours a day wasn't told this until orientation was done and on the floor working.
good,When I worked there it was expected for management to stay past 6 p.m. & not to leave for lunch.  It was a grind & not everyone there enjoyed it but some people thrive there.
good,"Good and easy job, just wish there was a lot more hours and not so much emphasis on the fact  that you have to make a lot of sales like it is a commissioned job yet we don't get paid commission."
good,Very easy job and enviroment but company has unrealistic standards towards signing people up for memberships. Not many people shop here and/or aren't frequent enough to sign up for memberships and the managers/district managers punish for low sign up numbers.
good,"over all I would go in help the customers make sure they get they fax sent and scan help them print , ring up people sometimes put the returns back met good co workers answer phone"
good,"This job is for kids just out of school or part-timers. People looking to advance must strike luck or they will be sent around in circles ""training"" and not getting anywhere. My team and I we're overworked until eventually, we all left. The expectations are high, whenever higher management was visiting the store or a phone meeting was set up it became even worse. Understaffed and overworked, I do not recommend this to grown adults looking to advance."
good,"I go to work and clock in,  The store maybe quiet for awhile.  I work in the copy center which is never quiet and is always busy. There are two people for about 3 hours then by myself.  Busy with customer and have orders that were sent online. It can get stressful and frustrating everyday. I am busy my entire shift and continue to work on jobs after the store closes.  We are all busy working helping customers and zoning the store.  We need more help and we can't get it due to cut in staffing hours."
good,Staples was a decent place to work but the management was terrible. The schedules were always unreliable and management never acknowledged it. It would be a better place if management wasn't awful.
good,"Liked my job at staples.  Did not like Staples as a company much.  I heard a lot of negative talk about Staples from the customers, which I'm sure contributed to my thoughts about Staples being a good company."
good,"Staples can be a great place to work, but if you have a supervisor who physically can't praise or encourage your team, makes it difficult to be successful or grow."
good,"Co-workers are fun. Regular work days are pretty slow, there are customers who are rude and say rude things towards you. Management doesn't seem to do much and all jobs fall on cashiers."
good,"It  would be helpful that management and employees communicate better to new hires, about the working place and how works needs to be done, training is very poor."
good,I enjoyed many of the people I worked with and I loved my job.  I was promoted here and learned a lot and picked up new skills I will take with me forever.
good,Staples is a good company to work for if one is looking for part-time or even full-time work. The jobs are fairly basic as it involves stocking the shelves and being a cashier from time to time. The focus is on customer service being number 1.
good,"Great as a sales associate."
good,"A typical day for a cashier includes stocking the front candy shelves, greeting customers who entered, and maintaining a clean work space. The busiest season is during back to school and it's fairly quiet most other days."
good,Overall Staples is an alright place to work.  The bosses that I had are very kind.  They are understanding on medical emergencies but not when it comes to the fact i have two jobs.
good,The Manager doesn't like they're employees to get second jobs because they know they have their requirements such as be available all weekend.  The Store Manager will act like they don't know how to work around that schedule and cut your hours.  To begin with your hours are only 20-25 at 9.50/hr. Some of the co-workers and Managers in Training can make a employee feel uncomfortable. Managers in Training seem to let their roles go to their head.  One of the Assistant Managers is like pulling teethe to get a break.
good,Working at Staples is a good experience to build your resume but moving up in the company and advancement is not easy at all. The company has pretty fair benefits and they do activities with the employees during free time.
good,"It was an ok place to work"
good,"Managers are horrible at keeping track of requested time off.  Also, at the time I was working the company was not making much and in turn everyones hours were repeatedly cut.  Maybe 5 employees worked more than 2 days a week."
good,"Working at Staples I learned a lot about sales and communication, being operations supervisor I was in charge of multiple departments and made sure goals were met every day.  I received many awards and continued to have my team reach and achieve."
good,"Worked as a cashier, the shifts are about 8 hours long and you will be on your feet the entire time. Often will be dealing with extremely rude people but that's where customer services come to play."
good,They put way to much pressure on selling and getting perfect customer rating while restricting your ability to help them. If commission was based on this it would make more sense.
good,Office outlet is great environment with great staff members everyone treats each other like family. I've been there for 6 years now and I'm looking for a career change and 40+ hours
good,The job was fun we would race pulling orders and loading the trucks plus if we finished early we would wor in differen areas to learn other positions cause some people woul get burnt out with there position
good,"Staples is a typical retail and computer service entity. Some benefits were offered, but were very costly. Wage was payed in addition to some commissions from selling various services and sale add-ons."
good,"My review with working at Staples has become very competitive but I learned so much and working here has helped me develop communication skills, team work and also strong leadership"
good,"The distribution establishment is great for a short term investment, for a year or less time. The work is simple, yet difficult at the same time. What makes it hard to work here is the management style and what is allowed vs not allowed when it comes to work ethic. As always, there is a certain way to coexist within any establishment, this establishment is just not one worth trying. If you are not 100% a yes man here, they will do what they feel is necessary up to and including termination if they feel it is necessary to keep them happy."
good,"Didn't really mind it at first, but some recognition goes unnoticed or expectations for way too high when there aren't enough people in the department."
good,you will lose weight walking .. Im part time and walk 10-12 miles a day there. Management some seem to just want to look for something to get people. So if you dont talk mind your own youre are good.
good,This job was a perfect job for me to get started. However there was not a whole lot of room to move up. One thing that I liked was that I was able to learn new computer skills that I did not know before and it was my first real job that was able to let me branch off and sell extras.
good,Wonderful company with some good benefits. The work environment made you want to come to work and interact with everyone there. You get to meet interesting people.
good,i learned how to improve my customer service skills and my abilities to be able to deal with people and their problems management was very people and employee friendly
good,"It's a good typical first job to have when you are 16 years old. "
good,"It makes ends meet, the company like any retail is hurting right now. The compensation is okay for the work that you do. Overall as soon as I can I'm done with Staples, they have always treated well, I'm just sick of working 2 jobs."
good,I worked there for over a year and was the only one qualified to be promoted the two times there was an opportunity and was denied because I am in school and do not have open availability which is very unfair.
good,"My job duties consisted of a lot of data entry, answering phone calls in a professional manner, emailing property managements to get approvals to weatherize homes, revising paperwork and creating files."
good,"Great company to work for in regards to job security and training, experience and possible promotions. "
good,Staples is a great place to work.  Just like any company it has it's pros and cons.  I love the team I was on my manager always had our best interest at heart
good,"As a sales person, I enjoyed my job at Staples very much.  I was able to accomplish my goals each year because I was disciplined and tenacious.  There were times when I was disappointed with the Management Team in how they communicate but overall it's a good firm to work for if you love to work and enjoy an environment which is ever changing."
good,"The best part of the job were the other associates and the Great customers. I learned the copy and print business and how to please my customers with service. The store manager I had for 91/2 years was the best he knew I could handle my customers and my sales, we worked well together to solve issues when they arose. When he left the morale dropped. The hardest part of the job as trying to keep up with corporate. The most enjoyable was helping customers and exceeding sales goals with my team."
good,"The job wasnt bad. The unstable hours and lack of room for advancement where the big downsides."
good,"I enjoyed my work and the people I worked with. Time went by fast, you really didn't feel like you were working. The job was actually fun, made my quota very quickly and orders were accurate. Benefits were great as were the co workers and leads."
good,"Being a sales associate at staples, your day would consist of, reviewing your previous sales results, making a goal of the present day sales, assist customers and constantly up-sell. Staples teaches you how to be confident and natural with customers, to be able to get to the point and show them what their looking for in little time."
good,Timing Is Everything. Have to Be Able To Read Numbers To Pick Correct Orders For Online Customers. EXTREME AMOUNT OF WALKING THROUGH AISLES & REACHING !! Safety Class is Required once hired there will be a lot of reaching.
good,"Good place to grow and advance, as they give a lot of training courses. Great team and good environment. Lot of opportunity to move up. Pay is not top dollar but worth the experience."
good,The work environment is mostly positive. The company set very high standards and sales goals. Anyone with a good work ethic and ability will progress within the company.
good,"Electronic and stationary retail store. Expect work and customers to go with these."
good,Work was not physically or mentally demanding. Although I felt I could do more but was swamped under being a single cashier on most days. Learned how to effectively manage my own time over a shift and effective ways of  Working with a team to distribute workloads
good,Great college job and ability to transfer when moving to and from college. Different stores operate very differently some are much more relaxed and flexible than others.
good,"The job is relatively easy, it's just annoying when the manager only sits in the office all day and does none of the work that he/she wants you to get done on your own which is usually not possible to get done in one shift."
good,"pros : good for fresher to start there career, brand networking is good "
good,I have been there for years and there is little to no advancement. I need a full time job.I want to be able to expand and show my creativity.
good,"At Staples I learned a lot about management and team work.  I also learned how to effectively communicate with the customers and other departments."
good,"Heavy lifting, stocking and interaction with business owners. Great place to work with flexible hours. Opportunities to post for jobs within other departments"
good,Working in copy and print it did get busy but I did enjoy working with my co-wokers. When the mangers seemed to be in a bad mood it felt as though the whole place was falling apart.
good,The work is regular but the equipment maintenance is not good enough. And also the management is not very good. We were not appreciated for what we have done good.
good,Its Been great working with staples so far. Great benefits and great team. The only concern is very low chances of growing within the company. The culture of putting customers first at all times is a great value at staples. They are strong in customer service.
good,"Typical day would involve sitting on the tills for 3 or 4 hours expected to serve 3 or 4 customers at once due to always short staffed. Money is way below expectation being 5.30 hour. How are you expected to live of this? Overall.... the job isn`t bad, you have to learn alot about tech if you don`t no much which is interesting, but to sales faced and no initative for commision. And unless your a female you will work your way up ""womens smile more likely to attract customers"" pure sexism should never be tolerated."
good,"Just like most things in life, it requires teamwork and strong leadership!"
good,The job is easy and the people you work with are great. The manager has built up a really great team that are easy to get along with and work well in a team.
good,"Staples is a large chain, but at the store level, it's very basic and quite small. Once you become comfortable in your job's given position it becomes very mundane. The management is fun when they want to be but tend to take out stress and personal issues on the associates. Sometimes they even micromanage the wrong people and have un-achievable expectations. The co-workers, those who stick around that is, are very fun and are pretty reliable. I learned quite a good deal of information about the business world, selling, technology products, but found that my PC repair skills were rendered useless because the leg-work of the PC repair is outsourced to a third party company. Overall though, I have created mostly good memories with Staples. I really enjoy the fun atmosphere, straight forward work, and the co-workers. The hardest part is keeping up with the constant changes that the management, who are usually in disagreement about major actions, are trying to make, and doing what is deemed ""right"" when the Sales Manager says something that's different than what the Operations Manager says, who is also in disagreement with the General Manager. It would be a lot easier if we had a Tech Supervisor, but the position has been vacant for months, the department is essentially a snake without it's head."
good,"I love my job at staples , but it has come to light that i wont be going full time with them as it is not in their budget and i need full time employment . what i love about staples is the costumer interaction , i try to get a smile out of everyone that comes in as i am a very happy person ."
good,The company produced labels.It was a 24 hour operation .Most are required to work 12 hour shifts on a weekly rotating basis.The receiving department where i worked was very demanding.One person is required to do the work of three.So working 12 hour shifts means you will stay busy.
good,"Brought on board small to large companies to buy their office supplies online and have delivered....not retail."
good,"Every day was intense from start to finish with many functions to accomplish daily. I would start the day with management meetings to discuss any issues from the previous day. It would take an hour or two a day to get through emails from the morning. I would hold start up meetings with the Sups & Leads before the front line team would show up. Once the entire team arrived, it was all about ensuring that all orders were complete and loaded. The hardest part of the day was the interruptions that would occur to different departments out on the floor. As well as the calls from Sales and CS where we needed to do something extra to take special care of a customer. The best part of my job was working with my team to ensure we were striving to achieve our goals. Getting their feedback on how to continue to improve and how to resolve issues."
good,"A typical day at Staples consist of: running reports on customer accounts, researching and resolving issues with accounts, meeting, "
good,"Management only gets a few cents more pay than associates. Its computer support doesn't get advertised and techs are expected to meet the same sales as associates and we are expected to perform the same duties. I am not a salesman, I am a tech. If you don't make sales then you will be stuck with 15 hours a week or less before summer, even 5 hours a week. The lack of attention Easy Tech receives from Coporate is abysmal. Do not apply if you are interested in a tech job!"
good,Not a lot of room for advancement. No consistent work schedule for Management. Not able to schedule vacation time when you want.
good,"A typical day was long."
good,"I have worked for Staples for 8 years. It is a great work environment with great associates and management. In my 8 years working at Staples i have learned how to execute great customer service as well as learning the AS400 software. The hardest part about the job is not the ability to learn, it is the lack of hours Staples gives to they're associates. I really enjoy the people i work around and the best part of the job is being able to work with customers"
good,Good place to work. Friendly Staff. Flexible work conditions. Easy to get off days for personal matters. Always chance to learn and grow as an individual.
good,If keeps me focused on my next step after I move on. Reminds me on how organization is important for your self and your employees.
good,Challenging work environment built on creating a great place to work and meeting customer expectations.  Support of a large company with a strong infrastructure.
good,Typical day at work involved managing a team of 23 associates in both the Fraud & Reports department. I've learned a lot about online fraud and the different methods to help prevent it. My immediate manager was a pleasure to work for. He was tough but fair.
good,"Managers will expect you to sell warranties. Big sales are meaningless without the sale of a warranty package. If you aren't comfortable pushing people to buy warranties, work somewhere else or just don't do it, you'll still get paid. Customers can be annoying and the job itself is rather repetitive. Co-workers make or break the job, really. "
good,"The typical daily basis of Staples was pretty mundane with selling technology, selling warranties and looking for more ways to improve the store and the personal success of fellow employees."
good,I started at Staples in 2012. The company has a solid supply chain network. I have learned a great deal of logistics and supply chain.
good,Extremely fast paced and extremely high pressure.  On a typical day I would receive in excess of 100 e-mails.  Associates would spend the bulk of their day in meetings.  Communications was somewhat poor from the top.
good,"I like to work in Staples. The environment in there is fine. In this tough economic situation, it is not easy for everybody"
good,Working at the staples warehouse was ok but not great this job does not required all the  testing you have to do for the pay and working environment I'd had better jobs that required less....the pay was ok 12.25 an hour but not amazing but I did love the fast pace and volunteers for overtime the work schedule was also good 4pm to 12am manager where pushy and numbers driving it also didn't matter how fast you work because they don't pay you bonuses or incentives  like most warehouses  but overall it was a ok place to work if you just do your job and mind your own business
good,"Nouveau défis, le travail doit être effectué avec exactitude et concentration."
good,Depending on the manager will either be working on displays or facing the products on the shelf as you should expect. Not very will staffed meaning don't be surprised to find yourself running you assigned department for the day whether you are experienced or not.  Not to many customers makes it easy to build relationships with the ones you get.
good,Staples/Compucom was a decent environment to work in. I learned to work on several additional systems I did not have prior experience on.
good,"Greet guest"
good,Always a great place to work.  Excited to walk in and see everyone.  family type environment.  I learned most of my management skills at Staples as they have great programs to advance learning.
good,great people to work with and great environment. just not the best management team. loved the people i work with and the hours were great. wish other people were trained for my position
good,"The day starts with logging into our system, and retrieving jobs.  I check emails from the previous shifts (overnight) then begin to make follow up calls to clients on the status of the jobs due that day.  I deal with alot of clients,managers, and sales managers, having customer service skills is necessary.  "
good,Great place for highschool & college students to make some money. growth in the company is next to impossible and no real compensation for good work.
good,nothing to do when a company like staples has almost nothing to provide to people. most of everybodys time is spent stocking and hoping to help the next customer.
good,"Fun and challenging environment. typical fast paced retail stores, strong network of support from head office, enjoyed working here for ten years."
good,A typical day requires patience with customers and the ability to help customers in a timely manner. The mornings are usually quiet and good for organizing and cleaning up before it gets busy.
good,"I was able to learn a new aspect of sales with Staples, which was phone sales. I moved from an outside sales position into an inside sales position. I was looking to spend less time in my car and chose short commute over driving all over Florida (central Florida was my territory with my previous company). I had prospected business via cold calling in the past but this was my first time making warm calls and making a sale without any face to face meetings. I liked the job and the culture of the company, but felt like there was no room for growth. Staples is in the process of purchasing Office Max/ Office Depot and until they figure out what the end game is, they are no longer promoting people inside the company. At least not in the inside sales department. I loved my sales team but felt like every couple months the commission plan was altered and goals were harder to reach. There was little reward for great sales months, but always the fear of being fired when you had a bad sales month."
good,"Morning is a typical day , i learned how to work with co-workers "
good,"Cold calling,appointment setting, follow-up, time management. Management is limited to local Area Sales Mgr. 2 days in the office and work from home the rest of the week."
good,"In my 14 plus years at Staples, there was never a routine or boring day. "
good,Decent job with great employees and manageable work. Starting pay is great at first but raises are pretty minimal. If you have no experience it is a great first job.
good,Great starting location for people that are hoping to get into a tech career. Management isn't trained in the tech field so be prepared to come in with the knowledge you've taught yourself.
good,"I don't want to admit my tenure just to say that it was extensive.  Recently I got accustomed to reporting to the Manager on Duty as it was easier than formulating a productivity plan for my team and work day.  Learned first hand that while my job required that I do this most often the plan for vetoed by the Manager on Duty with respect to the objectives given to them.  I wish to clarify that I have no problem following directions or even inspiring a team to do so.  At issue to me is the redundancy in Management and the conflicts this causes.  "
good,"While I adored my customers and 'staff,' the management levels were consistently hit-and-miss as far as competency, accountability, and maturity went."
good,"The typical day involved walking to each customer in the store asking if they needed anything and on occasion we would advise them on the purchases of computers or other tech devices."
good,"It was a good place to work for but offered little chance of advancement, also wouldn't offer any more hours despite obviously being short handed."
good,"The training for staples was great, the management is awesome. The work environment was outstanding and the pace was good as well. The only thing i could say about this place thats bad is the pay is not good, the hours and job security."
good,"Normally the day will go by smooth but if not its because the manager has a stressed day and lets the workers work extra hard. i have learned how to keep a temper under wraps and not show any emotion. The customers are always right, and that was the motto of that job or any customer service job."
good,"A typical day at work is making sure the store is in check, mostly focus on customer service. Making sure that they are happy when leaving the store. I learned how to interact with people more and understanding preferences. I worked with great people. A team that was always ready to work in a drama free environment. The hardest part of the job was selling the suit. The most enjoyable part of the job was building a relationship with the customers."
good,"Within Staples if you are an hourly associate it is a great place to work. The attendance policy, pay, benefits, time off etc. are all very good. However, if you move on to a management role the situation becomes much less favorable. The downfall of becoming management is the pay you receive does not reflect the hours you work. Often you were expected to work no less than 10 hour days, this would lead to hourly associates making more per hour than you do. Advancement beyond a supervisory role is also frustrating due to  constant restructuring which left senior management loosing their positions and being forced to take lower roles leaving those who wanted to move up very few opportunities."
good,"I was very busy and enjoyed the different roles I played in the warehouse.My day would start off running a packsize machine, I did this for about an hour. I then would either scan carts or would pick orders either on the breakpack line or for the bulk team. Sometimes I would do stocking and even work in shipping. I worked in every stage and department in the warehouse."
good,Expectatios for this position are not supported by corporate. Not enough hours not enough support with merchandise to meet sales expectations on the mobile end. Not enough promotion.
good,"A typical day begins with gathering data to compile a report that is used by the entire company to indicate the labor hours used to complete the orders daily as a productivity measure.  It is extremely important that this is completed as soon as possible and be accurate.  Details are matched against alternative buildings and with Payroll.  I have many tasks that I am responsible for and each day is never the same.  One day may be filled with compiling and placing vendor orders for supplies or simply opening mail/invoices and coding them accordingly for process approval.  The most enjoyable part of the job is when I have planned for a special event/luncheon/dinner/or gift and people are happy with my selections.  The hardest part of my job is planning for an in building luncheon for all three shifts and not being made aware of the headcount and lunch times for each department.  I have learned that it is important to keep an open mind and be flexible at every moment as you never know what task you may be faced with.  I also complete a monthly newsletter and conduct the Associate of the Month nominations.  "
good,"At staples, I got to do what I love doing. Working on computers. However, as time went by, corporate saw fit to change the way we work on computers and added a automated system so we could ""be out on the floor"". Most of the time, I was the only one who knew anything about electronics, so all the tech related questions would get forwarded to me from all around the store. While this does not bother me, it does cut into my tech work time. Especially considering the fact that I am the only tech there 90% of the time. As time went by, staples showed just how little they care about their own tech department by making us use old equipment, slow internet, cutting back on our hours, and nor caring if our equipment breaks. all while expecting us to grow and be more productive. It got to the point where I no longer enjoyed working at the easytech bench. The only thing that made the job tolerable was my co-workers. it is a fun and friendly environment where people can interact and enjoy each other's company. "
good,"I make sure I know who is working for the day, and then I start assigning everyday tasks to my employees. Making sure I greet every customer that walks in my store, along with thanking them on their way out. I learned how to balance my duties while watching the front end of the store and also with my employees. I would check in with my employees to make sure they are doing what they are supposed to be doing. To see how sales are doing through out the day, I would check the AS400 system, and see last years figures compared to the current date. The hardest part of my job is making sure all the duties are done correctly, 110% before I can close my store, so the store is in tip top shape for the following day. I enjoyed being a manager and calling the shots and helping every customer that I can. I love to help people. It's a great feeling to help a customer find what they need for their business or even just their home."
good,"I started this job working in the Copy Centre. Due to lack of proper training and not following procedures, this position caused a lot of stress and a lot of nonsupport from the management."
good,"While fellow employees were fun to work with, and the work was enjoyable to do, managers left work created for teams to be done by a single technician."
good,Working with the Staples team is like working with any other team in the retail business. If everyone does their job then the industry will prosper. I've learned how to cope in any given situation on the spot dealing with a variety of customers everyday. The managers could use a little more communication on how they want to run things. The cashiers at best treat the job as just a job. The hardest part about my work was trying to please every customer through Staples policy. I enjoyed the flexibility of the job. It wasn't something that needed to be taken home but gave lots of opportunity to advance.
good,This company took a person that was truly not qualified for a position and promoted them over someone that had already been in the position. This person was more qualified and valued the company and the position more than anyone that was there.
good,good company overall good quality of life sometimes very slow pace
good,Be your customers trusted advisor to build a consistent business relationship.
good,One good thing about working for Staples is the workers become family. i loved my job when i worked at staples but i left due to my general manager. pay could be better and workers could be appreciated more.
good,"I loved this place as my first job, I only moved on because I wanted a challenge."
good,Not a bad place to work but most positions are through a temp agency
good,"It's the dawn of a new Staples, one that is struggling to stay alive like all other retailers in the internet commerce age.  It's trying new things and embracing the website to try to be another ""Amazon"".  I used to love it there, but unfortunately, it changed to much, and I simply couldn't."
good,"Serving the technology needs of the people of the city of Rochester Hills in a dynamic environment. "
good,This is a great place to work if you content on part time employment.
good,"people were very supportive, if any questions needed to be answered they were willing to help."
good,"Management didn't lead by example.  They wanted employees to do more than they can during their shift, and if they go over 28 hours get mad at that associate when they were only doing their work"
good,"I really enjoyed the old managers for the first 4 years then they brought in new management, and it was difficult for a lot of the old staff to change there routine, I even had old managers complaining about the new routine, I tried my best to keep everyone happy. The management and staff said that I was a very calming and happy person who respects everyone and want everyone to be happy"
good,It was one of the strangest environments I ever worked in. I felt like I was stealing someone's job that was about to be fired.
good,"I would come in, in the morning to be yelled at my the manager of my section due to her work not being finished. I would then continue with projects that are not finished and call customers to let them know of their finished projects."
good,we work 14 days out of 1 month. rotating shift.too many management  but company is ok. wish they paid more than  what they i do. Alot of work.
good,"Staples is a great place to work for. Amazing team...supervisors and coworkers. I  was one of the main front end associates during my stay. Although I worked hard every day and showed more effort and interest than some of my coworkers, I feel it did not reflect in my benefits."
good,I have learnt many things in staples about working unity and learned many things
good,I truly enjoyed my job I wish I could been full time. I enjoyed the staff and learned how to do cycle counts.
good,Fast pace work constantly helping customers or restocking the floor. Working on customers computers making sure the work was done before the day they were coming to pick up. Handing out flyers and talking to people to get new customers into the store and the easy tech center.
good,"Sale, and meet sales quotas. Stock items, and help out with other tasks. Customer service at its finest. Fix, and instal software in customer computers."
good,"Relatively low pay, but it's retail so that's normal.  Rarely requires working additional hours etc.  My immediate supervisor was bad, but the two above him were pretty helpful and encouraging."
good,"The hardest part of this job is being able to fulfill all the customer needs at their convenience.A lot of customers come in wanting their jobs done instantly ""while they wait"" but thats not always possible when we have other customers orders to fulfill as well. Therefore we give 24 hour turn around times to give us enough time to fulfill their order correctly. A typical day at work is greeting customers, taking orders, fulfilling orders, and also packing and shipping in the postal area."
good,I don't mean job security. I mean physical security! CVS gets robbed all across the country because they are an easy target. I worked at a 24 hour CVS and have never seen a place get shop lifted so much and even robbed. I eventually left when one of my managers was physically assaulted and had to get reconstructive surgery due to the event. I will not lose my life for a job.
good,"I have 20+ years experience as a Senior Executive Administrator and am looking for a more senior and challenging role.  Although I enjoy working at Staples, there is no growth potential or path for development."
good,The company has been very strong until recent store closures have threatened the level of job security.
good,"I  worked at Staples & Associates part-time  I'm not sure how much has changed since I left, but the sales pressure for good ""numbers"" was definitely starting to increase. I understand the need for good sales numbers, and attaching the right accessories/services to a sale. But when the employees get no added compensation from actually meeting goals, it makes for some very dissatisfied employees."
good,Customer service is priority. It is an okay place to work but has a high turnover due to bad management.
good,"A typical day at work consist of stocking shelves, helping customers to make sure their shopping experience was a great one.  From working here I have learned how to better find solutions to problems as I was always help customers fix their problems.  My co-workers were very fun and enjoyable to be around as well as my managers.  I would not say there were more things that were harder to do than the other because having and maintaining a job is hard work all together.  I love working, I love the feeling of being self sufficient and helping people throughout the day."
good,"It is nice place to interact with different people every day and try to provide best customer service satisfaction. "
good,"Pay kind of sucks. It is always busy, a lot to do Multi-tasking is key."
good,Staples has gone through a complete store restructure in management the past year.
good,"Staples has been an enjoyable work experience for me.  As a Sales Associate, a standard day is very dynamic with many twists and turns, as I strive to meet both customer and corporate demands.  Good time management skills and the ability to remain focused on the big picture are necessary traits when working at Staples."
good,Co workers were very friendly. Learned a lot about the company. Long hours but It was not a difficult job.
good,"Responsible for computer intake, maintaining, troubleshooting, and repairing."
good,"I did enjoy my time at Staples and will miss being there. However, the lack of honesty and consistency within the management team has at times left employees feeling less than appreciated or noticed. That being said, I have had many great experiences with many of the management staff members, but it does just take one weak link to break a chain. I find too often the questions or concerns of the crew members, myself and my team had gone without resolution at all. It builds frustration and low staff morale and is unfortunate because as I said Staples as a company is a wonderful place to work."
good,"i was honestly scared of one of my managers, i learned that all I'm good for is cleaning up after everyone, co-workers hated working there too but i was the only one willing to leave, hardest part of the job was getting walked all over by management, the most enjoyable part of the job was leaving at the end of the day"
good,Compensation is not great with low career advancement opportunities.
good,"Great co- workers, very close team as been together for 10 years. "
good,"My current position is still evolving, making it a dynamic and fun place to work.I love new challenges, so corresponding and negotiating with new accounts is a plus. My only con would be that management was often not fully equipped to direct because of the frequent systematic changes. Overall the position is simultaneously fun and character building."
good,Agradável de trabalhar. convivio. organizada. movimentada.
good,"enjoyable team atmosphere, learn to work as a team unit and also individually without supervision."
good,"Pays very well for store management, and a good value for customer service, however non-store managment will expect you be them before family and life, and there is no loyalty in upper managment"
good,"I have gained tremendous knowledge of technology, sales, and customer service while at Staples. I have built a great rapport with my customer base there. most of the hourly employees are decent people and easy to get along with.  store level management for the most part is okay as well. but above the store is too worried about pleasing stockholders. I realize you have to please your stockholders, but there has to be a limit of how far you will go. the hardest part of my job is always having too much to do. I like a challenge but I think they expect employees to get too much work done with not enough resources to do it. they have a furniture department that they do not staff. they expect the easytech associate to be on the sales floor to help every customer but also get all of the computer repair services done. I think they need to be realistic in providing the resources to complete jobs. the most enjoyable part of the job is the impact that I have on helping customers meet their needs. helping customers solve an issue they are having I feel is very rewarding."
good,regular hours.learned how to work hard and become a better person. Great team leaders but lack of professionalism.
good,"Staples is a good place to work for a person in high school or just graduating. I would take inventory on what we had in the stockroom and also bring it out to the floor, Managers were nice and more than willing to help. I struggled because this was my first job and I was still getting acclimated to the work life."
good,"Maintained stock, worked cashier, built chairs, kept facilities clean, helped customers with information on products"
good,"good work place with many new things to learn and do. Everything from stocking shelves, to scanning items for an inventory completion"
good,Staples is a large company.  You must like and be accustomed to large company mentality and dynamics to be in your comfort zone here.
good,Back to school time brings in huge shipments. No time to rest. Stocking is like playing tetris. Very laid back environment since there is no one in the store other than my overnight coworkers.
good,"Overall, I liked the work environment and the vibe from the co-workers and managers.  I thought the pay was too low and the benefits were not competitive."
good,"During a typical shift I will assist no less than 100 customers with their copy and print need to varying degrees of difficulty. Everything needs to be done with a sense of urgency to the highest possible quality standards. Everything is about balancing the existing jobs with the incoming ones as well as getting out all the small jobs in the process so that people don’t have to wait to long for minor jobs while the larger ones are being produced. Multitasking is a very important part of a typical shift, at any given time I can be running 3-5 jobs at the same time while still maintaining a vigilance of the quality standard and time frames to ensure that all quality and deadlines given by the customers are being upheld."
good,Typical day at Staples was to execute reports that track metrics for dc's.Also follow ups on project statuses.
good,Great culture. Experienced management team. In general it was a friendly environment.
good,"A typical day is incredibly busy. No one in the store, including management, can help in our department which means we very rarely get breaks or assistance when needed. It is a fun job when it's not crazy."
good,a typical day consisted of attending to customers at the copy and print machines. I was mainly a cashier and ring customers up. Managers are very consistant in making sure you are working and doing something productive at all times...co workers are friendly/nosey.They reduce your hours and hire new people.
good,Was a good place to work for the most part.  Towards the end the companys management lost touch with whats happening in the field.
good,"Great company, easy to advance with experience. Very customer orientated. "
good, A typical day at staples involves working on your assigned duty while mainly focusing on customer support. What I learned at Staples mainly is communicating with customers and learning how to best fulfill their needs. The management at Staples wasn't the best mainly due to poor lack of communication with associates. My co-workers at Staples were for the most part friendly and respectful. The most enjoyable part of the job was my friendships I built with customers.
good,The day consists of scanning the store with an RF Gun to see which products are out of stock and which products need restocking. Take inventory of the high end electronics. Perform cashiering duties and direct customers to products. The coworkers get along well but the management hinders our progress for growth because they expect us to perform tasks without properly showing us how to perform them. Have to deal with difficult customers everyday.
good,Challenging to keep up with numbers and stack pallets neatly and safely if you are new to the game. Managers are very friendly and willing to work with you if you keep communication open.
good,"Staples is a productive company. although it is not my dream job, I am grateful for the opportunity that has been given to me."
good,"its staples, its good as a summer job. thats really it. but at least the management was nice. the job is a minimum wage job."
good,"Usually my typical day at work was spent doing all kinds of different duties during day. Stopping from stocking for customers or cashiering. Helping everybody from workers, supervisors and customers. Answering phone call for customers. Always getting called by name for customer assisting and other supervisors orders. And some times not getting breaks for at least 5 hours into shift after being on a 7.5 Hour shift. Skipping breaks because of too much work to do and not enough employees to help. But always helping with a smile and urgency even when with customers getting interrupted."
good,"When hired originally, BI by Staples wanted leaders with experience in sales, Business Development and the understanding of a Profit and Loss statement. They were looking for people who either had owned their own business or a SVP in another business."
good,"Staples can be a fun place to work for those who are just starting out in the workforce, especially if they enjoy retail. The pay is not great at all, but it's a job. There is not anything that is difficult about the job. Management will listen and take advice from employees, but already have directives from upper management. Some days can be slow. Staff are nice to work with. I enjoyed working with customers and working on computers there."
good,"Workin on a production line building pallets of merchandise and prepare them to be shipped out. Very fast pase for 12 hrs each day. Co-workers were good to lend a helping hand if u fell behind, good team work."
good,My position is being demoted to part-time and benefits are being cut off. Bitter sweet moment here now. It was a decision on management that my shift change was the one to make numbers better for the company moving forward.
good,"I must first thank Staples for providing me an opportunity to give me the IT experience I wanted. It was fun to learn all of what I learned. A typical day would be to fix as many PC's as possible and assist others on the sales floor to recommend the total solution for their technology needs. With this being said, it was very stressful to be there as their was not enough consistency with most of my co-workers but especially management."
good,"a typical day would always be hectic you would jump from role to role.inventory to cashier to duty manager .i have learned more about the hidden sides of the retail (margins,payroll,kpi's p&l).we tend to have great co-workers ,positive ,customer focused teams.the hardest part of our role would be the lack of direction and a reactive not proactive attitude .the best part by far were your co workers and customers"
good,they provide a very flexible schedule while going to school.
good,- Started as aisles assistant and then moved into being a Technology Associate
good,Everyday is a new experience and initiative. As a publically traded company change is a constant standard.
good,"There wasn't a typical day here. I worked in every department and did different things all the time. My only steady position was the saturday morning truck unload. I would come in early, help unload the truck, then push the product to the floor. I would usually have all the product on the floor by the end of my shift. I learned a lot of customer service skills there, phones, cashier. My co-workers were ok, didn't have trouble with anyone, just couldn't connect with anyone. Two of the managers were terrific, they were fun to cork with and very knowledgeable about things. But the general manager was a piece of work. She was very condescending, rude and only cared for her own career. It wasn't a very hard job, just face paced. I didn't really enjoy anything about the company."
good,"Company is ok benefits are good , get paid weekly. but the pay is low for how much and the type of work we do but you do get regular raises. If you miss a day you get written up unless you have accrued vacation that I think is rediculous."
good,A fast pace warehouse that I learned to be productive and assure quality.
good,"Staples has the potential to develop their associates along with expand their business. However, they have a problem doing so because their priorities are not straightened out. It's a happy enviroment, but you need to be willing to work retail for a very long time if you are thinking career."
good,"young employees looking to move into management would find staples and excellent place to work. older, experienced employees are not properly valued by management"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of daily maintenance of printers, lamination machines, cutters etc. Aiding our clients with the best printing solution and quality to their needs and specifications. Working with Photoshop, Indesign, Publisher, Excel, Microsoft Word, etc. Assisting other employees with printer knowledge and maintenance. Creating step by step pamphlets as a learning guid for new employees, Ordering supplies for the printers as well as floor products. Inventory of all supplies within the store."
good,"I like the job but, I don't like they wanted people to give so much of their energy but they seem not to care."
good,"A typical day at Staples consisted of taking customer's orders, faxing documents, attending clients in the UPS center as well as offering additional sales/services to customers. Staples has taught me stress-management. At times, the Copy & Print center would become very hectic. Clients would be lined up and as the only individual in the Copy Center, it was my irresponsibility to balance the work load in order to achieve the highest customer satisfaction rating with each customer. Management played a major role in my reasoning behind leaving the company. At the time, their was no General Manager for the store. Staff was constantly disputing over work schedules, which eventually led to a few individuals walking away from the company."
good,I loved this job I worked with children I filed I learned a lot about running a non profit organiization
good,"Staples prides the recognition that it is supposedly one of the best retail corporations to be a part of. While there are certainly worse employers in the job market, I wouldn't list Staples to be one of the best."
good,The company loses it's ability to appreciate and retain good employees based on a poor focus on details by management.
good,Staples is a much slower paced retail environment that believes in one-on-one customer service to achieve sales goals.
good,"I learnt alot working within staples, but not as direct credit to the company but from the customers and business it would attract. Each job and day would be different so there would be no repition of the days events."
good,"My days spent at Staples are usually boring simply because im alot more on the go than my position allows me to be, nothing personally against the company i just like to do more and interact more with people."
good,"I enjoyed my two years working as a ""red shirt"" at the Staples, store 008 in Natick, Mass. We were fortunate to have a great work ethic within our team ... no goofing around."
good,I definitely could not make a living for myself working here. It takes to long to move up here.
good,"Staples is a stable company and not a bad place to work, but the pay is below industry standards. The raises are very low, if you work in the manufacturing areas the equipment is very out dated and not kept up correctly. The management team is strong and knowledgeable. In general is isn't a bad place to work but don't expect to earn a good living no matter how good your experience is and your good of a prospect you are."
good,Accountable employees and co-workers.
good,"My typical day at work consists of working on customers' computer, being the main cashier, and answering the phone at the same time. On top of that answering customers technical questions. I am the only tech that is able to do onsite calls to customers' homes; which consists of wireless printer and network setups. The job can be stressful at times mostly because I'm required to triple task. Also it is expected of me to bring in tech dollars from customers and up sell. The pay is OK, for example for doing all this for a year I only got one nine cent raise, no benefits, and part time inconsistent hours. Management is OK. I am treated decently except for when the managers are always pushing me to bring in tech dollars in a low income area, which the area consists of businesses constantly going out of business. The hardest part of my job is doubling my workload when the other techs slack off or don't get anything done. The most enjoyable part of my job is working on the computers, its my passion in life and its what I love to do. I only recommend this job to techs as a stepping stone. It will look good on your resume but its nothing high paying and you wouldn't get anywhere making a career out of it. It seems like they are always cutting costs. For example: when they got rid of the cashier job position and made the resident techs main cashiers."
good,"Decent at best. If you enjoy honesty or fair pricing, this is not the place to shop. Management in certain locations will have you tell your clientel anything they can think of to keep the customers money for tech services. A manager told me to tell my customer thier computer was complete because we were behind in the department and they had paid for a virus removal. Thier computer had never even been pulled from the shelf for basic examination, let alone to actually be worked on."
good,I was in the print and marketing area and only getting paid 11.00 and working under 30 hours. Running the entire center was a headache especially when you’re not getting your money worth. The management is okay.
good,"I love the job there, but the company is going through instability. The same as most other companies, senior management needs to take a look at middle management and reassess."
good,"My personal experience was not ideal, more so related to incompatibility with the tech industry. The expectations are standard for retail with a major focus on  print and marketing."
good,Get paid every week Great management Great support Learned a lot and pay was good Opportunity to move up quick Fast pace environment Great benefits pto sick leave 401k
good,"It,s verry friendly enviorment but you neet to be responsible and little bit stressfull"
good,"Working here has taught me to be highly organized, to treat and aid customers with any and all solutions. "
good,Its pretty easy to work for them once you are already hired. They have decent hours IF you are already working another part time job. They will work around other schedules if notified that you can not work certain days. Requesting time off is fairly easy as well.
good,"I would come in look at the daily log to see what if any work needed priority, if any of the machines needed repair and if a maintenance call was made.  Check email & on jobs that were sent to production or third party.  Then help customers with there print order & occasionally help around in other areas of the store.  Also had weekly reports to turn in, training and cross-training, faxing, and assisting in the self-serve area."
good,"There is so much to learn by working at Staples, to this day, I'm surprised at all the skills I picked up with the help of my manager(s) & team. I would've loved to stay, but unfortunately, I don't get paid enough to cover rent, so I must bid this lovely job farewell."
good,My review about staples is the company is a good company. I recommend anyone to work at a staples near them. It’s extremely friendly easy going. You can easily upgrade in the work place.
good,"You can't really escape this job. If someone gives me a hard time I can't even get away in my sleep. I have some managers who want to believe the customer is always right even though I'm already doing my best to help with basically no compensation. It's often a 2-3 person job left to 1 person, so not only are you not getting paid fairly, but you must be an excellent multitasker. A fun job that just doesn't pay enough for the nightmares."
good,"A good place, but they would not schedule employees for enough hours.  I think this is due to trying to mitigate employee turnover, but it ends up driving increased turnover."
good,Shut down after a year of working here so not much to tell all in all the job was easy work and repetitive great for agents work never was going to get it full time
good,It would be difficult to work with the new manager. The old manger was very respectful and work with everyone the best he could. The new manger came with a rude approach. Releasing my personal information to another employee without my consent.
good,They were upfront and frank about being a sales force.  It is a pretty conservative work environment.  They want you to show up and get your work done.  If you can get good customer relations and a decent profit margin they will leave you alone.  The layoff was disappointing at first but now I have answered more of a calling.
good,"The customers are horrible, they mostly think your stupid and don’t understand your job. Management isn’t bad and the people you work with are mostly friendly."
good,There is no work/life balance. Associates and Managers are pressured to hit goals and are barely compensated. The structure of the company isn't at it's best & those in service positions feel it the most.
good,a little miss managed but the hardest part of the job is of course customer service which i have alot of experience and technical skills in easy tech and copy center
good,"It's a warehouse job.  Bought out by Sycamore Financial last year, so cuts are starting to happen.  No room for advancement.  They have eliminated several management and all hr positions.  Really pushing for high productivity.  But if you can handle repetitive work, the work is easy.  Overtime during peak times on short notice.  Ok starting pay."
good,"Throughout the day I would be asked to report my sign ups and things. If the report wasn't up to standard then I would be blamed for that. This would happen twice every hour. The co-workers were nice and fun to get along with. One out of the two managers were nice and I got along great with, but the other was a pain of a boss, trying to get you to do everything and if something went wrong and it was out of your hands, then it was your fault."
good,"It's nice having people who are friendly to work with. Though for the amount of time we have been left under-staffed you'd think they'd pay us more considering we still manage to achieve all of our sales goals. While they do offer what is called the ""team bonus"" it hardly amounts to much at the end of the day. It also doesn't help that some of the systems that they use are outdated to a point where it makes working even a challenge. They run their terminals off of computers that should have been left in the 2000's resulting in numerous slow-downs, and their kronos scheduling system is the worst. Constantly not working for mobile devices. I loved my time there though, I just wish they'd give us better compensation and better tools to work with."
good,Solid retail experience however the low pay along with many duties falling outside the job description make for a stressfull work environment not ideal for maintaining a motivated worker
good,Very productive and hard working person. make sure I don't get into drama but stay focus on my job. I always derive by coming out with more idea in the job just to make production high.
good,"Nothing really different about this job, it's exactly what you expect to see and do at a Staples. Honestly it's pretty self explanatory and easy, only stressful part about it (which wasn't even that bad) was the LONGGGG lines during back to school month (September)."
good,Jag själv tycker att det var en stressig miljö då det blev spring på spring på spring i orderplockningen och ibland blev det total stopp på banden och när det väl började så matades det ut dubbelt så mycket och det är väl sisådär enligt mig :) men lönen var väl okej :)
good,"I have worked here for a while and have been very disappointed with the new direction. The managers make me feel like my job is unstable if I make mistakes. They purposely understaff the store. I barely have time to complete anything in the copy center and I feel like I'm working the job of three people. It's just a very stressful atmosphere. I will say, they have been very accommodating to schedules. They seem to have a great understanding most of the employees are at the age where education comes first and they allow the staff to focus on that. It's stressful and I don't always feel supported but overall it's just a temporary part-time job."
good,Its nice place to work as a student and first job to gain experience. Pay rate is not good compared to work and management is not as capable to run this company.
good,Daily routine that's environment is fast pace with a wide variety of customers. I liked that I was able to stay current with technology via company mandated training program.
good,"Management was not always consistent, all employees and staff were not always on the safe page as for as production goals and what needed to be completed for daily tasks."
good,Staples was a terrible job for me because I was working very far from where I live. The management only cared about themselves when It cam to my travel conditions.
good,I just do weekends. Almost a year now. Nice co workers and management team. Clean easy going typical retail work. Not difficult work. Not for someone that wants a desk job.
good,the overall company is ok but the pay is not good and the management needs to figure out a better method of making thing work ie the overall products available in the store.
good,It was my step up from where I started. They have reasonable expectations and are a fair company to work for. If you are enthusiastic about being in the work force and starting your customer service experience then this is a great start!
good,Staples is a nice working environment. Good employment for college students with flexible hours and good pay raises after 6 months. Location is right off expressway I 94 and employee environment is supportive.
good,I loved the co workers very much but the management would always push someone out of their job if they messed anything at all up. I loved the customers and my job (fixing computers) unfortunately the management isn't the best at my local store\region since they are best friends.
good,"Some quick facts about my time with Staples:"
good,even on slow days theres always something to do. it can get a little hectic in the back to school seasons but you still gotta manage how to satisfying customers and getting your work done
good,Although it has changed immensely in the span of time I have worked there.  It is still a great place to work with many opportunities.  The company is going through changes as far as their business model but is still a stable and friendly environment.
good,Staples was a fun place to work but the shifts weren't very flexible when it came back to school time. My co workers were great but management needed some help in areas.
good,"Management was poor,  and the atmosphere of the work environment was very much off.  Tough to get a day off when needed because they were always short handed and on short notice."
good,Commissions were negatively impacted. Even with a margin percent of 121% and a sales growth percent of $900 less gross than what commission had been. Leadership was promoting only women into roles whether it was deserved or not. #womeninleadership.
good,"This can be a really good job for someone looking to find part time work."
good,"Hiring manager will say management opportunities during interview/orientation and if another employee gets offended when finding out, title will be taken back."
good,"Staples is taking on a new focus and new goals.  The changes that are coming are going to be amazing!  The continued struggle to grow in a declining industry is going to be difficult, but well worth the effort!"
good,If you are applying for a job at  staples print and marketing or tech are the places to go. they offer the most to expand and better yourself. also they offer the most opportunity to impress your boss.
good,"Staples helped me understand the basics of retail , management, teamwork  and sales.  I worked many different positions within this company that helped build my skillsets on my resume for future opportunities."
good,This was a good experience that gave me confidence to move on to an enjoyable career. It was a good job that taught me how to deal waith customers and co workers
good,"Great place to work if you enjoy a fast paced environment. Very Hot in the summer.  Work/life balance wasn't great. Although you are given core hours, you had to check daily before you left for your next days start time. If you were off for vacation etc, it was your responsibility to call and check your start time. If you were late, occurrence. Overtime was plenty. But you wouldn't know ahead of time. They would call OT prior to 45 mins towards the end of your shift. You could not leave until they told you that you could, otherwise you would get an occurrence."
good,It was nothing special and nothing I suggest to anyone who is looking to having a real living unless you have a second source of income besides this being a part time job.
good,At staples I unloaded the truck and stocked the store and helped the customers find just what they are looking for...keeping the store's price tags out and helping customers place orders for delivery and or in store pick up.
good,"The people are friendly, things are very controlled, eg lunch breaks, how long you are away from your desk for.  Very limited lunch time space considering how may people work there.  Structured monthly appraisals, encourages team spirit within the work place, a mixture of age groups."
good,A typical day for me at staples starts from 3 pm. I would clock in and help customers locate items or stack shelves. I got along with my co workers and it was fun working with then
good,This employment is pretty standard for anyone that doesn’t yet have a degree. I worked here while getting my bachelors and was compensated for some studies which I thought was pretty generous of them to do.
good,good for a starting position or temporary job but bad for long term investment. hours are all over the place but if you dont mind that then it is a great fit for you.
good,This was my first job and I had strugfled a bit at first because it was back to school season and staples was very popular. But after I learned the ropes I adapted quickly and enjoyed working there.
good,Department I was in needed a positive adjustment and that was my biggest struggle; didn't enjoy the poor attitudes any longer.  There are opportunities for advancement if you put yourself out there!
good,joined the company when i was sixteen years old. Worked there over a little over 8 months in order to get work experience. Had no intention of remaining with the company after that
good,"Company has a lot going for it. Under new ownership, they have a strong plan for growth starting now and through the future. Needs more of a Work / Life Balance atmosphere."
good,"great place to work for people looking for their first job, hiring process may take a while. Seems like you have to know someone before you are given an opportunity. Overall a good job, decent pay, nice environment,"
good,"I recommend this as a great first or second job as you get a whole bunch of learning and experience from this job."
good,This was my first job . This is where i learned what customer service was all about ! They take it so serious and that will forever stick with me . I recommend this job as a first job for someone looking for part time work
good,We had a great store but stuff from Corporate was unfair in certain situations. I has great coworkers and a great manager. The district manager and above were unfair of their people and detached from the day to day work we did.
good,"I liked the people I worked with, but the management had issues. And trying to get everyone to sign up for a protection plan or apply for a credit card. They also could pay a lot more and make it worth it. I did enjoy the employee discount and the double time pay on a holiday."
good,one manger in one manger out. with selling expectations that are un reasonable.  The support from staff is not coincident with the expectation of company.  Company use to be a destination employer
good,"There are good opportunities to advance your an associate. Management is very supportive of your ideas and suggestions. Training is excellent, flexible schedule. The company offers good benefits, and also provide additional training to continue learning new skills. You get to work with some great people from all over the world."
good,"Staples would be a great place to work, if they could get out of their own way and put competent managers in place. Great all around atmosphere, but you have to get used to the micromanagement that takes place constantly."
good,"It was a good job while i was going through college, they were flexible with the hours and stuff."
good,our particular location was very hot in the work area. the work was sometimes intense depending on customer demands. During peak season there was a lot of overtime offered.
good,"The store is usually pretty slow until some holiday, tax season, or back to school comes around. You only really help out customers but when there are none you go to each aisle and check if everything's in order. It's a very boring job and the pay isn't great, but I enjoyed working at Staples only because of the managers. They were really helpful and understanding, as long as you did what you were told they're really your best friend."
good,"I was never given proper training, even when I asked to be trained in the specific job field I was assigned. Managers would force you to stay after hours while not paying, or giving overtime.  I was only given like 12 hours a week when I had applied and been given a ""full-time"" job."
good,"This job is nothing special. It is a very simple retail job no experience is required. You are not paid much not even to be considered livable, but if you need a job it will work."
good,"Staples Inc. is a Massachusetts-based retail company. It is primarily involved in the sale of office supplies and related products, via retail channels and business-to-business-oriented delivery operations. The company opened its first store in Brighton, Massachusetts on May 1"
good,Nice place the managers were very nice I learned how to improve my people skills helping customers on the floor and how to do inventory. The pay was low and the hours as well. But overall a good place to work if your looking for a part time.
good,"This was a temporary job, but I liked it because I was able to work independently. I liked my job, but was disappointed in the way that they handled my last day at work."
good,"A trusted B to B salesman, responsible with assignments given to manage and secure business 100% of time. Knowledge, prepared daily as preparation for daily business. Always came up with a solution. "
good,Just another high school job. Something I used to pass the time until graduation and leaving my home to go to the army. It was still a good job though.
good,"While working at Staples, my social and customer service skills have increased significantly. During my time there as an employee, we had a few managers in and out of the store. Each person hired for the job executed it perfectly. The workplace was fairly diverse. As a first time employee you will be over whelmed with the work load, for as Staples's business mainly comes from the Print and Marketing department. Aside from this, customers going into all departments of the store must be treated as anyone other customer. Overall, the most enjoyable part is the engagement with customers. You have the opportunity to meet people and create relationships with others that can benefit you in the future."
good,"Typical day was unloading inventory and placing it on the shelves. Counting inventory and remodeling shelves for the displays of products. Then cashing out customers, totaling daily sales and helping customer with any questions they may have on the product sold within the store."
good,the place is a good place to get on your feet when you are just starting out in the work world but its a fast environment so your always moving around the people are nice
good,I love working there but feel i am in a position that i am unable to succeed in as well as i have moved twice to higher levels but have not gotten any increases in wage i feel that is very unfair
good,"I was hired as a Sales Manager; after a few years , I was promoted to General Manager. As with any job, the decision makers always had there favorites."
good,As a print and marketing associate I work in a very high paced environment. I have to deal with incoming online orders as well as help customers who walk in. It’s a very stressful but fun job as well. Some days I’m left to do the work by myself but you will always have someone to help you out like an manager or supervisor. The pay is great and scheduling is very flexible. The other employees are great and I have great relationships with mostly everyone from around the store. The only thing I could say that’s bad about working at staples is the lack of good management. Higher tier employees like the district managers make some very ridiculous goals for us employees to reach on a daily or weekly basis which adds a lot of pressure to us. The managers don’t really take action when it comes to some employees not following policy but other than that I’d say this a relatively nice place to work and if you’re looking for job that involves a lot of hands activities than this is a good job to apply to.
good,Have lenient scheduling but pay you bad with low advancement and the managers take all the good hours and constantly follow you around making sure you're working while they do little to nothing.
good,"As far as skillsets and responsibilities, Staples Tech's Position offers hands on diagnosis/troubleshoot/repairs to learning in 4 areas of the Maintenance department: Electrical, Mechanical, Pneumatic, and Hydraulic. Also miscellaneous skills like Welding, Plumbing, Carpentry."
good,"Staples is a great place to work if you need flexible hours while you put yourself through school. Also, if you are just starting out and need a good lift off point. Once you're in, as long as you show up and do what is asked of you you're job is secure. The management are extremely approachable. When you are considering a serious career move however, they aren't really able to offer incentive to stay. Your hours are capped at about 25 because they can't offer health insurance unless you have a management position. I have enjoyed my time at Staples but the hours are just not there to make ends meet."
good,typical retail. Focused on sales of services in copy and print center and tech bench. Has gone through massive workforce reduction and store closings.
good,"Working here was not the greatest. I worked in the copy and print section, and the training did not prepare me for the job at all. People want custom prints and designs from you, but you aren't taught how to do them. You have to learn on the go."
good,"Staples would be a great work place if management didn't care about themselves. The staff got along very well, which it wasn't the staff that made me and other people leave it was the manager. If we are working in a workplace we becoming a team. At staples it wasn't like that people and manager pick and chose when they wanted to be a team which isn't right at all. For your company to succeed you have to communicate, team work, determination etc."
good,"I learned how to work with costumers and build up my communication skills . Hardest part of the job was to memorize where everything belongs , learn all the bar codes for every single item that was needed to be restocked. The work place environment was organized but they wasn’t to good at understand and communication."
good,"A lot of layoffs happen, so always have your resume updated. Your work environment really depends on you manager and coworkers. Pay is low-average for the job market"
good,"Good employer, learned a lot about sales (although they require you to push customers to buy extended warranties which are useless and expensive). No job advancement opportunities"
good,"The people I worked with were either high school kids that didn't care or management that took there job way too seriously. All in all, it was alright."
good,Managers were understanding of schooling conflicts as well as vacation. Staples provided flexible hours. Team work was great and effective. Discount was nice
good,"-Deal with customers on a daily basis: Help customers find what they are looking to buy"
good,"This is an average retail experience that has no sense of fulfillment. There are no chances for advancement even for full-time employees."
good,Great training and a clean workplace lead to a stress free sales environment. They provide additional training and opportunities to work at other locations if you wish. Good chances of moving up internally within the company
good,"Great workplace, fun staff. Management was terrible and overall lazy. Did not promote a healthy environment for their employees at the location I worked at."
good,"Learned Java, Communication,  Order Management System, eCommerce and lot of other management skills."
good,"Retail is a tough place to be these days, and Staples is struggling to maintain their strong brand and marketshare. Good company, good people, but lots of challenges that can lead to instability."
good,very stressful turnaround times and expectations. team was ok to work with but very unorganized at times. management was shuffled around so no one was ever in a position for to long which made doing our job alot harder because the support was failing.
good,"It was a great place to work. The people there were very supportive."
good,"Working here was a pleasant experience because i was able to help costumers shop and find supplies for the office or personal use. This establishment taught me how to be more understanding with helping costumers build their supply cabinets with different items. The environment was diverse, which made this fun because i was able to learn about my fellow coworkers and experiences they have had. "
good,"I had no problems working at Staples. They did have a committee that boosted employee morale. About 50% of our jobs were outsourced oversees and had to look for employment elsewhere,"
good,loved this job in so many ways and i hated it sometimes too.. Really good management.. everyone is outgoin and make sure you get what you need. really good customer service
good,"While I do very much enjoy my work in Staples's Print and Marketing Center, the general atmosphere is very controlling due to poor management."
good,Not really the best place long term but for a young kid just starting out short term seasonal it's perfect. Helps kids get a grasp of the real world haha
good,When I worked there good place to work with good supervisors. reason I left was I was on afternoon shift and people I worked with complained to much about who got to leave when there work was done and why  they didn't have to help. other than that good place to work.
good,I've worked at 2 different Staples and both places were laid back and a good place to work. Management is helpful and there are good working conditions.
good,"Call center environment with cubicles throughout.  Tough to be productive if you are not the heads down computer worker.  Great people, but compensations did not match workload."
good,"The manager went to school for merchandising and did not understand computers, we worked to five and went home,  people caught him behind the service desk and would have a computer they brought back with a question and he would have a Panic attack and tell them you have to come back tomorrow between 9-5 "
good,"Great work atmosphere "
good,"As it is a retail establishment, varied work schedules are available.  "
good,"Taught me a lot about being a cashier, and taught me a lot about making binding and cerlox books, making posters and blueprints, black and white and coloured print outs as well."
good,"As my first job I've learned most of my working skills there, however they lack a lock on the IT Inovation, most items that they sell are +1 year old, and most of the ""white brands"" they sell are totally unknown"
good,"Staples is a good company, unfortunately their business model has changed and not what I was originally promised.  Direct manager is not strong and demonstrates and communicates uncertainty of the direction of the company."
good,"staples is a fast pace job , especially back to school season . leaving work so late to back stock and to fix the store. There is a lot of competition between associates and determines payment. You can be a cashier helping out easy tech and easy tech would get payed way more then cashiers isn't fair ."
good,Ik vind het geen gepaste manier om hier iets over te schrijven
good,nothing about staples stands out as good or bad. The work is easy enough and the customers are usually pleasant. but like you might expect its pretty low paying.
good,"the responsibility of sales was hard to achieve as the company required on a monthly basis 5,000 per month on the average was 4500 at the time.  Staples believed in at the time comparing small sales as penny customers and that it was a waste of time dealing with clients that were not going to generate large sales.  I strongly believed in all customers were worth our time, and considering that the copy center was all about paper. Penny customers were to use the self serve with no help from staff."
good,Being a supervisor at Staples is veey stressful. All of the responsibility that is put in place is a lot. The managers did not make anything easy either.
good,"Scheduling can get messed up"
good,Staples was a temporary job for me but it served the purpose. It required you to learn a thing or two about computers and electronics and improve your customer service/retail skills.
good,"Not enough hours, and store was a mess. Management at the time was nice made some good memories. The pay was a little low as well. Overall I would recommend a young person to work here"
good,"Although I was able to create my own work schedule for the most part and was given a lot of autonomy there was no room for advancement in career or salary. Most hires were done outside of the company and management was not authorized to give above a certain amount in raises, and that amount was very little. Management was gossipy and would talk a lot behind other people's backs."
good,Was a job while I finished schooling. It was not a bad place to work.  Management was great. I just needed a busier place to work. Loved doing there plano-grams.
good,"typical day includes store stuff. Cashiering, stocking, and selling."
good,"They moved my entire department to Florida due to money concerns. After moving it, the department fell apart just as Staples did. Company was much better to employees years ago."
good,"Responsibilities: Providing exceptional customer service; scanning & bagging items; processing transactions; answering phones; looking up product availability; inventory control; stocking front-end racks with merchandise; and balancing daily cash register paperwork."
good,"Decent place to work, people are friendly and helpful but organization is siloed and can be complex to navigate relationships and historical ways of doing things to may not make the best sense. Creates a lot of friction in getting what should be simple things done."
good,"you are just a number to corporate you are replaceable, a lot of work and not a lot of people to get the job done poor training, i do not recommend someone choosing this as a career choice"
good,"typical customer service work. they had meetings everyday. you need to know how to answer the phones, and trouble shoot customer issues. good training"
good,"was a great company to work for. Fast paced and overwhelming at times. Wonderful people to work with, closed now though so no chance working in the call center environment"
good,"this place is not where you would like to be. Not enough hours to make a decent paycheck! No solid staff, not in good location as well. Not a good place to work!"
good,This job was extremely repetitive and was hard for me to stay motivated to preform everyday.  The management where I worked was okay at best and didn't help you very much when you needed it.
good,It was great working there and gaining the experience and while i understand that i was just a student i was severely limited to what i was allowed to do
good,Good atmosphere and good people working there. Low salaries which means a higher turnover rate for employees. In store management are very involved and work with the staff to get jobs done.
good,Was promoted to full time with benefits so that is the main reason I have stayed. They are flexible with scheduling and the people who work there are very kind.
good,"The company talks about how they value work and personal life balance, but the amount of work you are expected to accomplish cannot be completed in a 40-hour work week. There is a lot of pressure to work long hours."
good,"As much as I enjoyed what I did, the job was very stressful, although with the fast pace, days went by pretty quick."
good,"Delivery driver job is fast paced. You meet tons of different people. A lot of the time you may be expected to change your schedule around and go help another driver, which wouldn’t be so bad if they weren’t on the other side of the metroplex (50 mins away) then 30 mins to load off their truck and almost 2 hours to help them deliver. There is long periods of their year when it’s dead and you only get like 33 to 37 hours a week. Then there is peak times when you get like 45 to 60 hours. It’s nlt consistent. They hire to many drivers and not enough work"
good,"A typical day at work was wearing multiple hats and balancing multi-departments. I had the opportunity to meet great people through my career over the 22 year span. Unfortunately, they down-sized Rhode Island and laid off 31 of us. I appreciate all the knowledge I left there with."
good,I worked with great people who loved their jobs and loved helping people at the same time. Very helpful to there fellow coworkers and to the customers.
good,taught me customer service and how to work the front desk and how to great customer and how to work in different situation with different kinds of customers
good,each day is filled with trying to run a store with a short staff. seems company does not really know what it takes to run an efficient store. people get hired and then do not show up.
good,only worked there seasonally for back to school it was very brief but the managers were nice and everyone was pretty cool would possibly work there again.
good,I work with a lot of great and  talented people is my most enjoyable part. Hardest part of job is getting thru to the correct people to get things done for the customer.
good,"Customers come in with copy and print orders to be completed. Orders were to be done in store, if not possible they're sent to the online submission site."
good,The job had its good things and bad things. They had an issue with scheduling people when they have school and/or away from military duties. One of my co-workers would constantly be scheduled when they were out of town for drill.
good,"I was assigned to Staples warehouse as a Temp.  The managers were very nice, as well as the full time employees.  They made work feel easy with their flow of activity.  I would recommend to anyone who is interested in a physically demanding warehouse job."
good,very strong customer and cashiering abilities are required at staples seeing how you work alone most of the time.  there are classes to be taken to advance in staples if you desire to do so.
good,"I like working there : meeting new people, selling products that could enhance their way of life. I just wish they had full time employment with competitive pay.over all I don' need a 150 minmuim to express my feeling."
good,"As a merchandiser/sales associate expect to move newly delivered merchandise on to the floor, ring, guide customers, sell squaretrade and liquid armor, and place online orders for customers in a single day's work. Occasionally you'll be assembling furniture as well. You'll have a considerable workload to manage as far as operations go, but none of that will be considered in management's assessment of you, which is based entirely on whether or not you're selling squaretrade warranties. Management is going to try and feed you ""teamwork"" values while pitting your metrics against each other. It doesn't matter how much you helped a customer as far as informing them about an item/warranty or how many associates it took to convince a customer to purchase a warranty, the associate that put's their name down gets credit for the sale, which your coworkers can exploit if you're not careful. There is no commission for selling squaretrade, you simply get to keep your job, and occasionally you'll be rewarded with ""star points"" to spend on staples' rewards website for employees."
good,"working at Staples was my first job. it was very fast-paced when busy, but also very slow. The pay wasn't great. overall it was an okay place to work."
good,I was there for over a year and it was all good but I felt I was working too much and doing way more than what I was getting paid to do. They underpay you
good,"it was something to do between semesters, it motivated me to finished my degree during a bout of burnout. the manager i worked under was awesome, would not reccomend the current one"
good,Not the worst but nothing special either. Im not leaving any review. I am looking for a new job not wanting to bash the current one I have. Thanks....
good,they suck and least that was how i felt. they didn't have room for improvement and the lack of management was horrible. every day we would get some new people because no one could do there job right due to very little training
good,"Friends and family was working with me. Clean environment with many items that needs to be restock. Many activities to do, theres always movement involved."
good,"I do not recommend it to anyone. When I worked there, my manager had told me one thing, then, when he got into trouble, he threw me under the bus and denied ever giving me permission to take home electronics that had been left in the recycling box. I was using them to advance my knowledge at home by tearing them apart and putting them back together again."
good,Not a people place i wanted to transfer closer to home but they did not accommondate me would have continued to work their if placed closer to home otherwise they are a ok company
good,"it was boring, not a lot of work to do. mostly just did stocking and blocking and stuff, patrolled the store and that jazz. nothing much to say, really."
good,Staples Copy and Print center was always fast paced. The great thing about that is there was always work to do. Time management was one of the greatest learning curves I gained from working there. The occasional opportunities for cross training in multiple departments and coverage for Copy and Print associates was the greatest room for improvement resided.
good,"Same stressful pace as most retail organizations, but not a lot of support with a small staff on hand usually. Not uncommon to have 3 or less associates at a time."
good,The big problem was how fast management turnover was. You could have a good set of mangers then within 2 months most of them could be gone and you get managers that are not all that great.
good,"I'm grateful for the opportunity to work for Staples.  If you want to grow in your skills working for a retail environment, this is a good place to start.  But most of the time they are short staff so one person juggle between 3-4 responsibilities.  Be prepared to help restock the sales floor frequently lifting up to 40lbs and constantly using the ladder.  I like how professional and kind the managers in that store, and how great the team of co workers I have during my time with them."
good,"I make these negative comments from the time I spent with Staples because of corporate, going all the way to the CEO and down. Since I left, everyone in corporate was replaced, so things and circumstances might have changed for the better."
good,Overall good place to work until they started having money problems due to competition from on-line stories. Then they found reasons to encourage long time employees to leave in order to save money.
good,"Staples was my first job during high school, and I honestly wish I started somewhere else. The management staff were more than a little hostile, and the hours and pay were pathetic in hindsight."
good,"Learned a lot about how to work with the public and to provide customer service to people that were in need of specific items. Cash register experience, stock experience."
good,"The most enjoyable portion of my job is the interaction with my team and members of other teams. Working together with other supervisors to accomplish the goal of satisfying, both internal and external customers."
good,"Good company to work for, allot of store and great selection of electronics. It is a good place for student as their first job. Allot of learning chances."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of fixing client computing issues, in store and in home, and sometimes helping out on the sales floor, or with incoming store product."
good,"Staples Advantage is a good place to start your career in the corporate field. Please be aware that opportunity for advancement is very limited.The benefits are decent, but could be better"
good,"I wasn't stuck doing the same thing over and over again. I learned lots about making binders, posters, business cards, etc. The management was good and made sure things were always running smoothly. Employees get treated with respect and its a great environment to be in. I wouldn't say theres been a time where there was something I couldn't handle, but the most enjoyable part was that i got to experience new things and made new friends."
good,It was a great part time job. The Schedule fit in with my School schedule. The Store is easily accessible by public transportation. It was an organized place to work at.
good,"It was an okay place to work, pay was low, and they kept laying off more and more managers. Only a week of vacation and were looked down upon if you ever had one sick day."
good,"hard work is completed all day every day  nothing nothing nothing to say about this.  I do not want to complete this info"
good,Typical retail sales. One team member screwed up big time and then the basically fired everyone. pay was ok for part time between classes and to pay for expenses.
good,worked there for three years. Was a great place. Moved through multiple departments. So long as you work hard you have plenty of room for advancement.
good,If you are looking for a job quick fast and in a hurry staples is the place to go. It's not the ideal job but it puts money in your pocket. Management could be better but but hey like I said it's money
good,"Working mainly on tills and copy center meant that there were times when the same customers would come in, and therefore you gained a relationship with them, meaning that you knew exactly how they wanted their job done and they were very grateful with the effort put in to it. "
good,"Good for a first job, seasonal employment, or working while in college.  If your goal is to supplement income while doing the three options I just mentioned, this is the job for you."
good,"This job requires a lot from their employees. We are expected to help the customers, put freight away and up sell many products all at the same time. It can be easy but it is very demanding."
good,"Ambiente  de trabalho agradável, departamentos que interagem e trabalham juntos."
good,"Staples does a great job of catering to the needs of their customers, however, I feel that with more allocated resources (including people), the efficiency of their end goals can be achieved much more effortlessly."
good,I had a great opportunity with the boss I had. He was great and we pushed our store together to the top 10%. the issue is with higher ups in the company putting their finger into the stores and ruining the experience for the employees. I had to just leave because it was getting too bad. Of course 3 years after my manager and I left the store is back to the bottom 10% again
good,"You are inundated with the coordination of numerous special orders for the companies you are assigned. I enjoyed being busy, but I was extremely overwhelmed and afraid of failing. Everyone was is very helpful and supportive."
good,Not a bad place to work but they were not very good at training their staff. You are expected to learn as you go and keep up with the people who have been there for 10 years. They need to revamp their training procedure
good,"A typical day at staples is full of laughter a little bit of stress and full of customers. I would walk in before my work shift and my coworkers would greet me with a ""Hello welcome to staples"" and a smile on their face this would brighten up my day; I could only image how great the greetings would make the customers feel."
good,"Staples was a very hectic but an entertaining job. When you have a great manager your days are not as stressful. When you have a manager who does not know what they are doing your days become very stressful. Staples was good to me, for the most part, it's just like any retail job, to be honest."
good,"Staples was effective in providing some knowledge and training in my pursuit of Computer Forensics while in college. "
good,"Staples provides a good opportunity for people looking for a good way to earn experience in the working world, as well as rewarding workers for their hard work."
good,i liked working there people nice job nice close to house everything that is good was what this job was. everybody should work there at least once in there life
good,job is pretty simple and they will work with your hours but pay is not anything to brag about unless you manage to land a job as a general manager or higher.
good,"Copy and Print center us a hard position to learn there but once you get the hang of it, it's pretty fun especially when you make your own stuff aswell. Customers tend to be rude but you get used to it."
good,fun place to work with lots of training and oppportunity to meet many new faces there is never the same thing twice and you will love it and i know the managers enjoy therir
good,I was told a had to meet certain goals for the day and for the week. There was no reward or motivation once meeting the goals.  I had to train new employees and at one point a new manager.
good,Basic retail job. Nothing crazy. Help out as best as you can and clock out when your time is done. Good team to work with. Just never enough coverage to meet the need of the customers that come in.
good,"The company wasn't bad to work for, however corporate does not go out of their way to protect their store from customer complaints. Also, Tech Managers would have to sit through long meetings of why numbers were not being met and not given the tools to succeed."
good,There  information come in handy when there website work it to slow and need to be more update some information will come up wrong for customer when they place order online and they end up calling Customer Service regarding the error.
good,"Staples is the perfect job if you want to be surrounded by cool items and make a little money while doing it. A few perks, awesome in store playlist if that matters to you. But I have never witnessed anyone move up into a better role with staples."
good,Was fairly average part time job. Got to learn some fairly useful computer skills and people skills.  Met some good people that worked there as well. It was good.
good,Never enough qualified staff and if you are knowledge they will run you all over the store with the intercom.  Aisle 3...  Aisle 7.  This job is high stress for little pay.
good,"This company runs on typical warehouse operations and functions, if you are skilled in logistics and have an eve for detail this would be a good fit for you."
good,"Copy & Print was a very customer-satisfaction-focused position. Most Copy & Print Pros are not customer-satisfaction-focused. Management was stressed and pressured. Not a bad place to work part-time, but pay was low for my skill-set and there was no advancement."
good,"Typically sold electronic devices and software on the floor of the store. Interacted with customers, answered the phone, and fixed electronic devices."
good,"The overall company is the only bad part. Staples is too far behind the times to be a real competitor and it will frustrate you how silly some of the processes are. It’s a good place to work with a low stress, slow pace. They just think they’re more big time than they are."
good,"Typical day consists of customer service and interactions with associates.  "
good,Staples is a decent company. I mainly worked as a cashier so it was interesting and repetitive to constantly ring out customers. Overall it was a decent summer job.
good,Entered fax orders/email orders and helped with phone orders when the queue was busy.  Custom imprinted orders for businesses and schools.  Contacted customers for any irregularities on their order.
good,Management would have a hard time finding people to fill positions. Would often delegate employees with responsibilities of supervisors without the pay or the title.
good,Great place for part time work. Staples closed the store location that I worked at for part time work.  Great group of employees and bosses. Didn't  mind working late.  
good,Do not wish to participate and do not like that this is a requirement. My job at staples was fine. pros and cont to any job. liked the people and didnt like the hours.
good,easy work but fast paced.  must have a good relationship with customers.  must be punctual.  must sell protection plans.  must get customer rung up and out in 90 seconds.
good,"really not a bad company to work for, too bad that they will not last through 2018. any job there will be gone as they are closing all brick and mortars."
good,"stressful and fast paced"
good,Have an open schedule and prepare for lots of issues. They kind if throw youbto the lions but you learn a lot every dsy. Also making displays are fun.
good,check computer repair statuses for clients arriving that morning for pick-up.  make sure electronics department stock is all faced and in appropriate location.  assist customers with sales.
good,"Idk what to say, i'm forcefully having to put a minimum amount of words on here so I could move on to the next thing. The job was overall ok, would possibly recommend it to others."
good,The store is OK. Diversified job role. Strict management. Advancement is based on performance but takes time. Flexible working hours. Fast paced. Challenging.
good,"Job was a fun place to work.  Sure sales metrics were tough to hit in ever changing technological environment, but wasn't impossible.  Great atmosphere to grow."
good,"stress full working with temp agency workers."
good,Its nice working here...You are able to grow within the company...Customers are pleasant of course you have the rude ones but overall its cool .........
good,"The work itself is easy. Not that busy and not hard. Managers and supervisors are helpful and kind, but woe to anyone who needs help from HR, they are rude and sarcastic & not helpful whatsoever"
good,"I really don't have time to review currently, maybe someday in the future I will. Bottom line, I worked there 17 years and my position was eliminated. Not sure where Staples is going as a company."
good,"The workplace is filled with horrible people, both customers and coworkers. The managers abuse their power and make us work extra hours for little to no benefits. Compensation is low and it's not worth applying. Save yourself a waste of time."
good,Typical retailer. Over the years the company has developed a good training program if the management team utilize it. You might find yourself in a store that has a greater need for manpower and your training will be cut short.
good,Solid company to work at. Opportunities to train and improve job skills. The department I was a team member of consisted of a dedicated group of people with extensive retail knowledge.
good,"It's great for students looking to work and go to school, but it's still retail. Customers can be very nasty, and depending on the department you are in you will have to learn how to manage your time. You will learn so much and gain many experiences from working at a job like staples."
good,"I enjoyed working for staples up until their demand for results increased but my pay didn't budge. At the rate i received, i had the mindset of ""do your time"" and leave."
good,Fast pace environment which you have to be able to multi-task. Average salary is below other retailer. Great part-time work place normally very flexible with scheduling
good,"Overall, it was a great experience working for Staples.  Great benefits and good management.  Good severance packaged when laid-off.  Tough going for retail side, but good future for B2B and online sales."
good,"enjoyable part of the job was when i quit. i don't tolerate disrespect under any circumstances. the particular people i worked with some were okay and 2 people were horrible , they didn't know how to speak to others."
good,"Staples has a great handle on diversity.  They also promote from within.  I was laid off, and now there are more layoffs coming.  I recommend you be careful what department you are working for to ensure that it is stable."
good,customer services jobs like staples does not pay enough for what workers have to deal with. 11.00 dollars is not enough to survive on your own. plus the stress of what goes on with the job makes it so it really is not worth the money but its what you have to deal with if you wanna eat.
good,I started working for a company called Ross-Martin back in 1973. Through a series of buyouts I eventually was working for the Staples Print Management Company. Handled phone calls and emails dealing with specific clients. Working with an on-line ordering system for customers to access.
good,"My first day, I shadowed someone, and then I was on my own the next day. The rest of the week I was a brand new cashier still learning and thrown into chaos (as this was back to school time.) Customers were rude. Some staff helped but after a while, you could tell they were getting annoyed. Management was great when I first got there, but after our assistant manager left, it went down hill. Our general manager left shortly after and left the store in shambles. Since then we are going through temporary managers, and supervisors, and inventory specialist. As well as copy and print, they seem to be on their own little island."
good,"The job itself was enjoyable and very challenging, however the job required working various late night shifts which made added significant strain on m y social life."
good,"I learned how to do many different tasks. I started in the copy center, moved to cashier, office supplies associate, receiver, business machines associate, and department manger of furniture. Then when they down sized I went back to receiver again."
good,"The copy center stayed busy with all kinds of business. There was always something to do. I learned how to make banners, posters, invitations, business cards, pamphlets, booklets, and other projects. Management was ok and came to help when needed. Hardest part is lack of employees to help with big job orders and meeting the deadlines. enjoyable part is actually working on the project and seeing the final result of what you help create."
good,"A decent place to start getting money,"
good,"accommodating to my school schedule"
good,"A typical day at staples, I would have on average of 50-60 stops a day delivering to various businesses and delivering an assortment of boxes or packages through different cities."
good,"had to load trucks at night. hard work and doesn't pay well. bosses are cut-throat that I remember and they don't make your job any easier. not a very god company,"
good,"Your day mostly depends on the way the store is for the day. If it’s a busy day, then you will be on your feet all day. Having to restock aisles, busy in the copy and print center, tech & cashiers. If it’s a slow day, you usually see the cashier helping out in the aisles until a customer is ready to check out."
good,I was basically at the register for four hours (my whole shift) everyday. I really didn't enjoy the area most customers were EXTREMELY rude but hey its customer service so I got use to the disrespect by most of the older men that would come in.
good,There are no comments that I can think that would be appropriate for this review.   I appreciate the opportunity to share.  Have a wonderful day and a great week
good,"Not enough staff on duty."
good,"we come in and set up for the shift, cash register set up. greet customers and provide outsranding customer serivices.  fun job but sometimes it could be stressful."
good,"Hired as a tech, trained for tech. After 2 years moved to cashier because of shortages, forgotten about and had to work as cashier because there were no way to hire more."
good,The management was unfair and sexist. I was a female manager and was treated different than the men. I had more responsibility and was expected more while the men stood around and talked.
good,good people that were easy to work with and work offered plenty of overtime. hard work payed off in leaving early when work was finished as well as optional to help others out as well
good,anyone can do it. you place anything from a ruler to a pencil in a box for roughly 8-9.5 hours a day. you have no benefits and college kids manange the assembly line.
good,"With the change in ownership, Staples was purchased by a private equity firm a few months back, it is currently a bit unsettling at the office products giant."
good,"It was a good feeling when drivers would tell me how nice it was to be able to find all of their packages without to much trouble, especially when they had a busy day."
good,"Staples is not a technology company.  It is sad that retail stores are dying but Staples really has a hard time moving past retail and pushing their IT face forward."
good,"Again, I didn't agree to provide free content in exchange for my resume.  Imma fill up dis box heer with some nonsense.  I could write volumes about my experience at staples, but that's not why I'm here!"
good,Good starting place to work but if you want to work in a actual tech department you're better off finding elsewhere to work because its nothing more than a selling position
good,It was a great entry level role for those just getting out of college or looking to increase level of B2B experience.  Upper Management would change the sales goals and techniques each month during my time there. Which made it very difficult to master my sales process.
good,The hours were very random and never set. Often the schedule was changed without notice and there was always favorites who got the morning shifts. Pay is also very low for the hard labor.
good,"Decent place to work, 10% discount off of anything is helpful.  Super competitive sales enviroment.  Lots of pressure from district level to exceed sales goals by a large margin."
good,"I enjoyed working at Staples as an Area Sales Manger within the Print & Marketing Division. I managed 9-11 Print & Marketing Consultants throughout Northern New England.  I had extensive training focused on change management.  Great experience and the opportunity allowed me to further develop my management skills.  Print & Marketing Division continues to struggle at Staples, however the experience gave me the skills and experience to work through difficult situations and prepare me how to lead a teams through change."
good,"To much hard work break wasn’t long enough and the job didn’t pay enough for the work we was doing, wouldn’t recfomebt if you have bills to pay, physically demanding job"
good,"The managers were friendly and I got the position I wanted. It was very quick paced and the customers were constantly rude and complained about prices I couldn't change. The environment was very quick paced and competitive, and it felt as though you had to kiss up in order to move up. They are incredibly flexible with hours and will work with you if you are in school or have another job. Overall, I enjoyed working there and would easily work there again."
good,"i was working two jobs around this time and it was during Christmas season. it was horrible working retail during that time and influenced my decision a little bit. "
good,"Good place to work"
good,"With Staples going private, the environment is filled with uncertainty.  There are many changes anticipated in the near term leaving many feeling anxious about their future with the company."
good,"Lost position due to store closing.  Had worked for Staples 8 years, enjoyed the job security (until I suddenly didn't have it), but was a little burned out on the retail world."
good,i learned how to greet guests over here. This place is so quite. I love the way they deal with their costumers. the enjoyable part of the job was helping with guest concerns.
good,I have had the pleasure of working in two different locations for this company and can say without a doubt this employer can be wonderful and provide excellent career advancement opportunities when good management is in place. However when the management is lackluster the job satisfaction and employee rentention plummets.
good,I enjoyed the work I did.  Worked with customers on a daily basis who were for the most part very nice and respectful.  Was productive and met the customer's needs for order fulfillment
good,Staples has changed the bonus structure every year and it has lowered every time. They have set goals that are very difficult to obtain. And since the bonus is lower you have to do twice as much to get a bonus that you were used to before the changes.
good,Low paying job good way to start working if out of school. If you have a family do not plan on seeing them. Managers have to work 10 hour work days. Close at least 2 days a week and never have 2 days off in a row
good,"great company, working with others was a plus. Expectations is at a high level when selling technology items. "
good,I have grouped all of these companies together because they appear on my resume that way. The only reason im writing this is because im being forced to.
good,"Staples didn't really have a lot of growth opportunity, the culture was hostile. I don't believe all staples' are like this, but I would generally recommend this company to someone who is going to school, but not a career choice."
good,"It's not that hard to get the hangs of the role and it rarely gets busy, Definitely get customers who have a sense of entitlement but some are nice and thankful of the customer servive."
good,I didn't really have many problems with the management. I had fun while working there. I just got my hours cut and I could see the company was headed down hill will not very many employees which fell back on us
good,"This was a job I wanted before I could find the ""right job"" for myself. Sometimes it was hectic, sometimes there'd be nothing to do. I wouldn't recommend it."
good,It was a nice place to work and the employees are very nice. The pay was not ideal and the hours were long which is typical of retail. There were a lot of things required of you with not much pay to compensate.
good,Ok place to work. Lots of changes. Management was going through many changes when I worked here.  Not sure what the culture is like now though. They were trying to get more Amazon like when I worked there.
good,Not too hard.   Working with DC's across the US. Management is too lax at times and you don't get much help in resolving issues. Co-workers make the job enjoyable.
good,"Die Teamarbeit war sehr wichtig und dies war positiv! "
good,"loved the job, but raises are an insult, does not give one much  motivation to do a good job and work hard. First year got 7Cents an hour raise second year only got 12 cent raise Pretty pathetic"
good,good start for someone just getting into the real world and looking for a part-time gig. when i worked there your hours where based on what you were able to sell.
good,"This was a stressful but interesting job. Learned many things and enjoyed interaction with co-workers, sales representatives, etc. A typical day was constant phone interaction with sales and processing closed loop resolutions to situations."
good,Fun place to work. Had an opportunity to work on many new initiatives and projects taking place during my internship. Great way to get your feet wet. Human Resources had a great intern program.
good,"This company is an excellent agency to work with. It is perfect for a student, working schedule is very flexible, so students can adjust their working time to fit school time."
good,perfect job for a teenager or anyone good with managing a store. i picked up a lot of useful skills for running a store and it was a gateway to some actually pretty decent jobs
good,It was a relaxed environment because it was a work from home base the disadvantage was that it was only a temporary job the most enjoyable part of the job is that I could set my own schedule
good,I think that this is a good place for someone looking for a starter job. It wasn't hard work and you have to learn to interact with others daily. Tough however if you want to make it a career choice.
good,very nice people at staples when it was their but again the agency kept me on and off like a yoyo cant seem to have a break from these agencys absolute total nightmare
good,"Three primary corporate goals to operating a successful Staples Office Supply Superstore, Excellent Customer Service, Sales Growth, and Maximize Profitability."
good,Staples place for me to develop personal skills that I am able to transfer into next roles. The working culture there was fantastic and we worked as an effective team to reach our goals.
good,I liked working here until I watched a webinar detailing the low percentage they strived for as far as employee satisfaction. Salary was low compared to similar positions with other companies.
good,having a wonderful smile and a great attude to all coustomers and workers working together is shower a passion to what you doing and brings a love to what doing
good,"The only part of Staples I enjoyed were my peers, which all quit shortly after I was hired due to poor management.  ""People don't quit jobs, they quit the management""."
good,"Great work/life balance (if you are doing well as a salesperson). Poor upper management, company is constantly and drastically changing things around with practices, metrics, and even sales technique. Sometimes it feels like they are grasping at straws. Not 100% secure in my current role with all the changes just because there have been a LOT of divisional layoffs within the company and not much room for advancement unless you are looking forward to becoming a robotic area sales manager."
good,Very organized entity with strong support for staff and management. Warehouse are unionized so it is critical to be alert when dealing with staff. Long term plan in view with flexibility to adapt to quick market changes.
good,"Good place to learn customer service skills in a fast paced environment."
good,"As a manager, we would come in get the store open, morning paperwork processed, get ready for customer traffic and proceed with the day. "
good,At first it was a nice place to work for until I changed my department then I found out that most of the time there was not enough work for us that's when they would cut hours
good,A typical day at work tends to be pretty long as I work 9 hour shifts but the time goes by fast. The employees are a lot of fun to work with and we enjoy our time there. The hardest part of the job is being under staffed in the evenings and having it struggle.
good,"Great helpful people to work with but communication between the higher management to the store was less than desirable. the culture was too relaxed but fun as well. Trying to lead my team with little to no direction, or my extreme lack of training before getting into the job was the hardest part. The amazing people I got to work with would be the best part of the job."
good,Good work place to work at just out of high school. People are easy to work with the pay is ok but it can be better. Not a lot of room for growth in the company.
good,"very big on safety, which included daily stretching and helping of other employees.  actively incourages open communication with upper staff and other employees"
good,"Working the cash register, helping customers, stocking shelves. Overall an okay place to work. The location I was at shut down and they did their best to get me transferred to a different store location."
good,Retail and customer troubleshooting is a major part of this job. Any given day your duties could and will differ from freight; stocking; organizing and tech work on customer PCs.
good,"Call Center Cubicle maze.  Expected to meet preset targets of calls received and queries resolved.  On slower phone times moved to a different call queue to answer unfamiliar questions.  Good motivational events and incentives, weekly meetings with management to listen and also be heard."
good,Engaging every customer you come in contact with.  Managing stores P and L statement setting sales goals challenging associates.  Establishing a professional work environment.  Controlling payroll day to day as a controllable expense at times was challenging.  I found great pleasure in hiring and training of new associates.
good,"Good place to work. Salary is enough, only problem is the time that is given a lot of time cannot make full 40 hours  works a week which makes it hard to make a living."
good,I left Staples after nearly 11 years.  I left during some changes but much more change has effected Staples since my departure.  I was on the contract team so I was not affiliated with the retail space.  I enjoyed my time at Staples and learned a great deal.  I think they will eventually iron out to be a good place to work but it will take some time.
good,"Steady paycheck and dealing with customers was very easy. Most duties included selling computers and or printers to customers looking to upgrade. When I was not dealing with those customers, majority of my shift was making sure the store was kept clean, resetting endcaps to display new merchandise and labeling overstock items while putting them in their correct position throughout the store."
good,I was hired as a lead in aisles department and excelled at my position to the point of being assigned more duties not within my job description. I worked well with all the staff.
good,"Always something to do and you always feel underpaid. Some policies just seem outright unfair to customers, be prepared to feel guilt all the time. Great sense of comradery."
good,"it's not too bad to work with the peoples,People are very friendly.I enjoy to be around the people that's I know at the STAPLE'S...But I have too leave the STAPLE'S and move on to the Mohegan sun casino...It's pay better"
good,"A positive work environment makes employees feel good about coming to work, and this provides the motivation to sustain them throughout the day."
good,"Staples was a good place to work, initially. After several management  changed, however, the work environment took a downward turn. I left very frustrated and confused."
good,Job usually offers seasonal and temporary work. Overall nice place to work. Benefits could be better and more permanent positions could  be offered. Nothing bad to report.
good,Make it what you want it to be.  I appreciate the experience and opportunity to work for a large company.  Working for Staples was a learning experience.
good,Typical day at work for staples. Everyday monday through friday id come in and start breakpack picking. Making orders for customers. the only thing i didnt like was it was very disorganized.
good,Staples is a great place to work. In my time working there I learned a lot involving tech and copy and print . I grew as a manager and was ready to go to the next level in my career.
good,"Not a lot of growth opportunities, but a good entry level job.  Compensation needs review as well.  Overall a good place to work with a very laid back atmosphere."
good,I enjoyed working with the staff that i was employed with but the core of the job wasn't the best to work that i was interested in. Also the management wasn't the best
good,"For a little cash to the side, it is a great work place but if your trying to have extra cash to yourself then I highly don't recommend it. The pay was low and the environment was pure boredom like having nothing to do on the weekend."
good,"Staples should not be a part time place of business. Staples needs to hire more people. Working with Staples is great. I learned every department in Staples. My goal is to be promoted as a Shift Supervisor at Staples. I love the copy and print department, its always busy and I interact with customers which I enjoy."
good,At the time I worked there they implemented a sick time package that was unfair to staff that had children. AR dept was good to work in everyone was friendly and willing to lend a hand when needed.
good,fun place to work great work place vibe greta coworkers managers were also very helpful. Customer service was always a main priority of the company it was top priority.
good,"Staples is usually a slow store, the pay isn't great but for the amount of work i think its almost fair, its good for a starter job to get into what retail is about and learn all the ins and outs."
good,"Staples has a brighter past, than future. With he current changes coming I would consider going somewhere else. "
good,You will never be paid what you are worth on a retail level. The stress you bring home with you is completely unbalanced to the role you play. It becomes extremely difficult to separate your work life from your home life.
good,Focused on lead generation and prospecting.  Strong focus on business solutions.  Very solid leadership with a culture dedicated to the individual.  Fierce competition from Amazon and other online retailers.  Attaining new business and providing solutions.
good,i only worked here for the holiday season but it was not a job that i enjoyed. i did not like the type of work that i was doing. the people i was working with were friendly but just not my type of job.
good,"It's an nice place to work. One can make it interesting by helping existing small businesses and start-ups improve their technology, Marketing and Organization."
good,"Learned how to make copies of all kinds of item such as documents, made money transactions,  and answered phones regarding customers orders when needed."
good,this job wasnt so great. i got tired of it very easily seeing as it was very repetitive. i enjoy a fast paced work day to help seem like time is passing by quicker.
good,I worked two postions at Staples. One was to stock the shelves in all departments and the other was a cashier position. Coworkers were relaxed and attentive to the customers.
good,Didnt have trouble doing my job . Most of the work was simple and not that hard of heavy lifting. Greeting customers with a smile and having respect ..
good,"Staples Advantage was a good first sales job.  However, it made me realize that I'm not a sales person.  I don't enjoy having to try and convince someone to buy things from me.  I love the customer service part of the job but not sales.  The management wasn't very friendly or supportive.  And there was NO opportunity for advancement in my office. Maybe in the HQ but not in the bay area.  It's a good place to see if you like sales or not."
good,"A typical day is very busy, with lots to do and not a lot of time to do it all so time management is very important. "
good,"Part time with very little compensation. Worked well with everyone, did my job well. Though I have no complaints about the company itself, I do wish I had more hours and better pay."
good,Copy center associate no complaints really kinda fun helped customers design stationary cleaned and kept area clean mgmt is not too bad fun people to work with
good,"Fulfillment Center"
good,"room for advancement"
good,"I loved the interactions i had with the customers. Offering Tech solutions and becoming the trusted adviser is the best part of the job."
good,"It's has good entry-level jobs for those looking for extra hours or a stable paycheck. Good experience to build and customer service skills to learn. Daily work includes freight, filling shelves, setting tags, selling products and services, and cashiering. The overall teamwork and use of walkies is an efficient system. Training will be through the computers and other associates. However, there are some downsides that come with the big business retail-territory. Some higher positions are compensated well while low-end positions are neglected in decent pay and reviews/raises. It is good for part-time benefits and a few discounts, but the hourly worker will move on to other promotions/opportunities or be stuck at low wages indefinitely."
good,"This is a good job if you are looking for a few extra hours as part-time, especially for a college student. No real full-time positions till unless in a supervisor position.Typical day is just working the register and running the customer service counter. Nothing really hard about it except for a few rude customer that come in. Decent pay for the position though."
good,"Worked on a temporary basis so very difficult to fully evaluate the company. If employed on a permanent basis, I think it was probably a good place to work: large organisation with good opportunities for development."
good,Good company to work for at the time.Company was focused on growth and customer satisfaction.Good leadership in tough retail environment.The company treated there associates well
good,"working at Staples was decent, the management seemed genuinely interested in me as an employee, seemed willing to help me advance. Didn't seem to have ample staff to accomodate high-traffic sales hours..."
good,"not so good, management it's not good. to many bosses. i work in the copy and print center, provide customers with their copies, banners, faxes n more."
good,"Technology is our Achilles Heal.  We are competing with some of the most dominating technologically advanced companies and we are still rowing our boat with an oar."
good,Got along with most of the staff. worked hard at replacing shelving and planograms for the face lift during fall 2015. I am better suited in customer service and previously worked at Shoppers Drug Mart.
good,"I've found that working in retail takes a certain personality. You have to roll with the punches, multi-task like a computer, and learn not to take complaints personally."
good,Store management was excellent but was not able to provide sufficient employee support due to company policies. They were not able to provide proper training within my department.
good,"it was an ok company to work for, the hours were unstable and would often cause some conflict with my personal life. My managers were awesome! Had a different crowd of people come in everyday."
good,"A typical day would include finding out our goals/tasks for the day and giving that information out to associates at a start up meeting. Delegating tasks or locations to associates based on their skill level. Keeping up with payroll, making sure we are hitting goal, VTO associated based on production levels."
good,Staples overall was a good place to work and I met a lot of great people.I learned many things over the years which helped develop me into a strong manager.
good,"It was a retail sale , normally the company looked at his target and achievement basis, learned how to tackle customer queries. Management always looked for profit ."
good,"Had to make money, wasn't bad to make money at. Staples is trying to do more with less and that just doesn't work out. Expect to work hard and be worked harder and still feel behind."
good,It's an okay company but they can do better in training employees. Doing this would help the employee and the company. I also think they can do a better job recognizing employees who go above and beyond. A pat in the back here and there increases moral.
good,When I work their they said that they would work around my schedule and then when sports started to have meets and that they gave me troubles about taking off from work from events
good,ok retail job. if you like dealing with people this may be the job for you. from cashier to checkout its definitely some that you should enjoy.Management was ok.
good,"stressful work environment, unreasonable expectation, no support from management, poor management, don't care for their employees and alway micromanaged"
good,Staples is a fun place to work. The back to school season gets a little crazy but if you enjoy a fast paced work environment then this is the place for you!
good,Good place to work but they don't pay well and especially not accordingly. The copy centre should be paid more then cashiers as it is a high paced and different kind of work then just a cashier. I do love the management at the store and my associates I work with!
good,This job is interesting if you're into memorizing multiple numbers and feeling like an accountAnt who stocks shelves. Not my idea of a permanent job!!
good,When I first started was in back to school season and they were always busy but after the season ends . Staples is incredibly slow. At the time it was fine because this was a part time job while I was taking six classes so  it gave me time to do homework when I wasn't helping a customer.  However if you're looking for a challenging job cashiering at Staples is not it. The people there a great sense of humor and the managers are kind.
good,Starting out I would open all loading doors in the shipping docks. As product is dropped I would shrink wrap pallets by hand and label certain product as they are dropped. Repeat for 8 hours.
good,"It had its ups and downs, but overall there is too much pressure on lower level employees and management doesn't understand the needs of their employees."
good,"Customers come and they go, help them out, stock shelves, talk with co-workers... nothing different than most retail jobs. Sometimes there are bad customers and sometimes there is too much to do, but in the end you come to work, do your job, and don't stress out."
good,"Great experience, was able to learn a vast amount of knowledge when it comes to printing.  Learned a lot about xerox machines and how laser printing works, as well as dipping my feet in digital design."
good,"I worked there for a year and it was an okay job for a high school student who just needed a little change in their pocket. Management was all over the place which made the store all over the place. If you like organized chaos, this is the job for you."
good,"11 years the company and it gets worse and worse every year. ""Protime""..... unlikely..   ""Make more happen with Less"" is more fitting."
good,"I worked in the copy and print center, it was fun working with local business owners. They really expect you to know what you're doing if you're working in the copy and print center."
good,very busy and fast pace. its easy to learn i learned a lot about copy and print and working throughout the store. to work at staples you have to be willing to learn because there is alot of stuff you have to pay attention to detail to.
good,"I think Staples is your typical retail job. You have some customers that are terrible and you will have other that are okay. As a part timer, it wasn't so bad since I wasn't there often and I didn't plan to be there too long."
good,you must be willing to multitask and work under very stressful rush. the associates are great. they treat you like family. some of the managers are okay.
good,culture and upper management are terrible to deal with. the daily routine as a manager is insufferable. they push programs to make a slim margine and neglect the important pieces.
good,Staples is a relaxed self paced job where you are in charge of your portfolio.  Team work and accountability are a major part of the culture. Very big on Excel and Access skills.
good,"its ok I would rather work somewhere else,  the pay can be unfair and they make you do more than one job at once, managers don't do anything,,,,,,,,,,,"
good,I found that I had more problems with the management I had at this time in one of the departments. Over all other employees were helpful and nice. I always kept myself busy either cleaning or correcting produce.
good,"Work consists of ringing up customers, upsell, and make sure you are always doing something. Hardest part of the job is the upselling and dealing with difficult customers."
good,"i havd lots of interaction with customers , learned on the job always willing to learn and enjoy new challenges, always carrying tools,at times can be hard , and heavy equipment ."
good,"Not a bad place to work, pay can always be better in retail for what is expected from all companies. There is not much more to say. I was customer service, A price auditor and much more. Didn't have any problems."
good,The management has made the work experience there unenjoyable and has gone done hill since the store manager took over and there are currently people looking for new employment cause of it
good,Staples is a good place to be. There are reorgs and changes.  Changes are good but stability is welcome as well.  The important thing is to stay focused and be flexible.
good,"They had many great products but the store i was at was overall messy, and short staff and unorganized. Warehouse was not in order couldnt find anything for customers"
good,Staples is the type of place where you hate but love it. The people who work there are great but the constant changing of procedures that seem to be working for us has to stop.
good,The staples print and marketing center is a fast paced yet productive work place. There is a constant flow of interesting work coming through. The store however was not managed as well as it could have been and coworkers were incompetent.
good,"A typical day at work involved going in at 7AM to settle the Cash Office and distributing money to all registers. Through this job I learned much about the retail portion of a larger corporate store. Higher management was driven but unable to stay organized. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning all roles, training, working with people and handling money. The hardest part of the job was make a living on a mandatory part time schedule that did not include any benefits while working full time hours."
good,"Staples is a dead end job. Yes you get paid, yes you meet good people, but there is no room for you to advance in your position and the things you learn are only relevant to working there."
good,Provided me with good experience fixing both hardware and software problems on customers computers. Lots of customer interactions and sales experience.
good,"It takes time to be promoted in a place like this but when it happens be prepared to work even harder and maintain numbers as numbers is the key thing they look at and if it is no where near what it should be, your in trouble."
good,I enjoyed working by myself all day and growing my side of the business and watching the business grow into a flourishing one. Miss my coworkers and team as well as the customers too.
good,"The shift at the time that I worked here was 4 10 hour days, I had a split shift so I worked Monday & Tuesday, had Wednesday & Thursday  off, then worked Friday & Saturday and had Sunday off."
good,As a Loss prevention officer I enjoyed my time at Staples. Miss the associates and the management. The workplace culture is very good. Staples treats their employees real good
good,"I mostly worked in the copy department in two separate stores, the one in Mohegan Lake was wonderful, the one in Poughkeepsie was not. I relocated and transferred stores."
good,Very friendly workplace environment. Is very fast paced and will need to have lost of patience and good customer service skills.  Did have great bonus and incentive program years back but did away with.
good,As Far as working at staples it was more so just stocking and organizing things in the store than make sales so its quite dull as the day goes on cause you really don't have much customer interaction.
good,"Slow paced "
good,Good place to work very fast pase wore a head set and it told what to pick where it was at and how much to pick the only think I didn't like  was that is was part time and I needed full time
good,"Maximizes sales opportunities with every customer by using current selling techniques and company programs."
good,"I was a college student working here. It was fun while it lasted the people were a joy to be around. Job wasn't too stressful although management could have been better. Easy job, easy pay."
good,"Friendly staff, could work on training the accosiates better. Good first job for someone in school. Not enough hours for everyone. Too much staff working there."
good,"Fast paced position with a lot of duties. I enjoyed the position, but it didn't pay what it was worth.  I relocated and had to move on because the travel was too far for what I was being paid."
good,"Its a nice job to have in college, or just out of college. You're on your feet a lot, but the folks and corporate culture are very nice. You don't make commission but the store is judged on something like attach rates- like if you sell a computer you should try to attach the software or printer, etc."
good,Coaching and developing young talent. Tech support on site networking and in home set up. Computers routers and end devices. Customer relationships. Growing business needs.
good,Staples offers a flexible retail environment with a lot of opportunity to learn different skills.  You are able to interact with many customers throughout out the day.
good,at the time of my hire things were difficult for me.. the store under went over five management changes some of which played favoritism. Hours started out really good for me until the latest manager joined the team and reduced my average hours from 24.5 to 16...
good,"Good place to work with many talented people but the competitive environment from Amazon, Walmart and others is really making things difficult and issues relating to salary and bonus are not to be taken lightly - hard to get rich at Staples."
good,"-Some days I would work a full 8 hours, while some days I only worked 4 hours."
good,I really enjoyed working for staples only downfall I had was when I was in a car accident i was let go due to being in the hospital and they couldn't no longer hold my position.
good,"Good place to work, good benefit's, good people. Staples has a lot of ways to expand within the company witch I really liked as I worked there. I would recommend it."
good,"Good job for student. Hours are decent and flexible. Lots of friendly staff, and training is very straight forward and easy. Good for part time or full time."
good,"The hours are flexible and depending on the manager, they are according of illnesses. Working at Staples has Improved my communications skills with the customers, they gave me a chance to learn and develope my talents. I was very happy working with them."
good,"Overall, I don't mind the employees. We all got along. Management, was okay. Select managers I liked better. However, the repetition of the job became dull, annoying and too easy for me. Even though not all goals were met, trying was always what I did. I wish to expand in life experiences and not be stuck, literally STUCK behind a register all night."
good,"Typical retail environment. Sell, sell, sell. Rude customers. "
good,"I worked as a Sales Associate. My hours ranged from 18-30 a week."
good,"Wouldn't recommend working for Staples, management were not informed correctly with changes causing constant emergency meeting and confrontation between workers. "
good,This is a fast paced environment and you're always on your feet. you have to be able to know how to multi task and take constructive criticism.
good,"fast-paced environment; requires constantly standing, walking, pushing, reaching; working overtime is mandatory for full-time worker."
good,"This was my first job, and for a first job it was a great company to work with and very helpful towards me and my learning of the occupation that I was given (seasonal sales associate)."
good,"The job is ok but there is alot of in job drama, rules are constantly changing, management doesnt seem to ever be on the same page, hours fluctuate , training is bare minimum theres alot of favoritism and the schedules are constantly changing hours are always cut back and all in all unless your on the floor doing sales or are full time your the lowest on the totem pole, worked here for a little while and I left because all in all theres to much drama in this store, bullying, and everyone is in everyones business.  You arent given the hours your promised, and hour cut backs are always taking place constantly, it becomes frustrating"
good,"Staples wasn't too bad. The management was very unorganized as well as every department in the store. Didn't provide much training to it's employees.Other than that though, it was a good place to work. employees were kind."
good,Staples is a great place to work.  The company is very committed to ensuring that employees have the tools to have fun while being productive.
good,Staples Advantage is decent company to work for. Has a good base salary but commissions are very low and bonuses are hard to attain. Immediate management is great but regional management micromanages and does a lot of fear based management.
good,I can say that this place was great to work and give me the opportunity to keep going to college. The worst part of working here is the costumer who apparently like to scream at you a lot when they don't get what they want and the way they wanted.  The best part of this job people get opportunities to grow in the company after a year or some get promotions after few months.
good,I enjoyed interacting with different customers as well as my fellow employees.  The only drawback was differences in management styles depending upon who was scheduled for various shifts.
good,"had a great run... job was eliminated due to restructure."
good,"I liked working her, mainly for the money though. This job is demanding and rightly so. The main issue is that the place is not for everyone. The management was great and friendly, and the other workers there were nice and helpful. If you don't mind loud noises, and stuffy buildings then this job is perfect."
good,Team work environment encourages you to work together in a positive manner and deliver A+ customer experience on every interaction.  Competitive pay and good benefits.
good,The 7 years I was there was pretty good. The main thing that would be frustrating is the turnover rate in management. I had 5 different supervisors and 3 different plant managers
good,I worked at 2 locations One in Kansas City Mo and the other in Vacaville CA. Each store was run differently so my experience was very different at each store. Seeing as every store is different I don't think I can give anybody an idea of what to expect from Their own store. I can say that they have for the most part good customer service and fair prices and they will bend over backwards for their customers.
good,"Worked at Staples for  14 years , Saw a lot of changes in brick and mortar retail. Sadly they closed my store, more people shopping online , and less in store so the staffing was eliminated"
good,"daily work routine is very structured in well organized."
good,"This company will train and prepare you for the position you were hired for. Professional place to work, most upper management are ok. Advancement is slow and does not happen at a high frequency. The only thing that matters is numbers."
good,"Management was fair, but no advancement was available. No health insurance for part time employees.  They were always short staffed.  also, no advancement in the company. y"
good,"The team that I worked with was great but the store was so mismanaged that it's hard to advocate for the company. Granted that every experience is going to different, the one i had was very nonpleasent."
good,"Working here was fine, Though I found myself wrapped in ""In store drama"" A lot which effected my hours as a hard working employee, And stunted the amount i would get on my weekly paychecks. All and all, It wasn't for me."
good,this job is a great place to work management is understanding and they offer many oppurtunities to advance and excel at every turn of the journey
good,This place started out great but slowly plumited into a downward spiral there was opportunity then out of nowhere just massive cut backs and lay offs and people getting cut left and right it was a long term here for me i spent 5 years chasing after a promotion dangled in front of my face only to find oi had been lied to and told one thing and got anther in 5 years my raise was 75 cents
good,"Answering and receiving incoming calls from customers assisting with tracking orders, placing orders, finding replacements for items that are out of stock or no longer available."
good,Seemed like the company was focused mostly on its online presence and it didn't seem that the retail side had much support. I loved the actual work of fixing people computers and helping them out as much as possible but the compensation was really low especially for a supervisor position.
good,The workplace had friendly co-workers who are very helpful when you first start out. the management itself is rather poor there isn't enough communication between management and staff.
good,it was a cool job but not enough hours i love getting paid every week the people there were okay but they didn't really like the job they were doing and it showed .
good,Everyday was a challenge. It pushed you to learn how to have better time-management. Our standards were always extremely high and what the customers thought of their products were most important.
good,I loved the people I worked with including my General Manager and Sales Manger. My District Manager was also amazing. I wasn't getting paid my worth even tho I was doing things way beyond my job description in other parts of the store as well as coming in on my days off and working for free because we couldn't get over time. When Staples got a new CEO and redid DM lines we got a new DM who was just horrible and didn't know how to run our district. Nor where they willing to give me a pay raise after getting the CPC numbers up. I mean way up some of the highest in the district and company.
good,Enjoy working with the various people.  Management good about highlighting strengths of their staff. Campus is nice. Raises are nothing to talk about.
good,As I was only there for a seasonal time or so I thought the job was quite an eye opener. I worked with evening crews as well as overnight and it was challenging.
good,"This job is excellent at creating proficiency in multitasking, time management and customer service. There are flexible hours and the employees are dedicated."
good,"reception of goods, maintain reception area and all related warehouse duties. identify and secure valuable items in lock up. assist client with furniture purchases."
good,A typical day at work included addressing customers needs selling warranties based on the needs of the consumer. Management was okay and the hardest part of the job was working under staffed during back to school sales.
good,"Shipping and Receiving Freight "
good,"In a typical day at my office I interact with other co-workers. Answer customer calls and assist other co workers that are out on the field. I have to set up appointment for four vans in our company. I am also have to da a variety of other duties that include filing, entering reports, making quality assistance phone calls."
good,"As a sales rep, I worked pretty much on my own , very self-motivated. Reported one on one with management once a week to review numbers and progress and review any issues or give help in any way."
good,My stay at staples was amazing! For the first few months. After that friendliness faded and multiple managers began to quit and the new one conflicted with each other constantly causing poor out put with the associates.
good,Its an ok place to work. As a General Manager you are given a ridiculous payroll budget and because of this it always feels like there are not enough people working.
good,A typical retail store specializing in office supplies.  I had a wonderful and supportive management staff.  They were approachable when I had questions and I was able to work independently once I had proven myself.  I liked the creativity I was allowed to use in the copy center.  Many times I was able to assist and/or make suggestions that my customers used in their printing projects.  I learned how to use various different machines that I would not have any other exposure to in any of my previous employers.
good,"An overall productive environment where they try to boost morale by having a fun committee.  Standard management style, sales focused, however, co-workers do get to take a minute of their day to share a moment of laughter.  The most enjoyable part of my job is successfully completing a project I started."
good,Nice workplace. Friendly work environment I got along with a lot of people there. I have also worked there for a good amount of time.
good,"this place is practice if you want to learn how to sell and how to interact with customers, yet the hours are horrible, hours are always cut and pay is very low."
good,"There is always something to do on the floor; helping customers and stocking shelves. Customers always come first and it's always important make sure they get in and get out with what they need. "
good,"work culture is quite good. Great place to work in.  Loved to work here. It's an awesome place.Industry Leader, Balanced Competitive Sales Environment, Awesome office culture!, Freedom in work schedule"
good,For the cashier's job you were to ring out customers and keep the front of the store clean. An issues was that when the store was slow we didn't have many other responsibilities. I learned that it is important to remain productive in your job position
good,"No day is the same, I am learning so much about interacting with people and the day to day challenges of a business."
good,Great job for people in high school or for a starter job. Easy to learn and not demanding. Company promotes from inside so if you do your job well there are a lot of room to move up in the company.
good,"Position Responsibilities:"
good,Great associates and good onsite management. the work is simple but can get overbearing. new changes from the company is making it harder for the workers and causing a lot of displeasure.
good,"Working at staples can be challenging.I can say that I have learned a lot about my current position,and I now have many new skills that I can add to my resume."
good,Learned how to operate several systems. Most enjoyable part of the job is the co-workers that you become close to. Have the opportunity to learn about various positions within the company.
good,"Overall as a job it's not bad at all, but in my experience the staff members were awful to get along with and they were all very judgmental. I'm younger so that might be why as the part-time staff were very nice, but the older employees seemed to have a thing against younger staff members so I would watch out for that if you are under 30."
good,staples was an okay company to work it had its pros and cons of working there management was not so good and had its downfall
good,Manager always switching your job to which you weren't hired or assigned to. Did work with college schedule. Called multiple times to come in when I was not schedules. Management had scheduling issues.
good,"unknown too long ago to access."
good,"I started working at Staples as a temporary employee, got hired on permanent a few moths in due to another employee leaving the company. Overall I loved the work I was doing, my daily tasks consisted of  posting of accounts receivables payments on a daily basis received by lockbox, check, ACH and wire to the appropriate general ledger accounts, reconcile cash and balance accounting system funds against band deposits, pulling reports and export into an excel spreadsheet, utilizing pivot tables, researching customer payments and accounts electronic bank files received and research to find out where the cash will be applied, etc. Our supervisors worked out of a different office so we only spoke with them through instant message, our Manager however was a pushover. The girls that I worked with were very petty and unprofessional. Management knew they were problem employees and still kept them around.  I would recommend this job if you're looking to get your foot in the door in an Accounting role, and they are pretty good about hiring within the company. The pay is not all that great though."
good,Enjoyed working here.  It was a smaller company and was able to give more individual guidance and training to employees.
good,Staples is an okay place to work and the Copy Center is its own little world. The job could be very rewarding when customers want you to flex your imagination and make something interesting for them. The printing and finishing equipment was fun to work with.
good,"I was employed working for Staples Fulfillment Center located in Lithia Springs, GA through an Temporary agency from 09/2015 to 12/2015.To be honest, this place is a ghetto environment. I was a stocker/cutter and although the job was fairly easy, the leads would make it a issue if you stopped for one second to say something to the ppl who were picking. Management was a joke, very friendly with the employees. Too friendly....Their are mainly children who worked there when I was employed, hopefully their gone. I personally wouldn't recommend this job but hey no matter where you work it's really the same issues. As a picker, it's no room from error, you can be terminated very quickly for to many errors. It's hard to get full time hours as well. Who can survive off 20-25 hours weekly at $11.00? BUT if you get in good with management you'll get your hours whether temp or permanent . Only advice I can give someone is, don't get sucked into the drama and focus on the reason you are there. Work and go home.Good luck!"
good,"Very good experience, the personal was gentile and managers as well. I had the opportunity to work in the new site, located in Corby for six weeks, the organization is better and the production is superior  which result  a more relaxed atmosphere."
good,"Typical warehouse job using pick to voice to fill orders in breakpack. They have a replenishment area, shipping area, recieving area, and work three shifts over 24 hours."
good,Great company to work for business to business sales management not strong in mentoring or helping in understanding the business.
good,I was hired as a front end cashier. My responsibilities were to process the customers transactions and provide great customer service. I was also responsible for attaching a warranty plan on each electronic product that went out the door. Management staff was friendly and encouraging. I learned quite a lot about printers just through ringing them up and asking questions about them.
good,I have gained confidence and customer service skills along the way. The majority of staff members are the most lovely people you'll ever meet
good,It was a friendly very competitive place to work it could be good at times and not so good at other times.  It was a family oriented environment.
good,Staples is a great place to work.  Co-workers were great to work with and be around.  Management was a fair as possible to us. Really enjoyed taking care of my customers.
good,"I enjoyed my first experience within this company while I was a casual working through Skilled Australia."
good,This is a great place for teens to work at when graduating from high school. They will learn good customer service skills as well as how to work in the different areas of work.
good,Learned a great deal about computer repairs through the company and other associates. Very goal oriented. Every shift began and ended with a recap of goals for that day and how things could be improved or done differently.
good,"Very relaxed environment, but often times boring. Staff was always willing to help in any way, and management was very laid back."
good,"Customers talk to you like you don't know anything, no chances for advancement, very little job security, sometimes management was very poor depending on location. Only good thing I have to say about the place is I enjoyed working with the other associates."
good,it would have been better to work at Staples if they give incentives to their employees. work environment doesn't have a proper ventilation.
good,The only difference in the other review is that in this one I wasn't a manager.  So I helped customers I just didn't have keys or manager abilities.
good,In my tenure I have held a variety of roles and have had the opportunity to work with a number of talented people as well as travel the world.
good,The office has a lot of good people who genuinely care about you as a person and make the effort to get to know you.  It's a fun and active job with new challenges everyday.
good,"Some days are hectic, but some are smooth and easy going. My co-workers are nice and enjoyable. You have to be able to multi-task when working in the copy and print center. Christmas time is the busiest time of the year for our department."
good,It was a mediocre job. I learned that I am not a people person. My co-workers got me through each day. I was a cashier there was nothing hard about it. My break was the most enjoyable part of the day.
good,"Staples was a very challenging job everyday because you never new what was going to happen.  I learned that being at a fast paced busy retail store that it was very hard to work together and learn many things.  The management team that I worked for was not a very organized team, so therefore communication was very poor."
good,A typical day here was slow and I spent most of my time organizing back stock to kill time. I liked most of my coworkers and made some gold friends who i still talk to today. The store was poorly managed and most of the managers that I worked with have since been replaced. Overall it was just a college job to pay the bills.
good,There were a lot of change in management during my tenure. The uneven balance cause thee work environment to be a bit difficult at time. overall the company was good to work at and understanding with scheduling.
good,"I would open up the shop with a few others, man the till for an hour or 2, go restock the shelves with the weeks delivery, make sure each customer is being approached and then close the store with a few people, depending what shift I was to do."
good,"A typical day at work included tracking and monitoring employees attendance, ensuring that goals and metrics were met, strategized collection efforts, and responsible for motivating the team, ensuring accountability, and recognition. Working in a collaborative environment was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,Can be very busy job with many tasks. Managers are not the best but it is fun working with some of the employees. Good first job as a high school student.
good,"I really enjoyed interacting with the employees and customers.  I learned a lot about the culture of Retail.  I learned how to use the system Staples used for their cashiering and what it takes to run a store.  I was disappointed, however, with the fact that there was not as much structure as there needed to be within the store and the morale was extremely low.  The Corporation itself will not allow very many hours so the people who are there are worked to the maximum and there is still a gap in the ability to get the product to the floor and keep it as it should be.  I discussed this with my General Manager and unfortunately he cannot change much because of the policies in scheduling and hours used.  I really liked my GM.  He was a very nice person."
good,"Employees were very friendly"
good,not enough training for new hires. left alone too early needed more guidance got hired for no reason. it was a busy place during the season
good,"its an ok  company to work for they pay well, you just have to really work every second of your shift to keep the job. its a lot of work and short breaks but overall its a job. just come to work ready to work."
good,"I've managed to work in, move up, and succeed in every department in this company. The customer service experience is invaluable and I feel each person should understand what it really takes. Unfortunately the company is retail and very, if not entirely, focused on the profit. There is not much consideration for employee relations. In fact I had 2 job positions of mine eliminated without not even the same 2 week notice curtsy they ask from me. Luckily, I was able to find available positions to migrate too."
good,"worked as a customer service representative, able to make orders for delivery for customers for furniture, great staff throughout my time there"
good,"I only worked here for a few months for a woman that was on maternity leave.  The company was a good company to work for."
good,The work-life balance is restricted. It is also not an environment where I feel I can be used to my full potential and learn as much as I am willing to learn.
good,Six Flags MAgic Mountain is a great first job letting you step into the working enviornemt and treaching you the basics and how to handle a working enviornment with professionalism. Meeting plenty of people throughout the job and most employees are great.
good,"Management needs to be seen more on the floor, the operational floor, as a resource for the employee to utilized.  Schedules were randomly created, without any thought of employee concerns"
good,"Engaged clientele with a friendly and professional demeanor and resolved concerns in a diplomatic and tactful manner. Followed all correct cash register operations, as well as maintaining integrity while entering services into the cash register."
good,Wasn't the greatest place to work. I worked there for three years in various different roles. High employee turnover. Wasn't the best place to work.
good,"You can obtain a lot of knowledge if you are into printing and writing. I was able to create some business cards and posters for my Recording Engineer company I am hoping to pursue as a career.  Other than that, it was one of the most slowest jobs I ever had."
good,"The co-workers are nice and so are the managers. I  learned everything I know about cash through staples. The hardest part about working at staples includes the short hours, the times when nothing is happening, and the distance. Overall, staples is an alright first job but only as a first job."
good,"This particular Staples has a hard-working, dedicated staff working for them, management and associates. Only real problem is not having enough employees to staff key work areas. On various occasions the Tech Department will find itself in Furniture. Not a big problem unless they have customers going to the tech area at random times. If we had less turnover, we would be able to get the job done more efficiently. We would also be able to give a fair schedule, so that people could spend more efficient time with family."
good,Management and communication was really difficult. Overall a great place to work as I am sure different staples will have different management techniques
good,It a great place to create relationships with customers and other associates management can be a little overwhelming and plain unfair at times. They will sometimes be so short staffed that you will be asked to forego your breaks or get sarcastic responses when asking to go on break. The most enjoyable part is the fact well at least for the store I worked at the majority of the associates are young and full of energy but can easily be brought down due to egotistical and demeaning management. The hardest part about the job is actually trying to do what corporate wants from you but will not provide the support to need to be successful.
good,Busy lots of fun because I had great co-workers that always makes work good. great deals awesome place for teachers and business owners.
good,"Fun professional work place with a laid back environment. The store place is always busy with visitors and guests, so there is always something to do to keep you busy."
good,Offered nice sale incentives. Easy Hiring process. It was nice meeting so many unique people given its NYC tourist location.
good,I've learned about printers and managing a department of 2 co-workers. Look on my resume for more info regarding this job
good,Staples is a good company to work for and provides benefits to fit people at all stages of their career. Recent additions include a fitness center.
good,fun work place with supportive management not all about the numbers but how yo personally grow and develop decent co workers and decent management
good,Staples is a great company however they do not promote growth in the company or my department. I fill my skills are not being utilized to there full potential.
good,"Great team, busy some days. I've learned alot from staples, i have many skills from the company and am very thankful."
good,"Staples is worlds largest office supplies. Deals from printes to toners cartridges, house keeping items, technology products."
good,"Flexible hours, learning about technology products is fun and working on computers is a skill that can be used in other jobs. "
good,It was a job to get me through medical school and I did like what I was doing at that time  inventory was a hard job liked most of my co workers I was cashier the last few years I was there
good,I enjoyed working at the store I was located at. It was a lot of fun and high spirited. I made a lot of friends there and my best friend there as well. exciting and awesome people.
good,"Helped over 50 customers per day with little or no knowledge of computers and software, work closely with management to make sure the establishment is clean and organized. Checking if fellow co-workers are getting their jobs and task done for the day while opening and closing the store. Best part of the job when you don't have any customer complaints and everyone is happy and is enjoyable to work in a friendly environment."
good,"Good Place Hectic at times, employees get along well with each other."
good,"Staples offers flexible schedules and there starting pay isnt too bad. Its usually above minimum wage. I loved working in Copy & Print. It was a fun, fast paced job and I got to meet a lot of new people"
good,"great flexible work schedules"
good,"If you want to learn about sales, this is a good place to learn, but if you become good at it, getting a promotion will take a very long time."
good,"When I was there I was surrounded with great management and as I went thru my time with them, the great managers left and the not so great ones took their spots. It was not a competitive company so much as a combative one. I made many friends while I was there and now, 10years later they are all gone and Staples is just Staples."
good,The management team were attentive and the job was not difficult. The pay was minimal and there wasn't much room for advancement. It's a stepping stone job.
good,"A typical workday consists mainly with printing papers, creating banners, or even finishing up projects that is carried over into your day. While on the job I learned how to operate Microsoft word, Excel, Powerpoint, etc. I also picked up a skill in which I am able to repair the printers, lamination machine, change banner papers, how to create business cards, and customize many different things. The management was very well and done professionals in a polite manner. Working with my co-workers was very simple, they were helpful and outgoing so it made the department in which we worked productive and enjoyable. The hardest part of the job is when a lot of customers are asking you to do projects for them and you are the only one on shift. Managers weren't able to help with the hard task because they weren't taught the Copy and Print department. Overall my experience was a learning one and I enjoyed the job in terms of he people I worked with."
good,"The copy and print center is a very productive and fun place to work while gaining valuable Knowledge, skills, and customer service experience"
good,"I enjoy working at Staples Promotional Products.  I like my co-workers a lot; I really love my work family.  The most enjoyable part of my job is to take care of a customer when perhaps something looked impossible.  The hardest part of my job is the daily stress in this highly event driven industry.  I was part of middle management for quite sometime.  I enjoyed working with middle management.  At times, working well at a certain level did not flow up, but would flow down to our teams.  That was nice to see.  I generally enjoy my job as well.  I wanted to look though and see if perhaps my skills can be utilized better at another company.  Thank you for your time."
good,"had a wonderful time working here, every day had something different to do, got along well with management and co-workers."
good,"Working for staples was an experience and did help me learn how to do things at first, but as time went on management got worse and now is not a good place to work"
good,"A good place to work management WAS good until they all started to leave. routing is really badly done in a different state. "
good,"it is great place to start as a beginner in the retail industry, it can be frustrating but it teaches you how to deal with customers and how to better assist them"
good,Good company to work for since they are small.  SVP's actually remember your name and RVP's too.  Can be challenging for smaller stores due to payroll constraints.
good,Friendly staff and pretty nice managers. My only complaint is they cut all part timers to 20 hours a week which causes myself and others to find second and third jobs.
good,"Staples is a wonderful company to work for, the environment is great and the people are like family. There are many opportunities to move up and make more of your career."
good,"Just make sure that you are in good terms with management and you'll be fine. Hard work does not apply to this company. The harder you work, the more work you'll get. Other than all that, it's not a hard place to work at all."
good,Worked for Staples a month before they went public.  Great place to work then. Solid management team.   I have no comment of them today.
good,Staples is good to work for. They work with everyone's schedule and my general manager cares about each of his employees and helps us meet our goals in the work place.
good,Great Environment to learn great customer as well as team building. And having great opportunities in the management positions
good,"Working at staples was a fun and productive place to work for several reasons. A typical day at work was just like any other workplace. I would get to work, clock in, put on my name tag, check with the managers with what was going on at work and if they needed my help with anything, then get to work. It was a small store so there weren't that many employees or managers there. However, the few that were there were very kind and helpful and made great team members, as well as the managers. It was troublesome because there were numerous occasions when I was missing hours on my paycheck, or wasn't able to receive my paycheck in a timely manner. However, to my understanding the managers were always busy."
good,I would recommend this to a college student who is looking for something to help pay some bills and get through school.  Good people and friendly environment.
good,"I was on the ""Tech Repair"" portion of the team at Staples. Became a Head of department in less than 6 months. Cool people working with me but the management did not care to take in my suggestions when it came to hiring more people to help me out. I was the only employee that would work by himself for more than 7 hours a day. Being in the heart of Las Vegas im sure you can see why I wasn't the biggest fan of running a higher volume store's tech department and sales floor, by myself..."
good,it is a nice place to work sometimes we will be busy and then we wont i have to do a lot of stuff like take care of the ink and telling people were things are
good,"this job has a decent standing in terms of oppurtunity, you can use this job to work you way up as a decent part time paying constant good money that you can rely on if you make it full time or become a corporate member later on"
good,"Sold Electronic merchandise, sometimes helped on the office side of the store if things got slow. Fixed, troubleshooted and repaired computers. My immediate supervisor was very helpful and helped anytime I needed assistance. Advancement opportunities however were rare and it was almost impossible to advance in any way as a remote district manager who was not a immediate part of the store would select people based on numbers and data on a PC screen. Hardest part of the job was when we had to lift gigantic boxed product up a ladder onto high shelves, which always exceeded the listed 50lbs carry weight that you signed up for but it did build you up. Customer interactions was probably the most enjoyable part of working at Staples."
good,"I like doing a local route with the responsibility I have to complete the day's work in a timely manner. I like the people I work with, and the terminal supervisor does a good job."
good,"Staples is a great company for college kids. The company offers good benefits and allows growth."
good,"It adequately suffices what is needed of such a job.  It offered a chance to grow, work as a team and network through the copy center where I work."
good,Management was very poor and flexibility was very minimal. I had the same routine each day and scheduling was the exact same. Trying to get time off was very difficult and working there became more and more difficult as the time went on.
good,"•	Supervised, led, managed, and directed a team of 6 personnel that consistently achieved and surpassed assigned organizational goals"
good,"•	Ajouter des nouveaux capteurs (sondes de températures et de pression)."

Monitored competitive activity and identify threats that pre-empt distributors loses. Utilize analytic tools daily to compliment SKU rationalization analysis with assortment and recommendations."
good,"staples is a great company to start working if you have not had any other jobs before. because they are flexible and they can hire you without any experience. however, they will never promote you unless you are willing to accept no real raise and triple responsibility."
good,"I loved working for staples, the people there were great!  "
good,Still need a lot of work with their systems and process which don;t allow for much when it comes to holding people accountable as the systems need drastic changes.
good,"As a cashier it was a difficult work environment, I did not feel as though management had our back nor the company as a whole. Customers were also often rude and ignorant. Company policies were also not the best and often made our jobs more difficult than need be."
good,"There were issues as far as the management, and also the hours of availability at staples. It took for me to put in my notice to leave for them to offer me a higher position or a raise"
good,"i started staples as a certified pc tech. when i started the GM was a general dirtbag. after about six months i was ready to quit the store was a mess the gm (when he showed up) spent his days sleeping in the office or telling me i was doing my job wrong. right when i was about to quit corporate finally fired him and brought in the new manager Tad he is genuinly one of the best peopl ei have ever worked for he is very supportive and definately knows how to run a store. he saw my potential and promoted me to Team supervisor with a raise and everything was fantastic.unfortunately a few months later corprate removed my position from the team structure so i i had to take a demotion and a pay cut. overall i have had a good experience, but loosing my role in the company was very disheartening."
good,"Genghis Grill is a cool experience, Its not your regular everyday restaurant, the customers get to put the food together that they want and then we cook it for them."
good,"Regular retail stuff. I can say I liked it better than Sears, but just like Sears more and more Staples are closing so hours and pay will reflect as well"
good,"Great job till downturn in economy and consolidation of companies in this business. Now trying to survive by cutting costs, people, and compensation"
good,"Day full of work starting from sending Birthday and anniversary mailers, recruitment, reports, etc. My major learning of the HR functions was from Staples which gave me a strong base. The co-workers were helpful and supportive. Management was decent and had a good support from the VP HR. The job was very informative about the Retail industry and the hardest part of the job was coping with the number of tasks at the same time whenever my collegues were on a holiday or left the organization, as I was new to the corporate world. This company has given me the right qualities to work as an HR professional. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new candidates, doing the training sessions and organizing Fun @ Work on fridays, by organizing events for employees."
good,"This company promoted from within the orghanization, they expanded West and gave opportunities for advancement."
good,"Worked inventory, and checked to make sure that all the merchandise was on the floor. Truck days were very busy and a lot of work."
good,"Get treated with Respect and have job satisfaction, with a great work . The Warehouse Manager is really caring but firm. With a great work ethic."
good,"I enjoy to work in retail, my boss was great, very caring for his employs but the hourly pay is very poor, it is really a shame, so sad."
good,"The Staples store located in Buford, Georgia is a strange one. It is often the guinea pig for the company's trials and experiments, while also being a high-volume store that generates a lot of revenue. Because it is technically retail, a lot of younger people are hired throughout the year as they need temporary jobs while in high school, college, or in-between jobs. There are some long-term employees (reading 10-15 years!), but most of the associates are younger than 30."
good,"At Staples, I worked as a sales associate who worked the register, stocked shelves, cleaned, managed carts and dealt with damaged products.  I learned how to work with customers and manage the register."
good,Sales would not be consistent enough for us week to week.  We live in a state where the cost of living is outrageous and most people live paycheck to paycheck so trying to get them to purchase a warranty or attachments on all items was a tough thing to accomplish
good,"Repair computer left by customers"
good,"I was constantly on my feet, always busy. management was okay and so where the ever changing co-workers. i Enjoyed helping customers but didnt like the schedule"
good,"Each day starts with a driver meeting, then we inspect our trucks and     then we go out and make our deliveries.                                                   I learned how to use product scanners along with many safety procedures.                                                                                               Management was fair, co-workers were nice"
good,"Unload trucks, sort freight, load delivery trucks and go home. This is the job for 5 days out of the week with decent pay. Co workers are cool but management can be really petty"
good,"Title says it all, Avg PT pay, flexible hours, but micro management makes getting sales a chore instead of a fun challenge."
good,Wonderful people to work with! A great place to learn and gain valuable experience. There is a lot of effort to improve company culture.
good,"Compensation isa ok, should be better. Job security is ok. Advancement is possible with time in. but the compensation from within is a joke. advancement within You are better off coming in at a higher position if you want competitive pay."
good,I enjoyed everyone i worked with.  It was very laid-back environment.  I would definitely choose to work for this company again.
good,"Great place to manage a wireless store front. This is a third party wireless business located inside of Staples and Costco. Worked under a district manager. Usually alone in the department, so obtain skills in marketing and reaching the highest sales basket."
good,Was a good place to work while being a college student. Very flexible with hours and understanding of scheduling around classes.
good,"The worst part of the job was how physically demanding it was, but the management and the other employees were wonderful to work with."
good,Great associates.  Enjoyed working with people from different departments. Loved the hours.  Fast paced environment.
good,"Job was very simple, only felt as if i couldn't excel or simply wasn't up to par with what I imagine myself doing. Although is was a overall nice environment to work in."
good,Typical delivery driving job.  Learn how to deal (on a positive note) with customers.  Manage your route within a way to use less fuel and mileage. Co-workers are always team players.
good,"Overall a good experience. I was able to transfer to other locations  easily, some for promotions and once when I moved. The pay could be better and management in the last few years hasn't been as good.  The job itself isn't all that hard, so long as you can handle customers (even the rude ones). "
good,"Staples has taught me a lot on maturing into a great supervisor, however their goals they set for the store employees to meet do not match the effort they put in to the company. (i.e.) They wanted mobile phones to be a big part in growth f the business, however did no type of marketing or advertising. And payroll for part timers are getting worse and worse by the month. It's obvious that this company will not be around for too much longer if they continue on the same path."
good,"• Art direction,brand development and management for two company brands"
good,"Hours are consistent."
good,Good Company. Many stores for growth and able to move around the country. Can move quickly up the ladder to management. Need to have more stores in the southeast.
good,"Really fun work environment in the transportation side of the buisness.  Very challenging managing the day to day operation, but very satisfactory delivering results."
good,"Staples is a well-run company. Work hours are relatively strict, and everyone working at a given time is expected to share equally in all aspects of store upkeep, such as cleaning, pricing, and check-out services. I learned valuable customer service skills, including how to effectively work with a customer to solve a problem with a product."
good,"•	Held a position in the staff office"
good,"1. Many angry costumers , gets busy second hours of the day. "
good,"the work day depending on you part or full time position was decent, i did learn how to manage to an extent i had a good set of cowokers the management team could of been better."
good,This position was a great experience for my first full time experience.  The staff was courteous and helpful when questions arose.  It was a very positive first step in my future working career.  I hope that my future work experiences to have this kind of positivity and great results.
good,"Please see other review"
good,"Work on warehousing and distribution solutions to meet customer needs."
good,"Days always varied in what was required to be done.  Whether it be joint calls with reps selling other lines of business, doing product training, developing standardization programs for clients, site measuring and consulting, prepare notes to submit for drawings and prepare proposals, managed literature library, and worked closely with reps to help uncover opportunities. Had to be very versatile as I was the sole furniture person in this region.  I learned to cover alot territory, success comes from timely responses and that having a mentor for a sales manager made the hard work bearable."
good,not enough pay for the amount of work required. poor management not room for advancement in company.
good,"worked alone without help, sometimes too many customers to assist at once"
good,"It is okay. That was my first job. I got better pay than other electronic retailers. They gave me decent hours. Co-workers are fun but it's a big pressure for me because that was my first job. Overall, it is okay. The job was temporary though."
good,"A day at work, check the variable receive date, line count and carton counts. Account for associate’s time off scheduled or otherwise, plan coverage to get product processed and delivered. Management could be more organized and communicate better both with peers and associates. The biggest daily struggles are the unknowns: being production numbers, finish times (one day you may work 6 hours the next you may work 10) no scheduled finish time overtime is mandatory when needed. To keep you coming back: team members are fun to work with and willing to help out when and where needed."
good,"Staples is a good company to work for if you are a high school or college student. A typical day of work for me consists of major multi-tasking skills and organization pushed to the max. I can do the job I  was hired to do, be a back- up cashier, and work on freight in a single day if needed be. I work very hard and there is never down time for me. I have learned that you can make even the angriest customers into one of your regulars in a matter of minutes. Having phenomenal customer service skills and being knowledgeable about products is key to have. Management needs work. Sadly, but true. I wish they would better schedule for days we have no overlapping coverage. Co-workers are great to get along with. No issues there. The hardest part of my job is wishing I had more time in our work shifts in order to get things taken care of.I enjoy the most about my job is that I am constantly busy. I am never just sitting there wondering what I should do next. I love to stay busy and make sure everyone is taken care of properly and is a satisfied customer when they walk out my doors."
good,I like working for staples i learned a lot about printers and copy machines and ink.
good,"	Fully supported a technical suite of services for all IT related products sold at the store covering everything from computers and mobile devices to printers and all accessories imaginable."
good,"Was in charge of handling the front end of the store. "
good,The total experience is what you make of it. There is not great cultural leadership nor exceptional management. There is some lack of commitment by associates but that is do to the inability of upper management to do what is necessary.There is lots of talk but no follow through on anything and the hourly associates run the management not the other way around.
good,Most of my co workers were fun to be around but sometimes uptight. the negative flow sort of ruins the work site and makes it bad to be in
good,"- I would go in to work, count my register and made sure my area was clean before I opened up my lane."
good,"Staples was a place where I was always learning to improve. Working in the copy center you learn to multi task like never before, always meeting deadlines and starting new ones, nothing was ever seen as hard, as long as you learned however meeting budgets was one of the crucial and hard parts. my co workers were great, some were a bit tedious and quit really fast. the most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know how strong of a worker I was."
good,"First job in the Christmas season, it was an amazing exprience and a great start work."
good,"You have to have the right GM to succeed here"
good,"A typical day at staples would be to show up at 8:00 am. Get the register manned. Break into freight and restock. You have an excellent oppurtunity to practice and hone your sales skills. It is boring work, but if your in high.school its a good first job. The co workers were easy going. We came to tears from laughing so hard occassionally. The hardest part of the job is low pay or dealing with monotony. roll out!"
good,"eu sempre respondia os clientes por e-mail no Outlook, abria e finalizava processo de devolução ou traca por qualidade, aprende a organizar planilha, minha supervisora era sempre muita atenta, sempre nos dava atenção ensina o trabalho."
good,"Was my life for 6 years, I worked and gave my life to this company.  They expected as much from all management.  I enjoyed my freedom to help the customer in many ways.  The biggest con was the company's lack of willingness to work with you when you need them to."
good,This position does not have any influence on my future positions.
good,This is your basic retail position w/some additional Customer Service tasks included.
good,Working at Staples was a great experience. It was long hours. The training was very poor.
good,I was always busy doing something as far as stocking shelves or helping customers with any questions they had.
good,Good Job to get experience in a typical retail environment. Meet new people and get a grasp on the retail industry.
good,staples is the place for you if you enjoy to sell and work wtith the public.
good,Learned lots of selling skills. selling has been the most enjoyable part of job
good,"I worked at Staples from 2002 to 2014.  I was recruited as an Inside Sales Supervisor and then promoted to Inside Sales Manager, Inside Sales Manager - Vendor Relations and then to Manager, ecommerce Sales & Support."
good,"I worked as an EasyTech and it was good. I did like the advancement in my position ,but I was expected to stock the store as well,sell, and fix computers. I did not like the overhaul of daily activities, however I really enjoyed working on the computers."
good,Good place to work it has its days though. Customers at times can be a hand full. The people that work there are pretty nice. Hardest part of the job can be trying to deal with difficult customers.
good,Pay is not very good if you are a computer technician. It is however good work experience since you deal with customers that have real life issues with their computer.
good,Worked daily with helping customers meet their personal/business needs. I have learned that the key to good managment is to engage our staff and support input for business improvements.
good,Some days are productive and some days its a drag. I have learned to have some patient. Most enjoyable part is when management buys lunch or snacks for the employees.
good,"A typical work day in my position would appear as follows:"
good,if your trying to provide for a family then this is not a job for you but if your a single person in school then this a great job to have and work at. my job there was to clean the entire store.
good,Working at Staples has given me experience working with customers and problem solving issues that may arise. I enjoy designing custom prints for customers business needs
good,"Staples has been a great company for years, up until recently when they started struggling.   Of a staff that was mostly employees that had been there 10 or more years, in a matter of months only a few remain.  Most of the highest paid and highest tenured staff was let go and replaced with employees that have no knowledge of how to run a successful store.  They have become so aggressive with pushing ""numbers"", that the integrity of the business is diminishing.  These new people will lie to customers and push policies that don't exist (such as refusing returns on ink when there is a defect) and losing business of customers that have been shopping at our store for nearly 20 years.  And this review isn't coming from a bitter employee that has been there for years.  I have only been there for 7 months, but I have seen the changes actively happen in that short period of time and it's all too familiar. When the company starts to lose money they get desperate and  start hiring ""sales-minded"" people who try to sell you a warranty like a car salesman would try to get you to buy a Mercedes.   And I won't even get started with the corrupt new managers editing time stamps and taking hours off of employee's paychecks. This will be the 3rd company I've worked for that has laid off its staff because the store shuts down and it's a shame because Staples was once a great company to work for with job security and amazing benefits even for part-timers."
good,"I would say it was not a very good place to work. You had to do  everything there, sometimes phone would be ringing and at the same time you had to checkout customers and managers don't want the phones to ringing for long time. Pay rate is not according to the work you have put there. and of course Layoffs during slow months. hardest part of job was to do everything at one time."
good,"This job was a lot to handle while going to school fulltime, I would go to classes all day and go to work from 4 to almost midnight sometimes and then have to get up for my morning classes.  it was a lot to handle but I needed the money and three of my roommates working there made it more enjoyable"
good,Staples is a great place to learn interpersonal and customer service skills. It is a very fast paced environment and teaches one to multitask efficiently.
good,"Provided great customer service, ensuring all customer needs were met on time.  Used creative solutions to resolve issues with customer's technology.    Most difficult part of the job was the amount of tasks distributed.  You were expected to be the inventory team, the computer technician, sales associate for practically all departments, and a cashier.  The duties were numerous and the store was severely understaffed.  You were always pulled away from the task at hand. The most enjoyable aspect of this job was the process of solving sometimes complicated computer problems.  It would have been a great learning experience for beginners in information technology."
good,Great experience working at Staples just under lazy management.
good,12 hr shifts and overtime always welcome and benefits are fair.
good,This company (formerly American Identity) was purchased by Staples Corporation several years ago and has yet to smooth out the transition. Management is ALL OVER the place.
good,"Lack of communication, lack of training. Fantastic customers."
good,learned about computers and electronics co-workers were great
good,"a good part time job. they work with school hours."
good,"A typical day at work is fun, entertaining and efficient. I learned valuable skills such as ordering stock and talking to buyers. My management is fun and great to work with not always ideal but can go to them with any issues and a solution is always found. My co-workers are always willing to lend a hand when needed. The hardest part of my job is making sure the customer is happy because I am not always able to get them the product that they need. The most enjoyable part of my job is leaving everyday knowing that I helped the customer to the best of my ability."
good,"A stressful environment due to the fact that i was new and didn't take their time to show me what to do. When attempting to sell insurance they would pressure me to sell it to them as much as possible.  They didn't tell me that my position was seasonal for the back to school season, until i spent money on a metro card to get to work that early morning. They could've told me over the phone or a least let me work that day."
good,"I sold PCs, printers, tablets, and other electronic devices.  "
good,"I work in the Copy and Print Center at Staples. On an average day I help customers print and assembly presentation, flyers, brochures, etc. I also help them create business cards, post cards, banners, posters, etc. Some customer come and already have what they would like printed/created designed, but some customers are not sure on the design they would like and ask for our help/opinions. I also help out occasionally in the cash room counting the bags/registers from the day along with the safe to make sure that they match up with the computer."
good,"The hours were flexible with my school hours."
good,"The management team of this company is very lethargic in my opinion. Regardless of how heavy the workload is or how far we're running behind, the management team rarely helps the employees get the job done. This, in result, is very stressful for the warehouse associates."
good,"•Recruit and train employees"
good,"They seem to want to keep most people at part time hours, and the pay below management is minimum wage or as close as makes no difference."
good,"good job benefits, not enough hours. really easy job and fellow employees were nice."
good,co workers and supervisors were always there when you needed help
good,A typical day is me attending appointments & calling potential leads and cold calling that I have created and that's everyday bar Tuesday as that's the day I spend creating appointments.
good,"Like any retail job (I would assume), there were busy days and there were slow days. On slow days, I would be able to spend my time helping customers in the aisles or restocking the shelves in between turns at the register. On busy days, I would only really be able to help out at the registers. "
good,"For a young student, this was not a bad place to work and start out learning what it meant to hold a job and be an adult."
good,"a typical day at work, really normal. we always learn new stuff everyday or every now and then. really good management for sure. the co-workers are really friendly and really easy to get along with they will help you always whenever you need something or help they are always there to help if your new to the place.and there's really nothing hard on the job just maintain you speed and you'll be good.!! working with people that could really help you whenever you need them and being supportive at all times!! staples is a really great place to work at they are really really supportive and always find a great way to help you and work with you whenever you need it."
good,"Great management team, excellent job for high school or college student."
good,It was normal work environment with customers and making sells. I learned how to deal with all sorts of people and even co-workers. The hardest part of the job was standing on your feet all day and the most enjoyable was making things easier for the customer and seeing how much they enjoyed my help.
good,I have fun days with my team. We like to have fun and joke around but we always make sure our work has been completed first.We are a good team and always help out our peers.
good,On a typical day we move freight and help customers around the store. Ive learned how to lead and manage a team by carefully watching my manager.
good,I thought there was room for growth. About 6 months after being employed they announced they would be eliminating my position.
good,"A typical day at work was when I had to get everything done by the end  of the day with a lot of pressure on my back. "
good,"Worked here for the last two years of high school all the way up through graduating from college. The flexibility was nice but it seemed like they were constantly changing procedures and switching management, as well as changing postal providers."
good,Everyone is very pleasant. Some of the co-workers do not have the best work skills. So there is always shortage of staff. And you have to work long hours.
good,"Good staff and management"

good,"-There was a lot of on your feet work, checking stock in the aisles. There was also a lot of heavy lifting and helping the warehouse move stock."
good,"At staples there always something to do greeting, helping customer to find what excatly they are looking for. I learn how to have patience because not every customer I came across wasn't so friendly. My co-workers will have there days where one day there friendly nd one day they mad at the world. Theres really no difficult part of the job. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I can see a customer needs is fulfilled."
good,Transferred to a department where I had to learn how to operate multiple powered industrial trucks and was charge with errors on each individual piece during what should have been a learning period.

good,"A typical day at Staples is busy. There is a constant demand for your attention. I have gained experience that further my quest for knowledge in computer science. The people I work with all have the same goals as me, therefore, my knowledge is expanded further. The hardest part of my job is that fact that I am no longer being challenged and want more. I enjoy learning new things."
good,"Everyday i would load trucks with product which is mostly boxes that come down the converter belt. I have learned to stack a lot better. Management is great, they are nice, they teach you stuff you dont know and let you come in early sometimes if they need you. My co-workers help me out on stuff i dont know i get along with everyone there. The hardest part of the job is getting more hours at the moment. The most enjoyable part of the job for me is just working fast to keep me busy."
good,"I enjoy the daily workflow as a CP Supervisor. I have to be very sharp as a Copy & Print Certified Pro. I also have to continuously stay on top of Equipment Maintenance, and operations. I am very busy at all times meeting customer request and deadlines. Its very exciting to be able to apply my Broadcast Engineering experience to my Copy & Print experience.

good,busy shop where I helped serve customers and deal with there enquiries. Staff were freindly and i learned a lot about customer service.
good,"Typical Day: Discussing with Clients their promotional options via on online eStore platform or Spot Buys or negotiating contracts to extend contract terms. Making it easy for the customer and finding a great solution for all parties. "
good,slow if its not back to school time then you don't get to many hours .
good,"I worked both East Coast and West Coast for this company. It seems that the closer to the Home Office you were, the more things were tightly set up and done according to Operations. I started from Office Supplies and moved up to the Tech Lead in training to become a GM. When I moved to Southern Cali, the district was a complete mess. I scoped out several stores before choosing one and it just seemed people were miserable and mismanaged. The company has gone through a lot of changes in recent years, but I would recommend it to people who wanted to get some experience on their resume, not a long term position."
good,"Good work place, learned a lot. Enjoyed working place, managers need to care more about employees."
good,Staples has a great co-worker environment. The management is friendly and accommodating to your schedule. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the constantly changing schedule and unloading and packing out truck every Friday. The most enjoyable part of the job was making connections with customers and co-workers and being able to assemble various displays and endcaps.
good,"liked working in a team setting, enjoyed working with new faces and making them have a smile and also helping others, good at helping people get along with others very well"
good,"I am currently employed at Staples.  A typical day at Staples varies.  It can either be very slow as far as taking customers' Copy-Center orders(i.e. making copies, binding books, making laminates, etc) and finishing those orders same day or taking about 10 customers' orders at a time and having the turn-around time be for tomorrow. It's a whirlwind, however it is experience. It teaches me how to multitask, how to be patient with customers,  how to be meticulous, and how to be caring for others.  My management will let some things slide ONCE in a while because he sees us as human beings primarily but he is by the books and gets things done when they need to be done.  My coworkers' and I took a while to work together and get a feel for each other because when working for Copy-Cent in Staples, you have to be really close with your co-workers. It took some time but now we are starting to mesh together, for a lack of a better word.  The hardest part of the job, honestly is when I cannot understand something, and I need to ask someone else.  It is more frustrating.  Although it is more teamwork,  I like knowing that I know how to work machines and how to execute the ""Signature Experience"".  The most enjoyable part of the job is when customers compliment me on the help that I have given them and walk up to my manager and tell them that I have done a great job."
good,"If you are looking for a company set in its way, this is it.  For many of us that may not be the ideal scenario as this environment suffocates creativity.  My office was far away from the HQ in MA and our building only housed about 200 employees, but you always felt big brother watching over you.  There was certainly a lot of pressure on managements to meet their annual numbers and they simply passed that pressure on to us.  Unfortunately, management was incapable of providing a sensible plan to meet the expected metrics as they themselves were not equipped with the tools to be good sales coaches.  "
good,"First thing, always make sure the customers are helped."
good,As one of the busier stores in the region I was kept quite busy with customer and inventory related tasks. The management team as well as my fellow associates made my time there much more enjoyable.
good,"Count inventory every shift help unload packages that contain chairs, printers, computers, and so on."
good,"j aimais mon travail"
good,"Enjoyed the early aquisition days. Therein ,there was lot of integration work."
good,"As im sure with any workplace, it can be very hectic and stressfull. But other times It can be very rewarding. I wouldn't say there is much opportunity for progressing. But the people are friendly and fun to work with. It is a good atmosphere."
good,"Copy Centre Supervisor"
good,"A typical day consists of serving customers, proccessing transactions, dealing with customer queries  and concerns, opening and closing the store. I have learned key customer service techniques to ensure I give the best possible service."
good,Great Did audits for IRS. I love mortgage and data entry.Also worked in mailroom and was lead. i trained new employees
good,"Definitely great for students or those looking for small time work, no room for advancement though. Upper management is a joke."
good,Company is not growing and not reinvesting in the operating unit that I was in.
good,"Not the worst place to start a career as a technician, but be prepared to do a lot more than just work on computers"
good,"Staples cares about Staples the Stock, not Staples the people."
good,Enjoyable work place. I've learned time management and production.
good,"Staples is a good friendly place and first sale associate job offer to help learn and understand customer service area. "
good,Not much benefits and compensation. Managers always harping on upselling and trying to get customers to squeeze more money out..
good,Corporate Express was purchased by Staples.  Lots of layoffs occurred.
good,"focus is customers satisfaction"
good,"Whether I was on the sales floor or behind the register, everybody has questions about their computer, and I was happy to be able to help them. I helped in all departments, and made great sales for each, though my best sales came from computer/printer sales. I got training with them that I didn't get from other places, so I was finally able to learn about and effectively sell digital cameras. Management was great, and I had a great team to work with."
good,"It was a fun and safe environment. A day at work ranged from opening the front doors in the morning. Counting out the cash drawers. Making sure the store was clean and stocked before we open. Once the store was open I was in charge of many things. Customer service, computer tech services, sales in technology with knowledge of the rest of the store if needed. Cashier abilities with with key-holder responsibilities to ensure safe deposits and withdraws. I learned many management skills that allowed me to play a major part in my co-workers advancements. Working along side my co-workers formed a bond, and trust followed. This in turn led to a cohesive team that consistently met, or beat our daily goals in sales and profit. The hardest part of the job was dealing with upset customers. The most enjoyable part of my day would have to be dealing with that upset customer and finding a way to make them happy once again. I strive for conflict resolution."
good,"Average rating. No room for real growth, not much incentive to go above and beyond."
good,A typical day at Staples consist of providing excellent customer service. I have been with Staples for 2 years and I am pleased to learn something different each day as the company seems to be changing. My coworkers are some of the best I have worked with in a long time. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I can help people with what their needs may be. The hardest part of the job is not being able to find something a customer may need because of the negligence of other employees.
good,I worked in the copy center and I had a lot of loyal customers and I also got new ones all the time. It was nice that I didn't have to go to work and know what my routine was going to be every day. I made several friends along the way as well.
good,"In retail stores like Staples, you will find yourself making amazing frienships and connections with coworkers and customers in general, this type of job is good for a part time student and someone that wants a career in the retail industry, if you are looking for something bigger I still recomend working for this company for the experience and understanding of what it is to interact with all kinds of customers."
good,"moves you around to different departments so you may learn new things, people are pretty nice and help when needed"
good,"Sales culture needs work."
good,Management consistently takes short term view and is not always honest with employees.
good,"Managed my day acccording to appointments to speak to business decisions makers about office supplies.  Learned that persistency, energy and drive are the kys to being successful in sales.  Co-workers were helpful in learning the job, but it was not an interactive environment since it required you to be alone all day.  Hardest part of the job was constatnt prospecting for qualified business who fit our office supply program requirements.  Plenty of freedom and individual awareness of time management."
good,"I enjoyed Helping people, talking to people.  Great team players"
good,"It's an ok job, not career. I've worked at staples for 5 years and I just got completely bored with working here. Florida stores are much slower than my old location on wall street."
good,"During the time that I worked there many changes took place.  The management staff changed over multiple times.  Managers that actually had a clue seemed to be the ones that were abused by the other management staff or pushed out."
good,"Sales Representative helping customers with enquires on products and customer care & support. Training new staff members,"
good,"boss stayed on top of everyone, stacked shelves at night or in morning, worked freight and polished floors"
good,I loved working here and it wasn't so far away I'd work there again
good,I go to work todo my best and learn more! Making a customer happy and exceeding their expectations is the best thing to do.
good,"Co-workers were laid back , management was also laid back focused."
good,Excellent community supply store. Workers were friendly and helped if you ever need anything. Supervisors and managers were there for you if you needed anything and very understanding if something was done wrong. They worked to help right the wrong and teach you new techniques if that situation ever came up again.
good,"Pay sucks but its an ok job."
good,"General manager was basically a middle school bully, fun to work with sometimes, a complete pain inhibiting work abilities at other times."
good,"Come in, cashier all day, put out ink, clean and go home. I learned more about office supplies. Management and coworkers were cool."
good,Really great people that work for the company i see them being around along time
good,"I greeted and helped assist customers find items, cleaned, unboxed and stocked up merchandise, helped within the printing and copying area. I learned that their is a time to play and their is a time to work, and when your at work you shouldn't play. The management was very serious about getting sales and having customers leave happy. The co-workers was nice. The most enjoyable part was seeing customers leave happy."
good,"Those who doesnt have any retail or work experience this will be a good place to start out. It can be challenging at times dealing with customer(s) who cant understand your a training even thought it said it  on your shirt, but the best part is when you have a certain customer(s) that understand, is patience and even jokes around with you."
good,"morale is low in this facility, but there is a pretty solid bond between associates. a good place to work if you like to be active."
good,This company offers a lot if you can run the rat race.  They are great & offer a lot of great corporate perks if you want to always worry about being walked out the door.  It makes you feel insecure all the time kind of work place.
good,"A typical day is: do cash office, open store, perform 2 different in-depth cycle counts, perform out of stock scan (plus research), do paperwork, clean warehouse, help customers, meet sales quotas, help on cash register, answer manager calls from customers and employees, receive (load and unload) truck/freight/load within 24hrs, send back damaged product to vendors and warehouse. "
good,This was a typical retail store customer service job.  I was a brand new college student and it was a good balance.
good,Great company to further develop your selling skills.  Good leadership.  Excellent product offerings.
good,"Hi volume, fast pace, productive, customer service environment.  I learned how to develop and manage a staff of 20-30 associates and have an excellent relationship with associates of all levels.  The most challenging part of my job is operating with systems that can't handle the volume.  The most enjoyable part of my job is satisfying customers and adding to the success of the business."
good,"A typical day consisted of selling tech items to customers and providing them with product input. I learned even more customer service techniques at the placement. Management was tough, but fair. The hardest part of the job is the fierce competition in the job. You work towards ""ultimately"", the benefit of the customer, but there was no ""team"" effort. It took some adjusting to. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping others in their need for product input."
good,I Was Copy Center Lead!! Very Busy!! Made Copies for Customers Some Big Some Small!! Ordered Stamps/Business Cards/Banners for Customers!! Making Sure Copiers Were Stacked With Paper Making Sure Area and Copiers Were in Clean Working Order!! The Mangers there Were Very Nice and Respectful!! I Learned How to Deal With Customers One on One!! Solving Problems and Offering Solutions!! 
good,"Punching in to start shift."
good,"- Learned and manged inventory/stock"
good,"Working with customers and sales, proofing job tickets, lots of multi tasking. Need to know how to manage your time. Good group of people to work with. "
good,I met and worked with a wonderful team selling products for offices
good,"The people I work with are awesome and so are some of the regular customers that shop with us, but that's about it..."
good,no much to say dealing with customers and working your butt off for little pay
good,"The pay is not great, at least for the computer technician position I held. But, at least the work environment and hours were decent. "
good,Replenish shelves for the pickers to box for customers. Co-Workers are great. Management not so great. 
good,Enjoyed doing the copy center the best. Cause I got to do the creative type of work.
good,"see other staples review"
good,"Drive sales on a daily basis by offering promotions and up selling products and services. Building lasting relationships with customers."
good,"A typical day at work would be picking daily orders using the PTV (pick to voice) unit, making sure orders are packed timely and neatly into boxes, and cleaning up work area as we go. Management is very knowledgeable about daily operations of the company and always there to help associates in anyway possible. The hardest part of the job would have to be repeatedly pulling around a cart full of office products all day, constant overtime, and summer. "
good,"My typical day would be serving customers behind a desk and making sure that I fulfill their needs and that they walk out with a smile. When I am on supervisory duty, I have to make sure that the staff are motivated to achieve their targets as well as their set tasks for the day. "
good,I enjoyed my time at staples. I was a cashier and also office supplies sales associate. I was hoping to get into the copy and print department but they really needed me in office supplies  
good,"Management is a 10 hour day with 1 hour lunch. You get 5 hour of OT a week."
good,"Laid back, simple job, Worked here a year, learned a lot on customer service"
good,"After hiring on with staples and working with one of the worst GM's in my career I have come to some conclusions. While being hourly is nice as an assistant manager, they do not provide enough staffing hours to complete the hundred or so tasks they want completed each week. After the restructure in April each store was supposed to receive more hours for sales associates, however that is incorrect. My store has received no additional hours to speak of. Pay scale is terrible it is nearly impossible to retain good talent when you have a GM who treats people horribly and you cant hire them in any highe than $7.45/hr"
good,Staples has been an experience which has helped me place a strong concentration on team management and customer service skills.
good,"At Staples, the best part was working with the customers that came in. Even if I was having a bad day, as soon as I got to work I couldn't help but put a smile on my face. Sitting on the register could get a bit boring when it was slow, but that's when I had time to really talk to the customers and get to know them. This was always my favorite part of the day because having a good relationship with the regulars was very important to me. I always wanted to see them leave with a smile on their face even if we didn't have what they needed."
good,"Staples was a pleasure to work for. I met some great people there, and learned some amazing skills."
good,"A good company to work for, but the upper management isn't the best in strategic planning."
good,The hardest part about being an operations manager for this company is having the time to be an operations manager.
good,I worked in the copy center. This could be very stressful at times dues to impatient customers and time crunches. The job its self was fun in the fact of creating projects and doing things with your hands. They would keep their employees longer if they started higher then minimum wadge with actual raises.
good,Easy going place. It's staples walk in the store and you'll see the environment. Not much more to it.
good,"Management was strict on reaching certain in store quotas. If some employees did not reach a certain quota and some did, the overall store performance would go down with it. Even the managers didn't reach their own quotas but always explained the importance of it."
good,Staples has been a wonderful place to work. My superiors are extremely flexible and open to our ideas. My co-workers have been a joy to work with and are always willing to help others.
good,"A typical day never really occured in my job as it was different every day i would have customers wanting things from business cards designed up to exhibition stands other times i would have many students wanting printing and binding for dissertation, i was in charge of my department and managment let me get on with things as we were making a profit, I really enjoyed working with different people every day and making things for them that made them happy."
good,"Busy and you're often asked to do something in every department. Not a bad place to work even with part-time because you do get really good benefits. Don't complain, this is retail. Worst part of my job/location of job are the majority of the customers that come in. Not the best demographic to work with."
good,Each day was different.
good,"face paced, very diverse group of people, lots of overtime, went through supervisors too much, decent money,"
good,"My tenure at Staples Advantage has enhanced my leadership, communication, and management skills. I definitely learned how to challenge both myself and customers, manage multiple product category personnel, and present, host and train customers and associates. I most enjoyed the opportunity to develop and shape the future of Staples Advantage, by serving and training on multiple committees."
good,"First work experience, As a sales associate i began my training in working with others and helping patrons with sales. Management was pleasant to work with. as were co-workers. hardest part of the job was distances had to travel. Mos enjoyable was learning."
good,"The work is fun, its really busy and most of the time you will deal with difficult customers"
good,"I believe that line managers should be much more skilled in employee relations and operations management than they currently are. Bonus program for employees doing that actual work is pathetic. Decent benefits, poor pay compared to other companies in supply chain."
good,"Close to my house, good supervisors, okay pay. Alot of standing around and physical work."
good,This was my first real job I learned a lot here I think if I would have stayed I probably would be higher up in the comapany with my college education and experience it woul;d have been a great career
good,"stocked and reloaded my department. took care of any guests in my department with any questions and need they had. put together the desks and chairs, as well as any maintenance on any broken ones brought in."
good,"Its a fun place to work if you take everything take it easy, I had no problem working their since I don't take anything serious I do my work."
good,"Assisting customers with their purchases, checking stock, ordering merchandise etc."
good,"A normal day at work varies on the workload. On an average day I had maybe 20 customers in queue and 1-2 onsites scheduled. I would arrive at work and either be approached by a supervisor or another floor tech and they would tell me what was going on from the time I left the previous day throught the morning before I arrived. I would make my phone calls, take care of what I could before I had to leave for my appointments."
good,"Staples was a good place to get management experience. Had good co-workers for the most part, although with labor constraints, not enough of them. Enjoyed helping customers. Hardest part of job was the tight labor they run the stores on."
good,quick pace atmosphere with good benefits also good management.
good,"In my position I typically process several reports while assisting customers. I have learned a lot on how to maintain and manage a store. I have also learned a lot about technology and about marketing/ advertising. My co-workers are like any typical work place, they come from different backgrounds and are all different ages. Management is cool. I like processing the paperwork aspect of my job. The hardest part is trying to sell certain items to certain customers or the occasional difficult customer that comes in as well."
good,"First job, was a great experience to learn. Working with my co-workers was nice, it was welcoming and management helped with things when needed. Getting to make the food and knowing that someone enjoyed it."
good,-slow paced
good,It was a short temporary job that showed me how much work is involved in setting up a store
good,"All employee's in any Staples are trained to know as much about the products in store as possible, it can be a great learning experience. Unfortunately, not only the management at our store but management at a majority of stores all the way up to the more corporate level are not very easy to deal with and can make working for them a real pain at times."
good,Retail is difficult to work but I was able to grow to other positions within the company.
good,Staples is a quality organization that provides the resources and
good,usually had lots of work to do n complete but the store was usually calm. Worked with friendly customers as well as employees. Did most of the design in the store as well as working on our copy center orders n working on the for to help customers with what they needed
good,it was very respectable environment is you do your work right.
good,l'aspect le plus agréable de mon poste etait de travailler avec le public et de travailler en équipe jaimais ca.jai de la facilité a communiquer avec les gens.
good,"Mostly work at the cashier register ring out customer. You had to make sure the customer had a reward card, knew what the item of the month was, up sale if possible and if buying electronic offer the warranty on the product."
good,I enjoyed talking and meeting new people everyday. I would greet customer and give details on products and product information. I would stock shelves and do inventory on the items in the store and i also enjoyed working with my co-workes.
good,"i would pick orders off the floor. i learned how to drive and stand on pallet jack. mangement was not very solid the department went through alot of supervisors, also my coworkers were very helpful in teaching me processes. the hardest part of my job was that we sometimes had to lift heavy furniture and the most enjoyable part of the job is that it is fast past so it makes it seem like the day is going by fast"
good,Usually fast paced and good job for starting out in retail. Employees are very nice to work with. I learned a lot about customer service and the way that retail operated
good,"Job was ok. Shifts around 8 hrs, sometimes longer. Management was fair. Not much advancement. Company at one time put employees first, last 3 years company if geared more towards saving money and pushing higher production, cheap with costs, and health care costs and benefits are higher then before, made reaching goal numbers to achieve quarterly bonuses unrealistic after first time achieving them."
good,"Customer service, i learned alot about sales and being a leader with good management."
good,"Its a great place to work especially for college students looking for part time to work. General manager on the other hand is very rude, and talks down on the employees, but the other managers are friendly and patient, they treat workers with respect. Typical day is to ring up customers, organize work area and provide excellent customer service to our customers and this made it easy for the fact that we were able to be ourselves and I enjoyed smiling and helping the customers out. The hardest part will be the closing when we have to restock inventory, but since we had hard working employee the time went by fast and efficient."
good,Its a pleasant atmosphere but I'm looking for something a bit more challenging. I'm looking to get into the Insurance business and make a career out of it.
good,"temporary set up crew to open store on time, fast paced, lots of work done in short time"
good,"Cashier, cart retrieval, go backs, stocking, restocking, returns and exchanges, answering phones."
good,"Smile and greet customers, shoe intrest in needs for a new wireless divice. Closed deal"
good,"A typical day consisted of troubleshooting comptuers and helping customers find the right product they were looking for. I learned alot while working there, I learned how to set up computers, how to tear apart computers, and I also learned how to deal one on one with a person and how to decide what exactly the customer was looking for without makeing them spend alot of money. The hardest part of my job was to sell computers to someone that didnt have alot to spend. I was always trying to manage their money instead of selling them the product they needed. Co-Workers were great to work with if they picked up their share of the load. The most enjoyable part of the job was the rewards I got for doing a good job."
good,the company is a great one to work for
good,"Daily meeting, management was cooperative, co-workers were friendly, the moral was great"
good,Lots of calls and orders to be placed
good,The hardest part of the job in Staples ia that it has grown into the technology sales field over the past few years. I did not wish to be in that field as I am not tech savvy and do not have much interest in that field.
good,A typical work day is 100% customer service and sales based. I learned many sales skills in my 7 years with the company.
good,A typical work day at staples is fast paced with many consumers seeking to gain credit for either a new business or existing business. Many of its clients are demanding and impatient. As to be expected when handling corporate measures due to limited time. However the management is fair but somewhat laxed. The hardest part of the job is meeting the demands of it's client but definitely doable once a system is developed. The most enjoyable part of the job is learning how the credit/finance industry exists and further exploring its collaborations.
good,Day to day work could be challenging but overall a decent place to work.
good,Nice corporate environment with potential to grow. NO growth in store.
good,"a fast enviroment warehouse, picking orders for custumers.scanning and labeling building pallets of products. i learn to use lots of warehouse equipment such as hand scanners,RF, forklifts,order picker,electric pallet jacks and Reach machines. great manegements and co-workers. the hardest part of the job is working in the furniture area cause some desk weight up to 200 lbs and the most enjoyable part is picking orders in the case pick floors."
good,District managers our out of the loop with their stores. staples is a good company to work for.
good,"Great people, not enough opportunities for growth. Shifts go quick, some tasks that are asked are not reasonable"
good,was not a good experience with the management system there.
good,"A typical day at work would be dealing with customers face-to-face or over the phone. Stacking shelves was also a common duty. I learnt that working in teams can be just as beneficial as working on your own. I felt that the General Manager at the time was not so motivating. I got on with my other co-workers very well, able to work together on bigger tasks whilst dealing with customers. The hardest part of the job was meeting targets (for example a certain number of loyalty cards obtained). The most enjoyable part of my job was the camaraderie between the employees contributiig towards a harmonious atmosphere within the workplace."
good,A typical day I would verify and change price labels for all items. Re-stock items. Help customers with and educated purchase and rang up the items.
good,A typical day at work
good,"A typical day at work is dealing with customer service, assisting customers with their needs and reaching sales goals. While working at Staples,Inc I have learned the way you present yourself is really important your noticed by your presentation and how you treat others. The management at the store has not been stable since I started working there. I would love to work in an environment where everyone is on the same page and everything is ran smoothly. I enjoy meeting and getting to know new people. I've learned to adjust to different people and environments and I am currently seeking a new position to start my new beginning."
good,Co-workers were very good and very helpful.
good,Learned many valuable skills over the last 16 years.
good,The customers there are usually for mean since they are all in a hurry all the time. It is also a stressful place. The electronics Department was laid back. Lots of pressure to sell.
good,"They were focused on selling contracts for computer repair, as well as in selling all electronic equipment. I had the concern that this was not a strong point in my selling experience, but was assured that as a manager I would not need that experience. I did not feel I could do my job properly without some training in this area, which I did not receive."
good,* Answering the customers inquiries on the phone * how to professionally answer the customers inquiries * the management was good *enjoyed working with co-workers * being on the phone all day; and dealing with irate customers * having such good co-workers
good,There was nothing hard about the job work goes by instantly when not noticing.
good,"Sorting alll work orders,Call or delever courier shipments,audit & cheack spot orders,invoice all outbound orders,enter recieving shipments into inventory."
good,I had to leave the company to find a job with better pay. The individual they hired to replace me was offered a wage that I'd previously requested to stay there.
good,Nice store and work envirenment. A little cheap in the wages.
good,They had a good product but lacked the management to execute. Too bad the company failed.
good,"Restocking the shelves, helping customers make the most well informed decisions."
good,Great for a teenager who is just entering the workforce. they mold you into what they see your fullest potential can achieve. great for getting experience in retail and customer service.
good,"A day at staples for a tech is like a car repair shop. You get demanding customer plending to fix all there problems for free lol. After consulting with them with great customer service they begin to realize the total solution. Thru it all i learned a lot from staples from professionalism to customer service, even computer repair. I couldnt ask for better co-worker to work with they know how to work as a team and get the job done. The hardest par of the job is the pay. Financially it doesnt fit the needs to support my family. However the are so many enjoyable momenst with this job that i could write a book. Staples That Was Easy"
good,Enjoyable to a degree.
good,GREAT FOR A PART TIME JOB. A bit to much favortism there. Best part is you get to be part of the magic at the shows and games.
good,"A very nice place to work at. Alot of work had to be done on a daily basis. Greeting customers, stocking shelves, helping customers with there needs."
good,Not the most motivated group of people to work with. People feed off of their leaders. When managers come to work with the attitude that they dont want to be there why would I want to?
good,"A typical day with Staples is to simply get to your station and do what needs to be done. A lot of the job is aiding customers. Most jobs can be done very quickly without a major amount of assistance. Since Staples is a computer and electronics company it gives the employes a good opportunity to learn about various computer software and hardware. All the members of management where polite when they needed to be and stern when it called for. I be-leave because of the lax values of the company they tend to higher more people with diminished values and not all co-workers seem trust-able. The hardest part of working with Staples is learning some of the Copy centers machinery and programs, but someone with a good amount of sense is sure to pick up on it quickly enough. The most enjoyable part of the job where the customers. People who come in are looking for equipment for devices that generally cost a good deal of money. Those people will be quite picky and jumpy about what they are getting, but put a great deal of faith in your knowledge of the subject. Seeing a customer who originally had fear about the subject leave with confidence is a great reward."
good,"Staples has a very diverse workforce. Depending on your position, you may be in contact with customers or co-workers on the other side of the US. There are positions available with varying schedules for those who are not able to work a regular 9:00am - 5:00pm.job."
good,Most days you clean the shelves and isles and help customers.
good,working with staples as there easy tech associate was fun because i got to help people solve there complex problems and provide solutions to them.
good,"ET4b is a great new focus for Staples, close to my home."
good,Nice company to work for. Nice place to grow as far as job position.
good,"Most Everyone who works there are really nice, and get along with pretty much anyone. Assistant manager works just as hard as the rest of us, she tries to make sure that everything gets done but during slow times, she can be fun and laid back."
good,I had this job in high school and in that point of my life I wasn't worried about benefits or advancement so I don't believe my review will be much help.
good,"There is always something to do, and always pleasant people to talk to. I have worked in every department and enjoyed them all. The managers are very passionate about what they do."
good,"It's an overall good company to work for, just have to start out on the bottom rung of the corporate ladder."
good,"Good management, accommodating of class and other engagements. No real room for advancement"
good,"I enjoyed much of time at the company, but the reoccurring theme was weak management, and apathy towards associates."
good,Good company to work for. Emphasis placed on teamwork. Opportunity to grow in company
good,Good company but the store that I worked in wasn't the greatest.
good,"The job itself was good, getting to deal with customers on a daily basis along with some light merchandising. The only real bad thing is the amount of hours that are given out; as a part timer you could easily only be given 8 or less hours in a week."
good,"Staples is a good company to work for,however, the hours are not anything to rave about!"
good,"A very fast paced warehouse, yet always get enough work never sent home, so thats a plus."
good,"Staples was very organize, meaning the shipments came on time and I never had to wait to get started working. The warehouse was always clean, it was always easy to find shelves and find product that customers needed."
good,"Normal Retailer daily operations "
good,"They offer a ton of products, though you have to dig to find how to offer some. The print department's operator design sucks. Having 5 ways to place orders and only being able to track 2 of them directly. I hate having to make phone calls to check on things that aren't rushed."
good,Very strong sales culture. If minimums are not meet by even i% on over 12 different key areas they are mad and let you know about it. There are no mid range goals only strech goals and all must be meet every time.
good,"While I have held many different positions both on the sales floor and in the receiving area, their culture supports maintaining good customer care ensuring the customer receives all they need with one visit."
good,"This was okay place I would say, mainly for students. Don't go for it if you are skilled person, growing within the company is difficult.  I don't have any complaints."
good,"The work place is amazing, but the management could be a lot better. Everyone there is really friendly and willing to help with your success i wish this was the same for some of the management team. I couldn't say all management was bad but one in particular was very difficult to work with."
good,"When i first started Staples it was a pretty good work work environment, Friendly employees, willing to teach and very helpful crew. Though when I made the move to Florida i transferred to another staples and it honestly my view on staples sort of went down. My new manager seems to not want to help when i ask him to, he gets sort of an attitude when i ask, and it seems that our district manager is very unreasonable and has threaten to cut hours do due numbers of the store, even though our store does better than hers."
good,"I would recommend Staples as a first job. Nothing about the job itself is obtuse or unfair. Management is good, moving chairs and printers around is a nice workout, and it's a relatively low intensity way to learn how to deal with customers. However, despite having no commission, you will be worked as hard as a laborer and full-time salesman combined, while only receiving a part time position (with full time hours) and minimum wage. Not to mention how much specialized knowledge you'll need to be doing sales, it's a wonder they can call themselves ""entry level"" and pay like it."
good,"I learned a lot of basic sales, I made friends. Typical day would include going over numbers pushing sales, staying busy. Management did their best but the hiring was questionable and hours were sometimes sparce"
good,"The work/life was fine, not too overwhelming. Benefits and pay were very good. Typical day was the same as any other retailer. The most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with all the repeat business customers."
good,"Working in the Print & Marketing department, you understand that your department talks to a lot of customers to build relationships. Some customer however forget the people working behind the counter are people too, not dogs to be on their call. I've personally have experience a customers snapping his fingers at me and my supervisor had done nothing. The work load however was easy as long as you go things done in an organized fashion."
good,"Lots of nice people who are generally very competant at what they do.  Serious work environment where you're expected to perform like an adult. Flexible about working-from-home when needed, especially on bad weather days."
good,Management at the Knoxville Store is great.  She is fair and honest.  Works with employs to address issues.  Customer base in W. Knoxville is somewhat entitled acting which can sometimes cause friction but it's not intolerable.  Pay is too low.  They start at $9.-$9.5 except for Tech people.  They NEED tech people all the time.
good,If you apply work hard don’t talk to anyone it’s just not that type of environment everyone is gossipy and management is full of it. Just Crazy psychos.
good,"Was once a great place to work. With the very challenging environment they are competing in, and the private equity firm that own them, it is not a good place to work anymore."
good,"For the amount of work print department associates do the company should pay them more. I think $12-15 an hour would show more appreciation to those who work in the print department. It's never boring, but I would prefer to be caught up at work more often."
good,"The jobs gets REALLY stressful and you’ll wanna quit. I kid you not. MOST customers are very annoying but if your professional and just do what you have to do, you’ll be good. Once you get a hang of all the equipment it’s a breeze."
good,"This job will help you gain invaluable skills with people, which will not only prove to be extremely helpful on the job, but in life as well, as effective communication plays a major role in lifelong success. The environment is good, excellent support from fellow associates makes the job more enjoyable to work in, and boost confidence when it comes to selling protection plans. BTS (Back To School) time is a grind, but it’s not outrageously hard. If you prove to be a hard worker that is readily available through most of the week, you’ll more often than not be scheduled an exorbitant amount of hours, and don’t be surprised if they try to call you in on off days. To be perfectly honest, protection plans seem like a bunch of bullshjt since you don’t get anything from them, and they really need to stop pushing so got d@m hard on them, it just looks delegate when they keep asking the customer over an over again.  One final thing I’ll say is that they need to be a little less lenient on some of their associations, if they continually don’t show up, the. get rid of them and hire someone who’ll take the job more seriously ."
good,It was a good job. It was a fast paced environment that didnt requirement physical endurance. Most of the customers were pretty good as well as the fellow employees.
good,"As a tech supervisor half of your job is customer service/working the technology bench, but the other half of the job is sales and meeting quotas, most of them are unrealistic. When you do finally reach a quota, it's not good enough and they raise the number. You are pushed and pushed and pushed to make sales numbers go up, but are not compensated in any way for the performance of the store. Cool."
good,"Compensation used to be good. "
good,Back to school season is not for the faint at heart or those that buckle under pressure. I worked through 3 of them and saw many temps disappear after their first shift. The training is less due to being a temp but you get next to no time to get used to the register or processes before you’re required to dive right in and handle the chaos. They generally didn’t hire until 2 weeks before the peak of the season and when the temps stopped showing it was up to the regular employees to pick up the slack. They would not pay overtime so if there was a no call or a call out you were on your own. They would often get you to work a double shift if you hadn’t reached the max hours. The breaks helped make it worth it but working from 7am to 10pm isn’t always ideal.
good,"Although I worked with some pretty amazing people, the customers were pretty neat to. I loved helping customers that didn't know where things were and helping them to decide on products they needed and didn't know went with the product."
good,"I find myself very stressed out with how frequently customers are having issues. I have a few close coworkers that make it a better place for me to work, but I don't think I have worked a single shift where there wasn't at least a mildly upset customer."
good,Staples is a laid back business that isn't too fast paced nor slow paced. My favorite part of the job was seeing the difference of the whole store after cleaning every day and feeling accomplished.
good,"I learned to work well in a team and operating cash systems and becoming better at sales. An okay company to work for, sometimes stressful with lack of organization and difficult expectations from management, but in general nice customers and a good and fun/supporting team."
good,As a tech associate a typical day starts with tracking down inventory that is scattered around half the store and physically confirming that we have the number of items specified. While doing this you are to also assist customers with finding products they need. Upon finishing the inventory you are to pull new inventory and stock shelves with it while still helping customers. As the day comes to a close you are to clean up items left on the floor and at the bottom of shelves as well as bringing product to the front of the shelf to make the shelves look orderly.
good,Management was what made my job mostly tolerable. Had a great management team that facilitated success in the workplace. I could see this job being much worse if management was not great.
good,Ok place to start in a retail environment. Learn your customer service skills before you move on.  Benefits are great.  Opportunites to expand knowledge through vendor courses
good,"I gained my management experience while working at Staples. At first, it was a joyful place to work. However, hours were very long and scheduling unpredictable."
good,"Large matrix organization going through an identity crisis for years. 800# gorilla in its heyday but now struggling to find its fit."
good,"It is the typical retail job. Show up, meet your quotas, be respectful and get paid 9.5 dollars an hour. Some of my managers and Co-workers were cool so that was nice."
good,I liked working at Staples in the beginning and then I got a new job offer so I ended up leaving. The other job I was working at offered better pay and better work hours.
good,"Management didn’t make sure employees had a positive and organized work environment. Also, a hard working person was never appreciated by the management."
good,The work environment at Staples had gone from bad to worse in recent times.This is mostly due to clueless people hired at all levels of management. I would not recommend Staples for any prospective employees.
good,Pretty good job. Just needed better compensation. Enjoyed vacation time the most. I worked there 4 years and had earned a total of about 3 weeks paid vacation time.
good,Staples recently purchased by a private equity firm.  Management and culture is changing.  Was a great place to work- but hard to determine the direction of this organization. I love my job here- but not sure what changes are looming
good,"Depends on the location, some are better and more structured than others because Staples are going through transitions (ie branch at univeristy ave). Their vision and goal looks promising if its pushed through all locations."
good,"Work hours are flexible and conducive to students, post retirement folks and those new to or just getting back into the working world after some time away."
good,"I started working there in 2018 as my first job and it wasn't horrible in all honesty. The occasional bad customer , but that's customer service for you. Never had an issues with any co-workers or management ."
good,"Overall, Staples is an okay place to work. The hours are easy and the pay is $15/hr weekly. It's good to have patience with this job as some customers can be finicky. The hours can be flexible if you elaborate on your situation."
good,My store has a lot of ups and downs but I personally have a decently nice time being there and it's not super stressful. The area isn't very busy so there are days where times are dead and times that are busy for the deals Staples has.
good,Working for staples was interesting with the different skills and talents  everyone brought on board.  I learned concentrated and think smart in every situation.  Management was patient with those who knew a little about their responsibilities. Culture was diverse and I hope to see more diversity.  The hardest part was sales because the sales object or item wasn't the best quality at times.  The most enjoyable is meeting new people with their stories.
good,I enjoyed the job but I was looking for something different. The culture there was fine. The most difficult part was the unrealistic expectation of turning around a challenged store.
good,"Staples is a decent part time job to have if you are in school/ college. Compensation is not the greatest, and the expectations are high. Not a bad temporary job."
good,"Great place to work, I would recommend Staples to others as a referral. Management would ensure of a proper work life balance. Staples was recently status as privately owned."
good,The company has a laid back corporate cultures. There are very limited opportunity for advancement. The salary is ok for starting but it definitely not enough to live off of.
good,"I didn't really enjoy working at Staples. I was constantly shorted on hours. I gave them full availability and they gave me minimal hours and complained they had no staff willing to work. Some managers were great, some not so much."
good,"A typical day at staples is random, you never know what you are going to be put through. You have to meet certain quotas in order to make the day. The hours are really limited so do not expect to hit overtime if you are not in a full time position. Overall the workplace culture is chill as long as you don't butt into peoples business. Then again it is a retail job."
good,Great place to work and learn retail to move on in a career. Start young and work your way up the ladder. Most of the employees are teenagers having their first job.
good,I worked as a computer technician.  I was a good job but the pay was low. My manager was excellent and the clients were well mannered. It was an a good stop gap job while I waited to get full-time employment.
good,If you need to make some money in a stress free environment id recommend working here. The work is simple and hours flexible. If you work here too long you can feel like you're stuck but its a good coasting job.
good,"Staples is a great place to work if you are just starting out. however there is no room for advancement. A typical day includes price changing, pulling product forward, helping customers, ringing them up."
good,"If you hit your goals, which some times are very hard because you are very slammed, its pretty chill. You just need to have the right managers and have to show respect. A lot of the procedures are very convoluted but my managers understand that."
good,"I would rate this job fair. The job isn't hard and Ive worked here for almost 2 years now. I learned customer service, and the management is decent. As a cashier, they wanted to me to tell every customer about paper, and the promotions they have. If someones buying a printer, they expect you to mention square trade and ink with it. The job is cake, and the most enjoyable part of the job is the freedom they give you."
good,"Inventory specialist is a somewhat unique postion at Staples. Probably the best position for introverts. Tech associates are glorified salesmen. The IS spends plenty of time on the floor helping customers but its only about 50% of your time. The other 50% is focused on keeping the store well-stocked and neat, as well as returns to warehouse, receiving truck shipments, and sometimes helping management with store layout plans (planograms)."
good,Staples was a good job and I would recommend this job to other people.  The work was not hard but you have to be very careful about the SKU numbers. Some products might look the same but are not. Management here is good they all are caring and will hear out your ideas.
good,This job is perfect for anyones first or second job maybe still in high school or just something for some money while you are in college. Don't have very much to add on staples as a francise.
good,I have been a Contractor for them for the last 8 years so my experience may not reflect that of an actual regular employee.  I have taught training classes and worked the same job that I instruct.  The goals are tough to meet.  Simply because you cannot always control a customer interaction.  Overall though they understand some of these difficulties.  They are fair.
good,It was a great place to work. Management was great the hours were good and so was the pay. The only thing was it was really hard to get something approved by upper management. They were never around
good,"10+ hours a day are horrible not to mention at least 10 hours a week are wasted on conference calls, pay is not at all competitive. DO more with less and for less"
good,"B2B Sales Consultant"
good,Staples attempted to buy Office Depot but was not allowed to by the Federal Government. This incident caused me to think that from experience the company would not succeed upon a failed merger attempt. Also too many stores closed. That made me think they weren't going to make it as well
good,"good place to work...good career ,,work is inside out of weather.. safe work environment....get good breaks.....nice people ... no lay offs,, fast pace"
good,"i worked the cash register and the whole time i was getting yelled at in my ear piece to sell ink or paper or plans for certain items, they have to meet a certain quota of stuff to sell and if they were getting close to falling below a certain number thats all you heard in your ear piece. they are extremely short staffed so customers were upset for waiting so long in line they werent interested in hearing about no plan you were trying to sell them.  the up side was everyone that worked there was real chill.  if they werent stressing on me to sell sell sell I prolly would of stayed working there or at least give commision on all the stuff they having you sell."
good,"My time at Staples started off great, but than they started to ask more of me but did not want to pay I'm a team player but it seem to me that I was doing more than I was being compensated for..."
good,"a typical work day was fairly easy, show up to work and do a pull list which is filling holes on the shelves. Customers are a top priority so along with making sure your shelves in your department are full you have to help customers. I learned a little bit about computers, as far as how to remove and protect them from viruses and basic tricks in trying to fix them."
good,"I did not mind my time at Staples, I rather enjoyed it. But if you continue to leave a crooked, self centered, arrogant person as general manager, I don't see the store thriving much longer."
good,Fun place to work and learn as a teenager. Decent salary. Clean store. Sufficient breaks  . Good schedules. Management could use some work . Overall decent place to work
good,"Worked as a work from home representative. Answering calls to help aid customers. Placed orders , took payments , processed refunds , deal with irate customers."
good,"Picked up the job as something to hold me over when I went back to school for chemistry. Not having any expectations about what kind of job it would be, it has been acceptable."
good,"You have to meet budgets and sales goals.  "
good,"Great place to work so much opportunities, the people there are awesome.,  learned a lot working there  I would  recommend  anyone to work at staples..  the supervisors are great people also"
good,Liked the people I worked with.  Learned office skills .  My manager was great to work with.  The hardest part about my job was having to leave after 37 years.  I loved having a place I enjoyed going to every day.
good,"Odds are you will be paid minimum wage and no commissions for the  technology sales position. Depending of your manager, there could be a bit of stress to sell warranties and other services with the products you sell. You will do a lot of restocking and changing the aisle when it's necessary.After 3 months of employment, you could choose to pay around 6 dollars every paycheck for medical and dental plan.With a limit of a 1,000$ a year, I've barely paid anything for visiting the dentist for the past 2 years. Overall, it's not a hellish place to work like KFC, and the workers at my location are fun to work with."
good,The pay at Staples was fair however there is little room for advancement beyond an associate level 3. Management is ok but for having the tenor in the positions they do you would think they would know a lot more. They are often focused on the wrong things.
good,"When I started at the store, all my managers and supervisors were awesome. It was a great environment, with a very supportive team. I learned a lot, and my team backed me up when I made mistakes. By the end of about the first year, that team was all promoted or transferred, and bad hiring choices led to others quitting. Eventually, I  was the only one left with any experience, including our new Store Manager. Our new manager, who was terrible at his job, combined with corporate constantly changing policies on the fly, made my job frustrating, so I had to quit."
good,My working experience at Staples was not so good. The management team didn't know how to handle pressurize time. The working schedule was very hectic.
good,"Good place to work, not stuck in an office all day. unrealistic sales goals.great support team.  Manager was supportive. Overall  I would recommend as a first Job"
good,Worked with almost exclusively net new customers. The new reps were paid at a higher rate than the reps that were training them. There was no real room for growth and you are limited in your ability to call on customers based on time.
good,Worked there for about 4 years now and it great. Has its ups and downs but not enough to keep me there at all. Cant advance or get very good raises. Overall been really great with people who you work with
good,Very slow type of business. I had several different responsibilities. They included both sales and operational duties. The managers were reasonable and I never felt disrespected.
good,"The work was intermittent but sometimes challenging, I felt that because of my location I was overlooked in many aspects such as extra training or help there seemed to opportunity for advancement since you were perceived as a contractor nothing more. The more difficult part of the job was trying to keep the customer happy within your operational means. I was always difficult to order repair parts without any issues, there was always something causing an issue. The workplace was fun as I was assigned to the Boeing Company and that work environment was fun."
good,Besides my GM who is amazing and who i still work for Staples as a corporation has no idea how to keep talent or develop it. Their stock is at $7 which should tell you enough.
good,working for this company i learned a lot about communicating and being open to new ideas. At first this was a temporary thing until i went back to school but a year turned into 2 and then 3. I loved being able to go to work and having my co workers who became family to me make the day enjoyable I met a lot of wonderful customers who became regulars and was able to help them with most of their printing needs. I think i stayed there so many years because of them. There were times when it did get frustrating especially stating the same policy over and over to customers who didnt quite understand.
good,"Staples is a great job for someone who is looking to get some experience. While the managers are usually awesome, the pay and the stress of the job tend to be its downfall."
good,"Staples is not a bad place to work, copy center is just overly stressful. I would find myself literally ripping my hair out, I have enough to stress about with school and trying to find a balance."
good,Go to a meeting. They tell you what the expect the day. Weather or not it is going to be a 8 hour day or longer. Go the area that you are assigned to. Log into pick to voice. Scam 5 five boxes. The pick to voice will tell you where you need to. Alway look and see what is going on around you. You might have to fix a jam on the belt. Look for yellow lights. If you see one that means that you need to go and help your coworker clear that light.
good,"Great pay, terrible management. it feels like some people in higher positions got the job cause they know of somebody but not truly having the skills to succeed or fulfill the required job."
good,"Working at staples was fun and easy, however the pay was very low to try and live off of. The hours were sparse and often couldn't make up for the low pay rates. This is a great job to start off in the workforce but hard to make a career with."
good,Work environment constantly changing as well as commission structure and job responsibilities. Immediate managers are receptive and supportive of their employees.
good,"There was an expectation that you always report to work early and stick to your scheduled hours except for vacation or sick days.  The benefits were good, but the compensation was far below industry average and was later corrected.  They would provide budget guidelines based upon fantasy growth that never occurred while continuing to ignore their own decisions that affected the budget that they set."
good,"Staples is a good place for a part time job to make some money on the side. Although, when it came to mobility in the company, I've had a bad experience. I wanted to move up to the tech supervisor position, which requires an interview with the District Manager. I approached him and let him know my intentions, but has ever since denied me a chance at an interview because my sales weren't good enough. I have improved my sales in hopes of being ""good enough"", but it never happened. 4 years, and I was denied a chance of moving up in the company."
good,Was a fantastic place to work in the early years however now not so much . Good hours to work but vacation is very difficult to get especially around the holiday time is this call centre works around American holidays
good,"When hired and throughout training customer service was the focus (as I believe it should be). We were trained to take care of the customer and attend to their needs with a no pressure sales approach to build loyalty. That idea change once I was there for a while. They now teach to continue to sell after the customer says no and don't stop until they either leave or purchase and do so even to a point of misrepresenting customer needs."
good,"Copy and Print is a huge part of staples business, however when the copy and print supervisor is unqualified and gets pat on the back for doing a great job while they barely show up for work and there underlings work there tails off, is unjust and unfair."
good,"work there many years and over the years the staff are okay to work with management are not the best due they don,t tell you when rotas change so you cant plan your personal life around it and plus the store id not busy enough to keep open, and you never get overtime if you want it paid."
good,"I was undervalued. I wanted to move up but wasn't allowed to. I was available for full time and was the most knowledgable print center associate and was not put to full time. They are built to make money, but it screws the associates."
good,"Copy and print center was a stressful place to work, and many times I wondered if the 9.30hr was worth it. People were rude, management was not very reliable when it came to the department. However, I will say I learned how important presentation and being detail oriented is because it was what either kept customers happy or disappointed."
good,"Mgmt was really nice and caring not only about their customers but their associates."
good,"Not much overtime required - if at all.  Very relaxed environment.  This is both good and bad, as you are not overworked; however there is zero accountability.  This breeds an environment where it is almost as if no one cares about their career (or yours). Everyone is shuffling around day to day, with little to no go forward plan for the business. Many managers are under qualified, but have been employed by Staples for 20+ years, so they just continue to be moved up. If you want to learn, develop, and grow your career, I suggest you stay far away.  If you just want to go in, do your job, and collect a paycheck - this is a fantastic, extremely relaxed environment to do so."
good,"Working for Staples required to be detail, and multitask all the time."
good,Je me suis engagé pour être technicien. Un mouvement de personnel était prévu pour mon poste mais il ne l'on pas fait. Donc je suis vendeur et conseiller et je veux aller de l'avant
good,When I first started working at Staples all was fine. However lousy managers are what really brought down the experience for me. It got so bad that I had to leave.
good,"Their Christmas is back to school time. We had to work 6 days a week for about 6 weeks. The rest of the year was ok ,just 45 hours a week. It was fun to learn about the different aspects of small business customers."
good,Its a job for people who need part time work that has time to invest in a place that wont invest in you.  Work hard get noticed but the price of getting noticed is more responsibilities with no pay increase.
good,"Fun at first but the store manager just doesnt know how to balance the scheduling properly, alot of times short staffed and the hour cap sucks. Just needs work."
good,Company systems are not as advanced as they should be with the money the company has. Daily struggle with system issues that are blamed on supervisors. Support from management is not on the level it should be. HR empowers employs which undermines supervisors.
good,"Management is verbally abusive.  Most employees are under paid.  Very good benefits, health paid for by owner, vacation time, sick pay, work/life balance."
good,"A normal day working at staples is typically boring. Often times i won't have a specific job to do so i assist customers with sales, although I am usually a Stocker. Managers are fine although they seem to have the employees they enjoy working with more than others. the hardest part of working at Staples would be the slow day, meaning their aren't many people to interact with throughout the day. the best part of the day would be me doing the overheads because it would usually take most of the day to do, which would mean I have a job to do for most of the day."
good,"Typical day at work is doing the load, or being a cashier. You get a 15 min break for a shift that's less than hours. If you do more, then you get a 30 min lunch with two breaks. Hardest part of the job is probably back to school season."
good,the managers are way too consumed and force associate to feel the same way. customers often complain that there should be more people working int he copy center.
good,"Staples is a decent company overall, the DC is a tough place to work and you need to be prepared for that. If you are willing to put in the hours and throw your life out of balance for a while this is a good place to be"
good,Staples was easy. All I had to do was offer customers plans on warranties and whatever promotional item we were offering at the time. It was very great being like by all the customers.
good,"Management très appréciable, journée jamais identique, pas d'opportunité d'évolution"
good,"A good place to work in terms of balance. You get to speak with customers but also work as part of a team which is essential."
good,"A typical day at work for me is busy I have to be able to multi task answering phones, serving customers , and checking them out. I get along great with my management because I communicate well with them on everything that's taking place on the job. The hardest part of the job for me is when we don't have the products for the customers and they then become very upset. The most enjoyable part of the job is when i am able to solve a problem for a customer and they become happy."
good,great team members with healthy working hours also a healthy environment with a safe place to work. would reccommended to anyone starting out.
good,"During my 7 years working at the Staples Distribution warehouse, I saw many people come and go. It was just a local job opportunity to help my wife and I start our life together. It payed very well for the work you do but has no potential to lead to anything outside of a warehouse worker."
good,"A lot of regular customers coming in weekly for the same old copies or sending/receiving faxes. "
good,Working here gave me the experience I have today with working with the public. What made it a great place to work was my co-workers. Everyone is so friendly to work with.
good,Must have an eye for product placement and attention to detail. Organizational skills are great to have in this job as you will have to have a sense of where every product must be.
good,"There is not a good balance of job work and personal time."
good,Name recognition. Retail and outside sales presence. National Account Representatives pay is not acceptable.intially compensation was acceptable but has. Even reduced.
good,"It is a decent place to work. There is a lot of work to do and the pay is not great. Lot of multitasking as well, expect to be on register for half of your shift. Management is hit or miss. You are expected to meet a lot of sales goals (no commision) and Staples has become very micro managed. As of late, they are tracking sales per associate so they can see who they need to yell at for not selling. The ones who doing well get as much as a 'good job' over the store radios."
good,"Its a great job, They work with you. I highly recommend it. Not much advancement opportunities though i believe that if you want to work 2 jobs staples is a good job to work with it."
good,"This is a very admin heavy job, little time to actually go and sell to customers. Lack of response and support from internal department is very frustratng."
good,"Managed a large portfolio, enjoyed the customer facing meetings however this job is a lot more admin work than necessary.  Lack of internal accountability is a large problem."
good,Basic office stuff. It isn't challenging to do unless it's almost the beginning of school. Angry teachers and moms are the most trouble you will deal with.
good,"Staples as a company is piling more and more onto their associates and not compansating them nearly enough. "
good,"It's a hit or miss situation. You either run with an amazing team and kill quotas and make customers happy, making you happy, or you run into the worst management ever with people who call out 3/5 times with no disciplinary action placed against them. I was in both spectrums and experienced both. Upper management can be the biggest thorn when they aren't the ones experiencing what you're working on with customers and building a relationship as they try to force you to shove various things down their throats. It really is just a hit or miss situation."
good,"My coworkers were amazing, all college students and we had competition with selling all the time."
good,State of the art equipment and nice people to work with. Very busy work schedule with constant crazy deadlines. The Assistant General Manager can sometimes be unrealistic.
good,"The job of a sales associate at Staples is not just doing sales but also doing stocking, ringing people up at the registers, cleaning the store up, and also working as a customer service employee. At any given point during the day you are tasked with doing multiple different functions at the job site. The work load for the rate of pay at $9.00/hr is not good enough to compete with even the fast food chains in the area that start off paying $1.00 to $1.50 more per hour. However, the managers that have been working at the Staples that I was employed at were generally very nice people that didn't pressure you to sell their unneeded protection plans. In short, the job is a typical retail job."
good,"I enjoyed my time working here. You occasionally had people problems, but for the most part everyone was respectful. The hardest part about working here was that the policies did not allow for life. While some people got away with anything it seemed like. Those who were trying there hardest and failing were not given any help. Sometimes snow happens and your kids get sick. They attempt at being flexible without actually achieving flexibility."
good,"Staples gave me the foot in the door I needed for work experience. If you were willing to put in the effort you were bound to get get what you needed out of it. The advancements through the tech department gave me the necessary skills to continue onward towards my goal. "
good,"A typical day was helping the customers with orders and questions"
good,Management was very nice.  A lot of opportunity to always advance in the company.  They were good if you needed time off or needed to go to a dr. appt.
good,"A typical day is spent tending to the needs of customer with Copy & Print requests. I learned a great deal in terms of problem solving, how to deal with deadlines in a hectic environment. I also got the chance to be a supervisor for the department, learning how to lead a team. Coaching and helping my associates grow within the Copy Centre. I also gained a high proficiency with printing and finishing techniques."
good,"with the new supervision, they don't care about what is happening in the store. they don't know how to appreciate  the hardwork and no appreciation nor recognition for their night team. they talk to much without and pretend that they do something. like what the upper management, they focus on their mobile rather than attending the needs of the customers."
good,"There is always a project to be completed, fast paced, and the day goes by quick. I learned something new every day. The customers were nice and always in the market to purchase a product and I feel good helping people making a purchase that they will enjoy."
good,"At Staples, there is always a chance to find a new opportunity that will help you to advance to the next level. Although you may not see a quick path in terms of being promoted within your group, there are plenty of jobs that pop up elsewhere within the company. You will learn a lot at Staples, but like most corporate atmospheres, it can be very cutthroat. You can't expect to have your hand held when it comes to advancement."
good,"Not the worst place to work. Its easy to find something to do. From inventory, to selling merchandise and selling plans, services, etc."
good,I worked as a cashier only and didn't really enjoy this job as I could only cashier and not do anything else. I would have to stay in the cashier area even when their were no customers. I didn't mind checking out the customers but needed to be more challenged. Overall I didn't care for this job.
good,"Staples is a great place to work besides the management and gossiping. Management will pick and choose when to be strict, and employees are constantly gossiping."
good,woking with kids is never the easiest but with patience and creativity these kids were well behaved and loved having me come over
good,Staples has changed over the last couple of years. I would recommend coming into the company as either a Tech Associate or a Copy Center Associate because they offer more money per hour. Opportunities for advancement are more contingent upon one's ability to sell than anything else. If you are looking for full-time do not apply for any associate positions because they're all part-time and do not come with benefits.
good,"To start, the fact that ObamaCare has scared Staples into limiting part timers to only 25 hours is awful. On top of that, managers can get in serious trouble if any part timer goes over 25 hours, but if a full timer goes over 40 and gets overtime, they look the other way. They also have no full time positions except with managerial positions, so unless you are a supervisor or manager, good luck getting full time or anything else."
good,"I was taught management skills, how to work with others, became adept in financial tasks."
good,I have had great management and have been compensated fairly during my time at Staples.  They have just decided to restructure their company and left little room for some employes to continue to grow.
good,"Decent place to work, if your in high school, not a lot a good place if you want to advance your career, maybe because is not as big as before. would recommend it if you just want to work for fun."
good,love the work only part time hrs. nice mgr. fast pace and good training provided to complete job at hand.need more hours and better health and dental benefits
good,Staples is a good company to learn and grow with.  Agents have a lot of tenure and many have been promoted within the company.
good,"fast pass work"
good,"Un bon environnement de travail, mais aucune évolution de carrière."
good,It a typical job for college students who needs the extra money for everyday life. Management will work with you on anything that is needed.
good,"Ajuda no crescimento com profissional e como pessoa"
good,"•	Performed thorough diagnosis on failed computer components/and repaired to ensure customer satisfaction."
good,Staples is struggling with a secular decline in their core business so much of the focus is on cost reduction strategies.
good,Fun atmosphere with Co-workers.  Outdated staffing model has locations severely understaffed.  The day has peaks and valleys of customer activity. Customer service is the best part of the job. Least enjoyable is the store recovery.
good,"good place to work but they ended our shift with a nationwide shut down of all deliveries."
good,"There were alot of confusions on the job and the team i worked with in the department are not the most positive people, they are always yelling and negative but will not make the sacrifices the make things right."
good,"I was told from the beginning there are many advancements from the position I am. As time progressed, I am now being told that they will not hire from my location, regardless of how well I do my job and show that I want to move up. "
good,"My time working at Staples Inc. was a good opportunity to gain sales, customer service, and team working experience. Everyday I went in to work management worked well to give you an outline of what needed to be done around the store. Co-workers were also very helpful and team oriented as well."
good,The company is very confused about what a store should look like.  Every district and region has different standards which gets confusing.
good,"Fellow coworkers are excellent, you become a great work family. However, the higherups don't listen to squat. Don't expect your opinion to get very far."
good,A typical day at work had me receiving freight while also attending to our customers throughout the day. I learned team work and leadership skills along with self management to accomplish store duties. My coworkers were always friendly and loved to talk. The hardest part of the job was for the store as a whole to meet the standards of each digital precept and rewards sign ups per month. The most enjoyable part of the job was being responsible for keeping the store organized and walking the customer to the product they were looking for.
good,"As a Principal Quality Engineer I Coordinate and Plan for manual/automated testing for functional and nonfunctional testing of Apple, Android native apps. and web app. Ensure that offshore and onshore testing resources understand current priorities and are completing and reporting on their testing efforts. Execute and write functional automation scripts using Appium. Keep stakeholders informed of testing status, and provide assessment of deployment readiness. Coordinate crowd-sourced testing activities with Applause (uTest) project manager. Involved in coordinating UAT tests with internal and external sources. Building team at onsite and offshore and mentoring QA resources. Involved in conducting trainings and facilitating QA and cross-functional meetings. Play a role of Scrum master as and when needed."
good,"A typical day at work; check for any pending orders first thing in the morning and complete them right away. Help every single customer that walks in while not getting behind on print orders. Print large posters and mount /cut/laminate them and about different types of paper. How to make business cards , postcards, flyers, etc. Some basic Photoshop. A lot of computer usage."
good,"overall I give it a C+.  The people are great, managers are great, but if you do not like cold calling you will not succeed here."
good,"Great job if you are a college student or looking for part-time work. No opportunities for full-time employment, unless you are in management."
good,"My average day consisted a basic routine. Check to see how close I was to my weekly budget in my different categories. I would then review the schedule to see who I was working with while walking the sales floor for opportunities, most times creating a list. While walking the floor, I would make sure customers were being helped and would say hello to everyone. Finally, I would take a look at inventory that remained from truck. "
good,"I appreciate the leadership skills that I have gained at Staples. I am sure the company is moving in the right direction as it pertains to employee relations and customer relations. The business will grow and afford many opportunities that do not exist at this time,"
good,"Great place to work for the moment, but looking for something in which to advance my career. I handle inventory management, while also dealing directly with the store manager on all issues. I enjoy the people as well as the fast paced environment it takes to work over the course of a day"
good,okay people that try to look out for you just as if you were family
good,"Staples is a great place for aspiring technicians to get their start, as the issues presented are fairly simple and not likely to overwhelm an upstart tech. However, Staples is an office supply store, and not generally known well for having the latest tech. For technicians who want to jump in to the latest and greatest technology, Staples may be too far back of a start, since most computers that come in are fairly older models, and the ones sold by the store tend to be mid-line consumer models, and not the most powerful on the market."
good,Met great co-workers that recruited me to bed bath and beyond.  Hardest part of job was working over night. The most enjoyable part was watching closely how Pat managed us and the skills he used.
good,"Good starting job. If you get the right manager behind you, inspiring you then it is a very tolerable job. However, it can be a bit much some days and the workload can be daunting. If you have the right people, you can do it."
good,Learned something new every day and co-workers fun to work with
good,"Doing excellent customer service,cashier.copy center."
good,My coworkers are very easy to get along with. Our store sees a lot of small business owners who visit out store for the exceptional customer service. It's a small community with good people.
good,"Enjoyed my time at Staples, learned a ton about customer service, the retail environment, and got to know a lot of great people. However, the manager was irritating, and did not follow through with what he said. After being offered a promotion multiple times over the course of a year and a half and a raise of only 14 cents, I decided it was time to move on. Still keep in touch with other co-workers and supervisors however."
good,"•	Ensures that all customer contact as a self priority on every shift, every customer leaves happy."
good,"I loved working at staples for the time that I did, All my co- workers were friendly and it was genuinely enjoyable to work with other employees. Management was wonderful at listening and trying to make the work atmosphere fun with different challenges."
good,a typical day at work is very fast paced & urgent. This was where i learned all that I kno and I would honestly say its been one of my best life experience.
good,"People were great, making delivery deadlines on a consistent basis while overall maintaining a great attitude in an ever changing environment."
good,"good job for a teen wage wise.but great on teaching inventory counting ,freight unloading as well as sorting and restocking using item numbers to make for a well organized in store warehouse. the hardest part of the job was balancing the register with other peoples lunch breaks. My Co workers were awesome and ready to assist where it was needed an i think they were a great part of the experince working there."
good,"Basically, I moved up in this company by making sure I worked hard and took initiative so I could advance. "
good,"Staples was a retail environment focused on offering the full package of general office needs, everything from computers and printers to pens, paper, and shredders.  The staff each was assigned to various departments but many were versed enough in other areas to offer assistance to the customer should a series of questions lead to cross department inquiries.  The job was basic enough in itself, stocking shelves, verifying and changing prices, putting away excess product and assisting customers with any and all needs to the best of our abilities.  What made the store more or less fun was the people with whom you worked.  The job had the benefit of being in the know about new software and hardware as we were often presented with it in advance, but there was little remarkable about the time there.  It was neither a good nor bad situation, generally enjoyable if you don't mind a tedious environment."
good,Staples would be a good place to work for those not looking for advancement. It has little in place for new leadership to blossom. There is little to no bench strength given that they do not develop associates to go to the next level. The pay is very competitive and it is challenging.
good,The work schedule was good when there wasn't mandatory overtime. The pay was also good. Difficult pace to get used to but manageable. They did encourage cross training in different departments when possible. Working extra hard got you recognized and encouraged to advancement. Some managers were good to work for while other only worked for their own advancement at seemingly any cost. The coworkers were nice to work beside and helpful when needed.
good,"Great boss and friends."
good,"Great place to be in terms of the people, not a great place to be if you are not interested in being a ""yes man"", management of people is very inconsistent from manager to manager, department to department.  That being said, if you are working for the right manager, it is a great place to work."
good,"Worked in the field, learned about a variety of small, medium and large businesses.  Management helped drive results, the co-workers where supportive.  The toughest part of the position was replacing clients due to the lack of customer loyalty.  The job work/life balance was the best part of the job."
good,"Great challenge. Quota driven, need more emphasize on the team."
good,Just a normal sales temp job. Helped knowledge grow for IT support with in store and on site break/fixes.
good,Every day is quite straight forward. The hardest aspect of the job is lack of teamwork and accountability. Management has little focus where it should be. The people who work there are friendly and personable. The best part of the job was the people.
good,"I clock in do my inventory duties of the day and cycle count, hop on the cash register when needed and put out crate and stock."
good,"I honestly forget alot about this job.  I was doing stock for Staples, I never had a problem and I got promoted quickly"
good,I enjoy working from home and my coworkers are great.  Unfortunately I am being laid off as of 1/31/2014.
good,"A typical day at work was very pleasant.  All employees were friendly and helpful.  I gained additional knowledge in Excel due to the programs used to complete my duties.  The management was helpful and at times confusing during transition and clarification of additional job responsibilities.  The hardest part of the job was doing the groundwork for new potential positions and after all the organizing, the job would go to another department.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with, they made it very easy to want to come to work and do a good job."
good,"Working retail, what more can I say? has it's ups and downs and takes forver to get a promotion."
good,"Overall, it was a good place to work for students. They are very flexible with school schedules, and accommodate any changes that may occur. My co-workers were great. Through out my time with Staples, there were many different managers at my store. Each manager brought a different approach which changed the experience."
good,A very good launching pad for a career if you are willing to work for it and are surrounded by a staff who sees your work and is willing provide you with guidance throughout. My co-workers were great and I learned a lot about being a business professional through them.
good,Peers are good. Overall a decent place to work. Freedom to make decisions and flexible work schedule when needed.
good,"* co-workers are okay."
good,"Had a fun experience being able to work at Staples Copy Center. Learned a lot of creative and exciting projects such as photo boards, business cards, stamps, and wedding invitations. Management was there to help but wanted you to learn hands on first before they stepped in. It was nice getting the chance to work with the people I did, they taught me a lot about computers and the copy center. The hardest part of the job was being understaffed, staples was always busy and we never had enough associates. Overall, Staples was a good stepping stone in learning customer service skills, run a register, and a great way to multi task."
good,"A day at Staples was a fast paced enviroment. We greet all of our customers. Make goals for the day (everyday), such as sales & promotions.And we would execute them through out our day as a team."
good,"I come in and go to the warehouse where I bring product that came off the truck and stock it on the shelves. I assemble furniture, help customers in person and on the phone as needed. I create inventory lists and fill empty shelves. I became more confident in my ability to talk to people. I've had a mix of coworkers from overachievers to slackers. The hardest part is when someone asks me something I don't know and I can't get them a solid answer. My favorite part of the job is putting furniture together."
good,"Stock product, help customers, sell products with attatchments, fix computers, clean up, manage inventory"
good,"Opportunity to learn many different skills while working here. Close group of associates as there are only about 30 of us altogether, including our 3 managers. Focus on team building and building relationships."
good,My customers are great and I have a blast with them while activating their new phones and during the class I teach I always have them laughing and vice versa
good,"I made a ton of copies for the customers that came in.  During the holidays I put together calendars and greeting cards.  Management was good.  They understood I had a responsibility to take care of at home, if I couldn't make it to work.  The co-workers helped me as much as they could, when management couldn't  "
good,"A typical day at work involves providing excellent customer service, counting inventory, and setting up displays for merchandise."
good,"On a typical day when I have everything more or less done I am engaging with customers. I have built some strong relationships over the years. No matter how busy or how much I have to do, I always make time for all customers.They are my first priority. I enjoy working with my co workers. We meet outside of work for trivia and grub about once a month at BWW. I've had 4 different mangers and I've liked them all. The hardest part of my job would have to be moving a pallet of cases of paper off the truck. It's almost impossible for me to do. The most enjoyable part of my job would be the people that I have met that took the time to teach me new things. "
good,"I was a cashier, customer service and sales and I enjoyed working with the customers and helping with the customers problems or order"
good,working at the company is a pleasure and you will learn a lot of great things to help u progress within the company.
good,Enjoyed working there and meeting different kind of people from different businesses 
good,Not a bad place to work expectations are clearly spell out and achievable if you work hard.
good,"Very busy days, new technologies and devices, good coworkers."
good,"I was hired on seasonally and continued on for a bit longer. It's a simple job, takes little to no specialized skills, and the pay is low. They don't try to sugar coat it however. It is what it is. In my experience the people there, management included, were great."
good,"I was a cashier and a customer service rep, I handle customer complaints and orders and also did retail and sales for our products in the store"
good,"Typical Retail.High expectations, Limited Payroll. A typical day at work. You can spend the bulk of your day covering breaks and lunches for your associates and one assistant manager."
good,"Staples is a very sound and successful company that will bring out the salesman in you, and it was fun. Its low pay however, means its not a forever home."
good,"I'm sure this is more and more common in the retail field anymore, but working for Staples presses many of my most sensitive buttons when it comes to sales and services."
good,"Work day consists of SALES, SALES and SALES!!"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of developing outside sales reps, field rides, ensuring quota's were met and creating sales results through lead generation and winning business."
good,It was a great company to work for. helped me develop aggressive sales skills which went on to help me in furthering my career
good,Job is a regualr 8 to 5 with overtime if allowed which is optional and they do give you notice ahead of time.
good,"Staples is a fun place to work. Awesome co- workers, drama free environment."
good,"The management of the store is near top notch in terms of know-how and being able to handle customers and employees. Scheduling is completely random in terms of days and hours, no organizational patterns what-so-ever, making it excessively difficult to ever plan ahead, take part in a secondary job, or even take part in activities in your personal life. They offer benefits for pretty much everything, however menial the offerings might be. They take pride in values, customer satisfaction is excessively high with the associates."
good,I enjoyed to work in Staples but they had no fulltime position that time for me. Worked just 3 months.
good,"Operated material handling equipment to move product within the warehouse.Performed various receiving functions, such as unloading trucks and putting away product in the correct overstock locations.Worked as a team member by interacting and communicating with fellow associates in a cooperative, constructive manner."
good,"Meeting new customers and always busy. I've learned that you always should keep a smile on your face no matter what. Management was pretty good, co-workers were great. The hardest part of the job is making sure the job dosen't over work you."
good,Lot of oppurtunity to learn in handling customer service.
good,"Pick and pack orders for customers. No air in the summer and never turn the heat on in the winter. Summers are miserable. I didnt really learn much here, after all you just pack orders. Management was ok if you were their favorite. Co-workers are starting to get younger and younger, and lazier and lazier!!! The hardest part of the job is dealing with people who did not help others and let you struggle. The enjoyable part was the pay!!!"
good,"go in, help out customers, and provide best service i can. learned how to work a cash register. the managers where reasonable with days off. co workers where very nice. hardest part was doing many things at once. most enjoyable was interacting with customers"
good,Unpaid lunch break even if you have been working for 8 hrs straight. The managers were reasonably acceptable. There is not much room fro a creative person. One is trained to do as they say as if their method were the absolute truth.
good,"I have learned a lot at my time working at staples. I have excelled in knowledge in many different types of technologies such as computers, printers, hard drives, trouble shooting, scanners, copiers, phones and many others."
good,Utilize rf and pick to light wrist scanner. Ensure warehouse guidelines are met to provide accuracy and product fulfillment to customers.
good,"Staples is a great place to work if you have other obligations such as school or kids. I have been working here for about 5 years( June 27). The main reason I am still here is for the benefits. I work part time as many people are so don't expect to get full time unless someone leaves. You have to be cross trained. I work in the copy center, but I answer electronics, office supply, and all types of calls along with being a cashier when they get backed up. I think the hardest part is not having many workers which requires you to do more work and start to loathe being there because the pay doesn't change much. The best part of my job is being left alone to do what I need to do without management hoovering over me."
good,Great atmosphere with many different levels of authority. Everybody is friendly and truely wants you to succeed.
good,Staples is a good place to work for a short period of time.
good,*A typical day at staples is like being around family. Comfortable environment and great management.
good,Staples has good pay with great benifits. This company is all over the United States as well as abroad meaning it has a lot of power in receiving lower cost for great products. Founded in 1986 Staples has become the priemier office supply store for small business in the United States.
good,I love everybody who works there. We were a big family and we worked together like one. But I had too much pressure and stress on my job and got overloaded very often because I always had to help others with their jobs and never received any help back wether it was from the bosses or the employees. The stress was too much for my low salary
good,It was an alright place to work. At times you are severely overworked and understaffed.
good,"The environment of Staples is very laid back and relaxed, as it's not an incredibly busy store, but the management is fickle and they have no problem with slashing your hours with no prior notice."
good,Ok place to work but pay is on the lower end of the competitive scale. Upper management is out of touch with what actually occurs for middle management at the store level and micromanages via emails constantly. Talent pool is small and not impressive because of how low the starting pay is for part time employees so team building and coaching is a challenge.
good,"I like how I greet and had great communication with the customers but I don’t think Staples was the the job for me. The new manager that was transfer to the Staples I was working at, she wasn’t really training me well."
good,"Stimulating team cooperation between all departments (service, tech, aisles, and copy). On occasion required to assist in other departments, resulting in the acquiring of various skills/knowledge from each. Management consideration for balance of school and work load is very understanding and accommodating. Constant customer exposure can be draining but for the most part rewarding encountering and connecting with new individuals. Goals are set before a day of work begins, which also attributes to the rewarding factor."
good,"Staples is a fun and friendly work environment. Some of the things you learn at this job is how to sell. The main thing to do at the job is sell. Protections plans, printer,and more."
good,"Pros:"
good,"It is a fair place to work provided the income is not to bad but management needs a overhaul. "
good,"Staples is a great job, if you aren’t planning to make a career of it. Understaffed, and the hiring process is so strict, most applicants can’t get past the entry test to even get an interview which adds to the understaffed issue. Long hours, base pay, meh insurance, and Staples has been bought and sold so many times I don’t even know who owns the company any more. All business decisions are made in an office in Somewhere, USA, they never ask employees about how things are going so when changes are implemented they are clunky, useless and often add stress to the already ridiculous amount of tasks already in place. Prepare for a life of frustration at Staples."
good,"It’s a decent place for college students, you can get flexible hours and work what you need to, but the pay is low for the amount of work you need to do and coworkers aren’t always the greatest."
good,3.5 stars its okay its not bad but its also not the best there are times where there is alot to do and not many people or too many people and not alot to do it all depends on the day.
good,"Staples isn't the best but not the worst. I wouldn't recommend for anyone looking for full time. I worked there during High School, so it wasn't bad. management wasn't the greatest, but they helped if you needed it. I worked the copy and print department and it was good. High pressure, and very little assistance if something happened."
good,"Not a bad place to work. Very friendly staff, very nice managers, work with the employees as far as flexibility. Can be difficult at times but overall it's a good experience I've learned a lot from."
good,it was a balance of meetings and interaction on the floor. very numbers driven. struggling with retaining associates. support departments struggled with meeting the needs in the field.
good,"Leadership is about making others better, and I can truly say staples is about the community and putting our facility first. As a result of your presence, and making sure the impact lasts in your absence."
good,Staples is a great place to get started in the Inside Sales industry. The culture is great and the people there are great to work with. What I appreciate the most about Staples is the work life balance offered.
good,"Pay and benefits was what I liked about working there.  Everyone who’s been there for a long time gets along with each other and team up on new employees if one dislike him or her, the whole team does the same and that’s including the higher ups (management, hr, office people, etc....). Lots of drama no matter if they’re guys or girls... too much gossip.  It’s a big company or warehouse with over 100 employees in that location."
good,"You do what ever they tell you to do on that day. It could be a large shipment just came in so your doing stocking. Maybe were low on hitting sales goals or we have a high traffic day, then you will push for sales."
good,I've been in retail for a long time and have worked at various retailers. Staples for the most part is an okay place to work at. The only down side is if you're looking for a full time position this wouldn't be the place for you. Full time positions are usually only available to supervisors/managers. In July/August is our back to school rush. Back to School sales are equivalent to black friday for Staples. Those two months are the busiest and we usually are slammed during those times.
good,"Coworkers had a “throw you to the wolves” training mentality and it made working there stressful. Tried to have a fixed schedule because of health reasons, yet the managers never wanted to talk about it. Managers would talk about workers not doing their job properly to people working with them. Coworkers were helpful if you met them on a good day, otherwise expect to DIY and learn the system with no one teaching you. Apply and work there if you want the job. Back to school season aka the summer is the perfect time to get in some hours."
good,"My store's success decreased in the 10 years that I worked there, due mostly to insufficient staffing. Applicants who would work for the offered wages did not always have the proper skills, and those with the proper skills often would not accept the low wages. Management always came across as caring for the welfare of their employees within company limits. Good opportunity to learn basics of sales culture. Many cross-trained positions offered fresh work activity year round. Many changes in management personnel at multiple levels made building fruitful work relationships difficult for associates and leads. Very good opportunity to build customer engagement skills."
good,a typical day involves helping customers resetting planograms and talking with my boss about why we aren't hitting the metrics her boss set for her which is where most of the stress comes from
good,"This is a good company to work for, they do train you if you have no experience so there is nothing to worry about. I worked for the Staples in Jersey City, New Jersey, Hudson mall. Great managers and work environment."
good,"Training (4 weeks) was almost completely unused within 6 months.  Entire training staff and curiculum is now completely gone.  "
good,"Staples is great because I get to interact with the public, give great customer service, solve challenges, keep busy with other task, and be creative."
good,Many different departments with very different views and approaches to work ethic from each. Led to confusion for those who cross trained between one or more but allowed for experience in dealing with many unique responsibilities.
good,"Never had a bad experience with a co-worker, but unruly customers were a near daily occurence."
good,"A typical day at Staples I guess was what could be expected from working as a Sales Associate -- I mostly directed customers to products or handled returns over the phone. I felt that management, and my work culture in general, was more positive than other stores, gauging from my coworkers experiences. I often had difficult time finding things in the store do to a bit of disorganization. On top of that it was sort of difficult to reach sales goals due to the monitor at the front often reading people coming in twice or theft from the homeless in the area."
good,"Staples is a great place to work to learn more about the balance of brick & mortar and eCommerce. Entry level jobs up to middle management can be very routine. You will have the same tasks week after week, so I change of pace was always looked for."
good,"Learnt a lot about how to sell, Different was to interact with customers, importance of a team, importance of planning for a project ahead of time and many other things."
good,"Staples is a great place to work mainly for younger people who need a part time job.  Management seems to be able to work around schedules with school or a secondary job, but only allows 25 hours or less a week due to government regulation."
good,Well what can i say but this; if you need a part time job and deal well with customers this is the place for you but besides that don't expect to get a career path from working here
good,"Deliver furniture and office supplies to customers’ homes and offices."
good,good place to work but they were going through a lot of changes and were outsourcing a lot of the delivery work.  good place to work once its settled.
good,"It depends on the manager at the store but Staples in Casselberry, FL was great once there was a manager who actually cared about the people. There are the normal disagreements but overall a great experience."
good,I had great conversations with customers about what they were going to buy. telling them my experience on some items I actually brought. Had great customer telling me I was a good helper. It was really a calm place to be in and learn about how to be an Associate
good,"Warehouse production. quality control, growth capability, good salary with great benefits. Great company communication. Employee Appreciation. Great hours of operations."
good,"Management and workers felt like family, and properly maintained the store. Felt fulfilling when able to get jobs done for business associates in a timely manner."
good,"Their sales practices are very useful and they provide a good environment to gain sales experience.  "
good,"As with any corporation job, numbers are everything. If your store isn't making numbers then you can expect less hours less product and more unhappy customers."
good,"Classic retail sales experience while also being a technical consultant for both individuals and businesses. Client interactions are mostly positive. The position does require you to either be interested or willing to learn about the technical/IT field."
good,"Working daily with managers to achieve company metrics ."
good,"In this Job your responsible to deliver product to customers, on a timely fashion. management is not that organized but there's a lot of opportunity to interact with customer and find your potential career through Staples clients."
good,"help support my team in sales.helped coached and developed. not a bad place to work nice easy schedule. great place to work."
good,"There is a good culture here if you are lucky to be on a team that accepts it. Like any large corporation, the benefits vary from team to team. The hardest part is priorities shifting every single day. It is difficult to stay on track with fire drills running constantly."
good,This is an amazing job. I have loved it as long as I’ve been here. However after 4 years of loyalty they are still unwilling to take me on full time. There is a revolving door culture with employees. Management won’t offer the job security and advancement that many people are looking for. Don’t work for staples if you want to advance your career because they won’t do anything for you there.
good,"It was an okay job. helped customers day in and day out, always provided optimal customer service even though customers were rude. Managers were very helpful."
good,Staples Inside Sales was a great team. Account managing was fun! They had great managers. Staples has laid off lots of people. Always cutting positions.
good,The management at the Staples I worked at was very relaxed. The job itself came with minimal stress mainly balancing customer service and online orders.
good,"Great environment, many skills and trade can be learned and be helpful in future employment. Job advancement and cross-training is possible. Many employee perks also available"
good,"Bon employeur, bonne équipe et bonnes conditions de travail."
good,"The best thing about working with Staples is the flexible schedule, great part time job for students or if you have a second job. The pay is very low (15 cents over min wage) and not a lot of performance based rewards. Also not a lot of room for growth within the company. Managers were friendly and is a welcoming environment. Work with a lot of great people, however there is a very high turnover rate and a lot of new people on a monthly basis, which led store being understaffed frequently.  Great job if you like doing sales and learn a lot of new things."
good,"Staples based on my experience has been B- retail experience. Definitely one of my better retail jobs I've had. The pay to start is decent ($9.70 was my starting hourly wage). My biggest problem is there is high incentive on product add-ons. Commission without personal compensation is a big thing at Staples. Product plans, customer surveys and store services are some of things literally shoved down customers throat thanks to how aggressive corporate is. "
good,"I only worked there for one summer and I did Easy Tech. The managers where OK, but not the best. It was an OK summer job though, but I wouldn't want to work there long-term"
good,"Poor pay, no benefits or paid time off or sick pay, great part-time job to have during school, managers were always very respectful of my school schedule, very friendly staff and managers; family environment"
good,"My first job out of high school began as technology sales associate and was later promoted to resident tech. Staples is a great place for learning customer service skills, sales techniques and to be confident in your self. The staff was very friendly and work was generally fun. Back to school is hectic but that is to be expected. The fact that there is only real room for promotion if you want to go into management and poor salaries lead to high turnover so you will find yourself relied on to provide training by management pretty quickly. Some disconnect between management and employees because some of the management salaries are based on commission and performance bonuses where the associates are entirely salary. Recommend for students as hours are flexible."
good,"I worked easy tech part-time for a few months. It was as expected, a retail position: fast paced, random customers and getting familiar with facing customers. It was a good learning experience."
good,"Staples was an okay place to work at compared to other companies,at points it was very slow but it was a blast with your team. The best time is around back to school time where you remain  busy."
good,"Certain times of the year are extremely busy: back to school and Christmas. Other times, it can be very slow. There are many competitors online with whom Staples competes. It requires staff to research each customer claim to verify their claims and match the competitor's prices."
good,"Overall in the business side things are good.  On the retail side things are more stressful.  Sales are always stressful, retail is harder on the body also."
good,"As a customer service representative you learn to communicate with the customer on many levels (Point of sales, sales-floor, telecommunication, and on-site installations with EasyTech). The positions are part-time, but scheduling is flexible and fosters essential customer service skills that will take you to the next level."
good,I work my butt off each day to make sales and get everything done operationally that i can but there is just so much that the company asks for that its hard to get it all done in a 40 hour work week. Once you feel like your heading in the right direction cooperate piles another metric that you have to focus on each week along with the other 10 things they want tracked. Other than that being an associate is easy and a great job. Management is lacking in pay severely and endures a lot of stress.
good,the environment at staples is pretty calm most of the time. The people who work there can also be fun and pleasant. the one negative thing I can say is that for some reason I can almost never get any true hours.
good,"Learned a great deal about sales, and everything that goes into making and completing a transaction in a business to business environment. Typical day at work was cold calling, over the phone and in person to get meetings; creating and researching new businesses for potential sales leads. Sending and responding to emails, etc. "
good,"Coming in everyday I would help out customers with tech and non related tech questions. Do retail. Sale computers and fix them such as removing hard drives, screens, CPUs etc."
good,"The job itself wasn't so bad (diagnosing, fixing, and selling computers is surprisingly straight-forward), but was often called to other departments not even remotely related, or near, my workstation. Got to the point that assembling chairs took precedent over fixing the computers, and would impede MY progress."
good,"This job is excellent if you wish to get into retail, great wy to get a feel of what it is like. Unfortunately the management at the store I was at, was not great, they didn’t really help out, they would just point fingers and then sit in the office on their phones. A lot of heavy lifting was required, chairs and tables and the heavy printers. The pay was prety low for the amount of work we had to do. We weren’t really allowed to be in the same aisle as the other associates or stay near the front because it would be a “waste of time” even if the store was empty and everything assigned to us was done."
good,"I worked there for 11 years. I was content until my 10th year. I became unhappy with one of the systems they had decided to implement prematurely. This was in 2014 mind you. So maybe the bugs are gone.. but I really don't know. If you want a plain old customer service job with lots of lateral training that you don't get raises for, then this job is for you. There are other positions available in the center, but they have WAY more responsibility with not as much compensation as one would expect. It was not worth it to me.. but someone else may have a different perspective."
good,Too many changes over the past 2 years with no clear direction and change management has been handled poorly by senior leadership. Dying industry in a super competitive environment.
good,I've met a lot of great people here in staples. Overall it is not a bad place to work at. I have obtain a reasonable amount of knowledge but now I feel stuck. I am not learning barely anything new and I am not receiving any training for new machines or any what  so ever. I am 23 and I need to work for a company that I can grow in.
good,"Typical day at Staples was a challenge but reward all wrapped up into one shift! The biggest challenge was keeping at times 100+ team members focused on one common goal. My experience at staples taught me the power of influence. No matter what product  your shipping, your success will be measured by your ability to motivate people to work together for one common goal. I believe it is the primary job of any operations supervisor."
good,The atmosphere was welcoming but it started becoming a problem when my area was short staffed and they didn’t want to hire more people. It was a stressful workload to have on one person and it got to a point where about 4 people was dropped from the area at once! And the manager isn’t all that professional.
good,It was really enjoyable to work in an environment where you would be  creating projects for the client and seeing the finished works come to fruitition.
good,"Learned to manage ongoing changes during the day.  Taking new direction from several managers at once, always coaching associates.  Measuring service levels and adjusting personal to fill in ques."
good,"Good Work Culture, as long as you do your job you should be fine."
good,Cashier for lobby and my typical day at Staples was putting items away to make sure the store does not get to messy. The hardest part of the job was during back to school season because the lines would be very long. We would have to work in a very fast pace and some customers had problems with pricing of items.
good,"Number 1 is customer service as needed, do a pull list and start filling merchandise, do BOPIS's buy on line, pick-up in store, do damages, open or close store, make deposits, lock-up"
good,"Muchos cambios durante mi estadia, objetivos poco claros."
good,"Supervisors were reasonable to anything. Really easy going job where everyone gets along well with each other. It's a little tough to get some help from everyone, but the job can be done regardless if you fall behind a little. Supervisors will reason and work with you to which shift and position you want to work. It's an okay place to start off if you want some warehouse experience."
good,"Worked there for 21.5 Years and would still be there.  My entire team was let go.  "
good,"Staples was an okay job for a college student. Flexible hours were given to help balance work, school, and everyday life. There was no advancement opportunities, which caused high turnovers."
good,"Staples is a okay place to work. They could inprove upon the system they work out of in Special Order.  Too many processes to get to the end result."
good,The people who you will work with at the greenfield store are mostly incredible. But you will be constantly frustrated by the demands of corporate and the upper management.
good,Employees would get straight to work no questions asked. I learned to be more focused while working here. The energy is very positive as well as the customers. Hardest part is moving the heavy items but other than that its a great place to work.
good,"I love my job at Staples very much, it pays well and has fantastic benefits. The working environment is great, as well. The actual job is not very hard, once you learn the various systems that they use."
good,"Nice serving customers.  Back room warehousing too tight.  Receiving days too intense, with trucks packed with pallets far too high.  Middle management under too much pressure"
good,"Veel geleerd bij Staples Advantage."
good,"As with most retail positions, you are constantly required to do more with less resources.  The job is fast paced and requires a lot of energy, both mentally and physically, in order to accomplish required selling goals.  I learned a lot about people during my time here; the good, the bad, and the ugly.  Retail takes a special kind of person who is able to roll with the punches and not take things personally.  But the customers are also what makes the job enjoyable."
good,this is a great starter job for anyone who has never worked or for the individual that just wants something to do in there spare time. Although the store can be quite at times there is still lots to learn and the staff here in nc are great
good,"i loved working at staples had so much room to move to what ever position i wanted it was great management, great pay, and room to expand to any position."
good,"The Assistant manager of my location is horrible. Refuses to learn anything from the easy tech or print and marketing department, will rush customers out of the store 10 min. until close, will complain if we're not out of the store 5-10 min. after closing and has been the main reason many have left our store."
good,"The managers are very nice and they are really understanding of time conflicts and things like that, but in my experience you could see as little as 4 hours a week for part timers even if you are doing a good job."
good,"Load truck for deliveries and make deliveries."
good,"There are always good and bad days at work, but if you do one thing wrong or say one wrong thing, those ""some"" bad days can turn into constant bad days. You have to be on your toes and unless you do things perfectly, you will be watched like a hawk."
good,If you don't mind some manual and tedious labor this is a good fit. I had to work the floor before I was allowed to touch the tech bench for 6 months. They will not pay you though what you are worth in any field related to Staples. If your looking to make a descant pay this is not for you. This company is good for anyone who needs a 1st time job.
good,The American Tubing along with the ASAP Staff personnel are both side reliable people. I vote that they are the best person I have ever meet in the United States
good,"Overall, Staples is a good place to work. You get to learn different techniques and you get to meet a lot of different kinds of people. Depending on the store location, the job culture is decent."
good,Staples is a good company to work for when you are first starting out at a younger age. It is by no means a career unless your are the manager of the store.
good,"Overall the staff is great, the management is ok. I was fired with a week left in my 3 month because from what I believe is that they didn't want to pay for my benefits.I did really enjoy working in the position I was in. If I was was asked to come back to work in the position I was in I would......"
good,Staples does offer a lot to associates from sick time to paid time off to benefits for anyone. They are extremely focused on sales first and foremost while not wanting to spend money to make money and stores suffer for this. Corporate expects much from the store without an understanding of day to day inside the stores.
good,"Upper corporate management needs to adjust the process in the store. There aren't enough people scheduled in the morning and between the hours of 2pm-8pm, more hours and better trained employees are needed. Employees are not happy and are leaving due to customer complaints about customer service. Staples needs to devote more time to taking care of customers instead of constantly rearranging the store to confuse the customer. Working people are busy people, they don't want to roam around the store looking for stuff, if they have bought it there before they will check the same spot. People get to frustrated looking for everything and unable to find it, so they go to wal-mart instead."
good,"O trabalho diário é muito intenso, com a gestão de equipa e tarefas diárias, sem perder o foco no atendimento ao cliente que é a principal função desde a abertura da loja até ao fecho."
good,"- Always projects available to do "
good,"I love the people I work with but the company as a whole doesn't give you the tools to be successful. I was originally hired to be the Easy Tech Supervisor, but with stipulations. I was given 30 days to prove it only to be lied to and given a part time position. I was only applying for management jobs but they did some shady things. Completed the 30 days with the understanding that I was the supervisor only to find out they brought in someone from another store. I had to work my way to full-time. Not the first person they did that to. The people are a joy to work with but upper management has no clue what our days are like."
good,"I worked at Staples about one year. I didn't have much complaint except that my fellow employees were allowed to smell like seed and cigarettes on the job, and that I thought one specific employee deserved a promotion over another that the manager liked."
good,"Working at Staples, Improved my communications skills with the customers and organization due to shelving products in order"
good,"I worked at Staples from 2010-2014 and held about 4-5 different positions throughout my time. I was really glad I could apply for new positions so that I wouldn't get bored and want to leave. But many managers seemed like they were micro-managing, and overall the atmosphere was pretty negative from coworkers. Not many were happy to be there, many had been there for YEARS, and we were crammed in like sardines. And then they started outsourcing."
good,"Bonne ambience de travail, bonne condition de travail, possibilité d'avancement ou de bonus de performance. Je ne peux en dire plus, remplacement de maladie de 2 mois"
good,"The co-workers were one of the best parts of the job. The hardest part was having to work overtime, then feeling like you were in trouble for working overtime."
good,"The job is going well, I am learning more everyday about handling sales and organizing multiple tasks. Everyone are great people as well."
good,"While pay, and scheduling are about what you should expect from a retail employment, the crew and management were excellent to work with and professional."
good,a typical day at work was adjustable. I learned how to multi task and prioritize within a certain period of time. As far as management with staples its mediocre. Co-workers were very helpful with training. The hardest part of the job was putting away returned items before after we were closed. The most enjoyable part of the job was conversations with the customers. I'm a people person. yes the do offer benefits
good,"A great place to work if you are starting out in the sales field, good training, great benefits.  Managers will do everything to help you and a top notch training process"
good,Basically worked with a small team regardless of the shift I worked.  We really needed twice as much as what we had to effectively pull together to succeed.  It has its ups and downs and it really shouldn't be that way.  The job/company has potential but there always seems to be something holding us back.  It is nice to help customers find what they need and answer questions that they have though.  The hardest part of the job is by far the lack of a full staff.  I've learned how to manage my team and figure out ways to multitask during my time at Staples.
good,"What I learned from Staples: "
good,"Typical day was moderately to very busy. Learned many things about office supplies, and the types of materials available for offices in general. Management was good, but I felt like they are a tad bit under staffed with managers. All of my co workers were easy to get a long with, and I greatly enjoyed working with them. Hardest part of the job was being short staffed to be honest. Many associates would get stuck helping a customer find something they needed, and if not that something similar enough to help them. Most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers, and other associates."
good,It was a good place to learn more skills that can help you in maybe someones professional career. A typical day you would just go straight to work once you are trained everyone does everything alone. I learned a lot of ways to promote small to big businesses and met a lot of great cooperations that I help make their business blossom.
good,"Great but busy environment with easy going people to work with. As Staples - huge company we believe in team work, but never forget about developing as an individual."
good,"The work load is managable, co workers are friendly, open from 10 - 7. Management is super cool, have to keep yourself busy or you'll be bored."
good,I pretty much select product in the Breakpack module. I put the product in a tote and push the tote on the conveyor belt. Then the tote is then sent to a machine that stacks the totes on a pallet to be  loaded on a shipping truck.
good,"Management was good, coworkers are great people. The hardest part of the job is the schedule, which starts you out at 1:30pm-10pm. It may work for some, and for others it might not."
good,Staples has been an excellent Job while attending school. They have worked with my school schedule and were willing to give me the needed time off to study for exams. The were very supportive of my move to complete school.
good,"I like working for staples the only thing that i would like to change is the pay and the hours they give to employees."
good,"Check reports, emails, make sure payroll was updated, check map communications, plus goals for the day, open the system and registers, do a small rally meeting talk to the opening staff and prepare them for the business day. Designate task to the staff and follow up with them as the day went by, and always be sure to maintain the customer service part of the business intact for the entire day."
good,"Job responsibilities consist of running  the copy and print department making sure production is a success. Other job duties were completing customer orders upon request via email, phone, and customer walk-in.  Contacting customers who are contracted with Staples and making sure jobs are done and customers are satisfied. Keeping aware of revenue and ordering supplies for the department and staying within the store budget. Other responsibilities were to be knowledgeable of frequent changes within the company and making sure associates are informed and trained to be able to produce at any time when needed. Also handling accounts receivable, making sure clients and customers were caught up on balances due. Other job duties consisted of mail merging and data entry. Taking care of UPS shipments and making sure packages were packed and secured to ensure packages would reach destination without being damaged."
good,A typical day at DHL Express included fast paced ramp operations to expedite the loading and unloading of freighter aircrafts. Ensuring proper completion of documents and loading shipments into appropriate locations. Employees are separated into several crews to work in specific areas of the operation. We learn how to work in a team environment and collaborate with other employees to get the assignments and tasks completed as a collective unit. The hardest part of the job is the physical labor especially during short staffing. High turnover rate because of the late night and graveyard work hours especially for new hires because they work the whole weekend.
good,I only worked there for half a year but I felt like I worked there for longer. Great coworkers and supervisors. The work was not too hard and easy to learn. I liked helping customers who were in need.
good,"Staples as a company I am certain varies from store to store, however I can confidently say that the team at the Ithaca store builds a strong friendly work environment where it is easy to voice opinions and enjoy yourself while performing tasks and helping customers."
good,Get to help each other out on a regular basis. Work with customers to improve their experiences. Management also a help with issues
good,"The people are awesome, unfortunately this type of retail store is not going to last for much longer. Buying out Office Depot is just a band-aide to much deeper rooted issues facing this company."
good,"A typical day at Staples very busy for a manager, leading the sales, the customer sales culture, making sure to drive all Corporate initiatives. From directing all the Store Operations to oversee Inventory Control, Shrink Control, Truck, In stock, End caps, Store Maintenance and Keeping  a high level of Standards."
good,Management is good and very knowledgeable. I love my co-workers they are what make the job fun and exciting.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with unruly and nasty customers at times.  The most enjoyable part is when you get customers who love the work you've done.
good,"Great associates and management staff. The business was very slow  "
good,"Fast paced, always moving and busy. Helping customers find product or solutions for their needs. Cashier and assisting customers and other staff.  Great customers and staff, always a pleasure to be around.  Most enjoyable part is the interactions with a different variety of customers and searching out solutions to any issue. Hardest part of the job is leaving on time."
good,They are a good company to work for but advancement was unlikely because they always hired outside of the business. I did manage however to train in every department and was in the management program.
good,Staples is a wonderful company to start as a teen. I didn't get much out of cashiering but once I made my move into the copy center I learned a lot. It is not an easy job as I'm often responsible for a large amount of work. I've gained a lot of knowledge while working in the department I'm in right now. I've had several different managers and all of them have been great and helpful. I thoroughly enjoy the presence and company of most of my coworkers. As great as Staples is and has been both to me and for me it is not the place I want to see myself at for very much longer. I don't feel like the amount of work I do everyday is reflected in the amount of money that I make.
good,"Very long days!!"
good,"I love the people with whom I work, this also includes the management team. However I am in need of more hours and except for back to school season, it seems as though the hours are harder to get. Great experience for a a first job or for part time."
good,management could have been better but it was overall a good working environment
good,"A typical day at work was helping a customer diagnose their computer issues and recommend the best course of action to repair the PC.  When that was done there is normally freight to put away from the weekly truck we get, so I would try to run that to the floor as fast as possible.  My co-workers are great and are always willing to help me or ask for help.   Management side of the store was dependable but the was a severe lack of organization with scheduling.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers understand their PC better and helping them get the most out of it,"
good,A lot of fun dealing with new technology.  Not fun dealing with fixing computers.
good,Was hired to help set up the distribution warehouse for the go live date. The hardest part of the job was in the beginning when there wasn't specific jobs set up yet. Third shift stocking was easy to learn and you always had enough work to keep you busy all night.
good,"very little room to advance in company, low wages , unreliable hours"
good,I was working there for 76 days and they let me go because i didn't fit their work environment. They give all new associates 90 days to work there and if they don't like you they lay you off!
good,"Coworkers and middle management are friendly, and fun to work with. The Store Manager is a jerk, and hard to get along with. During my employment, there were multiple employees that left for other jobs specifically because of the Store manager. The compensation/ pay is very low with no benefits."
good,"A great job in one of the high volume locations, but very difficult with staffing and management restrictions in lower volume locations.  The company has been shifting focus for the last few years, which makes priorities and expectations confusing throughout all levels of communication."
good,"Hitting daily targets, dealing with customers and retaining an excellent customer service at all times, learning how to deal with difficult situations and dealing with problems on a regular basis. Getting along with all my co-workers to maintain good relationships to put to positive results. Hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult customers who question some situations when working to strict policy. Most enjoyable part of the job is making customers happy with their experience with us and making them know that we're there to help them with whatever it is they may need."
good,"Welcoming, Assisting Fortune 500 companies with payments. Daily posting of cash and collection activities"
good,"Customers are friendly and the store is located in a friendly hamlet. There is never a boring day, from researching a product for customers, to filling isles and maintaining a clean storefront."
good,"For my job in particular, there just wasnt enough support to help promote the fact that staples sold cell phones. Atleast not at my location. I set up tables in the front of the store collected customer information made flyers and cards but the store themselves never put a big ad in the window or anything of that nature  after awhile I felt like I was harassing customers. Constantly calling them and forcing conversation in the store"
good,Co workers were nice. Management was great and really flexible.
good,The environment is boring. I would recommend Staples Corporate to an older individual. 40+
good,Overall great colleagues.  Growth of company and possibilities for advancement are poor.
good,Poor compensation. Under staffed. Great spirited employees filled with enthusiasm who work to help customers receive the best customer service possible
good,An okay place to work.  Sometime it can be fun and other can be a nightmare
good,THE only thing they need help on is the poor management. I loved the people and the good money. overall I was happy there but got let go unexpectanly
good,"Sales"
good,"My days there are pretty straight-forward. I show up for work, straighten the floor, greet customers, and sell protection plans."
good,"Fast-paced environment with never a dull moment ranging from customer document solutions, production inquiry, custom product design, UPS drop-off center and office mega-store keeps me quite busy. Everyday is a learning experience with figuring most effective cost and/or solution to customers vision. It is a very team oriented environment given the many retail items services availability. The most difficult part of the job would be equipment failure or maintaining unrealistic turn-times. The most enjoyable aspect of the job is exceeding customer expectations and early completion of work orders."
good,Staples is an ok place to work. The hours are great and the schedules are flexible for people with second jobs or who are in College. Some of the rules are fairly ridiculous and upper management can be close-minded.
good,"As a sales manager the responsibilities are staff scheduling, coaching and store operations. Store operation include cash managment, employee safety, customer service, inventory control, ans sales."
good,"A typical day at work was helping customers finding merchandise and making sales. I learned people skills, computer skills and how to be a team-player. Managmwnt was understanding of my schedule at the time. My co-workers were great team-players and easy to work with.the hardest part of the job was explaining to customers if a product wasnt in stock. The most enjoyable part of this job was the smiling customers and seeing new and old faces daily."
good,The pay rate is pretty decent for those who have little experience. The managers are very helpful and knowledgeable.
good,"Technician job includes services to hardware and software of PCs, sales of technology, and inventory management.  Optional duties include on-site services for installations and diagnostics."
good,"It takes a long time to become a full-time employee and the raises aren't that great, ideal job to supplement other income."
good,Great place to work especially if your a student. Typical work day will include helping many different types of people with different products. Need to have a vast knowledge of not just school supplies but also technology and how to use it to benefit the customer. Management can use some help because they are looked upon very strongly they are always under the gun of losing their jobs. I think if management had a better chance of helping us become better and also be more available we would have a better experience working their. Job can get difficult sometimes because you can be helping somebody with a specific product but then somebody needs help with another smaller product you need to learn to multi-task. Job has a lot of learning experience because you meet so many different people with different problems everyday so you learn how to deal with the problems and become better at it each day. The best part of the job would be the people you meet I think it makes everything just better.
good,"A typical day consisted of catering to customers electronic and office supply needs. I helped restock inventory, check people out as a cashier, and ship packages via UPS. I learned about time management, teamwork, and working with customers. The work environment and co-workers was very positive and I have networked with a lot of people from OU and through Athens and Dayton, OH. The hardest part of the job was meeting sales goals on slow days; however, I worked with other sales associates to help meet these goals together. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting/networking with customers. "
good,"A challenging environment to work. "
good,"I was scheduled to work in the electronic department selling products, or work in the stationary department working with customers. I provide top-notch customer service and answered customer phone calls. I also stocked shelved, got products from the backroom if it was available, or ordered products through the store's web site. "
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was the ability to be creative to drive sales. It was often encouraged to try new ideas and they were supported either way.
good,A typical day at work is handling customer problems and normal transactions. Handling returns and exchanges. Also balancing the previous days tills and creating deposits. On occasion working on new planagrams and working freight. My managers and co-workers were extremely nice to work with. My managers created a great work environment. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with the customers. You get to meet an eclectic group of customers.
good,"Most of my day at Staples is spent working on computers, from diagnosing and fixing hardware failures to registry cleanups and basic networking. My favorite part is going out to customer's houses and setting up networks and computers along with troubleshooting problems in their homes. I learned most of what I know of the registry there and got plenty of experience cracking open laptops and cleaning and re-greasing processors and heat sinks, something I had limited experience with and wasn't completely comfortable doing previously. Management has been very friendly and work well in setting and helping to achieve expectations. I have, however, often found myself frustrated with the services we are not allowed to perform in-store. I have often had to replace hard drives laptops that are seated underneath the motherboards themselves, requiring the motherboard to be taken out and reconnected later, yet we are not allowed to replace motherboards. We are also not allowed to take advantage of Digital River's supply of free software even if we have software keys readily available from customers, but instead must go through our distributor which does not have an extensive collection of recovery media, making it impossible to perform system restores on several computers. Compensation for the job is also very little."
good,Most of the time I am selling because there are not to much coverage.
good,A typical day at work was people not completing their tasks which made it difficult to do my job. Management did not train me personally a computer trained me unfortunately. My co workers were cordial people and were easy to get along with. the hardest part of the job would have to be fixing my associates mistakes. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be working on the computers.
good,"My typical work day consisted of working on customer orders, helping people out in the self serve area, taking phone calls, receiving orders through email, completing orders."
good,Work consisted of explaining products and services Staples has to offer. Assisting in exchanges and returns of products.
good,Great company to move up in managent with. Works with their co-workers in all situations.
good,Not a bad place to work wish there was better training guides to help you understand their policies.
good,"Management, and Associates are great to work with/for ~~ and satisfying the Customers of constant importance."
good,I learned alot about retail and corporate operations. I was heavily interested in forecast models and merchandise and allocation planning. I participated in inventory audits and cycle counts. I learned how stores are rated and how to determine how much inventory should be on hand and how certain products are eligible for certain locations. I was very involved in the everyday operations fo the store.
good,"Job security is high yet opportunities for advancement are few and far between, managers are disrespectful to customers and employees. Too much ""red tape"" involved in normal operations making easy tasks difficult."
good,"I enjoyed working in the Copy Center department because I liked doing projects for the customers.The management at the time did not make it very comfortable, but the co-workers were friendly."
good,fast paced environment with dynamic personnel. Daily politics with awful schedule policy
good,"good pay, great benefits, secure company with tons of room to advance. work/life balance is pretty low if you are a manager."
good,working for staples is a pretty good job just can slow down a little and i really like to always be on my feet and constantly busy not doing little things here and there
good,I learned a lot such as to to tackle the customers in different situations.
good,I started my career of customer service with Staples. I was able to get promoted to call center surpervisor.
good,"A typical day was constant customer service and learning about the different departments. I learned how to multitask between the Copy & Print Center, cashiering while working the customer service counter and learning a bit about the technical products. My co - workers were smart and motivated as well as driven. The hardest part of the job was the technical knowlege and dealing with rowdy customers. The most enjoyable part was the labor aspect of working in the Copy/Print Center (making the stamps, binding boks, laminating etc....)."
good,"Great place to start your career, but not the best place to advance."
good,"Staples offers a wide selection of products for their customers , from electronics , school supplies and even furniture. Also most have a copy center which offers services for many type of print jobs. They have their customers best interest ."
good,"Staples is a company that is in a lot of transition. I have worked for better companies, that take better care of there employees. There benefits are very costly and getting more and more every year."
good,Company is not growing and is actually closing multiple locations in their operating areas. Company does offer a flexible schedule and very good benefits package.
good,"Staples has spent the last few years going through many necessary changes to stay competitive in the office products and online business world. Things change a lot within the company, but they put a lot of consideration into their employees. Compensation is at or above market average for most cities. If they can make it past the next few years of changes and finding their new identity, this company has a bright future."
good,"Slow paced work, and the people are cool. Everyone is open and friendly, but the old customers are rude as heck. The pay is terrible for my skill level but i needed the job. Definitely leaving when i get a good offer."
good,my only complaint is that the goals wasn't balanced enough between first and second shifts employees. the first shift was challenged and the bulk of putting up great picking numbers was placed on first shift
good,"I enjoyed my time at staples. I appreciated staples university online training program. It taught valuable skills about selling in the retail environment. Management always encouraged further training and product knowledge and development with kind and encouraging support. The only downside is the wage. It was minimum wage and the benefits, for part-timers were only okay. If you love helping people with technical support then this is the job for you."
good,Quotas aren't unattainable but they are be difficult to reach at certain times. If you don't hit your quota you will be put on a plan where they expect you to hit that quota in the following month. If you don't hit your goal the following month then you go on the second step of the plan. If you don't improve then you will be let go.
good,"Manager was excellent, flexible schedule, team oriented environment with room to grow. Learned a lot about the business and looked forward to coming to work each day"
good,"they do not pay commission for all sales you do. at the same time, they asking to make sales to meet goals. but it is nice to make money their since they pay weekly. flexible hours. friendly environment."
good,"From the summary, the reader can surmise that I have mixed feelings for Staples. On one hand, it is retail with good and bad customers. The job is not challenging and it's routine. The pay is low. On the other hand, it was never too stressful. The coworkers were enjoyable."
good,"I’ve worked with Staples for 2yrs now. "
good,"The people at the fuquay location are wonderful. It's a family kind of environment. The current manager is very understanding when it comes to the schedule, as long as he has enough notice to mark down your conflicts."
good,I started as a temp and had to wait 90 days to roller over and another 90 days to receive benefits and paid time off . I Didn’t like Mandatory overtime !
good,"Wasn't bad, depends how your store management is. Easy job if you're able to make selling goals, otherwise corporate will push hard on managers, which in return will come down on you. In my store, if another department was slacking, I would be expected to help them."
good,"Great team culture in a high paced selling environment.  A lot of direct client interaction in outside sales.  Fun and energetic office atmosphere.  "
good,"Staples is not a bad company but does not seem to be growing. The work here was redundant and I really did not learn a lot, The work culture might have been one of the best. Fun always balances redundancy."
good,"okay place to be need to hire seasoned worker  not high schoolers"
good,"I worked as a part time Cashier.  My job was to maintain stock around the registers, assist customers as they entered and left the store, as well as check out at the register. "
good,Great learning experience for everyone but very crowded essentially on back to school days. Packed like crazy and everyone gets hot tempered and in a rush.
good,opportunities for hard workers to be promoted within the company. pay could be better for all positions. most stores have high turnover rates. good place to work for a short-term job
good,I enjoyed working for them. Managent was good but the pay was not so good and the hours I had were insufficient  and the pay was also insufficient. Still I enjoyed the job
good,"Working at Staples was a great experience. As my first real job I loved working there because the manage made it manageable for me as I was still a student. He was able to give me my hours based on my school schedule which is pretty cool. As for management, there's still a little work that can be done but other than that, the people there are nice, the pay is good (you get paid EVERY week), and the atmosphere is nice. So no complaints really."
good,The job is an Outside sales position. So obviously if you are not closing deals or accounts your job will be in jeopardy. I didn't like the fact that management will change the objectives/goals every other month. It was hard to get accounts because Staples was your own competitor. ( explanation: there are about 3 other departments all going after the same type of business customer so this confuses the customer and you spend more time explaining the internal differences than actually building a relationship and closing a deal.) In addition our outside competitors offer better incentives that staples so if you do close an account it is on pure relationship building ( must have the gift of gap or be a fast talker.) If you have those attributes you will do good but I just don't believe on convincing someone to purchase a membership or higher priced item when I know they are not receiving the best deal or service that's available. My suggestion is push the brand of Staples to get in the door and look for other areas staples can help their business other than supplies.
good,"Currently senior associate in an ESCALATION/RETENTION department. Field and handle complaint calls and e-mails all day, train new associates, do call quality and case reviews."
good,"Working here, I have made many friends. its a fun work experience and at times it can be crazy and stressful but mainly fun. we strive for our customers happiness and we are like one big family there"
good,Great people at Staples but the Company is changing.  I wouldn't recommend a professional role in Retail but if you have outside sales experience it is a good starting point.
good,We work as team to accomplish the goal of sales. I think the job could be better handled on corporate basis. I learned sales and customer services. Plus cashier services
good,Supervisors and managers are crucial in this company.  If they do their job correctly and take an interest in training the associates how to do their job they will be successful.  I experienced a bad supervisor who did not train me properly and then wrote up bad reviews on performance.  Typical day in the print and marketing center is...there is no typical day so it kept things interesting.
good,"Every week goes by fast because of different quotas that need to be fulfilled. Need to make a certain amount of dials, appointments, won businesses, sales quotas, etc. "
good,"great management skills "
good,"I was an Easy Tech Associate for a while. I grew really tired of being forced to do 4 different jobs for the pay of one. On a daily basis I stocked products, repaired computers, sold computers, and repaired mobile devices. It was also very stressful to come to work and constantly fix mistakes made by coworkers and even my supervisor in the tech department. I can't honestly recommend this job to anyone."
good,"It has been great for me to develop my skills and gain knowledge but it has been a challenge to ""climb the ladder"" in this company over all I'm glad I have worked for Staples but I am looking for somewhere I can earn more experience and grow."
good,"overall, staples isn't a terrible place to work.  It is just the store I was working at of course but the management sorta sucked and was very difficult to wok with.  The other employees are the only thing that kept me there for as long as I stayed."
good,"Its not bad place too work , but growth in the company is not really good.There is Job security in the company. Management is not bad. Salary is not good."
good,"Job was relatively easy, good pay, great benefits."
good,"It's a great company to work for if you're young and you really enjoy sales. I am finding that it is monotonous and it doesn't feel like I have a purpose other than selling things. It doesn't feel like it serves a real purpose in humanity. They can be very pushy when it comes to meeting metrics. You get to work from home sometimes which is nice, but it can get quite boring."
good,"I was a 3 dimensional business of office supplies, computers and copy center, Each business was profitable and generated sales. There were also profitable metrics to sell."
good,I am confident that my job is secure but with poor management it makes you hesitant to want to come in each day. Overall tho its better than working fast food. Its more of a placeholder until something better comes along
good,"I learned the ins and outs of salesmanship at Staples.  The manager's are kind and understanding and respect their subordinates.  They are compassionate but fair (after all, it is still a business)."
good,"The job consisted of contacting your customers, asking questions, discovering needs,making suggestions, then telling them to pick it up at the store.    Good Job but it wasn't for me.  The dept was eliminated a few months after I resigned."
good,One of the best thing I experienced is good team work and that is night crew and also it has friendly management which is good.
good,Working at Staples was s mostly enjoyable experience whenever you had very trustworthy and supportive management to work with. I learned plenty of valuable customer service skills and gained retail experience. There may have not been chance to advance to a computer technician but the job got me by for college.
good,"I've been working at Staples Copy and Print Center since February and I've learned a lot.  I didn't realize how many different types of paper there were and how many businesses are in my town.  Due to how many businesses we wait on, everyday is always so busy at the copy center.  It doesn't help when there are only ever one-two employees working at one time.  The line is almost always backed up and sometimes, customers are not that understanding.  One out of the three managers at my store actually know things about the Copy Center so if you have questions or need help and it's not that one manager and you're the only one working, you're screwed.  I usually never get out on time either.  There are days when I end up having to stay over 1-2 hours because it's so busy or backed up with orders.  There are days I get so frustrated that I leave the store crying."
good,"The pay wasn't so bad for warehouse associate, and learned how to monitor production volume and pick to voice.  Management are easy going and understanding.  The downside would be long hours almost daily and say goodbye to sleep."
good,"Staples has given me chance to improve my skills and progress within the company moving from a customer service advisor to an account manager. Staff there have always worked well together no matter what department they are in and are a great team. I enjoy building rapport with customers growing and developing their businesses where i can, it can be a struggle at times when certain customers do not want the calls or do not want to have a conversation with you but i try and mirror the customer to understand when is the best time to talk."
good,"fast paced, always challenging.Recieve product in back sell in the middle and ship out the front door.Company changes to different goals every year."
good,"Essentially I obtained my position at Corporate Express which was later taken over by Staples. Corporate Express was one of the best companies I have ever worked for. They truly cared about their employees and did their best to make sure they were happy. When I arrived at work I would sign on to my computer and start my job by ""clearing my queues"" and sourcing the remaining items through different suppliers. I learned a lot about the inside of a business to business corporation. My direct supervisors were awesome and amazing people. My coworkers were good people and did not deserve the layoff we received. The hardest part of my job was accepting that a large corporation could consume a smaller corporation in a small amount of time and destroy everything the small company stood for. The most enjoyable part of my job occurred before the hostile take over."
good,I really enjoyed working at staples. It was a very interesting work place and all my coworkers made me feel comfortable.. The managment was very considerate and understanding about certain things. the hardest part of the job was having all the freight put away by the time the general manager set for us..
good,Overall the job was a bit overwhelming as an assistant manager but it was very rewarding. I had the best general manager anyone could have asked for but the worst district manager I have ever worked with. I do not believe that being a manager should mean intimidating people into their roles. I feel it should be about supporting and coaching into role.
good,depending on what job you go into it could be very easy and boring. or very tough. pay is good. also if you go full time they require mandatory overtime and they call overtime a lot.
good,"une journée de travail typique"
good,"When I was employed at this job, it was to great benefit to me. I do not regret working there one bit. My coworkers were great, very welcoming and helpful. I was originally hired as a cashier, but was put through training as an Easy Tech Associate meanwhile training to be a cashier as well. It was decided by a manager that I would be placed on the Easy Tech team as I had some experience, knowledge, and interest in computers. However, because they needed another cashier regardless, I ended up working as a cashier for the most part. I would ring up customers, offer Staples Rewards cards, work with business clients and their accounts, stock, face, and organize the floor, sell furniture, answer questions as a general sales associate, run diagnostics checks on computers, and help customers with electronics and their accessories as an Easy Tech Associate. I enjoyed all of my positions at Staples and their mission statement.. The only partial issue was that during this time, Staples had closed many of it's stores due to sales being down. There are obvious pressures that take place during these times, and are understandable as the success of the store is highly critical, but this did result in inconsistency amongst managers at the time. They all wanted to try new things, experimenting to see what would be best for the store. This often resulted in miscommunication and tensions to where one manager would make orders, but another would want to direct something completely different. From this I was able to practice multi-tasking, but it would at times be difficult to please three managers"
good,I worked at both Palm Desert and Palm Springs.  I worked at one with a rude over bearing manager that used intimidation tactics to make people work harder and one that would hide in his office 24/7 and not work with associates at all.  Polar opposites but two reasons I was never able to stay at Staples.
good,"Excellent place to grow your Leadership abilities, lots of available training for those wanting to improve sales and Management skills."
good,"Typically, time was spent repairing computers, taking in new ones for repairs, and working the sales floor to assist customers. "
good,"the store just need better management. They dont keep up with the bathrooms, there just so out of order and there attitudes are horrible"
good,"There are excellent bunch of people, would have been better if they compensate a bit higher."
good,"a typical day at work are daily deliveries, making sure the right people get there order. a lot of heavy lifting, but i learn different places as i go."
good,"This place has it's UPS and downs but like most retail chains, they are making changes that effect everyone. Sometimes it becomes stressing and other times it seems easygoing."
good,"Staples has multiple working sections for different skill levels. There is several types of employees from all around the world. There are multiple levels of management and daily work experiences vary form manager to manager. It is an easy job, but it can frustrate some people, some days are too lenient and some days seem brutal, but overall a good job for a part time worker or a student."
good,"positif: 1 moins routinier que la plus des entreprise"
good,"A typical day in this job includes operating and running a cash register, answer customer questions, answering phone calls, and keeping the front end clean and tidy. I have learned how to deal with customers and difficult situations. Also I have improved my customer service skills by always being immersed with the customers. The management has went through many changes over the almost two years of working there, some better than others. Overall my coworkers are one of the best aspects of working at staples, and I have become quite close with many of them."
good,"Staples is a pretty good company to work for, Great managers who care about there employees. i did notice that are company has change good and bad, employees who i work with are amazing always helping each other when we need it."
good,Customer Service is the main focus in all departments in Staples Stores. Fast pace. Multi-tasking with customers and projects. Assist co-works if needed. Fill out paper work when necessary.
good,"Typical day at Staples consisted of coming in checking email, following up with the HR manager and my manager (Operations manager). Started my reports for corporate, then production and damages report. any kind of assistance for the supervisors or upper management or even the associates."
good,"Includes attending around 30 calls per day and directing to 2 nd level if required . 75 percent are solved in phone and rest in store."
good,"TYPICAL DAY"
good,Good company to work for; best for self starters; no micro-management; Job culture is good; casual dress code; Low compensation; no incentives
good,"Love being here, but Staples as a company sucks. My co-workers are great and fun to be around! But, like I said, Staples does not care about its employees and they keep on cutting back on hours."
good,I was able to train in the copy and print center which enhanced my computer and electronic skills. I enjoyed transferring to different branches to work. My co-workers and management were great
good,"A company effectively falling apart due to the way it is forced to run by management who seemingly never worked on the shop floor, the store management are constantly forced between a rock and a hard place in terms of tasking and serving customers and most the time the normal members of staff are not adequately trained due to this rising situation, management do their best to help staff as much as possible but it's not always easy and there is little reward, a typical day working there is 70% tasking, 30% serving customers, the business would thrive more if we could all spend 90% of our time serving but that is a head office for you. I have been lucky enough to be given responsibility of many things and have gained full time hours as a show of their gratitude, with this I have learned many skills all of which benefit our customers whether that be a busy day or a slow one."
good,Solid company not alot of advancement opportunities  Solid product line and structure.  Good management  Overall a good working place with very good people
good,"This is a great place to work that is stress free. Great co-workers and very nice managers. Hardest part of the job is not enough personal on the floor. Best part of the work is on non-busy days, it's relaxed. Great location next to other malls."
good,"A typical day at Staples, was stocking merchandise, changing SKU and barcode labels, maintenance as well as cleaning and sweeping, promoting sales and merchandise, providing customer service, and performing carry outs."
good,"Job responsibilities consist of running the copy and print department making sure production is a success. Other job duties were completing customer orders upon request via email, phone, and customer walk-in.  Contacting customers who are contracted with Staples and making sure jobs are done and customers are satisfied. Keeping aware of revenue and ordering supplies for the department and staying within the store budget. Other responsibilities were to be knowledgeable of frequent changes within the company and making sure associates are informed and trained to be able to produce at any time when needed"
good,Book appointments by cold calling and by phone.  Meet customers to sell program and various lines of business.
good,fast paced environment with not a lot of help... They offer benefits for full time employees... They also recognize employees within and internally promote rather then looking for outsiders. People are usually great to work with...
good,I was tired of being so pushy and turning people away with them not buying a tech service
good,"Customers can want the impossible sometimes, but we do not say ""No"" to any customer. My Management staff is always ready to help me find a special solution for our customers."
good,"Management went downhill, contacted higher-ups to fix issue, ignored."
good,"The morning starts with verifying that all customer computers are present and accounted for, then the status of work on each is evaluated to determine which are the main priorities of the day. With that settled, customers are contacted and updated on the status of their computers, and work finally begins. While repairs are being done on the bench, new customers are bound to call or show up with their ill computers, so multitasking is a must. While it is always gratifying to see the joy in someone's face as they pick up their newly repaired computer, not all stories end so happily. It's also a bit disheartening to be reprimanded for not pushing service plans or expensive repairs hard enough."
good,"1) Clock-in work on tots and truck."
good,"Staples was ,unfortunately, in the middle of changing its direction from brick and mortat to a more omnipresent online presence.  This had the effect of drastic changes within the company.  That part aside, Staples did provide any atmosphere of learning and teamwork/play.  My own viewpoint is that you get out of a situation what you put into it, I love to learn, work hard and grow from all the amazing people that I come across on a daily basis."
good,"Typical day: Walk around helping customers throughout the store"
good,"great employees for the most part. fast paced, pay is'nt the greatest but its work."
good,"A typical day at work is slow starting, getting prepared for the busy day of customer service. I have learned patience, and to obtain a thick skin. With patience I have learned to better help and service customer. I have also learned that to get to where I want in a job I have to work hard, diligently, and to figure things out on my own."
good,"Typically, once you clock in, you go right to your area of work and start into your routine. The hardest part was for much of my time there, The store was understaffed. The most enjoyable part was the people i worked with."
good,"Awesome staff, but if you are in the technology department it can get kinda of stressful when needing to sell 8 attachments plus a 200$ warranty for every computer you sell"
good,"Very fast paced environment. Great people to work with. Had some issues towards the time of me leaving with the company demanding more from us managers. The way the company works is by sales, and if you do not make sales, you did not have a job."
good,"My managers are really friendly and very supportive. What I love about working at Staples are people at my location, they are really fun to work with, time passes by really quick. Staples is really pricey compared to other retail stores, so customers are usually very cranky."
good,Teamwork and interpersonal communication skilld were improved.
good,Everyone is happy and fun to be around. I enjoyed working there.
good,working in staples involves managing your own time efficiently or many of the daily tasks cannot be completed succesfully. the company offers very good benefit packages and some oportunity for advancement. many of the daily tasks require good communication and team work to be fulfilled. overall retail is demanding of patience and effort at all times.
good,That was all I can say good about it. The managers all had their favorites. That place was always based on he said she said. I got tired of the drama. The supervisors were just as gossipy as the employees. My back still hurts from the stab wounds
good,"Typically I helped customers look for what they needed in the Easytech electronic department. Fixing computers, selling and diagnosing problems. Inventory control was another part of the job. Phone calls, register, lifting and unloading truck. hardest was dealing with unruly customers who had a tough problem with their computer or device. Most enjoyable part was learning about the devices."
good,"I first started there as an Easy Tech Associate then Easy Tech Expert and I couldn't stand how much pressure they put on us to sell, sell, SELL! I moved over to the Inventory Associate position and like my job much more. It keeps me busy and interested and there is a lot less pressure. Management treats us like peons, its difficult to cope with when you know you are capable of finding a better job but can't because the job market is so tough."
good,"helping new hires learn the system, taking phone calls to fill clients orders."
good,"Staples is a well designed company. It provides a number of great services to its customers and much more often than not, puts a smile on their face before they exit the store. It has good business practices as well, and because of this it appears to be very profitable. Does this mean you will be paid well here? No. One can only assume that the shareholder line their pockets with what should be in the hard-working associates' paychecks."
good,"Excelente espírito de equipa, bom ambiente e cooperação entre colegas. Uma óptima gerente de loja sempre disponível para ajudar com qualquer problema."
good,Can easily balance work and life with the flexible hours. Management doesn't get paid very well and health insurance is high. Expected to be able to do every role without increasing pay. Too many conference  calls. Have to attach protection plans to everything and sign customers up for rewards and credit cards. Company wants to control customers  wallets instead of allowing them to purchase what they came in for.
good,The job itself isn't terrible there's a new GM and she's trying to build a much better work environment and she is acheiving it. She is truly trying to do as much as she can when it comes to employee recognition and doing right by the bottom of the totem pole. The down side is the pay...whatever it's average but it's minimum wage and if sucks.
good,Fun job to work at. Management was super cool and nice. Was part time worked 37.5 hours a week. Hours sucked only because i like Monday thru Friday weekends off
good,"I was a summer youth intern . it was a decent job, the manager was understanding, the employees were extremely helping, it was somewhat an easy job to do."
good,Staples Is A Overall Realxing Job. Managment Was My Only Issue At The Location. It Was A Nice Office With A Easy Access Cafe. Co Workers Are Very Nice As Well And Professional.
good,"I worked with the best team, amazing management and coworkers. Made the busy days feel less overwhelming when there is a team like them working with you. The job itself, the clientele, not the best."
good,Great place to work. Sometimes under staffed. You have to learn about all facets of the building. Enjoyed helping customers and learning about products.
good,Good place to work. Good company with good benefits. Employee pay rate could be higher. Great job security. Good work environment with management. Customer interaction is also good.
good,"Good student Jobs, not much more really. For a student job it was perfect, much more better than any other alternatives."
good,"I enjoyed the new challenge of balancing employees with daily tasks. I learned a lot about computers, a side of sales I never really knew before hand. Overall it was a great experience."
good,Never have I enjoyed my colleagues more than at this Staples. The staff here are friendly and supportive. It is definitely a team focused with great management leading the store's growth.
good,"Working at Staples was fun but a bit stressful. I think they could improve their hours, benefits, and options. I wanted more hours and to move to a different department but it did not work out."
good,"great colleagues, everyone pulled together in a team effort, 1st 2 levels of management understood what was going on and did not expect the impossible, provided resources to complete projects and provide support."
good,"I learned how to work in hectic situations, but if you're working in Print and Marketing I recommend to get ready for hectic situations, and be ready to learn how to sink and swim, meaning that you will  learn how to survive."
good,Typical day would be starting our day by reading our emails and for the first couple of hours make our sales calls. I've learned to push myself to higher levels working at Staples since the culture was very competitive. Management wasn't always around or available they seemed to be pulled away or at least what they told us.
good,"This is not a bad job at all. It has a lot of potential, but some of the employees make it difficult as well as how often they change the pay and operating systems."
good,Working with small business customers.  Making sure shelves were stocked and faced properly.  As a computer tech and business machines associate I was constantly working with people about their purchases or computer issues.  Lots of computer hardware and software troubleshooting.
good,"Staples was a great company for many years, however, over the past 5 years it has gone through many changes with upper management and expectations of job performance with reduction in labor. Staples has focused on its on line business and has closed over 400 stores during the past 4 years."
good,"Good company, very fair and balanced. Sorry to be moving on. It was a 2nd ""home"". Met many good people and made solid relationships both personal and technical. I would recommend it to anyone considering it. Solid company."
good,Great company at first but become unfavorable with the constant change.There has been a lot of change in the recent past as part of the reinvention some good and some not so good. The size of the organization can be a challenge when negotiating changes cross functionally.
good,The atmosphere is pretty laid back. However its very hot inside the fc. and theres little to no air flow. I have a full time job but only get part time hours. That is something i really don't like about my department.
good,"Good place to start your career, management is great but the poeple running the show at the HP are clueless and running Staples into the ground. Each month there are more and more changes and quotas are unrealistic now"
good,"Staples provides stellar sales and product training and this will benefit you as you progress in your sales career. Open territory, competitive, manager was very supportive and knowledgeable. Outside sales part again is great for a sales 101 person as it is a position where you set them up and then move on in the traditional B2B role. Great way to meet new people and at the time I was there they offered some great bonus options for being successful. Benefits are ok and Staples does treat you like a family but you must work hard, create an internal brand for yourself and make sure to connect with other internal teams and individuals that you feel comfortable with as you do a lot of delegating and it is nice to have a good relationship with them as you pass off your new accounts to them. They do expect you to make a lot of appointments and close 2 NEW accounts maybe more now by each week. You have weekly, monthly and yearly goals to hit and they track you and will assist you but you have to work hard and put in a lot of effort at the start."
good,"Bonjour!"
good,Staples was a good to work place to due to its core focus on coaching and developing the future leaders of the company. Everyone from supervisors on the front end up to the CEO of the corporation were internal promotions. It made all of us feel like we had unlimited growth potential in this company.
good,Corporate puts pressure on in-store managers to get tasks accomplished with as few employees as possible which results in unrealistic expectations being placed in the Sales Associates which then leads to them being overworked and stressed by the General Managers.
good,The day starts with customer complaints and ends the same. Great way to learn patience or just how to bite your tongue. The store I was at had great managers most of the time (8 out of 10 were amazing) over five years. Workplace culture? Sassy fun! Hardest part would be customers. Most enjoyable your co-workers in the slow moments of the day.
good,"Having recently transitioned from Staples to Office-Outlet the company is re-building.  A good time to join on a level playing field as everyone is on the same page.  The leadership is good with robust experience and skills.  You will feel welcomed and part of the team, All store managers are very supportive and understanding."
good,"Was a good company to work for when I was first hired, however they are running thin + employees are paying for it with lack of flexibility, decteased pay, being overworked, + having less structured management."
good,"staples is a decent place to work if you're a student. there is chances of advancement if you want longer shifts and no available time outside of work. Copy and print is stressful to say the least but you do learn lots of great skills that can be used outside of work. Decent management, cares when it comes to things like , not so much when it comes to you actually being able to take a break. May wait 4-5 hours because of no coverage."
good,"co-workers are very encouraging and helpful. On a typical day you stock shelves, help customers. The hardest part is completing tasks within a timely fashion while trying to help needy customers."
good,"A typical day at work: four assignments at once=impossible to complete."
good,The enviroment is fast paced so the days pass quickly.  Corporate mangement communicates action plans that follow the SMART acronym but local management changes the plan drastically adding confusion to the process.
good,"A typical day at work was never the same some days it was busy and other times it was slow but never a dull moment. I learned something new everyday from counting money to answering calls in customer service. The co-workers are friendly. There really is no hard part to the job, as long as you do good in training you'll do perfect on the job."
good,a great day the only hardest part of the day is when we have a store full of customers on crowded busy days such as black friday and back to school the sales numbers goes up but its hectic
good,my co workers were very friendly can encourage me to be more independent. I love how they have different advance through out the company.
good,I enjoyed working at Staples. The atmosphere is really laid back. You learn many job functions and cross train is always welcome.
good,"This job is perfect for individuals who are working part time but provides no real income for part timers. It is a retail position so it requires people skills and patience. However, the coworkers here make it less stressful and are really easy to get along with."
good,"I worked for staples for almost 4 years, I met a lot of great people and was promoted several times. I wish the training system was better, atleast for managers/supervisors, and that the hours for part time employees were more set than they are, Overall, it was a good first job, and experience that gave me opportunity to grow."
good,Staples was a great place to learn and progress my career. I developed successful sales techniques that will help my future as well as increased my knowledge as a computer technician.
good,"Working for staples is a great opportunity for me being that i'm a new comer to Brandon Florida. I recently started working at staples; on a typical day at work would be basically greeting customers when they walk in the store, assisting them when they need help looking for an item, and ringing up their items to be purchased. I've learned how to price and look up sku numbers for items within the store. The  management team that I work with is very understanding and accommodating, they allow me to work a flexible schedule. My co-workers are pretty cool and laid back they are willing to help me if I need any assistance on the job. To me the hardest part of the job Is not being able to work more hours due to it being part time position and the hourly wages aren't as much as I would prefer them to be. lastly, seeing the customers leave out the store with a smile on their faces and with everything they needed and wanted is the most enjoyable moment working at staples."
good,"The Company was a Really Good , a great place to work at the workers are friendly and good management i would recomend to a student or in collage person, but overall i had a great experience"
good,"Staples, where I have learned a lot so far in terms of productivity, pressure handling, creativity and development."
good,"Sell and fix computers."
good,"Typical day here at Staples is understanding product placement and recommending products to customers.  Also as a Manager, you must upkeep freights and do an inventory count.  Overall, Job seem quite simple as an office equipment specialist in making sure price tags were up to date and products were in the correct sections.  Management and co workers were great."
good,"Nothing out of the ordinary, a regular job at an office store."
good,"I had fun working at Staples. Although wage is pretty low for entry level job, but overall the job was pretty easy."
good,Staples is a very family oriented place to work allowing you to balance work life and family life.  Creative environment that allows all associates to work together to create and provide fun and innovative products to help make office run smoothly.
good,"A typical day in Business Development entails high levels of prospecting and moving the sales cycles along at various stages of development."
good,"A good place to work, I just didn't get enough hours or pay. They are very flexible on when you need a day off. They were very good at working around my school schedule."
good,all of the tenure employees are extremely helpful they want everyone to be successful
good,Staples is a company that cares about its' employees. They try to assist in developing you as an individual. There are some who are promoted within.
good,"In the morning I check sales,payroll, multiple e-mail accounts, update schedules, check bulletin board for new projects or updated directive, take conference calls/ webex, submit reports, walk the sales floor, assign projects and tasks to employees. Throughout the day I resolve customer concerns, meet with various department managers and review results and or create/follow up on action plans, conduct audits (Safety, HR, Loss Prevention,Operations), Coach and develop associates on sales floor, assign training, follow up on maintenance issues (broken ladders, leaky roof, etc..), drive sales, organize events,consult with 2nd level customers, canvass the neighborhood, conduct reviews,work with distribution, consult with vendors and more."
good,Really amazing place to work. It being a small store is really nice. You get to know the customers when you are working with them.
good,A typical day involves greeting customers and checking them out when they're ready.  Nothing exciting happens and the hours drag on like watching paint dry.  But the other employees make it less boring.
good,Staples is one of the best companies to learn new things and to help improve your selling skills. It is a fast pace environment. They do push you for the better to improve yourself. They have tons of benefits and positions open for everyone. It is one of the best places to create amazing relations with your customer. There is a down side on how small the staff becomes and how much more you have to put in when moving up with the company. The challenge is great.
good,Great experience and learned a lot working with great people. But it is in a dying industry. Well positioned to grow other categories using core base.
good,wonderful place to work especially for young people heading into high school or college and need to learn responsibility and  skills for good customer service. The salary should be better honestly especially for supervisors and employees in management roles/supervisors.
good,"It was your average retail position, working the register, helping the customers when you were able to. The managment generally had my back whenever there was an issue.This location is now closed."
good,"Relaxed atmosphere. Very diverse environment. People of various cultures frequent the company due to product or service demands. The business is broken up into 3 different areas, and each department is competitive."
good,"If everyone does their tasks, it’s smooth sailing. Staff are very friendly. Easy to learn job. I recommend being cashier or copy and print associate.ok pay"
good,"Lots of metrics to meet. Slow to change processes. Not agile enough as an organization. The company is trying hard to change. "
good,Within the Print and marketing area of Staples there is so much to do and learn. All of the new skills i acquired were a great stepping stone for me to move on with.
good,"fast environment , forklift experience ....great holiday meals. great work out . pay is decent . you will learn a lot about office supplies. match 401 k"
good,Staples is a good place to work at if you are looking for a part time job while going to school. You can get a schedule based on your needs and management is good. Staples allowed me to gain sales and marketing skills. The only bad thing about Staples is the compensation but this varies from store to store because it depends on store performance.
good,"I enjoyed working there. The management could have been a bit more professional with the way they handle things. Overall, it was a decent experience for me."
good,"Evreyday is different. Expect the unexpected. Be prepared to work with, for, and come in contact with all types of personalities. But as long as you are a joyous and positive person then you can maintain. You have to be the positive person most of the people need. You never know what they are going through."
good,Staples was an okay place to work at because they don't keep there promise on the hours you will be given. If you had a probably with your hours they would kind of push you off.Management didnt really care much about your problems work wise they just needed you there no ifs ands or buts. Overall I loved working in the copy center because I got to learn many things. All creative projects were given to us and I like that alot.
good,Staples has given me many opportunities. I started off as print and marketing associate and they gave me the opportunity to be the supervisor and it's an awesome experience just wish they paid us more and cared about their employees a little more.
good,Staples can be a good company to work for with the right leaders in place. It also can be very stressful at times. Sometimes when something new comes all focus on the new item and the basic are forgotten. Which comes back to haunt new Managers.
good,it is a good part time job. if you want to work there and move up then it's okay also it's not a job i'd suggest doing long term. Very tedious but you'll have a lot to do so the time will fly by
good,good job i love working there met alot of people not all goood but most and awesome working there and friendly co worker i would love to work again
good,"Great place with supportive co-workers, ever well balance between work and personal growth development. The most pleasant part of the working with the company working alongside my colleagues and learning from them."
good,"Great job for a college student looking to make a bit of extra cash. You get paid weekly so that is a major plus. Work is usually pretty easy, except for truck days (one day a week) and during the back to school season."
good,"good place to learn culture for start in Canada."
good,"I really liked working there, it wasn't a hard job to do. I learned when you work with the right people your day would go really good and fast."
good,"Being short staffed was the most difficult part of the job. There were also times when other associates did not remember to fill out information correctly, or leave detailed notes for the next associates shift. Jobs would be forgotten, not done, or placed on hold. Another complication is when a customer gets upset and begins to yell at you for the job not being finished or correctly completed, even though it may not be your fault. **This is where patience and understanding must be handy**"
good,"Staples was a great place to work until they removed their fleet and went 3rd party...."
good,"There are many Great people to work with,  a lot of support from your peers.  I have learned many things that will help me in my future endeavors."
good,"A typical day of work includes working register, helping customers, and restocking inventory."
good,its a very job productivebut not reliable bette job culture
good,"Although I was fired from this company I still have a lot of respect for most of the team members, management, and overall policies, procedures, and work atmosphere of this company.  I have rated the company with a 3 because I feel they are lacking in is proper training procedures and I did have problem with some dishonest employees and overly competitive behaviors resulting in a divided team and some immature choices against each other. . This could be highly improved. There does not seem to be a training procedure so much as a learn as you go attitude. However,  some team members are eager to help eachother. Management , should have been more involved in my training to see how things were going. management is very good at hearing out the problems of the employees and unlike many companies they gave out proper counseling and the right forms   before and during my termination. They provide great pay and benefits if you are qualified"
good,"Day to day this job was good to have. Compensation was wonderful and so were the benefits. The only problem I had was my territory. I was an Business consultant in NW Arkansas and the rest of my team was in Oklahoma. My numbers that I had to keep up and the territory I had just didn't seem to work together. With Wal-Mart Headquarters here, the state being under Office Depot contracts, fewer Staple stores than any other office supply stores, and small town people being dedicated to their small town vendors, it made the job tougher than it probably should have been."
good,"I have been working for staples over 5 years now and go through day to day selling products and helping customers. I sort delivery out and make sure objectives are met daily. I have learnt many things working at staples such as interacting with customers, asking the correct questions and making sure i know how to make a sale, 99% of the time i make a sale and always leave a customer happy. The management is fairly decent, i very rarely make a mistake and always do the correct things to stay on the managers positive side, 5 years of working for staples and I have never seriously had a problem. I have also got along with my co-workers as i am funny and very easy to get along with, I have never had any problems with my co-workers. There is never really a hard part of my job and i am experienced enough to deal with all situations, 5 years customer service and I am confident about the decision of moving to a bigger and different working environment. I enjoy working as I am confident with my job and dealing with problems and queries. The most enjoyable bit is that i have the confidence to work by looking forward to the end of the month, knowing i have made money as well as helping the company i work for."
good,"A typical day at work would be counting cash drawers out for the cashier at the beginning and end of shift, assisting customers with complaints and or compliments about the service they were given, helping the Store Manager with sales goals that needed to be met for that day. And any other given task. They ranged from day to day."
good,"check equipment get work for the filled orders, great people to work with fast paced running different equipment"
good,working for staples is a fun workplace to learn and grow. as a former employee its a great place to grow for future reference.
good,"Since there is only one copy and print associate on duty per shift, I am very busy at work. A typical day is a cycle of helping the walk-in customers place or purchase orders. I also have to keep an eye on the e-mail because we do web submissions and e-mail orders. We are also responsible for customer consultations, production of instore print jobs, and maintaining the copy center. There are some administrative activities to fit in also."
good,Staples is a great place to work. I learned a lot about computers and how they work.
good,"a typical day at work is pretty easy, as long as you can perform basic cashier duties and you have an outgoing personality you will be great for a job at staples."
good,Be ready to work long hours Monday-Friday. Management is highly mediocre and has miles of room to improve. Good working environment. Clean warehouse for most part
good,"It was a food place to work at , had very flexible hours was able to work with my schedule while in school , able to learn how to talk to different types of customers"
good,"If there isn’t enough people working that day, it gets to be super stressful. When I was in CPC (now PMC), if someone left at 2pm and no one else came in, you were pretty much stuck there. There were times I had to call someone to come in early, but it wasn’t way too terrible."
good,Staples is a great place to work. If your tech savy they have position where you can travel to customer home to setup tech product. You will also have the ability to work on computer in the store as well.
good,"Quill is the most  profitable arm of Staples focused on the small to mid-sized B to B companies.  They are extremely nimble and agile with the ability to design test and deliver solutions very quickly."
good,"The job is hard for the horrible pay you get. Customers want everything right away and get mad when you say no. Corporate gives you one set of rules and the managers go right around them to ""take care of the customer"""
good,my honest review about the place they take to long to respond back to you during hiring and the manger and general manger are very nice also how much i was being paid wasnt disclosed to me until it was time for w2 forms
good,"As an outside Strategic Account Management position where I would visit my existing accounts to produce added value service."
good,"Working with clients who love design, and can understand that The designer knows what he is doing so there are no back seat designers, thats nice..............."
good,"It is a good company to work for. The people, management and culture are very good. I thoroughly enjoy it here with my peers."
good,"although i only worked there for a few months, the people were fantastic, the management was a good balance of work and play and very knowledgeable of their products and company. staff was always willing to help out to give the best customer service possible."
good,Helping customers from the time I'm there until the time I'm walking out the door. I learn almost everyday from my co-workers who I enjoy!
good,Staples is a great place to work.  They will help you move up and grow with the company. I learned a lot about computers and customer service.
good,"I enjoyed working there, you got to see people from your community. They also had a great block party which gave back to schools. It also helped link other businesses together."
good,Operations run well. Managers are great. Learn new things everyday. Coworkers treat you with respect. Environment is clean and healthy. Never a dull moment
good,It's a well managed company that really cares for their employees. They're very flexible with students as well as the needs of employees. The job is very educational and gives you a good hands on training to situations and experiences you probably won't get to learn else where unless you went to school for it.
good,"In all honesty, you do more work than you get paid to do (i.e., you have a million job requirements for minimal pay depending on the position you've applied for). On the upside of that, management is very kind and willing to work with you. Staples aims to work schedules around the needs of the employees, which is heavenly. Associates often get along well, with little-to-no problems amongst each other."
good,"Daily goals, and stressful environment, Pay was ok but doesn't fit for the stress involved for the job. You have to work hard and love what you do fir this position.  If not, don't apply. I was there 8 yrs, and loved it due to the relationships I formed with co workers and management.  Made the entire time enjoyable.  Extremely hard work, a lot of research and goals are involved in this job."
good,"I was working in sales where I had to sell computer witch it was my first job and I didn't know a lot abut selling and computer a the time, and it made it very hard a lost interest"
good,Its a good company to work for however after I was laid off i went back to work for them. It fell apart after that. They didnt erase my points from the previous year and didnt care about their employees.
good,"Answered calls for customer service, billing inquiries, took catalogue orders over the phone, credit card issues, tracking orders through UPS"
good,"Good place to work while in high school or college. Decent compensation and flexible scheduling. We receive time and a half on Sundays, paid vacation time, paid holidays and there is a yearly scholarship available to college students."
good,Staples is a decent retailer to work for. I mean it is retail you cannot expect too much. I worked with some very amazing people. I actually miss it once in a while.
good,They have great benefits & you get to learn what staples is about for small business and things like that. but i would recommed the job
good,"Working at staples taught me alot about customer services. Learned that the customer is always right, and how to keep business blooming. It was a big staples. I was the only Deaf worker, so I learned to use my skills to interact."
good,was a great experience learning new things and a great motivation meeting new people growing threwout a business taking things to the next level and achieving bigger and better threwout my job career.
good,i had the best boss i could of asked for she was very understand as well as helpful in terms of helping me and my fellow associates achieve our goals in the store
good,I liked working here. It was fine but now the rules changed with a new management. I wanted to learn more and have more experience in warehouse
good,the job was very present . I worked at the front end of the store on 14th street in 6th avenue out side as well as inside greeting customers.I was the cashier in the day after class.I am curently a student at a new location. i enjoyed the diffident people i had to enter act with.my co workers were young and vibrant individuals funto be and work with.
good,A typical day at work starts with scanning the store for replenishment. Then on to cycle counting which is a different product everyday of the week. Checking for price changes. I do too many inventory things to list here. All crutial to keeping our doors open for business. I love what I do. If it has to do with inventory or merchandising I'm a happy camper. I have several excellent co-workers that are a productive supportive team. I feel we go above and beyond the call of duty. And as with any place of business there are the co-workers who are only there to collect a paycheck. And at this time I feel that the current management team is not stepping up to the plate with fair and consistant management. All in all I like being the Inventory Associate.
good,"•	Listen to and resolve customer complaints regarding services, products, or personnel."
good,"If you want to keep a life outside of work or to get respected by the management this is not a good place to work. No matter how many sales you get or how hard you work, they will always expect more out of you. The management bullied a lot of the workers and no one stayed employed here for long"
good,The benefits where actually very good. Beyond that it was a nightmare to work there. Slave labor wages for mountains of work. Even assistant store managers made about as much as regular employees at other company’s. Corporate is a joke and higher out of store managers often are accountants or from other fields and have no retail experience.
good,"I would walk up and down the aisles to maintain the cleanliness of the store, and answer any customer questions, as well as stock shelves with products."
good,"The culture has definetly shifted overtime. In many ways for the better. I'd say, overall it's a ""fair weathered"" environment"" In the best of times of the seasons, it can be great for someone that's already sales oriented. however, if you are not, or you live a considerable distance away from the location you're working at, it can create a strain on you overtime. There will ALWAYS be around a dozen different metrics that you'll be expected to keep up on, (not to mention the hours spent coaching employees in attempt to improve the metrics in question). During the busier seasons (Back to School), there WILL be nights you'll be expected to work until 1 am if needed. If you can make peace with both aspects of this job, it can be a fantastic, rewarding experience."
good,I like working there it was just that the mangers wasn't professional enough. The pay was poor at the time. there was no advancement in that company. the company was also a face pace store.
good,"helped customers, answered phone, made copies, binding, laminations, faxing, and took orders for business cards and stationary making"
good,"A typical day working here was very eventful but not worth the pay."
good,Min wage job. You can never do well enough in their eyes to substantiate a raise.  Hours all over the place so working in a second job is impossible.  Never use them for a reference most  management will give you a bad reference just to be spiteful.
good,"Fun place to work when the management isn't terrible.Their new store manager is terrible at her job and it makes the place a terrible enviornment, while the Assistant and other managers are very good at their jobs it can be hard to work under the terrible leadership of the store manager."
good,"Team members were great to work with, very friendly and supportive. Management style was autocratic, and did not have the ability to be relatable to employees."
good,"Great company to work for, but poorly managed and as a result, low job satisfaction and high staff turnover rate. Good pay and nice co-workers but poor scheduling and micro managing from managers."
good,typical day at working would be just seeing what computers needed to be worked on and assisting customers. At the end of the day it would be restocking shelves and putting things from the return bins and putting them back up.
good,You never know what you will encounter each day. That may be in every retail store but in STAPLES and especially in the Print and Marketing department I know for certain you are faced with new challenges every day. You learn a lot from your fellow peers and your customers.
good,"Sell great furniture, household items, computer's and great sales on Alot of item's. But no Health benefits, you can get cash back up to 50.00 Dollars in cash back."
good,Great management and co-workers when I worked there.  I enjoyed the job because this was my first job fresh out of high school.
good,"I have been with Staples for almost two years now, and have worked at three different stores in that time, and while I enjoy the work I do, I do not think that the way they run things is particularly great. "
good,"great company great environment the down side is if you dont manage to do your job in a timely manner you will be written up, when you clock in and get to work the managers have already planned you day and expect you to do your shift in the way its written"
good,Love the job.
good,"Management will nag and and nag about goals, though IF you're lucky your coworkers will make the time there more fun. The benefits are a joke if you're part time and it becomes so much more stressful if you're full time that it doesn't even feel worth it to stay. Just because you're told you mean a lot to the store doesn't mean you'll be respected or worked with to improve teaching your goals."
good,"I loved working with Staples. The people were great and they would help you if you couldn't work a day they scheduled you, someone would swap days or work it for you!"
good,"During my employment at Staples, my work experience fluctuated depending on who was in the managerial position at the store and what employees I was working with. There is a high turnover rate. It is challenging during back to school season."
good,This job position was not only very hard to maintain but also the company held very high stander that was nearly impassable to meet.  Despite of its difficulty I really enjoyed the fact that i had the opportunity to learn new thing from  and was able to use in my daily life in i wanted to.
good,employees at a small staples will have the benifits of a lack of training a lack of managment training no real pros no real cons just missing something
good,I was responsible for the stationary department. I would look for the product that is for writing like books and note pads. I would separate them and put them in their right place. Also I would make price tag and do mark downs. I would make sure the products are facing front and that they are not out dated. It was a pleasure  working for this company I really enjoyed my job.
good,Working at staples provided me with the opportunity for advancement in a fast passed retail environment.  starting as a part-time sales associate then moving to a team supervisor after only being there for one month was a gratifying experience.  However due to budget cuts payroll mandated a corporate hours cut for all part-time associates.
good,Challenging but a fun working environment. Learning how to work the printing and copy machines. Great co-workers to work with the environment.
good,"Working at Staples was a good experience for me I learned more about how to work with copy machines and how there's more to a copier than just making copies. I also learned how to do wide format printing and scanning. I learned how to do various types of binding, cutting, machine folding etc. I learned how to work in a fast paced environment because randomly there will be rush hours at work where we will have to use all our multi-task abilities and put it to work. I enjoyed seeing my customers happy. If they left with a smile and a feeling of satisfaction I was happy because I knew I did my job and that was the best feeling."
good,"I would start the day putting out new flyers, making sure area is clean and stocked.  During the day in between customers I would re-stock computer ink's and paper. Front face all products.  Keep up the area clean and tidy.  Greet the customers with a friendly smile.  Making sure that they receive quality service."
good,"Staples fit into my life at that time.  Staples was very flexible with my hours and I was able to work as much as I needed.  "
good,The hardest part of the job was finding and delievering the criteria that needed to be found and taken care of
good,Good place to work  need more hours and pay  pretty busy with lots of customers coming through daily. Very detail oriented work. it’s an okay place to work if you don’t need to much money to survive
good,I do not have any information to share about my time working for Staples as a Copy and Print Sales Associate. I was apart of a training program and was laid off before I could have any notable experiences.
good,"Day at work included stocking and customer assistance, learned a lot about current technology, management was very linear, associates were very fun to work with."
good,"The managers at my Staples are amazing! "
good,Staples is really a revolving door and most employees are replacable. They will work with you for your hr.s to a point and management can be really self-centered normally managers are good but any higher and your dealing with people who have really lost touch with the average employee.
good,"Fast paced high stress anxiety filled atmosphere. Paid well. Able to work with little to no supervision. Good training. Enjoyable workplace UNLESS you were having issues with equipment. Ex. Forklift, Robots, Printers, Computers/screens, Staging buttons, Box Closer, Wrist rockets, Conveyors, Taping machines, Scanners both handheld and at station. Worked with many awesome good nice people who made the bad moments bearable doable because they had the same issues at times. Good pay GREAT PEOPLE."
good,Compensation should be a lot higher considering the kind of work you have to do in order to maintain professional relationships with small biz owners.
good,"It really wasn't anything special, the managers were very nice but I was not able to work as many hours as I would have liked, in general the hours were not fair, there was also no way to move up at all."
good,It was pretty simple but when I showed promised to learn the store everyone had me doing their job while they went in the back room and got on their cellphone.
good,low income retail job that progressed into a managment role.  still low paid until you get to director level.  great team to work with.  just a job until i found something in line with my degree
good,"Overall the job is manageable, but not enough hours available for all employees. I was barely making 15hrs a week. I had to get another job to make ends meet."
good,Usually only want to hire for the season (beginning of school) not a lot of hours. Stay busy not a lot of down time. People are nice to work with. Management is understanding and helpful.
good,"over all staples has a lot of energy from its employees, the managers are understanding of students and will try to work with their schedules. Great job for anyone needing to build costumer service experience or as a first job in general."
good,"Staples in Az was a fun experience that gave me long life friends. Management was okay, the supervisors were not as hard working as the sales associates."
good,"The relationship between coworkers is good and was able to make relationships with customers fairly quickly. After 2 years, a raise was finally awarded."
good,"The day to day operations at Staples Sharon DCS consists of putting out fires that could have been prevented, and constantly playing catch up."
good,This was an okay place to work. Some of the management was nice and some treated you fairly but overall I would work there. Depends on who the management is.
good,this is a company that has changed and restructured over the last 5 years to the point where you do more with less. the stores are under staffed and they will not allow any part time associates to work over 25 hours a week. Management is reduced to stock boys and are not managers any more.
good,"100 cold calls"
good,"Working at Staples Redemption Center was probably the most rewarding job I have ever had. The pace of the work environment was fast enough that I was always moving, which is important to me. I learned the importance of communicating with other employees as a lack thereof just makes situations more stressful and difficult. My co-workers were awesome people who each brought a different dynamic to the workplace making each day enjoyable. The most enjoyable part of the job actually happens outside of the workplace. People came to have personal relationships with us and would tell us stories about the parties they went to, what their kids were up to, how their job was going, and their hobbies. We in turn shared ours, and when a customer would meet us outside of the shop they would yell across the store or where ever they had seen us and introduce us to their families and loved ones. I most enjoyed being ""The Can Guy""."
good,"The individuals who work at Staples are great, but the management is terrible."
good,"Customers unhappy about their computers along with stocking issues. I learned what not to do in business just by working at Staples. Management did not have good communication with the employees or each other. A few of the co-workers did not want to do their part but the rest of us who wanted our day to run smooth a pleasant worked it out. The hardest part of the job was the unpleasant customers that had attitudes for no reason at all to try to make your day bad. The sales competitions prizes, some of my co-workers, and the customers "
good,Staples created my foundation in excelling at Customer Service to which I am very proud to say.
good,"Awesome job, I was employed for 12 years and it was a great place to work. Would still be at my job had I not been placed in a compromising position by a manager, this manager was placed on a written warning whereas I was terminated."
good,"Not a great company to work for. They aren't readily willing to work with your personal/educational scheduling issues. I have a daughter, and when she would get sick, they weren't ready to help my scheduling to take care of her at all. When I went back to school to finish my certification , they took me off the schedule completely, instead of working with me so I could still have an income to support myself and my daughter."
good,I have learnt a lot being at Staples. I have learnt that I am a born leader driven by results. I do not shy away from a challenge and want to grow in this company.
good,Great Place to work if you like people and can get along with management. Has a great customer base most are very loyal. most employees are great to work with
good,Lohg hours lots of cleaning but i did enjoy the free meals every day like the company always had a big smile at work and looked forward 2 the next dayy
good,A lot of favoritism goes on. It’s a cage A-D with over 40 people walking fast. Some people get to leave early while you are still stuck sweating your butt off. If you are trying to lose weight this is the warehouse to work.
good,"Staples will work you hard just when you think you reached your box per hour they want you faster , expect you to lift pallets fast you much on your body bathroom is too far to get too overtime called late in the day without warning sometimes"
good,They used to emphasize customer and associate development now its more of a rat race to hit metrics and quotas with customer services and engagement falling by the wayside.
good,"Personally i have had two experiences at Staples. One as a new hire, that i totally adored as well as being a sales manager. I loved those jobs, after becoming a general manager a lot changed and so have my feelings."
good,"it was a great place to work, I really enjoyed it but never got the chance to progress because the management didn't like me cuz I didn't kiss butt! But its whatever"
good,"Greet all customers entering store and assist them finding any items requested. Operated cash register to total and collect customers payments for purchases, Addressed all customer issues and complaints.  Coordinated associates schedules according to customer and store needs.  The culture was somewhat relaxed but always professional.  The hardest part  of my job there was telling a customer I couldn't fulfill their needs The best part of this position was seeing the excitement on the customer's face when I help them find that must have item."
good,"It's a fun job. You get to learn a lot about different products. I became an expert on our printers and office chairs which made the job go a lot easier. You have to always be ready to answer any technical question a customer might have. You are also expected to sell protection plans and tech support plans. If you enjoy talking to lots of different people and making (and tracking) sales, you will enjoy this job. They are also very generous with hours."
good,Great place to work at and for amazing people but pay is low and there is no room for growth . Great job for students or your first job . Definitely not a place to grow a career
good,"A good day at work would include helping out every customer, whether they were seeking help or just looked indecisive. Also, making plenty of sales and enrollment for the stores credit cards. Although a bad day would consist of my manager making it a bad day for me by giving me terrible criticism, while lacking everything positive that I would get done, having the fact that customers would leave great reviews about me on the company's website. My manager would try his best to make me want to quit so that I wouldn't over step his position because everyone knows that he barely worked hard, in no competition to my hard work ethics. By the way, I learned my job on my own, my manager never completely trained me to do tech support."
good,brought new people in and give them all the hours and the old people didn't get hours at all. So that caused a lot of old worker to leave the company like for myself
good,"A typical day at work in staples is rather busy believe it or not, I have minimal time to focus on things that need to get done for the customers. I learned a lot from staples of how to fix certain items of technology, the basics of how they fix computers..however i am NOT the one who fixes them full time. The workplace culture is a good place to be. I have made life long friends there and wish to keep in contact with."
good,A good job that challenges in a great way unless you are in a store solely based on numbers. Those places tend to treat their associates as disposable assets and overloads everyone.
good,"A day at staples consists of a slow morning with little to no projects to do up until 3 pm where we transfer onto the closing shift. everyday, every night there's a pull list that has to be done. A pull list is much like a quick inventory of whats missing from the shelves. I learned to be patient with difficult customers and how to adjust to a last minute change in my schedule (because that happened all to often at staples). Some of the managers lack communication with their ""pawns"" and often stay in a group with  their peers (other managers). The hardest part of the job is probably truck day; trying to unload the truck and dealing with customers. The  most enjoyable part of the job is when I work on in-store projects with a good productive team."
good,"My days were good. Some more stressful than others, but I like being busy so it was fun for me. I typically each day made banners, made business cards, copies, designed layouts, and helped customers with their printing needs. I learned creative design. The management was friendly. The culture was fair. There was no hard part to this job. I loved helping customers create what they needed for success in their businesses."
good,"I worked at Staples for almost 2 years and it was a very good place to work. I worked alot of hours and all I did was eat, sleep and work. I felt like I didnt have a life. All the company thought of was getting the product out and not about their employees. I did like working in the shipping department was about all I liked about the job. I liked the people that I worked iwth in the shipping department."
good,"They were bought out and were merged together which caused a lot of change and turn over because of it. my team was in change of the profiles to the new profiles and platforms. and work with merchandising dept, creative department, and salesperson for each account. and keep them on track with deadlines and new launches for new business. added prices to items on the system and changed prices for sales items. and added text and french text to the web page. always on time"
good,"The company is an ok company to work for, they aren't the worst. It is a call center environment, so you know how that works. There is opportunity to growth, but it will be years before you advance. Also, if you're the type who seeks feedback or training/development, this is not the company for you. If you're really into doing the job right the first time, this isn't the company for you. If you're looking for a decent check to get by, welcome to Staples. Don't go to HR about anything, you'd be wasting your time."
good,"managment often didnt properly support their workers, it was still a good place to learn industry related things. I think I learned the most about professional work envronemtns here"
good,"if they wouldn't do so much micromanaging, they may be able to get associates who wouldn't mind coming to work and doing a great job."
good,i loved the job itself but the management and employees were not so great. the environment was extremely hostile and as if everything going on was a secret
good,fun place to work the company is works their work ours around every individual.this is an great place to work if one is looking for a part time job.
good,Very little stopping during the day. There is a lot of learning but it is a small company with no management and no coworkers and a lot of responsibility.
good,A decent location and large store provides a lot to do in the day. Working with like minded co-workers helps make things like prepping the store more enjoyable. When it gets busy during the day time just flies by.
good,"Management was AWESOME, coworkers where cliquey and some not so welcoming. Good learning environment, good trainer. The hardest part was working around my school schedule. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing happy customers and having friendly customers."
good,Relatively paced environment with constant engagements with customers. Helpful team of co-workers that leaves no one behind. Driven by sales and places huge importance on technical knowledge. Thoroughly enjoy the amount I have and can learn from senior technicians.
good,Enjoyed working there with the employees and the customers were great people.I delivered office supplies to Duke Unv.enjoyed interacting with so many different people.
good,I like working here I just do not receive enough hours to live on.
good,"A typical day at work, I run the register, stock empty shelves, answer the phone at the customer service desk, help customers in store, opening and closing duties."
good,On a typical day at work I would be a waitress and serve members of the club.
good,"As a technician my work revolves around assisting customers with technology purchases and finding resolutions to their computer problems. As a Staples associate my work involves anything and everything except management work. My stores management is awesome and I enjoy working for them, but the corporate culture seems determined to cut costs everywhere and this means you barely get scheduled unless you are management. Hardest part of my job is dealing with the barely there working hours. Most enjoyable is helping the customers and having them come back and say ""Thanks for that, it was just what I needed."""
good,I would go in and start my inventory check as soon as I started my day. I then would go where ever I was needed. I learned very specific details about Android and Apple Products. The managers were very outgoing and would help with whatever was needed. My co-workers were all helpful and we would all do everything whether we were supposed to or not. The hardest part of the job was learning about all the electronics that we had in the store. The most enjoyable part was how my hard work was getting noticed by my managers.
good,"Management constantly being rearranged, makes the work place very tedious. No flexibility for working students. Co-workers very nice and helpful; much solidarity amongst everyone."
good,The company as a whole is good but lacks proper employee training.
good,I worked at 2 Staples locations. Each store and location is different. Generally speaking depending on your manager it could be good or bad. The 2 locations I worked at were both decent. I have seen some workers at staples at different locations that were suffering and I seen some workers at a different location that was having a blast and enjoying everyday.
good,"A typical work day at Staples consists of first clocking in and greeting the customers as they walk in. What I learned at Staples is to take my time with things and not to be so impatient. To work together and build a system of trust with your co-workers and supervisors. Being reliable and motivated is a big contribution to the day. The hardest part of the job would have to be dealing with the stubborn and mean customers, what i learned about dealing with customers that want to fight with you is to maintain calm and do not let them get to you and never to yell back, the customers are always right. The most enjoyable part of being a Sales Associate is i get to meet different people everyday and have the opportunity to get to know each customer on a personal level."
good,"its was ok, the management team doesn't stand behind you during tuff times"
good,I learned a lot on how to structure myself and daily work routine.
good,"well staples like any other retail store is a good place to work go in clock in get coffee work the floor. I generally go check to see what computers need service, start the services and work the floor, help customers and deal with complaints. Management is mixed with personalities. The hardest part is trying to prove myself in the work place. I feel that my military occupation is what is keeping my management from giving me the opportunities to advance. And the most enjoyable part of working there is all of my friends. Great Co-Workers and good Team work"
good,Learning new job skill and applying my school skills in real life experience.
good,"the job was hard at times especially having to lift heavy boxes and put them on skids "
good,The company itself is great and focused on the right priorities but there is definitely a disconnect between the company‘s motivational techniques and the approach from lower level management.
good,"So I enjoyed working with the people here, but I am not a stand in one place all day type of person. I couldn't stay here, because they couldn't work with my other schedule."
good,"The amount and nature of the work for my particular job makes it hard to achieve a sense of accomplishment. The flow of incoming work is constant and the nature of the issues can be complex. We work salaried and management is flexible about work/life balance but the workload has a tendency to be too heavy for the amount of people completing it. Staples has a ""do more with less"" attitude."
good,"The job was amazing and everyone was very nice to each other, all but the General Manager. Apparently the GM is untouchable by HR and the terrible work either that GM provided ruined my taste in working at staples and I lost all motivation in working there."
good,"Pros"
good,"Most associate jobs are part-time, thus, no benefits such as health insurance or 401k. The job is demanding and expectations-and-definition of success is constantly changing. Be ready to work and learn how to deal with all kinds of people."
good,Staples could be a good place to work but low wages paid makes turnover frequent and lack of comprehensive training makes jobs fairly stressful. Good people for the most part and interesting products plus good customer base gives it high potential.
good,Overall Staples was a really fun place to work. None of us can choose our co-workers and this place did have a high turnover rate. Some management played favorites and did not evenly distribute day to day cleaning and merchandising.
good,"Staples, all your office supply needs in one building. One must bring their A game to each shift and be able to provide customer service no matter what your role is. The hardest part of the job would be time managing and the most enjoyable part of the job would be seeing the satisfaction of a happy customer or superior."
good,"I enjoyed being a loader for the most part. Organizational skills are key though, stacking and organizing at the pace needed can be very difficult. The people I worked with were all right, but prone to cause conflict when things got tough. The commute to make what it did may or may not have be all right, I didn't have a preference at  the time. The gave me good full time hours, and paid the best out of every job I've had."
good,The hours were made to keep very few long term employees. Only a handful of Full-time employees the rest were Part-time and dont get more than 25 hours but mostly no more than 15-18 per employee. the competitive nature of being a sales person of a technician cost me by relocating me to front end cashier when my education said I was a qualified technician and that was what I was hired for. I love working with the community and my Customer Service has always been great so working the Front End was not a problem for me.It became a advancement killer for me no chance for raise and no chance for hours and it became hard for me to support myself somedays not even having the money to finish my work week.
good,"The checkout system is the slowest I have ever used, but it's okay because an office supply stare is rarely ""slammed."" The environment is relaxed and reliable."
good,This was a summer job. The conditions were good and management was supportive. I did not like having to clean the restrooms. The customers were friendly.
good,"Staples was a interesting experience, fast pace and precise. It was good working with customers, but the management was not so good. Being able to interact with customers and meet their wants was satisfying and rewarding. But I felt like the management was very ignorant as they gave me shifts during school hours that I could not make, which I was exceptionally clear during the interview about."
good,Staples was a good place to work especially if you're a student. Sales are pushed really hard especially in the Easy Tech department. If you can sell and are good at what you do you can enjoy working here.
good,"Reached out to my account base to set appointments maximizing sales through lines of business for Break Room, Facilities, Print, Promo, Furniture, MPS and Computer Products and serviced a notable account base."
good,"When I first started working there I had amazing managers, even when one relocated to another store the next manager came in and I liked him because I knew him, we used to work together. As soon as he left to go to another store a third manager came in and we were oil and water.  He didn’t respect my views, nor my opinions, he didn’t work with me instead worked against me and every day was awful. Then we got a new district manager and that was even worse. She didn’t do things properly, didn’t care about anyone’s opinion just her own and thought her changes were great. How would she know, she never worked a day in the store before, not like us, we work every day in a store and maybe they should start taking opinions from us."
good,"I worked for Staples as an Operations Manager for over 7 years.  In that time span, I became a General Manager Designate and learned much about the operational side of running a store.  I also learned much about sales, profit and margin, inventory, customer service and retail in general. Unfortunately, the company was slow to adjust to meet their competition.  This lead to stores not making sales, downsizing, closing stores and eliminating positions.  I have no regrets about working there and I was able to meet some great people and have some great experiences."
good,I enjoyed the technical aspect of the job and being able to work on and fix computers. The pay was a little low for anything more than a temporary job.
good,"a typical day was busy, management was very friendly and helpful, the hardest part of the job was finishing late nights in the cold, the most enjoyable was the people you meet and get to work along side with."
good,"Depending on the day, work went easy. I took care of customers and restocked. Other days like holidays and back to school were not fun to deal with rude customers."
good,Conform to the culture in order to thrive...can be very cliquey. Expected to work through lunch (eat at your desk). If you aren't dedicated and working overtime without complaining this probably isn't the best company for you.
good,Solid organization. Typical retail work. Long hours and not a steady set of hours week to week. Can be a great place to start a career and learn how to manage a team.
good,"I think the people working at Staples are some of the best people with the best attitudes, however, I highly doubt if the company itself actually values it's employees. There aren't ever enough hours, benefits are weak, and they work you like your a tool as opposed to being a human being."
good,The day start by reading the ad to get familiar with what in sale at the job. I like working at staples because of the customer I meet. The con about working at staples is not too many hours and short breaks
good,"Local store manager was great. The support from the District and Regional levels was not good. Very little support from the District Manager to achieve corporate goals. District level expectations were not supported by training nor were staffing hours conducive to maintaining store readiness, i.e. displays, stock rooms, overall store look and cleanliness."
good,"Can be a very fun job, management setup poorly, lowest level employees go straight to store managers for everything, no point in having supervisors. Also sups have 0 authority."
good,"I have learned a lot from my work. I can talk to everyone easily, if I need help, I cam ask any question to my lead. Always, keep smile with everyone at work. If we are sick, and not able to go to work, call our manager or supervisor at a time"
good,"I appreciate the opportunity that Staples gave me. It's a good company, but they don't pay well. My job wasn't too challenging."
good,"Basically, the people I work with (most of them well under 40 yrs old) are ""nice"". Very ethnically cliched but civil for the most part."
good,The most enjoyable part was seeing the progression of the associates who move up and became managers themselves. I learned the most important part to motivate associates was to find out what motivates them and let them excel in their position.
good,"It's a fair place to work. Employees are young and a lot of part time staff. Team work is promoted but not necessarily applied.. As most retail stores, lots of tagging to do and constant changes and rotations in the store. All in all it's an ok place."
good,"Good people to work with, customers tend to have negative attitudes"
good,I typical day involved PC diagnostics and repairs such as hard drive replacement operation systems install  Computer memory upgrades.  Retail sales through out the technology portion of the store.
good,Staples wasn't that bad of an employer but did have more cons than pros. They would make simple tasks seems difficult and didnt hve a set job description for any employee
good,"Management generally helped do plan-o-grams as well as stock counters and carry out heavy items for customers. Scheduling was mostly full time associates during the days, part time on nights, weekends and holidays, as it should be. Managers did not over manage instead employees were well trained and self motivated.  Loves that I was left alone to do my job. The best part of the job was the bonus program they had in the late 1990's early 2000's that allowed everyone in the store to benefit therefore inspiring employees to take more interest in doing their jobs well. The worst part of the job was to many requirements to sell additional items such as rewards cards, warranties, emailed receipts, item of the month all at check outs while still wanting a fast friendly checkout."
good,"overall, I did not have a bad experience while working with Staples other than the fact that they will almost never make you full-time. No matter how great your performance is they will not give you a raise or increase your hours by much. Management is usually pretty good. Co-workers what can I say, you have some good and some bad. This company has a high turnover rate as far as I know and there is a reason for that. Hardest part of the job is walking all day and dealing with upset customers. But what can I say.. It's retail."
good,My day at Staples would every busy especially working int he copy center. Copy Center is the most busy and stressful departments. I've learned how to deal with impatience customers (rude customers). Also I've learned how to work with different equipments  and become a better person. My co workers some weren't easy to work with but they are good people. The hardest part of job is working long hours and not able to get a break because people call out off work.
good,fun place to work great management great coworkers supportive big company personal growth chushJDIAHDvu vshaeiowSDCnzx jbcfsiulSJDIZCXHNBJioAshcznjs fWIO;RjavznXK Hbfe:dvZ HUCVJHFU
good,"My position within the company is one of a specialty department within a traditional big box retailer.  I am personally responsible for the training of all employees within that department, setting and achieving sales goals, and building and maintaining relationships with our customers.  Many of our traditional business customers have been digitizing or cutting back on their printing budget, which leaves us with a less sophisticated, more consumer-oriented clientele."
good,"I live and work in a fast paced work environment which sometimes require teamwork.  Being a Supervisor can be challenging but also rewarding.  Customer Service is the key to making or breaking a company.  The upmost lifting part of my days are producing quality work that the customer will be satisfied with and the vision they had pictured.  Creativity has a role to achieve the impossible.  Multi tasking, juggling everyday activities, supervising and handling everything thing can be stressful but its all a Journey. The Journey is all ways exciting."
good,typical day at work was good until the manage showed up and started saying random stuff to you for no reason. Hardest part was when you knew more about you department than the manager and had to go along with their wrong even when you they were wrong had to go with it cause managers are always right.
good,"The perks of working here are pretty cool. You get to see concerts, award ceremonies, and sports events for free. See different celebrities and see major networks set up outside. Starting out they don't have a lot of hours to give you. You really have to hang in there awhile to get consistent hours. I noticed a lot of favoritism in management which made me a little weary of working there.This was saddening for me because I wanted to work my way up in a company. I believe work should be conducted in a professional manner.Favoritism can easily lead to other unprofessional behavior in the workplace.Ultimately I left when I realized you can only get promoted for kissing butt not necessarily working hard."
good,"I really liked working on computers because that's what i am in school for that's really the only reason i took that job because all it paid was minimum wage and i was trying to work my way through school, but as it turns out. Its pretty hard to live off minimum wage."
good,"Better than most retail companies, but still lacking in some areas. Advancement generally hits a block, with little regard to potential."
good,the job is pretty simple come in do customer service. Make sure the sales floor is nice and neat. Wait for sales goods to arrive pack out all the product on the sales floor. Do an inventory check before leaving the store clean and prepare the sales floor for the next day.
good,Great atmosphere and friendly staffing make this a fun place to work. There are always fun projects that allow creativity to flow.
good,"Working with children, assisting teachers"
good,corporate needs to make field distribution centers with the same perks as them
good,It was ok. A typical day at staples was amazing. Great mangagers and coworkers. No complaints
good,"easy place to work, but expect to be a backup cashier if you are floor associate.  it takes away from your own tasks"
good,Come in to work and get started right away on print jobs that need to be completed.  The jobs would range from simply printing and file to creating a document from scratch.  Throughout the day I would take other jobs either from online or walk-ins.  I really enjoyed seeing people light up when they receive their job and it looks great.
good,"Overall I have found Staples to be a decent company to work for.  In the coarse of the day I would manage anywhere between 4 and 8 employees.  After receiving my promotion to the Team Supervisor position I was responsible for managing all employees of the store along with handling customer satisfaction/problems/issues/etc, as well as managing all other aspects of the retail environment.  I was responsible for receiving store inventory, training employees, and overall store operations.  "
good,"this is a brilliant first job, the staff are all friendly, there is opportunity for advancement on occasion."
good,"The company seems to offer a strong sense of favoritism, at least at the store i was at. More opportunities were offered to the people who the DM favored most. And thats not the correct way to run a company. There were also a lot of empty promises."
good,It's a pretty good work environment. Can't say more about it.
good,"The place I worked at didn't know what was going on. One of their team leaders on the Easy Tech side didn't know half the electronics. I was helping a customer with a printer and they were happy. When she took over, she took them to the most expensive printer we had and the customer wasn't happy and walked out and never returned."
good,"The associates at Staples are very friendly, easy going and make you feel a part of their family. The management is friendly as well but can be a bit intimidating at times. Some of the customers have no respect for other human beings and treat associates like slaves. However, this mainly depends on the location of the business, at least that is how I feel."
good,Great employees but a company going through many changes right now
good,Was thankful for the job but i wasnt really put to good use at this former employer. My abilities could have been better maximized somewhere else.
good,"    I enjoyed working in many different roles during my employment at Staples, the experience gained throughout my time there will be a valuable asset. As the push for online buying and selling has now hit retail even more this year, Staples as a company is restructuring its retail stores to adapt to the changing times. my job position no longer exists there along with several others as they continue to downsize, or I would still be there."
good,"I call customers and you are promised the world when starting this such as you will receive bonuses and advancement. Pretty much all lies. The management team is great, but upper management could use a few sensitivity classes and learn that Staples is not the whole picture."
good,I like my co-workers. If it wasn't for them I don't think I would still be there. When work is slow its nice to have a joke with them and chat. When it's busy - too busy. Well then that's when this job sucks. They make you work 44 hours because they can. Don't even asks if we
good,Overall fun environment customers are a little testy in the copy center though. the assistant manager should have been the store manager. I was in the copy center for about 6 months before my supervisor found a different job. I ended up training her replacement which i thought was unfair.
good,Led the store to top of district in products sold
good,My daily task included helping customers on the sales floor as well as the computers that came in for service repair.
good,"I enjoyed the 4 years I worked for staples, through many different managers and store directors. I found that the last crew we had before I left was a great team but management was showing a lot of favoritism, even to the point of costing people jobs. Watched many good employees get fired over small things. But I loved to value the company placed on Customer Service and in making things right for people with issues on their orders/service."
good,"Staples is focused on the future of the company, and will try anything to advance the company."
good,"Working at first seemed to be tedious at some points and I felt anxious at times because there was a lack of communication at some points. However, when I talked more to my supervisor and co-workers things became a lot easier."
good,"cultivating relationships with customers, specifically Small Business customers. Will take around four months to feel like you know what you are doing."
good,I liked the job but the pay was not worth it.  The other workers were very helpful and quick to jump in and help whenever needed.  I wouldn’t suggest this job to people just because of the pay.
good,It's an okay job to start while being in high school. You do have fun at work depending on the shift and who's working. Stocking Is the only thing that hurts you because sometimes the other employees either don't care where stuff goes and just puts items randomly or they stock shelve but not neatly so you end up fixing it and making it neatly over and over again.
good,Staples in South Bend was a good first job opportunity and I started out with very reasonable hours (only 5 hr shifts) I left due to constant pressure to sell things people don’t want and also because they were moving towards longer shifts (8-9 hour shifts) which I didn’t like due to being a busy college student.
good,"I like working at Staples because every day is different, you get to meet a lot of cool individuals, & the work environment is pretty easy going. Everyone at Staples for the most part has a good attitude that makes working fun. I would recommend Staples as a good first job for any teens looking for an easy & fun job."
good,Great people i worked with although management was very judgmental and hard on a people. Overall i enjoyed the atmosphere and going experiences in different places like customer services and cashier. It may be my first job but it taught me a lot.
good,"Stock Shelves- load product onto shelves "
good,Good people pay was a bit low but that's is determined on location. Did work long hours. The middle management was not very strong. Training is lacking
good,"Overall, the company is nice to work with. It's an easy job to do, but the opportunity for advancement is almost non-existent. I've been promised a supervisor role multiple times and every time, a newer, more bright-eyed employee has gotten it. Seniority and loyalty seem to mean nothing at this company."
good,I had good managers. I would recommend them. Benefits are only for full time and part time you only receive up to 20 hours and maybe more. You can work at other stores at the same time.
good,I would recommend this job for others. I would work their again if I had the chance to. It was only a seasonal job but it was helpful for me in many ways.
good,"A typical day at work was fairly routine, coming in at posted hours we would help customers find what they needed and take turns on lunch breaks. The best part of the job were the people working there, if ever a customer had a question I couldn't answer my co-workers were always there to help."
good,"was there for 17+ years in Business Development and Account Management. Learned the ""Staples Way"" sales approach which I became very comfortable with. the approach starts with an ""upfront agreement"" with each potential customer that there will be next steps at the end of each meeting. "
good,I'm proud to be part of this team and the knowledge I've gained working here. It has added great value and experience to my professional career. The culture is great and the atmosphere with my colleagues is fun and professional.
good,"Staples from my perspective was a little understaffed, and asked more from current employees than met the job requirements.  Management did the best they could with the resources provided."
good,"I think they should hire more from within, give us a chance.  Instead of hiring outside people for higher positions, ask the people that work there first.  Open it up to us first."
good,I traveled 78 miles one way to a store passing 2 on my way there. Was promised a new position by the DM in a closer store and when she advanced. the new DM put a stop to all plans to advance or move people as planned.
good,"The work that you have to put in is very tedious, heavy lifting, standing, and walking around on concrete for 12+ hours every day/night. Was very stressful to hit the time quota's."
good,"Great place to work do need to improve on awarding there employees for hard work and going able and beyond the call of duty. Like all companies, they need to realize happy employees do grwat work."
good,"As a Copy and Print Supervisor, there's alot of sales goals that need to be achieved, there is not much help from management explaining on how to achieve these goals. You are expected to know everything about Marketing and Business products, the good part is that you meet new people everyday and get to interact with different businesses and learn more about people's needs and you develop sales pitches and tools as you go along."
good,"I worked at the Staples in Delavan.  I enjoyed the people I worked with, and the team spirit and camaraderie.  I worked in the copy and print center, and enjoyed it very much."
good,"A very good company that spent too much time, effort and money chasing a merger that never happened. Good people left. Company lost their focus and identity."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is working with the other employees, also interacting with the customers. My typical day includes cycle counts, returns, and customer service."
good,I worked there for a couple of years when I first started college.  It was a fun part time job and the atmosphere was nice.  I learned some great skills while working there.
good,"Although pay and benefits were good, management was poor and caused stress. If things went right at you stops the day was good. If you needed assistance, managment was not very helpful."
good,at staples as a cashier you first start your day by getting a pad with your goal for the day. the rest of the day you stock candy handle customers and the money as well as toner and ink recycles. You also need to get sails for square trade for electronic and furniture items.
good,"A typical day at work involves helping customers, stocking shelves, putting out freight, an reorganizing the store."
good,"I enjoyed my time with Staples, and it is unfortunate that they decided to have all computer repair outsourced to another company instead of working on machines in their locations for their community."
good,"I had the typical cashier job. My manager was the worst. My house burned down while I was at work, when I told him I needed to leav just an hour early (on a Sunday even) because of what was happening, he told me to get over it. I left anyway. Later that week I called to tell him that I wouldn't be able to make my next scheduled shift and he yelled at me. It was my last week anyway and I was only scheduled to fill in gaps and help out."
good,"My typical day at work was alright could be great on some days being a cashier and dealing different personalities ""sure"" I had fun days where I would see my fav customers and some days I would have the usual grumpy can't get their way customers. Every day was the same making sure the front end was clean no clutter and made sure I was always aware of my surroundings.  Filled ink, censored ink, had to give ""great customer service"" try to push more accounts in and rewards program. Made sure to meet our quota every day or every other day.  The majority in my area was a bunch of stuck up ignorant people. Some of my coworkers were lazy or just slow (in the face and personality) meaning you always had to be underneath them to do something because in their eyes they think everything is good they don't care what happens because they did their part but in reality, it is not I've made some good bonds with some."
good,"I had a good team when I worked at Staples. I worked with the EasyTech team and was able to assist customers fix hardware and install software when they needed it. My other role was to help sell equipment (computers, printers, etc.) to a customer for the best price possible to meet their needs. This includes software and other hardware the customer may not have thought they needed at the time."
good,"As a department supervisor, I was given unrealistic expectations to reach. Yearly reviews were skewed and no big raises were given. As a job though, it was a great daily job. Where I worked had great co workers and management. For the most part the customers were great as well. Good benefit options when offered."
good,"Learned how to edit and print documents, business cards, ect. for customers. That I was able to be creative at times was a plus for me. Coworkers were also enjoyable to work with."
good,Working at staples wasn't so bad i was a cashier and i always had something to. Coworkers are very nice. They are open for growth but sadly i wanst there for so long.
good,the job was fine and I loved what I did it was the management that was missing. if the management didn't change the store would be so much better than it is
good,Worked here when I was a teenager. It was a good first job. Coworkers were nice and management stepped in when needed. Pay was okay for a first job. Overall good job for no experience
good,was not bad at all  though when i went to move they didnt  help me change stores Work there itself was exciting thogh I had to lift heavy items alone when store was shorthanded
good,"I enjoyed my time working for Staples. It's a great company that takes good care of it's employees. The benefits and office environment were great. I would definitely recommend it to anyone."
good,"If someone is willing to put out the effort, the Part-time position can become nearly full time by making yourself available and by calling in often to see if they need help. Management has total buy-in to the culture and training of employees."
good,"great company to work for. good hours. good pay. free food.The Executive team is out of touch and does not believe in their people. They reside in an area of the building that is closed off to all other employees and rarely ever interact with staff. Over the last several years 8+ jobs have opened at the officer and executive levels and many good, qualified internal candidates have applied. Only one opening was filled internally."
good,It was a good first job considering the season I worked there at and how hectic it was. Gave me more experience than I would of gotten otherwise. The staples website was also easy to navigate for the associates as well as the employee discount wasn't so bad.
good,Typical work day there is pretty slow unless it's school season. I learned a lot about electronics and computers. Also sold plenty of office supplies. The management wasn't bad. They switched managers quite a few times in my period of time of being there. Hardest part is dealing with some of the customers. Best part is that it is easy.
good,"Staples would be a great company to work for years ago, being that they where privately bought out last week there are many changes and lay offs. I would say most employees are team players."
good,"It's an okay place to work, just like any other retail job. It really isn't terribly busy year round, back to school time is the worst. Overall it's a good place for a part time job while in school or while you find something better."
good,"A great place to work for college students, great flexibility !  Perfect place for for your first job if your a teen !  The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with friendly and grateful customers."
good,"It is a decent place to work- but very hard labor involved. Supposed to be ""small "" package delivery. Very fast pace is expected, management is horrible. Hardest part of the job is putting up with management. The enjoyable part is all the great customers you get to meet."
good,"A typical day was pretty boring, nothing would go on for hours at a time in most days. My coworkers were nice and helpful, very few things ever actually went wrong. Nothing really exceptional and nothing terrible really."
good,a good place to work. I first started the 6 pm to midnight shift but then the opportunity came up for me to switch to the 3 pm to 8 pm shift. The work itself is easy once you get the hang of it.
good,"Most of the work is easy and its applicable to my desired field of work. I enjoy working at Staples however, the customers can get intense and the work load can get large. I'm not too much of a fan of the management and how things are organized, it seems to be a bit of a mess on that part. BUT the job itself is good."
good,"somewhere that will stick with me forever. it taught wonderful customer service practices and the concept of a completely happy customer. they also taught me how to sell something that no person would ever actually need, a skill that is very useful."
good,I loved this job but it was retail.. I loved the money room duties as well as price auditor. My favorite the most was doing planograms. Cons of working there is the work schedules days change and pay is minimum wage.
good,A typical day starts with going through totes and getting all tech items onto the shelves and then checking labels to sure we have the right prices before the outlet opens
good,"Very impersonal and lots of cliques. High-stress, but a very organized company. I definitely gained a lot of knowledge in this part of my career."
good,"Warehouse work is great if you like to mostly work on your own, and I have had a good experience only problem is that you are sometimes REQUIRED to do some overtime"
good,"Typical day here consisted of stocking, assisting customers, making the store look nice, setting up planograms when needed, taking down old ones or redoing them, cleaning, and assisting in other departments as necessary. I learned inventory, cash register operation, scanner usage, and how to deal with customers, among a great many other things that one learns in their first retail job. The management in my store was great, albeit sometimes a bit tough to deal with. Supportive for the most part and willing to teach you new things. Coworkers were great for the most part, willing to lend a hand when you needed it and not often causing trouble for anyone else. Things ran pretty smoothly across the board. The hardest part came for me when things were updated. Plans needed to be pushed more frequently and the required number of plans you needed to sell increased as well. For the department I worked it, which had very few things that plans were offered for, it was difficult to make that number especially when competing with other members in the store who also had to reach that number. It became more about selling plans and signing up rewards members than it did about helping our customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I was tasked with breaking down truck. Hard labor where I could work and not be bothered, and also accomplishing something large was always a nice break from the tedious straightening of messed up products."
good,i had a good experience and earn it as well too bad they just listen to some certain people very unfair but good job so far they give you good hours of over time
good,I was only here on a temporary basis and unfortunately the assignment came to an end. I basically batched payments from different lockboxes and then posted to correct accounts
good,Great opportunities to service and meet new people. It was wonderful to assist customers in solving problems and providing them with the attention that I would like as well.
good,"I enjoyed working with a lot of my coworkers, we all got along and worked together well. Some of my managers weren't very agreeable, but others were and worked with us to improve our experience working there."
good,"It has been a great learning experience working at Staples. It is definitely a more demanding retail chain. This is definitely not a job where you walk in expecting to just walk around and get paid to do nothing. They expect high quality service out of each employee, which I pride myself on. There is continuous training that you go through to keep improving yourself as an employee."
good,"At work you will always be on your feet either helping customers, maintaining inventory, processing online orders, and organizing the store in general."
good,"Une journée de travail se résume offrir nos services aux clients afin de les aider le plus possible à obtenir ce qu'ils souhaitent. J'ai appris que même s'il y a des clients plus demandant que d'autre, il est important de faire son maximum pour l'aider."
good,"Overall a good place to work, not much flexibility in schedules. Many events to show gratitude for the service of the employees, work not too difficult and also never boring."
good,This is a good job for a teen to start working. Trying to build there life up by working. I recommend it for starters. They work with your hours if being needed to. I learn tech support training very exciting! Management was empathetic to my needs when i had an issue.Co-workers where very friendly to eachother ( like family). hardest part of the job was inventory control. Most enjoyable was when we had compitition of highest selling record; gain incentives.
good,"When I first started at Staples everything made sense. Most directives from corporate had a direct reason and result. Now direction comes from too many sources and resources are tight. So tight it is nearly impossible to perform every minute expectation that is asked."
good,Forever changing.Tried to stay up on new technology.  It all depends on how much management wants to invest in their associates.
good,"This was a great experience for me to work in my field. I was able to get hands on skills as to re sizing images as well as retouching images for store banners. I liked my co workers, which were friendly and very helpful when I needed assistance."
good,"Good staff but very poorly ran company, very hard to progress with continuous redundancies being made, difficult to see where the company is going, learnt an awful lot about retail, used to be really good to work for."
good,A lot of slow nights. Very flexible your able to interact  with your team and get the job done. Basic level IT demands that mostly anyone can do
good,"Paper, paper and paper, Paper is Staples bread and butter. Heavy lifting and specialised deliveries were a daily must. Customer service a must as well."
good,"For every job you start as a seed looking for a way to grow and improve. At Staples your shirt color defines your ability to move upwards in the company. And the clouds of micromanagement loom overhead, be prepared for breath down your neck. To ensure the utmost quality experience you will be tasked with reporting in every day for not meeting your quota of sign ups. Enjoy the world of retail."
good,"The hardest part is when it is busy, answering call after call, endless ringing in your ear.  After 10 years, I need a change but there are many who have 10+ years at this center, for a reason- great benefits."
good,working at Staples was a fun and enjoyable experience I had a great relationship with management and co workers however  the compensation I was not pleased with.
good,"my day would start by clocking in then assisting all customers with various products for their purchase. I assist in all areas of the store operations by ringing in the point of sale to working in the copy center and mail center. I have learned a lot in relation to tracking inventory and technical information concerning PC electronics."
good,"I started at Staples as a Part Time Team Supervisor.  It was a new position in 2013 and by 2015 was eliminated.  I am now an Team Member Associate.  A typical day at work depending on the day could be setting plano's on a non truck day to working live load.  We get one truck a week on Tuesday and it is usually finished by Thursday.  On non truck days I can be doing plano""s, helping the other associates, helping with copy center.  I have done the cash office, deposits.  I also at one point opened and closed the store.  I use a hand held computer every day for specific placement to make sure we have plano integrity.  Hardest part of my job is I am so used to being salary and working until the job is done.  At 25 hours a week I do get  frustrated as to not being able to finish what I have started.  The most enjoyable part is having fun with the customers.  Getting them what they need"
good,"fun workplace, good training, friendly people, own work space, casual dress, not micro managed. The work is steady, compensation great, great benefits,"
good,J'ai adoré travailler à cette entreprises malheureusement je cherche autre chose à cause des coupures de postes et d'heures
good,The organization is full of great people that care about internal and external customers.  The associates work hard to take the organization to the next level.
good,"Steady pay raises, some management relate well with employees.  Some management is horrible and have no idea what they are doing.  Favoritism exists."
good,"Because it was around ""back to school"" time, the store would get hectic and overwhelming. My managers and co-workers helped me adapt to this time of atmosphere and feel extremely comfortable asking them for assistance. A typical day at work is working the register and helping a few customers find items. The most enjoyable part of the job was the feeling of independence it gave me."
good,"I loved working there. The other staff was always friendly"
good,"Staples is a good place to work, generally centered around the younger employee.  I enjoy working there, however the work I do is physically challenging."
good,I think its a great place to work and lots of opportunites and they really value their employees. I have had some great mentors and have been able to understand the communication it involves to be a leader and helper.
good,"A typical work day at staples consist of me coming in and clocking in. I would notice that the employees and costumers in the store were always smiling, busy or not. Management was always on the floor making sure everything was going the way it was suppose to. I loved coming into work and getting all of my inventory things done making the rest of my day easier when it would come to helping employees."
good,"Answering phone calls 95 percent of the day. Currently learning the print world and how to spec forms for custom printing. I work with a good group of people who are supportive of each other. It's a small team and when one person is not at work, the whole team feels the affects. The hardest part of the job is the unrealistic expectations that management wants, which is to stay available to take calls all day but still manage to complete other tasks at the same time such as replying to emails and making outbound calls to follow up with customers. Working as a team with my co-workers."
good,its a good job if yu wrk part time and very good if yur a student. i loved working here until the staff gets too comforable.
good,"The things I learned were properly executing customers orders via online products or in-store services in the copy & print department, even orders placed in store for delivery."
good,Staples started out good but then they cut hours and changed benefits.
good,"My daily routine at Staples was quite interesting. I worked as a cashier depositing all cash and credit card transactions, and I also assist and explained  product details to customers. My two manager were awesome. They diffused problems immediately. They listened to their workers, they compensate and acknowledge the good work coming from employees. My co-workers were very energetic and hard working. The hardest part of my job was staying over an additional two hours after my shift on a daily basis to clean up the store. The most enjoyable part of this job was mastering, how to multitask. Staple was a demanding job, and you would have to do several things at once."
good,"•	In charge of the other cashiers to make sure they were doing their jobs"
good,"Good company to work for to get started in print, but no money to be made unless you move up within the company outside of the retail environment. There is lots of chances for promotion within the retail store but comes to a sad halt past that even with a degree."
good,"Heavy lifting tight schedule"
good,"I build pallets, wrap them and then load them in the semi trailers"
good,A typical day was standing at the cash register and helping on the floor. It was a simple job and mostly fun. The people I worked with were great. The managers did not know my name after I had worked there for a while which was very irritating. I was also scheduled almost every weekend and told I may not have a job if I request time off.
good,Joes was a really good place to work at. I learned quite a bit about working in a office type setting.
good,Learned operating ERP IBM AS-400 and handheld device. Inventory control.
good,"Staples is a decent company to work for all in all. The take-home pay scale is extremely low; which is my biggest complaint. But the comparable benefits makes up for it. You will be exposed to all the latest information that technology has to offer. There are free trials of the latest software that is released that is given to all tech associates. There are also discounts and special pricing on pretty much everything imaginable. Like I stated before, the only huge problem I had with the position I was in was that it does not pay worth a darn. Loved the job, but that wasn't putting food of the table."
good,Staples was a busy place to work but I enjoyed every minute of it.
good,"co workers are fun to work with"
good,"Great company goals/values, bad execution by managers and executives"
good,"Staples is a great company to work for, however, the job description doesn't apply to its standards. The job is fast pace and accurate restocking methods."
good,learned alot about computers and business's good management also good co-workers dealing with public hardest part trying to make everyone happy
good,"Depending on the shift, I would be in either Cash or Print Center. I greet any customer help the find the items or take their Print orders. Help cash out any customers or help with any returns. I finish any daily paper work and help where ever needed."
good,"Staples is an easy place to work, the crew is great at my branch and if you want a relatively easy day and dont want to make a whole lot of money its definetly the place to go. As a cashier your basic duties are to greet customers, clean bathrooms, answer phones, help with stocking shelves and blocking and running registers. "
good,I was in charge of the copy centre learned new things everyday. best part was ensuring customers left happy with what we processed for them
good,"Staples was a great place to work, with high-quality staff and a genuine desire to fully satisfy the customer, not just sell them merchandise and/or services."
good,"On a typical day at the job, i was responsible for the customer service area where i performed transactions such as, typical purchases to returns, and exchanges. My managers were okay, never really had any complains about them, as far as my co-workers we all tried hard to work together and get the job done.The most enjoyable part about the job was when we closed and had to put all the returns away. the reason why is because that's when all of the employees got to know each other more without worrying about a customer."
good,"Worked the customer service desk, helped customers on the floor, built furniture, pulled items, stocked shelves, took inventory overnight, employee of the month twice"
good,Work for me at Staples was a very enjoyable learning experience. A typical day always included a high level of customer interaction. I learned how to operate various machines and all other duties pertaining to the copy center. Management always maintained a comfortable setting and were very helpful in resolving employee related issues. My co-workers and myself developed a close relationship and we were always willing to assist one another. The hardest part of the job was balancing multiple orders and making sure they were ready in a timely manner. The most enjoyable part of working at Staples is interacting with the customers and providing them with excellent customer service.
good,Overall a good place to work for starters but not a long term provider for stable job sustenance.
good,Typical retail. The company was fun to work for. The managers were great and fun.
good,nice place to work on your people skills. Managment dosent comunicate well with the lower level employment.
good,Staples is a great place to work beacuse of the family oriented environment that is presented at this company. They do alot of different activities for their employees.
good,"Great place to work and grow with the company up to store management levels. You will need to dedicate abundant time (including nights, weekends, and holidays) in order to succeed in a management position. The culture and values of this company are directly influenced by district/regional management in a highly competitive market."
good,"I love printing things for people everyday, and I love getting to know my customers. My main issue with this job is that I am part time, so I can receive as little as 10 hours if my manager is low on hours any given week. I would like to have a job with stable hours and stable income. Another issue I have with this job is that my managers will force me and other people in my (Print and Marketing) department to do the jobs of other departments."
good,"My career at Staples was comprehensive and fulfilling. There were always daily challenges, but the rewards outweighed any negatives. The benefits were also very good."
good,It was a good job. Made enough money to make a living. 40 plus hours most of the times and the work wasn't to hard. Independent worker. You wouldn't have to many people looking over your shoulder
good,"More good days than bad days!  Depending on the managers on duty your day could be poor or great, and when help was there it made for smoother work days, but the company limited how many hours the store could have overall, so we ran short on help sometimes."
good,Working for this company was definitely hard work. Alot of lifting and walking around a huge warehouse. The management was awesome. Could always talk to a manager with a problem you had. Unfortunately the hours I was working was not right for me.
good,The managers did a great job at always having their employees back but there is only so much they can do. Copy Center is busy and people can be harsh if you're not on the ball.
good,"Working at staples was very fast paced. Everything needs to get done quickly and efficiently, no matter which department you wind up in."
good,"Most of my time was spent trying to sell warranties, service plans, and product replacement plans on devices.  The company puts a lot of value on those (from a tech standpoint) because that's how they make money.  Was able to help lots of customers, but at the same time, your value to the company (or at least management) is limited to what you can sell, and how you can package that sale."
good,This is a great job to start at and also to be in school with you can make your schedule around what you need and just not good for career to stay and grow
good,"Staples is a good place to work. People are helpful and willing to give pointers. Benefits are very good too."
good,"Staples is a great place for those who are looking for a part time job. Whether you are in school or looking for a second job, this place can help you out with that."
good,"Staples is an okay company to work for. The management staff is very diverse, some really care about their employees, others not so much. Too much drama and unnecessary stress about things that you can't control. Their systems are very outdated which is disappointing considering their a billion dollar company that sells the most up to date technology. It's a good starter job for highschool/college students, or maybe a stepping stone to further your career"
good,I enjoyed my job at Staples because I really enjoy working with the public. The managers always made sure the employees had plenty of work to do while on the clock.
good,"I worked there for nearly two years and it was stressful a lot of the time, due to management and customers. However, I would gladly recommend the company to friends and family. They have multiple benefits and are always coming out with new ideas. Also the discounts and the school supplies definitely helped out. It is a great company."
good,I worked here in high school. I made a lot of friends and gained many valuable experiences. They were always flexible when it came to time-off and working around students extra curriculars.
good,"management was pretty good"
good,"I enjoyed the job a lot! I got the hang of the recipes and everything pretty quickly and, most of the time, had no problem preparing food and serving it in an orderly time!"
good,I enjoyed working with staff but it sometimes seemed that they overworked their managers to the point where 2 quit within my 9 months there! They weren't trained to the point of security in their jobs and it hindered their ability to pass on the necessary info to our staff members! Hard work and energy will help the employees who work here!
good,"Training was lacking. Emphasis on keeping the store neat & clean, but i was hired to sell, and received very little sales training.  Fellow employees were helpful, supportive and generally nice. Management was ok."
good,I had a great time and it was a fun work environment. Just had a better opportunity come along that I could not pass up but it is time to take the next step and find a job that will provide for a family.
good,professionals - internationals - lots of contacts overall
good,Staples is a good starting job my coworker are all very good to work with and the management is very responsible in accomplishing the sales goals and teaching the employees.
good,"Since it is a corporate company you have a lot of management to go through if you have a problem. Depends on which store your at, depends on the work environment."
good,Was okay. Not a bad place to work as far as the company itself. It really does depend on the location you work at. Staples is an exciting company with a lot of changes happening. With change comes a lot of people who do not like change and a somewhat stressful and not positive environment at store level.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with.  The teamwork was a great part of the print implementation specialist position.  "
good,"If you work at staples as a Tech Associate or Sales Associate, be prepared to interact with customers very frequently. Selling is a big part of the job. Selling printers, computers, chairs, etc. If you have a good management team then this is something you could even somewhat enjoy. Retail is a tough environment in general so I would not recommend making Staples your full time career."
good,"I manage 93 associates and had to adjust to different characters in order to be a successful manager. Working with them and helping them be the best associates they can be is what drives me to work harder. They understand that in order for us to be a great department within Staples, we have to work together, provide the best customer service possible and they know that I am here to help in any way."
good,It's a good job I just need more hours right now is a very slow time and they're cutting hoursand I got a little girl to take care of so I got to get a better job with more hours
good,"This environment is fun, and all of the workers there were open to everyone. However, they had unrealistic expectations of one person in a short period of time in a single day. They also now are only giving me 5 hours of work one day a week, so this is leading me to find work elsewhere."
good,"the hardest part of the job were the over night shifts however had to make it enjoyable, a typical day consisted of packing and filling shelves, management was very understandable and great opportunity to grow within the company"
good,I did enjoy working at Staples. In fact I would love to work for Staples again. The last position I had in New York had issues with management but loved working at the production facility
good,"We were expected little more than to sell sell sell, and build up rapport with customers. Which was easily done, and not at all shady."
good,"A typical day at staples is jam packed with things to do, they only complaint I have is that the company hires a lot of young people who have no idea what to do, unless directed, and even then, sometimes disregard what they are told to do. Better communication would definitely benefit the company."
good,"A great place to learn new skills, get faster at designing, get better with estimating job costs and get the opportunity to work with different production centres."
good,"It was a good company to work for because of the people. Since they have become privately owned, they have laid off many. It will be interesting to see if the new product brands work to bring Staples back to the top of the game."
good,A lot to learn and uses the latest technologies and tools. Business direction changes quite often and the culture is not vibrant though. Work life balance is not so great.
good,"Working in the print department gives us a lot of leeway when it comes to breaks/scheduling. The district manager for district 77 is one of the worst people I've encountered in my life, as she is unprofessional and overall crude. This company's starting pay is low, and there's not much improvement that can be made unless you're a manager."
good,it was probably the location i was at my my manager was very two faced. She has since been fired and the friends that are still there like the new manager. If I did not move too far away i would probably go back. I liked the production facility much better than the retail store.
good,"Acquired skills /Accomplishments:"
good,"I worked for staples during school they were willing to work with my schedule and the managers were nice, however they were understaffed and the benefits weren't vary good so I had decided to leave the job in search of greener pastures."
good,"Staples Corporate Sales is a good place/position to work for. The hours are flexible, You can make up your own schedule to meet with your clients."
good,"The people are what made this job bearable, but working with a good team goes a long way. In the tech department you've got tons of things going on at once and sometimes it can be hard to keep track of it all."
good,"- Very friendly managers and staff "
good,"A typical day of work is quiet, considering I only work one day a week, but even with lack of hours I have learned to communicate and  perfect my sales persuasive skills. I enjoy the sense of earning my keep and winning a sale for the company even if it can be a hard to secure one with seemingly low interest from consumers nowadays."
good,"If retail paid a livable wage I would've never quit my job at staples. I miss the people, i miss the environment and I miss my coworkers. If i could trade my job now for comparable money I would do it in a heart beat."
good,"It is a good and slow-paced place. Once whole time comes around, there is an overflow of work. Occasionally, there are leaks in the ceiling. Management was cool, they would make little remarks if not wearing the correct uniform. At times, it would be boring."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Staples Print Solutions.  They had a great team and were doing pretty well in a tough market."
good,The people i worked with made working there very much worth it. I got to learn a lot of new skills for how to help customers find exactly what they were looking for. Also learned new skills with computer repair.
good,"A normal day was putting things on the shelf, face fronting items and checking the customers at the register. I learned that you have to be careful about telling coworkers your personal life."
good,"Be prepared to deal with irritated customers as you train to use the equipment. Do not be upset with misprints, it does not directly affect you. Management was supportive in working with me and customers to smooth over any misunderstandings."
good,"Great place to work, going through a lot of changes though."
good,The best part of this job is the customer service either on the floor or behind the tech counter.  Staples provides a solution for all of its customers.
good,"un bon environnement de travail, professionnel, beaucoup d'heures"
good,"Work is highly dependent on managers at any given time. The company is open to internal development, so hard work is rewarded. Professional environment given that it is in customer service."
good,"The job helped me to better manage my time, given that I was in the middle of my last semester of college when I was at this job. The boss gave me all the time I needed for my family as well as for my classes when a member of my family fell severely ill."
good,"this was a good first time, part time job for anyone as it taught life skills and valuable team building skills. the people i worked with were nice and the company is understanding os situations"
good,"Coworkers are kind and productive, diligent with their task-work and knowledgeable about store processes and standards. Managerial and supervisory staff are constructive and well-suited."
good,Staples is more of a job you work at not to make a career out of it but one of the jobs you work at while going through college.It is fast paced through back to school time but pretty slow otherwise.
good,Worked for staples for about 25 years but had to move from California. Cost of living in California has grown too much to live there. Moved to Tennessee with family to start over again. Wish there was a staples warehouse nearby to work at . Stores are way underpaid and overworked.
good,"Starting at Staples in the Print and Marketing department, I was immediately told what was expected of me along with what was and was not acceptable in regards to mistakes. I was also highly encouraged to spend time familiarizing myself with certain programs such as Photoshop as my actual training would be rudimentary and by necessity. My supervisor, while walking me through the types of services we offered, asked me to imagine if I could run any business what would I want to promote that business, or make it run more smoothly. That way i could use those ideas to help customers find what they need, or never knew they wanted. Prior to this job I had very little in the way of computer skills  but I have been learning quickly with an excellent team to support me."
good,I would recommend Staples. I started as an Account Consultant and after 9 months I was promoted to an Account Executive. There is definitely room for advancement.
good,"Bad management makes all the difference unfortunately. I loved my old store, which had a supportive and communicative manager which resulted in a great atmosphere. My new location has bad communication and scheduling."
good,"the company and the management were very nice and great to work for. Some of the other employees arent the best to qork with, reminded me more like high school than adults working"
good,A great place to work depending on how management is handled. The culture of the store is all dependent on how the general manager operates. I have had great general managers that made work fun but on the other hand I have had general managers that run that make work the last place you want to be.
good,"Produtive fun easy going environment. Worked at Staples out in brooklyn for 8 months, as a computer technician there i learned alot about staples products and procedures."
good,"I enjoy working in an environment where the members of the team have a strong sense of camaraderie and a good work ethic. I like working with competent, kind, funny people who like to get things done. It’s important to me to feel that I can trust my team members to always do their best because I do."
good,good part time job. Work can get a little hectic. Pay is ok. People are friendly and always helpful. managers are engaged it the goings on. managers are always ready to listen
good,you are managing the business and working as a operational manager and managing the store in absence of General Manager on every shift. Good training program.
good,Worked here during the summer between high school years.    Team was very friendly and manager seemed to be effective and was always considerate of any team issues.    Very enjoyable summer job.
good,"Great Company to work for. Strong leadership with great standards in their stores. They could have had a larger focus on people development, and developing stronger leaders"
good,"Staples is a good job for if you are a teenager and it's your first job, or even a first couple of jobs to get the job experience. I would recommend working at Staples as a starting job, but to me, Staples isn't a job to get into as a career or really have that much advancement in to be able to make decent money and have a higher position."
good,A fun environment and everyone was so nice the break room and restroom were always clean and then u needed help they would help with kindness every other week they would bring u food
good,Laid back and non-threatening. Sometimes dealing with customers is a drag but the individual jobs are simple to learn and pretty rewarding. The skills you learn specifically as a Copy and Print Associate are incredibly useful.
good,"Good place to work, great chances of being promoted from within from hourly to management. Management team at time lacks experience and guidance on what direction team needs to go."
good,"Good job for in-school college or high school students. Learned how to market products and create a relationship with customers, to ensure return for continuous purchases and business."
good,Staples was a great company to work for when getting my education in Project Management.  The company was very supportive of my professional development!
good,"My job was standard. I was responsible for loss prevention, inventory, warehouse, pricing, security, reordering inventory."
good,I loved working at Staples because of the fact that you don't do much. The only busy time is during back to school. I didn't like that they would barely give hours though.
good,This was a new and ok experience for myself. The person who was in charge of interns such as myself was a little pushy  and nasty. I wouldn't know if this apply to all staples but the one i worked in definitely. (I am not sure if the same management is still there )
good,"Basic inventory management skills learned."
good,"it was a co-op placement and i did data wipes and the occasional troubleshooting and spent the rest of my time doing sales and stocking. i learned a lot about troubleshooting and sales, management was very forgiving and all my co-workers were friendly."
good,"You are required to sell even though it is not a commission job. On the bright side, representatives of technology companies come often forming you and teaching you new and useful stuff and you learn a lot about the field."
good,Staples is a high energy fast pace work environment. Multitasking and prioritizing jobs is essential to working there. Everyone takes on multiple roles in and out of their department
good,I had a great experience at Staples. I learned so much through collaboration with other teams and by being accepted to work on process improvement projects across the country. This a very fast pace company- They are always innovating and looking for ideas to stay relevant and competitive in the marketplace.
good,Clock in have a rounding. Let us know if its mandatory OT that day or not. Then head to area work shift got breaks and lunch. very faced pace. treated us well. order out for the workers
good,Typical day putting out freight and assisting customers. Management is good as long as you work and better if you people to get key items.The hardest part of job is getting non-business customers to get a staples credit card. Best part of the job is talking to all the customers.
good,"Great place to work. friendly people always working together. "
good,"It has been awhile since I worked at staples but when I was there 10 years ago, working as an ops manager was tough. Things that made it tough was the amount of hours worked every week. There not enough life and work balance for me. I have to say each store was different so in some stores it was much easier than my stores. Overall retail management is a tough job for any big retail store."
good,Staples is for anyone all you have to do is stock and know how the store is laid out to help customers. The hard part comes when dealing with coworkers and their work ethic as well as managers that pick favorites and then make the schedule to benefit those favorites by not putting them on difficult shifts. Instead they load all the work on to the few people that are hard workers.
good,"Lots of flexibility offered, management really understanding,"
good,"My work included everything from repairing computers, etc. to sales, stocking shelves and manning the cash registers.  My main complaint is that I often felt lost with such a variety of tasks and systems and no real on the job training or procedures to follow to be sure I was doing everything I was supposed to be doing.  But I have also never worked retail before."
good,"Good company to work for, the training process is very helpful and all employees are expected to be friendly and helpful. This business holds a high standard for their employees."
good,"I enjoy working here, but we are always understaffed. If one person calls in, the whole store might as well go up in flames because we can’t get anything done. Management at Staples is quite awful, they are nice people but terrible at their jobs."
good,"They probably could have challenged their employees more or offered more room for advancement, hours were decent, but lunch was only 30 minutes long, i don't recall ever feeling like i was apart of the team/company"
good,"Fast-paced environment with various challenges to grow sales, manage inventory, train associates, and provide outstanding customer service.  Job was fun due to the people with whom I worked but challenging due to staffing turnover and limited staffing."
good,it was a great environment to work at. great people and great customer service. peaceful and quit work place and very nice flexible hours and they are willing to work around you.
good,Easy job filled with great people but overnight hours are rough and the physical duties of the job can beat on the body over time a good job for young people but not for more than 3 years
good,staples has allot training programs to build a strong team and selling culture.management is very good .customers are very loyal .management hiring process is hard but it worth and trained managers very well.
good,Good management and well organized store to work at. Typical day would be helping customers find all of the products that they need and offering help to business owners.
good,Staples is a great place to work to absorb all knowledge above and beyond your position.  You must take advantage of all obstacles and make them opportunities to improve the process or yourself.
good,"I learned how to motivate people with little resources.  Also learned how to maximize my results in a high pressure sales environment.  The best part of the job was being able to connect with customers and ensure that they get not only what they need, but that they wanted other people to come to us."
good,"I love the Company, they are good to work for, until you hit the management cap and cant make enough money. its a good job for some, but the sales environment has gotten more stressful and it has slowly become less fun."
good,i worked there several years ago I did the start up. It was a lot of fun and learned a lot.. There was no heat or air condition in the summer it was very hot and a lot of people passed out do the the heat.
good,"Managers were usually helpful and understanding, but computer customers add a level of stress to this position that make it far less pleasant. On a day with good customers, it is a great place to work."
good,"solid place to work, great benefits constant employee appreciation to encourage overall moral. Competitive environment must adapt quickly to change an embrace new procedures"
good,"Working at staples was a good time for me, I would unload all deliveries and make sure all items were stocked in an organized and presentable manner, and when things were rough in the store other areas were more than happy to help each other out however they needed. Very good team building and the store manager knew what she was doing keeping the group together and on task always and did not flinch when it came to needing to get down and do some of the grunt work herself on busy days or when holidays came around."
good,I quickly learned to absorb the computer training because outside of that not many people would answer your questions. The hardest part of the job is the communications between the team or management is frayed.
good,"I worked part-time and then eventually full time, and it was pretty okay. The management at my store has since changed, but they were good people and easy enough to get along with."
good,Staples is a leading retailer in the retail and online office products industry.  They offer competitive benefits and there is room for career growth.
good,This is a good company which helped me explore my capabilities. It has always ensured to utilise my full potential and explore more abt my talents and opportunities
good,decent place to work - pay could be better and no benefits but management and coworkers made it a very good place to work - its been a very long times since iv worked here so things could be different.
good,It was a good place to work to acquire experience in computer support. My favorite part of the job was being able to diagnose customers computers that came my least favorite part was trying to upsell everything we sold.
good,"Great Company."
good,Very fast paced and productive environment. Site reliability engineer has provided me the opportunity to build my career on the ecommerce website through various monitoring tools.
good,I like working at Staples.  You meet so many different kinds of people with this job.  The turn over for my store is high because of the college students who are employed here.
good,"Company is in the middle of a ton of restructuring - things change week-to-week, different departments disappear, it can be hard to get things done with so much uncertainty. Good people from VP on down though, just too much going on."
good,"The people I worked with at Staples were great and I learned a lot working as a tech. At times, the work that needs to get done can be a bit overwhelming, but if you stay on top of your tasks you'll have no issue advancing in this job."
good,"the work days go by quickly with ongoing jobs and walk in jobs, the people are friendly there but they do need to spend more time actually training a person ten going through a online program that is not up to date."
good,"I liked working for Staples, I am definitely going to go back for the holidays and any other break I have during college. The work place is good, the co-workers were fun to be around and we all had a good time working with each other."
good,Good benefit being in a team environment flexible hours great management professional work place competitive salary friendly service opportunities for growth in the company.
good,"Good introduction to the retail work experience. People were great, Bosses understanding, customers were mostly OK. Found out I didn't much like working retail."
good,"Working at Staples Inc., I learned how to interact with customers and I worked my way from a cashier position to a sales associate. When the summer season comes and we have interns, while I'm on the clock I am in charge of the interns and the work that they do for that day."
good,"Staples certainly keeps you on your toes; nearly everyday is a different set of challenges due to the breadth of the business. Management is largely understanding, though sometimes training can be somewhat barebones."
good,Staff were all very friendly and accepting. There was always work to be done so you were never left empty handed. Training was very good and there was always help available.
good,"A great place for part-timers looking for flexible scheduling. Strict  customer policies that are easy to learn, but also strict policies about pay-grade and min/max hours per week. Certain departments can be understaffed, and part-timers should expect to be called on their days off to pull extra shifts as Staples would like to get by with the least amount of workers available. A good forward minded company that seems to be sustaining well despite a harsh retail market currently."
good,Typical retail job thats filled with many SKUs. customer service is priority and work keeps things interesting because of the various departments and products. Staples does recognize you for hard work.
good,This is a good starter or secondary job for those not needing to live off of it. Job is very demanding but fun for those who are numbers and inventory minded like myself.
good,"I worked for Staples for 17 years and started out as an hourly computer tech and worked by way up to General Manager where I spent my last 10 years and I still bleed Staples red. However, times have changed and the industry is different than it was in 1998, 2002, 2005, and even 2010. Staples.com has flourished but the retail side has not. What I noticed over the last 5-8 years I was with the company was that our policy of internal promotion stagnated as they began to cut back on stores and reduce district managers and other higher level management. "
good,"Always new things to learn and discover including products, services, and more. I felt like a kid in a giant craft area at home in the copy and print center where I could demonstrate constant creativity and endless possibilities for creating and producing one of a kind work."
good,There is really nothing to celebrate here.  I can say that they pay fair and the work is not physically taxing.  I can say the the last 2 years have been a huge toss up in the corp with the constant redefining of districts and mass change in management in my store.
good,It was a nice place to work. I had a wonderful time working with all colleagues. Learnt a lot during the process and I have seen an amazing team spirit
good,"Staples is a retail store. As the lowest keyholder in the store, I would be compelled by my desire to serve customers, where it seemed like not anyone else care. I also had a 37 1/2 hour schedule to complete a 50 hour work load. Mine was the most ""important"" position in the store. Even when I would be in the middle of processing inventory counts, or a weeks or so more returns, I get called to back u register. I 'd, walk away from my register to attempt to finish my actual duty, just to get called back again.  "
good,It was a good job and I learned a lot but there is no future. All jobs here are replaceable. I was upset when I left but I just did not make enough money to stay.
good,"This was by far my most loved job. Every week I got roughly the same hours so I knew what to expect, staff was amazing and management was pretty good too. Small employee group so everyone got close and had everyones backs."
good,"Staples is a really great place to work. The environment is very calm and relaxed, the management doesn't leave every problem up to you, and the customers are all pretty great."
good,I enjoyed working there. It was a nice joy with nice employees. The pay was awesome and the hours were nice. It was a busy department that I worked in though.
good,All of the typical ups and downs of working for a large company. Great coworkers and direct management. Plenty of autonomy but guidance available as needed. Great benefits.
good,I really like the people that work there. What kept me there this whole time were the people that work there. Great clientele too. There are a lot of loyal and kind customers.
good,I worked for this employer while in high school. I also kept the job all the way through college and grad school. I worked in the copy and print center
good,"Copy Centre Representative is a tough gig, constantly on your feet with orders to complete. But the team was great and overall work atmosphere was pleasant."
good,"Not one of my favorite jobs, but much better than the worst job I've had.  Felt very low on the totem pole as a cashier -- I had no voice and my opinion didn't matter and wasn't valued, and for my personality that is not motivational whatsoever.  There wasn't anything to motivate me to achieve the nearly unreachable goals that were set for me.  The managers are all very nice people and it was not hard to work for them.  I left because I found another job willing to offer me more hours, but other than that this was an okay part-time job."
good,I really enjoyed the opportunity that I had working for Staples Warehouse. It was different for me because I've worked fast Food for over 18 yrs. It was easy work just not enough pay for the hrs you have to put in. I would go back to work for that company. What I hated the most was we didn't have central AC just fans and you would get hot in the warehouse it was miserable.
good,"When i first started working there, the employees & managers made sure i completed all my trainings. They always made sure i was okay so as a employee i can give 100%"
good,"The environment was always busy, so it helped keep me busy and productive. The culture was always positive and the communication around the warehouse was very effective."
good,"un environnement de travail acceptable, formation des stagiaires, relation avec les cleints"
good,You're evaluated on how quickly you can fulfill orders or restock your section of supplies. The entire department needs to be finished with whatever batch you're working on at the same time. Overtime is mandated during certain times of the year.
good,J'avais été embauché comme étudiante mais je faisait du temps plein. Lorsque le moment est venu d'apprendre ma grossesse à mon employeur elle m'a couper mes heures et j'ai eu le pire des congés de maternité.
good,"I truly enjoyed working there however the pay is low compared to competitors that are quite close by, and some of the managers you wonder how they got there... and on that note you have to wait for your yearly review before they will negotiate a raise of any sort while you are making them thousands of dollars every day - according to their own data... i don't understand that part. By their own data i was making them more money in one day than they pay me in a whole year, yet i have to wait a whole year before they will negotiate a small (?) raise in my salary. That appears to be the company's biggest problem right now: retaining good talent. Their pay is not competitive, and their reward system for performance is poor."
good,"Good place to move around and learn different aspects of the business, super busy and you do meet great people. however right place right time does still exists when it comes to moving up in the business."
good,"Have worked at Staples/Corporate Express for about 14 years, wonderful people to work with, engaging environment, but also challenging atmosphere to be in."
good,"At staples they work around your schedule if you are still in school or if you need a day off and you put it in, in time you will most likely have that day off. At staples they really are like a family and they try to all work together and give the best time at work."
good,Staples is a fun place to work but there was little room for advancement and learning opportunities are limited as we can only spend so long working with customers.  We are also limited by our software and so are incapable of doing tasks that should be simple and not cost much.
good,I liked it honestly but they fired me due to the fact that I was sick during my 90 day probation.... The calls were very easy though the actual job was great.
good,"Great company to work for, very good if you have a particularly busy home life.  It's great to be able to work from home for Staples and still make sure I can take care of my motherly duties."
good,Worked here over a summer in college and gained valuable experience on how to interact with people in a sales-oriented environment. Helped me hone my customer-related skills and how to tune into what people need and want.
good,"The Staples company was a great experience, with  a lot of opportunity for growth. A typical day at work consisted of lifting 30+ lbs boxes, building pallets, and pushing boxes through asembly line."
good,It was a very fun and exciting place to work. Always challenging and learning new things. I have gained a lot of experience in the last 8 months working there.
good,"It's retail and in retail you can't really trust what managers do, but it was a decent place to work for the period of time I was there."
good,"It was my first job experience, people are very good and very helpful.  It is fun to work here as the company environment is very good."
good,"A great foot in the door to the printing world, Staples offers insight at what a bigger and more advanced print should would demand."
good,Staples is a great place to work and is a good entry level job. You will learn a lot about how to deal with all sorts of customers and how t take care of their needs while they shop around
good,"flexible work environment"
good,Staples is a really good place to work with many advancement opportunities as well as associate development tools that allow you to increase your knowlege of the organization and its products and services so that you may reach your full potential as a valued employee.
good,"Great place to work, great tools and training to help account executive succeed. Staples provides a wonderful work life balance ."
good,"Unless you're looking for management, change jobs soon."
good,Great learning experience. I learned a lot about the ecommerce industry and the overall corporate hierarchy. The workplace culture was great.
good,"I appreciated the opportunity to have a 2nd part time job, however, having 4 hour shifts did not meet the standards I needed to ""bring home the bacon""."
good,Great work environment with good people that work well together to get the product out the door in a timely manor. I have learned a lot about what it takes to logistically move product from the order to shipping.
good,"Worked there for a year or so and no complaints, really liked my manager and gave very good flexible hours and employees got along which helped make the job easier"
good,"Bom ambiente de trabalho. "
good,In Staples you'll learn many things all the way up to inventory management. You deal with many customers that are friendly and understanding. Great work environment.
good,"This job is what you make of it. Not a lot of training, so previous experience helps. Opportunity to advance in the company."
good,"Paid the bills (barely) while I was working on my Bachelors. However, the management tries to keep a happy balance between customers and employees. Flexible hours/ scheduling."
good,Tive a oportunidade aprender sobre todas as áreas de influência da empresa e crescer bastante a nível profissional.
good,"Employment was over 15 years ago, but at that time was a good place to work for; fast paced; cross training; good benefits; friendly environment; minimum wage with fair wage increases per an individual's performance."
good,i grew quickly and advanced very quickly thru the corporate structure by learning every job thru out the stores and learned a lot about time management.
good,"it's a job. it's the same thing day in, day out. i haven't learned anything really. the manager is nice but he's quiet. nothing is really hard about the job honestly. the best part of the day is being on the floor to be honest."
good,"Long days, price changes and an report to 15 different managers in one day all of them telling you something different.  The plan o grams never actually worked and the tech then was obsolete"
good,"I was employed with the company for less than a year, lack of hours lead to my leaving the company. My coworkers were fun to work with and they were all hard workers, making the job greatly enjoyable."
good,"A very nice and professional place to work in. The management was very professional, very helpful at times and ready to teach the new aspects in job. Great place."
good,"This was a great resume builder job for me and provided a lot of different positions and options to learn different transferable skills. Pay is competitive, and extra compensation is given to people who work later in the day/night (less desired shifts). Training is questionable, rushed, and not managed."
good,"Company has many directives from each end of the spectrum, Depending which tier you are affects work/life balance. Overall company is pleasant."
good,"Never a dull moment always something to do whether your completing customer order for example a banner or business cards, stocking the paper in machines for printing or even keeping a clean work area"
good,"Company did not Promote Associates, There was not much opportunity for advancement. Manager where not confident in their job and the associate did not fell secured."
good,"Good place to work, not much room for promotions or anything unless you wanna work there forever. Otherwise, they provide very flexible schedules for part timers and student, and pretty much anyone who needs a flexible schedule. The management varies from store to store. There aren't many benefits, they do provide health insurance and all the basic stuff though. The pay is what you'd expect of a retail place. Overall was a good place for a first job, lots of customer experience to be gained, sales experience as well"
good,Currently employed with Staples.com I enjoy working from home servicing incoming calls from customer's needing assistance navigating through COM.  Assist customers in accessing and completing their online orders resulting in a positive customer service experience.
good,"•	I organized and scanned all of the deliveries on the manifest so they will be accounted for when we made the deliveries. "
good,It was a very easy job that was easy to learn. The only thing bad about the company was that the health insurance was not good at all.
good,A parte mais agradável era conviver com os colegas e atender ao publico.
good,"I like to have an outline of task that I need to complete each day, but I am ok if changes to my daily task require my immediate attention. I enjoy working straight through until my task are complete."
good,Good job to work at and a good first job if you are looking for part time. I enjoy working here and most people do. It's a simple job and has good workers.
good,"Microsoft expert, Opening and closing store and receipts, Managing employees. To be available at all times. Copy and printing expert. Balance schedules. To learn a vcariety of job skills needed to deal with customers."
good,"I moved through the company and began with basic admin tasks of processing orders and taking telephone calls."
good,"Develop and implement a Security program for Distribution Center. Company was still new and had no written programs to put in place for Security and Safety measures. Wrote Manual for Distribution Center, and submitted it to Corp. Received recognition in the form of Company Stock. Set up Bids and hiring of Contract Security Company, established Yard and Pallet controls. Wrote Physical Security Manual for Gate Security. and trained Security in their duties."
good,I could not have wished to work with a better bunch of people than the girls at staples. Everyone was lovely and welcoming.
good,"Learned alot about electronics, how to do setups for different holidays, how to deal with customer issues, and how to do vender returns."
good,Very goal oriented. The management is wonderful to work with. They genuinely care about their staff. It is a fun and friendly place to work at.
good,"you work by yourself and the computer told u where to be, u had a time frame to do it. there was no interaction with management."
good,"I have worked there for more than 11 years. I have been in and out of college and each time they have been flexible with my shifts and in turn I have been flexible with them. While there is not much in the way of opportunity to progress financially, they do have many different areas to work in and anyone can learn a great deal of skills from working there.  The Glasgow branches both have great staff who all work well together and I get along well with. For me the hardest part of the job is irregular shift patterns as I am a dad, however I do get two days a week where I am able to spend time with my family.  The most enjoyable part of working at Staples for me is when I know I have given a customer my full attention and found a solution to their needs."
good,"Staples provided me with new job skills including money handling, customer service, and sales experience. Enjoyable work atmosphere with supportive management."
good,Typical day consist of diagnosing and repairing forklifts and helping with conveyers. Dealing with vendors for new and used parts for the repair of forklifts.
good,"Great enviornment but i just didn't see myself here long term. Im looking for longevity to support me and my family. the pay was good, but hours were mediocre. all hour were giving to cashiers and copy and print. leaving 25 hours between 3 merchandisers."
good,"Great experiences every day when working. From championships to concerts. Coworkers and other employees from the building are like family, we all know each other even though it's a big arena."
good,"Staples was a fun job to me, because there are many other co-workers that you get to work with, and also make a relationship with. My social skills improved, and I learned how to speak to all types of people, whether they're angry, confused, cant speak English."
good,Its a wonderful company to work for although it is very fast paced and can sometimes get overwhelming when you are the only person on the floor with 15 people in line and no one comes to help you.
good,You help customers to look for items and then offer them a warranty if it an electronic item. The managers and co-workers all work as a team to be the number one store in the region. It can be stressful when dealing with customers but can turn into a great learning experience.
good,"not the best place for perminant work, and isnt made easy to live off the wages they pay. im disappointed that they dont know how to treat their loyal staff with any sort of respect, and are willing to destroy peoples lives by cutting hours way back with little to no notice."
good,Staples is a great company who serves the small business customer to assist in growing their business through  technology and marketing.
good,"I worked for Staples for 6 years and they really encourage all associates to grow not only in the company, but also in their personal goals as well."

good,"busy days, long shifts, management was always good to listen and help. hardest part of the job was how my general manager volintold me to do a lot of things like raffles and setting up events which is fine, But when i have told them i have enough to do and explained what i had to do the just shrugged and said that sucks."
good,"Job is fine, but would be better, if they would allow the part-timers to work more than 25 hours a week.  I sell and repair computers.  Management is fine when they are not talking down to their employees, or tell the entire department, when you do something wrong"
good,"I have worked at staples for almost 4 years, and for the most part have always been given the opportunity to succeed. I have had great managers and a great working environment."
good,"During my time at my most recent employer, I learned how to work effectively in a fast paced environment. I was required to meet deadlines on projects for each client that submitted orders. Along with projects, I was required to provide customer service by helping customers who walked in with their own projects. It taught me a lot about time management and organization."
good,"Working alongside different co-workers to see how well we work with one another"
good,"Not being one to like standing around, the office supply position is excellent. There is always stock to put out, shelves to reset to allow for new product, a truck to unload. For those into body building, moving the bigger items, such as chairs, desks and file cabinets, into the customer's vehicles can be like a day at the gym, and of course, if you would prefer help, there are other employees to help out."
good,"First, i will collect all pallets for my assigned trucks and begin to sort them out according to route. Then i will unload packages from the belt and load them into the trucks."

good,the job was very fast pace but it was always made fun. they rewarded you for your hard work would throw pizza parties and give gift cards for saftey
good,"Great atmosphere, immediate manager is fully supportive. Very good with team collaboration. Struggles slightly with balance of work / home life. Overall good company"

good,"I have no complaints about the company or the position. It's just not for me. I prefer face to face communication, unlike what you get from a call center."
good,Staples has a strong culture of giving back and helping associates. The investments made in the corporate headquarters show that the company is committed to providing a better work environment for associates and that their people are important to them even when going through a reinvention.
good,Great place to work for if Retail is your life long goal. I've gained alot of knowledge concerning customer service skills. The General manager at the time was great and very understanding.

good,Very nice and friendly staff. Flexible hours and good management. Managers and supervisors care about the safety and well being of their employees. Comfort and productivity are important to this company.
good,It is a very great work lace to Learn and have the experience of great hands on experience and training. With a staff that helps and can grow together
good,It was a great place to work and I loved working at staples alot. The main problem was trying to find a full time job at staples which is what I needed so I was forced to leave the company.
good,This place is overall a fantastic place to work. Management fully understands your needs and goals. Time off has never been an issue and they don't make you feel bad for anything you must do in your free time. Respect is a two way street and they have held up their end in my experience.
good,Staples is a great company to get your start in the retail world. They reward hard work with promotion opportunities and look to promote from within.
good,"I loved my co-workers"
good,What i took away from working at Staples was a growth in customer service and a glimpse at working in Retail.  I learned more about my current skills in Information Technologies and also how to assist customers who were unaware of the differences between a modem and a router. Management did not micro manage and being i was in a separate department (Easy Tech) i was able to work and cross train whenever there was a lull in the store. Unfortunately the store closed down before my first year.
good,"I am busy all day, which I like. I get to interact with fellow employees as well as customers. The hardest part is working every weekend."
good,"I am delivering daily financial / non financial goals in Capital Goods (electronics, printing and copy center, furniture sections ). My duty is to develop and reinforce the selling culture, leverage customer relationships to drive sales, and maintain high merchandising standards.  Responsible to ensure customer satisfaction both in store and post sales. Assists in providing guidance, training and coaching to associates as required on company initiatives, sales programs and product knowledge."
good,"Office supply knowledge is a need when working at staples. flexable hours, easy going management. not so great benefits but other than that its a pretty good place to work at... if you're looking for a part time job."
good,"Lovely people to work with in a very much female dominated contact centre "
good,"Staples Copy & Print Center is a very fast paced job that includes a lot of multitasking.  The supervisor is only 22 and tends to make a lot of mistakes generating much unneeded waste."
good,Working here was lots of fun way different than the other two jobs I have had. The people I worked with were FANTASTIC always full of energy and always made the hours go by quick. The hardest part of the job is having to talk to much when being the cashier because I feel like people get annoyed with all the questions.
good,A typical day consisted of a combined effort to keep all customers satisfied regardless of their needs and our respective department. Managers took initiatives to do things to make us better at our job and took the liberty to make sure all our needs were met.
good,You learn a lot about sales and customer support but not a lot of room for advancement unless you can take late shifts. Management can do whatever they like as far as gathering around tables or their desks to chit chat but very snooty about talking in between your calls.
good,"The reason I left is because the workload vs the pay was not worth it. That said it is ok pay, lower than average technical position, still room for improvement"
good,"good day at work, working effectively together with team members and management. involves working on till, serving customers and doing stock."
good,"I loved my years at Staples;  Things just went south nearing the end.  No hard feelings but they need to learn to treat their people better."
good,"Besides the poor pay, I enjoyed working at Staples.  Lots of interesting people.  I enjoyed taking work in producing it and showing customers"
good,"A typical day in the copy center is filled with fulfilling customer's orders and customer service. I learned a variety of tools like book binding, creating calendars, business cards, heat shrinking, etc. The management and co-workiers were pleasant. The hardest part of the job is when I am the only one assisting a line of customers. The most enjoyable part of the job are creating projects for satisfied customers."
good,"This corporation is a good starter job for young adults in college and just coming out of high school. However, it is sadly no longer a place to commit to for a career, and even members of corporate agree to this notion. It is a sad thing, really, because it is the employees that are stepping in that would be the replacements for those in the higher up positions, as they grow older and retire."
good,Nice company to work for that is shines on the technology aspect and big with customer service. Good place to start with regarding information technology and has opportunity to grow into management.
good,"Customer service, stocking, price changes, prepared daily deposits, open/close the store, great employees to work with, cashier, shipping and receiving"
good,Friendly work environment filled with understanding co-workers. There was always something to keep you busy. It was a difficult job to be bored at.
good,"Nice company, room for growth, numbers are high, can be stressful at times, they try to do things to make it fun and take your mind off the workload"
good,"The job was good, I liked the way the company wanted me to perform and the other workers, but the fluctuation of managers made for an unstable work environment."
good,i enjoy work life at staples. very nice management in a nice work environment. They do their best at compensating. They give me great feedback and the customers enjoy shopping in our store.
good,At work the focus is always sales and service. I have learned how to prooperly engage with all customers in every situation. I am trained on how to coach other associates on good and bad behaviors. The hardest part of the job is dealing with upset customers and i overcome that by staying calm. The most enjoyable part of my job is when my team is meeting their goals and the store is making budget.
good,"Worked as a tech associate for over a year. Nice co-workers, decent management, but the pay was ridiculously low even for a retail position and the sales quotas were ridiculously high."
good,"I waited on customers who were checking out and those who had questions about products and services offered, I also answered the phone and directed calls."
good,"A day at staples can vary within minuets. You are busy one second then it calms down. You are always on the go whether you are stocking, finding product or assisting with a customer. Be prepared to help not only customers but other team members and management"
good,"Having worked for Staples for about 11 years in many locations and job descriptions, I feel like they are family.  I grew with this family, at first working in sales, then sales/technical, and finally a warranty depot.  On of the difficulties with this job was the sheer volume of repairs at this fledgling depot, but I think all of us managed it well.  The best thing of my experience here was learning about diagnostic procedures and brand specific training."
good,Print department is usually very busy. Learned how to print many different formats and basic editing. Have to do some closing shifts each week.
good,Meet interesting people work a close circuit television the thrill of catching an employee in a illegal act. Catching my first theft is like killing a big game animal (My opinion)

good,"Walking around and selling, work is easy."
good,"Worked mulitiple departments and handled all different tasks"
good,Typical retail job. As a Salaried manager 50 hour work week was normal and at times even more hours. Management and co-worker worked well together.
good,"Staples is a great place for those entering the work place looking for experience and career growth.  As a operations supervisor, I enjoy helping customers find what they need either in store or online.  The hardest part of the job is not succeeding in finding exactly what the customer needs."
good,"I learned a lot from this job"
good,"A typical day at work was spent assisting customers with supplies. I learned how lead a team. I also learned  how to work in almost every area of retail. Management changed a lot and that was difficult. The Co-workers were great to work with. The hardest part of the job was standing on my feet all day and holiday work like black Friday and back to school. Working with the public was great, but learning how people will steal and use other peoples credit cards was not pleasant because it is so wrong. The most enjoyable part was helping people daily. I had the chance to see another side of the public."
good,"It was a nice place to work so long as you didn't plan on really doing anything after school and getting home really late. They aren't able to keep you over as long as you're part time, though, so I was never there too late but they did ask me to stay plenty of times."
good,"great atmosphere, would love to work here again really learned alot as a cashier as well as being a sales associate and interacting with other customers."
good,"Enjoyed working in a team environment and researching company financials in order to make business, sector and industry recommendations."
good,"outgoing, meet different people. Enjoy working with others & help others and co workers. Look for customers see what they kind help they need."
good,The staff worked well together. Very hectic during back to school time. Went from working seasonal to a part time position.
good,"Employees on the clock should alway have a up beat attitude and show respect to customers and co-workers as well. "
good,"Working at staples print solutions I've been given the opportunity to learn about the aspects of production. From customer service until the finish product is shipped, teamwork and efficiency is a must. As far as my duties, I've worked closely with customers to assure they are satisfied with our products."
good,"Each day brings something new to learn / help in driving accomplishments. Fast paced environment. Multi-layered systems supported from customer, end user, and development viewpoints."
good,A typical day as the Fullfillment Center Associate III is to inspect incoming product to insure Vendors complied with shipping arrangements as set by the shipping agreement. When a compliance issue is discovered photographs are then taken and uploaded to the Vendor Compliance database and submitted for reimbursement. Maintained a budget goal set for each period of 4-5 weeks. The hardest part of the job was to reclaim damaged freight by vendors.
good,Staples would be a great start for someone who never had a job before like a student for instance because they are understanding and flexible with your hours if you were to be a student and you get a family vibe when you work there.
good,"As a cashier I maintained the front of the store, helped customers with check out and"
good,"Typically, I begin my day doing the stores bookkeeping. Then I am off to cashier for the rest of my shift. I clean the front end, make phone calls to customers, enter in rewards applications, all in between ringing up customers. I've learned that customer service is my number one priority, I am only concerned in making sure the customer leaves with a smile on their face. The management is very supportive, as well as the coworkers. I enjoy working with them. The hardest part of my job is trying to make every single customer happy while working in retail. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to be social with others."
good,Great place to work. Liked working for this retailer. Good perks for working hard
good,"You start the day by building displays or filling in product. Helping customer with questions on. Software and hardware. (ex.computers, computer accessories) We had a good management team. We has a mix bag of good and great employees.The hardest part of my job was learning software without a computer at home after the motherboard died on me. I loved seeing my results at the end of my day by numbers. I was one of the better sales men in the area."
good,"I worked in the copy and print center. I worked with large and small local companies , teachers, as well as people just starting their own business. I helped them pick the products that were right for their personal business needs. With a year on this job I learned more about people and customer service. I had to handle problems on a day to day basis. The management was great! Never had any issues with any employees or managers! The hardest part of the job would be to deal with the pay. The most enjoyable part of the job was to see how much I could help people with invitations, presentations, or even funeral programs."
good,"Staples was generally a great company to be apart of. Part of the reason it could be a fun place to work is there was no typical day there, and an environment like that is always changing. Sadly the one thing the store is still missing is direction and motivation. That can usually only come from one place, management.. Definitely the best part of working at Staples is our awesome crew of associates. We all got along great like a big family, and that can really make the difference to how the store looks and feels and also how people work and drive each other."
good,Multinacional ambiente tipico de uma multinacional focada no lucro
good,"Enjoyed running the entire department by myself when needed, also had fun with tacking all of the individual projects."
good,"Friendly work environment."
good,"A typical day at work involves answering phones, working with difficult customers, producing a number of orders, solving difficult problems, and ordering supplies. Ive learned a number of things at this job including how to deal with customers and getting comfortable on the phone."
good,My typical day at staples were to either open or close the store as a cashier/ sales associate. Make sure I sell EPP to customer's and provide fast and friendly service
good,"Typical day start with writing test cases and checking if report meet the expectation set by BRD and document specification"
good,I enjoy the level of interaction with each customer. No pressure sales environment which allows you to better understand customer needs.
good,"Fun, Exciting place to work Ok staff & nice employee ticket discounts when you can get them Plus you get to see quite a few celebrities"
good,"Although Staples is a typical retail job, the people make the difference. Staples promotes growth within the company and is not pushy with sales, and allows their employees some freedoma nd individuality."
good,. Management and co workers treats one another as family. The hardest part of the job is when you need to hit pace by being productive at all times but Is encountering issues and minor problems with programs or if co workers are constantly asking for help while you are busy. The most enjoyable part of the job is when we are getting acknowledge with job well done and complimenting us with Lunch and company barbecues.
good,The managers are great and they work with you as a team. The co-worker are great and enthusiastic.
good,fun and great place to work. managers are great and they work with you to make sure that you are meeting your metrics. you move up very fast within the company and after 6 months you have the option of working from home.
good,"Staples is great as long as you love customer service. I tend to love it and marketing because in the copy center that is what we are all about. I love working one on one with potential life long customers and developing lasting relationships with them and my team. Working in the office industry means that you run into all kinds of people. Managers, CEO's, and etc."
good,"A very slow paced environment, this would be a great first job and would double as great customer service experience."
good,I love the store but management began to make poor decisions and seemed ungrateful for any extra effort done or anything.
good,"Excellent management and great learning experience"
good,"I can honestly say I loved my job while working there.  The environment was fun and the people (for the most part) were great to work with.  It was an incredibly fast paced environment that always kept you on the go."
good,"In my 5+ years with my company, I have worked with some of the best employees in the Staples business, whether they be management or not. While the hardest part of the job may be dealing with the occasional unruly customer, the best part is making people happy and finishing whatever task I need to do for that day."
good,"Though I've only been working at Staples for almost a year now, I do feel that the establishment is decent at best. Everyone cooperates very well with one another, but the work place seems a bit frantic. Some days while working there I may be the only one scheduled and that can be a bit overwhelming. For example, I'll have to work on a shipment we received, while at the same time helping customers find products, conducting a inventory list of missing product, and I'll have to go up to the registers and help people check out, and at that our supervisors want everything done by closing time. When there are more people working at one given time in my department, Staples is really great, as it allows you not to be in a manic rush all the time and actually allows things to get done in the store. It's mainly due to hours that not a lot of people are working together, as you'd have one person in every department in a given night, but it's just a drawback from working retail."
good,A good first job to have I learned a lot about computers and Xerox machines. I enjoyed my co workers and my store had a very family feel to it.
good,"seasonal job worked only when the red sox were playing, every employee had their own section to secure and supervise. The game would start with thousands of people most who are buying alcoholic beverages,  and I would need to make sure people were not too rough or rowdy I kept order and made sure everyone had a good time. Management was ok they did not schedule enough hours. I enjoyed my time there."
good,Fast paced environmetn. Learned a lot. Great customers. It was an overall good experience.
good,"I enjoyed my job a lot. My coworkers were awesome, and I enjoyed the work."
good,"Work here is very sales driven. I am not a huge person on sales. I would much rather make a customer happy and fix their computer timely. Sadly, in a sales oriented field we are required to be on top of so many different metrics and more and more keep being added."
good,"get to work on computers with the occasional on site setup."
good,"-A typical day of work started with clocking in, turning on machinery, checking email, checking ""to do"" list, creating job schedule, printing and/or designing jobs for customers. Job duties also included taking care of customer and/or 3rd party issues.  "
good,"A typical day consists of taking orders and making sure they are finished properly from beginning to end.  Helping customers via email,phone or walk-in.  "
good,l'equipe de travail etaient tres gentille et quand j'avais des questions elle y répondait rapidement
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is the great customers that always come in with a smile on their faces.
good,I worked for Staples beginning May 2002 until January 2014.  I was fortunate to have many roles within the company to support B2C and B2B initiatives.  I learned a great deal as a Staples Associate and have wonderful memories of the people and teams I worked with.
good,"I really did enjoy working with Greentree.   What job is perfect?  Yes there was stress but when you are pushing for a Bonus of $1400 how could that not bring on some stress.  You have to collect money which is never an easy task, but it is very rewarding when you Hit your Goals.  Like most companies they have guidelines and rules that you have to follow.  Their attendance policy is pretty strict.  I had no problems just felt it was time for a change."
good,It could have been a lot better. the management was pretty ok with their jobs but the customers as a whole were rather frustrating to deal with.
good,"Work Life balance is not a big focus of the company. "
good,"A typical day at Staples involved meeting a lot of new people and helping them with their technical needs or computer problems."
good,"Staples is a fun and friendly place to work, daily procedures consisted of price changes, selling and directed pulldowns, whilst always surpassing the expectations in regards to customer service,"
good,I had a wonderful time working here. The employees were wonderful to work with and management at my store were great to work with. Staples made sure it put its name forward and did an amazing job training one to make sure to put the customer first and make sure our customer service was a cut above the rest!
good,"I took a part time position at Staples as a Sales Advisor. I was mainly responsible for sales on Business Machines. I had to make sure that my product knowledge was excellent in order for me to best advise the customer which product best suited their needs. Computer technology and software knowledge was essential. As our customers ranged from students a little like myself, parents buying for their children and Business customers, I had to adjust my spoken language when explaining the products operations as not everyone had the same levels of knowledge.  Add on sales and activation of Staples rewards cards were also my responsibility. I also helped process customer sales through the till and also help rectify customer problems when returning an item. I was responsible for making sure all Business machines and products from that department were put away in the correct places and security tagged to comply with Staples security policy."
good,"I started out working in the copy center and spent my first five years there.  It was extremely busy and overwhelming at times.  Particularly when school was just starting out for the year.  I learned how to run copy machines and the differences between types of paper and weights.  Hardest part of the job was dealing with customers who wanted their stuff printed yesterday, but didn't bring it in yesterday.  Most enjoyable part was making people happy with the finished product, or being able to take it above and beyond expectations.  "
good,"A typical day in the Print department will require one to be able to handle multitasking client orders as well as walk-in customers. Jobs will require one to use machines anywhere from Xerox copiers to laminating machines. All skills are trained on site and on the job. Management tends to be very helpful in getting work done."
good,"Staples is a great place to work at, but the pay is low and hours fluctuate. It is not an ideal job to have for a growing family, because you never know how much you will be making. Other than that it is fun, fast pace, and exciting."
good,I haven't worked with them in about 5 years but I guess I can say from what I did experience with them they were good.
good,It remains very busy and very fun working place and every day found new problems and trying to solving them.
good,A busy production facility that required everyone's best skills. Enjoyable co-workers made working there great. I focused mostly on quality control and making sure members of my shift were keeping on task and production was under control.
good,"I have learnt many things from my 6 years at Staples including: how to manage my work load, I have learnt how to multitask and take on multiple orders and so many more things. The co-workers I have worked with have become lifelong friends. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to know my customers and understanding their needs so that each time they came in we build a greater relationship with them."
good,"I was in short contract project"
good,"Overall a good place to work! Learnt a lot about myself and business practises. As a part time associate I have benefits that help cover partial Drugs both name brand and generic as well partial dental."
good,"Staples Advantage is a great Company unfortunately, my position as an Inside Account Manager was outsourced. I have vast experience with customers as all of my book of business was happy with my performance. I was able to cross sell Items that made my Customers life easier enabling them to be more productive at work."
good,"Walking in to Staples, I am always greeted by my fellow coworkers. I look forward to seeing them and greeting customers. People who frequent Staples are always a joy to see. The management is attentive and respectful, assuring a productive working environment. In short, Staples is a team environment."
good,"Typical day at work would be interacting with customers, cashing them out, or helping them pick out a printer"
good,"A typical day would start with opening the store, identifying immediate needs of the buisness, assign and delegate tasks based on store needs. Verify previous days labor and account for all in/out punches by associates. Prepare sales goals for associates throughout the day, as well as follow up with associates to make sure they have accomplished thier goals. Without a doubt the most enjoyable part of my job, is customer service and interacting with customers through-out the day, as well as celebrating the success of my employees daily."
good,Staples is a solid company. I believe there is a career path there for those who want it.
good,Many good people at Staples. Forward thinking company with good ethics.
good,Staples has provided me with great hours and always worked with my school schedule.  The supervisors always assist employees with their needs and do their best to help them with anything they need.
good,Low hours for most employees.  Understaffed to provide appropriate customer service.
good,Love my job! benefits could be a little better but he overall environment is amazing!
good,"Staples has been a great place to work, every supports and learns from one another and works as a team."
good,Typical day would start with daily manager providing new information on upcoming sales and giving a general boost to staff. Family friendly atmosphere.
good,"Being a sales environment, the workplace at Staples tends to be a fast-paced, ever-changing environment that evolves with each new customer. Management is constantly driving sales efforts with daily positioning techniques and constant drive of new products and promotions. Employees are able to quickly learn about new products and in turn advise and assist customers in making the correct purchase to suit their need. Staples is certainly an energetic place to develop and build upon critical customer relationship skills that can be transferred to any industry."
good,Overall it has been a great learning experience but the culture of sales at any cost and the level of upwell is something that I have not enjoyed
good,"-Most enjoyable paprt of the job: great co-workers"
good,"Enjoyed being able to teach and coach employees"
good,"Ona typical day I am assisting customers and my team. Contacting customers on a day to day basis referencing their accounts, assisting my co- workers with any issues that may arise with a particular account or help finding short cuts to better the job. Sometimes the hardest part of the job is cleaning out your hold queues, customers are constantly ordering."

good,working at staples was an enjoyable experience. conveniently located by my former high-school it was a close place to work in my senior year. Learned a lot of costumer service skills and learned how to work efficiently with time which i can apply to real life and use in other jobs.
good,Staples Print Solutions is located in Richmond Virginia. This is a printing company with multiple presses.
good,I was not there long but the company seemed fair. I worked there for a month to setup a store.

I love my co-workers..My GM is great and is always there to help and answer any question should I have one. I also work with another Team Supervisor and he knows the ins and outs of the store very well as he has been with Staples for 8 years..  The most enjoyable part of my job is just being around the people and hearing new stories each day...The hardest part can also be the people sometimes."
good,"Ran registers, provided customer service, completed customer orders, stocked shelves, cleaned store, answered phone calls."
good,better communications and leadership needed in the workplace.
good,"A typical day at staples would include performing daily tasks and addressing customer needs on the sales floor. Depending on the area of the tech floor, different products require many add-on sales which is encouraged heavily by management. The main technique used on the sales floor is suggestive selling by providing a complete solution for the customers needs. The hardest part of the job may be selling attachments that don't carry value to the customer, the easiest part of the job is the products are very high quality increasing the chances of customers buying from you over the competitor."
good,I want to empower my peers by making better choices in my life. I like to enhance people with understanding the importance of self-motivation.
good,"I worked for Staples for 12 years. I started out as a processor and once I had that area down I wanted to do more. I then moved into becoming certified to operate equipment. Once I have learned how to that I moved on to learning how to to Return To Vendors, Damages coming from the warehouse and allocating them in the system, then Post billing them to the store. In time I have learned how to manage a team of 8-10 people on the Back To School season returns. I also took upon myself to place everyone where they was needed when a manager did not show for work. Sat in on meetings that help decide where the building was and if they needed back up. I just have to say some days where more of a challenge than other days. I did not mind working."
good,"I would pick orders using an RF scanner in a warehouse environment. I would also cut open boxes and stock more merchandise onto the shelves, and I would unload trucks. I learned how to work very fast and how warehouses work. The management was great, they were on top things. I had a lot of different co-workers but we all worked well together. There was good communication. Heavy lifting was the hardest part of the job. I loved working at a fast pace."
good,"- Providing customer service"
good,"Its great to work in staples, and its a good team culture."
good,in my years working here i truly learned the value of customer service.
good,"Fast-Paced, great place to work.  Supervisors are always willing to help you learn."
good,"A typical day did involve a lot of things to be done.  I'd arrive and punch in and of course I'd be working the register for sales as well as returns. In downtime between customers, I'd often be boxing ink, cleaning the front end and sorting recycled ink.  Essentially, there was always something to be done and I had to think on my feet so that I was always being productive.  I learned how to handle upset customers, solve problems and sell offers right at the register. I loved my coworkers and management.  Everyone did their part to keep the store running and we all maintained a comfortable and smoothly running atmosphere.  The hardest part of the job was trying to please upset customers and staying on my feet all day.  The most enjoyable was probably the friendly conversations that I had with my coworkers after customers had left and we were cleaning up to close the store for the day."
good,"The hours are good, you work 3 days a week for 12 hours(anything over 36 hours is overtime pay), and during the busy season there is plenty of overtime. The bad part is staying on your feet for 12 hours, but its worth it when you get your time off. The only horrible thing I experienced is the hiring process.  I started as a Temp to Hire employee, and it took them FOREVER to convert me after several promises of ""just a couple more weeks."" but after being hired it is a big relief."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Staples. The customers were friendly and polite for the most part and my coworkers were like a little family. If you work hard, do what you're asked, and stay focused on the goals, you'll do just fine. I would definitely recommend working here if you're looking to make a little extra cash."
good,"good managment, busy worplace, very organised."
good,"I was a sales associate for paper/printers/furniture/office supplies.  This entailed a lot of customer service.  Co workers were great, mostly college friends.  Hardest part was the heavy lifting and the most enjoyable part was free school supplies!"
good,Staples is a constantly evolving company in the process of another transformation to meet the needs of its customers.
good,I very much enjoy the people that I work with.  The management worked very well with my schedule and worked with me when I was going to school full time.
good,"•	Process copy orders including quality control administrative functions"
good,"I have been with this company for twentyone years. Now a typical day is very stressful.  Assistant managers have been deleted. Now supervisors have added those job responsibilities without any additional compensation. A typical day is busy assisting customers with their needs, while observing and coaching the associates.  I have learned to be flexible and take the tasks as they come while also completing all daily tasks required to run the business. I have new management which expects everyone to do things only one way .A management style I am not used to. This puts more stress on myself, other managers and the associates. Most coworkers will perform when they are given direction. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the high volume while trying to accommodate the new general manager's constant demands.  The most enjoyable part is knowing that I have helped my customers and have them leave the store totally satisfied."
good,"I am a 1 shift supervisor, my day starts at 6:30am and I come in to run print ticket to start the flow of the day. I run my punch detail to make sure the associates are punching the correct way. I then start making lineup to plan where associates are going to be and what task they will be doing for the day. I also use the vacation planner to plan when associates will be out. "
good,Constantly moving around checking for errors and problems then if at the time there's no problem i would help other departments and managers.
good,"Every day was different as you never knew what would happen with customers etc. Once a year we did a stock take after hours which although was tiring, it was fun as we all had a laugh while working."
good,I have learned so much here. The people that I work with are wonderful. I have made a ton of friends with the customers that come in specifically for my services. We are all like family there.
good,"Overall, working for Staples has been a pleasure. I have been able to effectively develop my sales and leadership skills, while working in a very fast paced environment."
good,"When I first started at Staples I was a cashier. Then I moved to the Copy and Print Center. My day involves working closely with customers to create all sorts of projects. I like working in the copy center because I get to be creative and crafty. I have learned how to use all kinds of machinery, such as the binding machine and laminator. I have also learned how to use several different computer programs, like Publisher and Photoshop. Every day is different, which I really enjoy. Some days are hectic, though, which can be difficult if there isn't enough staff. Sometimes you do get that tough customer, but for the most part customers are friendly.  "
good,Constantly serving people in a retail setting can be a bit overwhelming. Staples was a great experience in the office supply world.
good,"Staples has been and continues to be a great experience and environment to be involved in. A typical day of work consists of being a customer service representative and dealing with customers daily concerns. Also occasionally it was necessary to help out in other departments of the store."

good,"Nice employees and management, but the customers can be difficult."
good,I really enjoyed working for this company. Management did an excellent job allowing me to maintain a flexible schedule. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to help customers as well as learning about all the different products they have to offer.
good,Challenging and volatile environment. Very good for fast paced individuals.
good,"I learned quite a bit working at this company. I helped customers with their buying decisions, and did research to help find the best products."

good,I enjoy working at Staples it is a laid back and fun atmosphere and has flexible hours.  
good,I learned a lot working here. Some managers could have a better attitude to make the company look better. 
good,"A typical day at work includes dealing with customers face-to-face, helping them answer their questions and making sure they have a happy shopping experience.  I've learned that patience is the golden key to life.  Working here, I've built relationships with my co-workers as well as management.  It makes it easier to be there when you are surrounded by friendly individuals.  The hardest part of the job would be making sure everyone walks out happy even on the most busiest days but all-in-all I enjoy working in a fast-paced environment."
good,"Opened new locations.  Hired, trained and develop highly motivated teams to meet needs of customers."
good,Fast paced work environment. Very customer service oriented. Not enough time in the day to get everything done.
good,"Staples is a great company filled with people that are just as great.There is rarely downtime, which is preferable because that means we are busy. It is a fast-paced environment complete with a lot of change. Accepting, learning to deal with and leveraging change is a must in this environment.  "
good,"selling, up-selling, organizing"
good,"I do mostly reconciliations and analysis of General Ledger Accounts."
good,Learned a lot in my tenure at Staples.  Able to grow and developed many relationships with fellow associates and customers alike.
good,"Staples thrives on professionalism.  I learned or re-learned how to work with the public and learned to toughen my skin because the public can be a tad nasty.  My management was flexible and understanding while searching for full time work.  Back in the day they offered above average wages.  Unfortunately, they have joined the ranks to only give the bare minimum and a lot is expected at that rate.  Overall, I enjoyed my time there with a great staff and and a great retail manager. "
good,work is fun and productive . you learn a lot of new things but its tiring for low pay . management  is okay we have different ones come and go . love my co-workers their great . the hardest part of the job is basically standing for 8-9 hours straight but its what you have to do . the most enjoyable part of the day is going home .
good,Growing company has strong formula for Sales reps to follow
good,"At Staples as an Easy Tech Associate, I was required to take many technical tests preparing me for computer repair, however the majority of my job was more focused on retail functions.   I performed very few technical duties, but instead valued the experience I gained in sales, inventory and other retail functions."
good,A typical day at work consists of meetings to discuss current/future mobility projects.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the various IT teams in delivering projects on time and on budget
good,A fun and exciting place to work.  Enjoyed working with fun and sociable co-workers.  The typical work day wasn't hard at all.
good,"Management team has long tenure.  90,000 associates in 27 countries means it is difficult to generalize working environment.  Lots of opportunity to move around and learn and high rate of internally filled postings.  Way more complex company than people realize. "
good,"As an Operations Manager, a typical day at work consisted of managing the sales floor - overseeing associate communications/transactions with customers and insuring excellent customer service. When I was not on the sales floor, I was managing inventory in the back of the store - sending returned merchandise back to vendors, printing and filing store reports and insuring all inventory into/out of the store is accounted for."
good,I am working in this company as contractor which is getting order in May 2013 other I would never prefer to leave such a great company.
good,"Although they do have some management issues, overall it wasn't as bad as some other jobs. It has little room for moving up, but is a good start for someone who needs technical experience working on computers. They do push you to make sales goals and you don't see real compinsation for your hard work. They do however, give benefits to part time employees, not the best but at least it more than some companies."
good,Managers were very willing to work around my school schedule. Co-employees were extremely friendly and helpful while I was learning the ropes.
good,Staples has a very good benefits package. The work environment is better than some other sales environments that I have experienced.
good,"Good Company, great benefits, excellent co-workers. cutting edge technology. day to day was normal then you had surprises to adjust to and comply on top of your normal daily routine.. very extreme deadlines. Never a dull moment at times very stressful."

Management was always very helpful. My co-workers were always easy to get along with and a few of my co-workers and and also socialized outside of the work place. There was no hard part about this job. The most enjoyable part of this job interacting with a few of the customers and minor supervision."
good,Learned a lot about customer service and working in a fast paced environment. Showing customers products and which ones are best. Co-workers are phenominal.

good,"you don't have to work any harder than what minimum wages pays you. they do not recognize hard workers. management has no control over raises. you get what home office sends so, work hard enough to get your job done, don't do any extra, for it will be for naught"
good,Up tempo workplace requiring computer and technical skills to diagnose customers problems in person or over the phone. Learn about new products and electronics while selling them to customers.
good,"A typical day at work involved various operational tasks including but not limited to restocking shelves, resetting aisles, and checking for signage issues. As a department lead, it was my job to ensure that every aspect of the department was addressed or that there was a plan in place to address it. Some of my co-workers needed constant supervision while others did their job well and contributed a lot to the team. The store manager was very knowledgeable and was invested in my development. The hardest part of the job was maintaining a balance between daily tasks and customer service. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to completely meet the needs of the customers."

good,"On a typical day I would ring in transactions, assist in sales, and act as a customer service representative by handling inquiries and complaints via phone. These were not all of my duties however. I also stocked, unloaded trucks, and assisted with loss prevention. At Staples I truly learned how to make things ""easy"" for people. As the word ""easy"" was their mantra. I worked with a wide variety of people at this job. Being as it was in Colorado, the population was very diverse. The hardest part of this job was always keeping busy, as there was a lot of down time. I found the most enjoyable part of the job to be the sales aspect. As a new guy to the company I was on top of nearly all sales categories, and half the time I was behind a register and not on the sales floor!"
good,Count money in cash drawers at the beginning of shifts to ensure that amounts are correct and that there is adequate change.

good,"Book keeping, nice co-workers, management is very understanding, and ive learned that i can do better"
good,"One day I wanted to crack a meeting with a prestigious company,but they were not interested in that,then I wrote a mail to them about the company by highlighting its background that it is world's largest supplier and among fortune 500 company and the products ,it is offering,they were impressed and they phoned me for the meeting."
good,If you leave yourself open you can learn a lot about business
good,Temporary work every mondays (thursdays in winter season)
good,Staples is great but they should have let Corporate Express drive themselves into the ground. CE was a giant disaster and if we would have bought them they would have died on the vine. Hopefully they can get rid of the CE sales clowns and move on to some better times.
good,"Very stable company. Upper management is very down to earth, knows your name, and treats you as a friend. Very diverse group of co-workers. Good variety of products/services and therefore a variety of jobs available."
good,"can be challenging, but you do get recognized for positive as well as negative reactions from customers."
good,Every day is different and fast paced. This is the world's second-largest ecommerce retailer. Fantastic Delivery and Logistics organization. Huge upside potential.
good,"Working on the computers and helping customers out was the best part of this job.. but the work ethic of my peers was lacking. It was a great experience overall, unfortunately there were not enough hours to give me."
good,"At staples as an overnight associate, it was a very busy and fun place to work.The most enjoyable part of my job was coming to work every night."

good,We cleaned the store and made sure all products were in their correct places. Set up displays and promotional kiosks. the hardest part of the job was lifting furniture because it took a lot of strength. The most enjoyable part of the job was at the home stretch when we saw the results of all our work coming to fruition.
good,"Retail company- Very stressful, not a lot of time to do a lot of things but there was a lot of room to grow."
good,"A lot of freight and inventory work is expected to be completed along with assisting numerous customers. Managers all have different visions and all choose to work in a different way but try to interact and plan with one another as much as possible. The hardest part of the job is being able to juggle both work and customer service at the same time, but the customer service is the most enjoyable part."
good,"A typical day of work involved customer service. This was both the most rewarding and the most challenging aspect of the job. While some customers are really fun to work with, some are not."
good,Can be a fun atmosphere depending on management. Smaller scale retail operation so there is not as much product to sort through.
good,"Fun place to work at. Management is lucking communication but workable. When work on cash it gets stressful and boring, all day standing on your feet. Fun activities by the mangement and cooworkers."
good,Currently work in Talent Acquisition and like the team environment at Staples.
good,"I learned a lot about stock keeping, universal product codes, functions of many stationary products, and also met a lot of great people."
good,As a copy center associate I enjoyed the connection with customers and helping them get the results they wanted or the results we could provide as close a possible to what they wanted. I learned how to use commercial copy and print machines. A typical day would include coming in and communicating with the other associate about jobs in que or being done at that moment. Then continuing with said jobs and taking orders from next customers. While there I met some great co-workers yet the hours were not the greatest. I went from being 38 hours a week to 24 hours a week.
good,"A typical work day consisted of meeting new people and getting to learn new things every day. I enjoyed being able to always interact with people, and the fact that there was always something to do. My least favorite part of the job was the hours."
good,Part of team that integrate supply chain fulfillment and delivery processes into one platform.
good,I only worked here for the summer but the experience was good.

good,learned to cooperativley work with a wide spectrum of people
good,great location and personalities and characters. The associates were hard working and understood the demand of the customers.
good,"I've been working for Staples for 11years now and its not a bad place to work. I learned a lot over the years, started as a cashier and work my way up. Management is great with me and I learned something new from them everyday. My co-workers are great and i get along with everyone. The hardest part of my job is when there is no organization and u have to spend a lot off time looking for the simplest things. the most enjoyable part of my job is when everything is in order and my numbers are great. :)"
good,Interesting job being on the opposite said of retail where you are actually preparing the customers order.
good,Working in a legal department is very different. Learned so much about labor law. Wish this position had not been disolved as it was. Would do it again.
good,good middle management position offering knowledge in the field of office supply and technology. fast paced work atmosphere. hardest part of the job was the disconnect between home office and retail stores.
good,Working at staples you come into contact with so many people. As a Copy Center Associate I had the enjoyment of creating wonderful works of art for our customers.
good,Working here was fun and taught me alot about the workplace. The coworkers were great to be around and the place was very relaxed and comfortable.
good,I enjoyed working for Staples for almost ten years. The people there became my family.
good,Working at Staples is a great opportunity for students in high school or college and/or anyone who is looking to advance their management careers.
good,This job was fun job that required great team work and good management. I enjoyed going to work everyday and loved working for this company. It provided me and my family with great benefits and good financial status. I would love the opportunity to work for the Staples Corporation again.
good,"Staples can be a great place to work depending on the team in place at the store. As a whole, the company is slow to promote and hand out raises, and some policies and programs will hamper the employees ability to do their job."
good,A typical day at Staples consisted of calling customers to inform them of a service failure and trying to right the wrong. It was a daily challenge to accomplish this.
good,"Great place to work. "
good,This was my first job in Canada. I learned and grew a lot while working at Staples .I loved their process of work .The management was always positive and encouraging and constantly showed ways to improve.
good,"I don't recommend applying for Staples as a long-term job. There is little room for advancement and, no matter how much you love office supplies or retail, the environment will wear you down eventually. "
good,working at staples has taught me a lot of different concept and knowledge set. I recommend this company for anyone who wants to learn and grow in their career
good,Staples is a great entry level job for anyone looking to get hours. With different directions of advancement theres plenty of room for growth. However if your stour has a bad manager things might be different.
good,"I enjoyed working for staples advantaged. I would recommend working for this company.  The culture is great, it has a friendly upbeat culture and management is always willing to go the extra mile to help."
good,"Staples. Its the job for sales. My position was to simply to make sure every customer that came in was satisfied. As an east tech, I worked on phones, PCs, Desktops, and many more as well as make notes and apply tech services for any devices we may acquire."
good,"10 - 7 "
good,"Long hours are very draining and advancement is extremely limited. Management staff supports you and is understanding at times, but in the end, it’s all about the numbers"
good,Management hardly ever had answers. I loved the people I worked with. there was about a 60/40 work-life balance. If you weren't a favorite you got easily passed up. It's sad to do that to people. I loved the work I did but I wasn't a favorite so I ended up losing my job
good,It is a warehouse so it can be cold in the winter and hot in the summer with dust in the air. You have dress accordingly and be careful of material handing equiptment.
good,It has been a good company to work for. I am disappointed that they don't seem to appreciate tenure with the company. I do like what i have learned with the company.
good,"Learnt about new technologies, workplace culture is awesome with teamwork and collaboration, there is scope for trying out new initiatives, very good probability for career growth."
good,"staples, after being bought out a couple years ago started cutting hours and number of stores. Overtime not allowed, and not enough staff to cover all the needed hours."
good,"At a place like Staples, your coworkers or associates make or break the job. Management is very time consuming, and pay is not the best for the amount of work they expect from you, but it pays the bills. There are a lot of factors that can make this job great or terrible, including location. Customers can make your job extremely difficult, but with a level head you will succeed here. The position of Tech Supervisor should not be considered long term due to the imbalance of responsibility and compensation (pay). But there is certainly room for growth with the company, and if you’re passionate about sales and customer service, you can and will make it higher up in management."
good,"Fun fast paced environment. They have great wages, and great benefits. They will also train you along the way. Everyone works together to ensure all departments are well taken care of and guests are satisfied."
good,"I was blessed to have an excellent general manager. I was cross-trained in copy and print and was never recognized for my work at the customer service desk. I was never really trained in the copy and print side of the store either, but going back in there now they have a full new team that seems to know what they are doing."
good,I enjoyed working for Staples Commercial Contract division for over 10 years. I was always treated well. I held several roles and enjoyed most. The benefits structure is very good.
good,"I like working there, however I want to be full time and it’s very hard to advance, and the pay you feel like you deserve more for your hard work but again it’s very hard to get that. But you do get paid every week, and you get discounts, and sometimes get pot lucks or celebrate birthdays."
good,"The job is good, and you learn alot, but the pay for the amount of work you do is not so good.  Management is caring and alot of room to learn new things."
good,It was a great job. Great people and run like delivery was made to run. But it is no longer running anywhere in Northern Cali everyone was laid off. Last I heard they may still run in Southern Cali
good,I do like working here just a drive to mount pleasant was hard they had nice management and working there was not hard the customers were friendly and loyal
good,"The Copy Center at Staples is one of the more involved areas of the company, you need to take customer orders for print jobs, some people will want their stuff done right away so you have to think on your feet sometimes and make sure you don't make any mistakes. "
good,"Never enough staff.. Stresses management and associates. Company goals are unrealistic without the proper training on associates. Since short staffed, there is never enough time to train associates."
good,"Overall, the company culture and people are excellent; however, more recently, the workload per person is more than 2-3 people can handle. We are working over 55 hours a week."
good,"Staples goes through a major Re-org every six months or so since they were bought out by the Sycamore group. They are no longer committed to the industry I work in, and are turning their focus towards online transactional sales. They were very fair to me when they laid me off, and I have no issues with them as a company."
good,Good temporary summer job. Pay was decent and hours were workable. Management was very good and the store has a good workplace culture. It is understaffed though so some days the workload could be a bit intense.
good,"Managers were very experienced and had good personalities. They understood that life happens and did not expect too much from employees. If you worked hard, they saw and acknowledged it."
good,"Loved working at Staples for a period of time, however little is offered in terms of training, shadowing, and seeking assistance both on a management and associate level."
good,"There was a lot of things about this job that required practice.  All of the different machines, how they worked, and how to print on them properly was probably the hardest part of this job.  One thing that was pretty frustrating was the customers (big surprise) and how impatient they were.  With this job you have to be comfortable telling customers no, which admittedly was pretty difficult for me at first.  I had some trouble with telling customers that I couldn't get their orders done immediately, most were cool with it, but there are always those few who take it personally.  I think that because printing something isn't inherently difficult, plus the fact that most of our orders are online, people assume that there isn't a lot to do."
good,Company lost a lot of its soul with Tom Stemburg leaving. Company was a little late to the game with a sales and customer centric model. Company pays extremely well.
good,"I liked working there because I'm an organizer freak and I liked organizing the store and making it very shopper friendly. I got paid a really low wage and it made it hard to pay my bills. This could be a good company to work for, but just like so many other corporations they don't care about the employees enough. Give employees regular 40 hours if they want it and pay them enough to live."
good,"safe and protective environment to work in. clear management staff, and lunchroom and breakroom available.  Shifting job titles (moving from area to area) when needed."
good,"The failure to acquire Office Depot and Office Max resulted in many leaders leaving their organizations.  This left uncertainty within their team members causing many people, including this reviewer, to seek out other employment options"
good,"Great place to work .Laid back , hours were good. coworkers were very friendly. got overtime steady. Got to learn a lot. management would buy pizza when the plant did good"
good,"Answer phones, direct calls to other departments, ring customers out, stock some of the merchandise, empty used ink cartridges behind the counter and tape up boxes for shipment out. Replace returns or go backs onto the shelves. The manager cared more about being every ones friend instead of managing. Half of the time I had to wait for everyone else to get their lunch before I got mine, sometimes, I didn't even get one.  The hardest part of the job was when it's extremely busy, no time to answer phone as it rang off the wall and nobody else would help with it. The most enjoyable part of the job was closing at the end of the day."
good,I love working for Staples I have learned a lot and it has been a very good company for me to work for. However I do think it is time for me to move on in a different direction in my life.
good,"I have to be honest, I love working for Staples. I have been with Staples for 9 years now and I have had the benefit of moving laterally and up in the company. Staples takes pride in its employees and really does what is best for them, most of the time. Over the last two years, there have been a lot of structural and internal changes. Some of which are good and others that don't seem as good. Overall I still think Staples is a great company and I am grateful for all that I have learned professionally and personally during my time there."
good,"The company centers around a sales focus now, but it hasn't always been like that. Although I'm looking at new and upcoming companies that have a focus on their associates and customers more then profit and sales, I'm thankful for my time at Staples still. Wouldn't be the manager I am today without the leadership and training I've had over the past several years."
good,"I had a really cool manager, and everything was fine."
good,Staples provides their employees with opportunities to learn skills within different departments within the store. Training is online based and transitions into working with customers as soon as possible. Very hands on. I suggest wearing comfortable shoes because you'll be on your feet all day (aside from your 30 minute lunch break).
good,It was an easy job. I loved dealing with customers. Even the angry ones. I loved fixing computers and learning new things. I loved it most because being able to help people was a desire of mine.
good,Not much room for movement. Good company overall. A lot of flexability. Not much certainty where the company is going. feedback isnt taken seriously. Good stepping stone.
good,"While working at Staples, you meet your typical customers, but you also have your priority customers. Priority customers are those who own a small business and require the best deals possible for the items they need. Staples offers multiple programs for these priority customers in order to make sure they will leave with a small. Requirements of the day depend on which day of the week it is. There's always plenty to do, whether its unloading truck, or even restocking shelves from the backroom. Quality customer service is always necessary everyday to ensure every customer leaves the building fulfilling their own personal mission. My personal store, went under a remodel and is kind of a mess since then, but we are surely getting back on our feet and always putting the customer first."
good,Good place to work great environment. Great benefits and pay. I would love the opportunity to work for them again. I felt like I needed more training.
good,"Tolle Atmosphäre mit netten Arbeitskollegen."
good,"Changes in the air! No idea what this company will look like in a year. "
good,Bei Staples haben wir sehr nette und Hilfsbereite Kollegen außerdem viele Schulungen und Erklärungen um bei der Arbeit nicht unwissend zu sein. Ich kann eine Ausbildung und/oder einen Job bei Staples empfehlen.
good,The culture was very POSITIVE the biggest downside is the pay was VERY VERY LOW. I loved all of my managers but there was pretty much NO room for growth if you have your degree. The pay was very low.
good,Worked at Staples for 12 years and most of the time loved it. I still walk into a Staples and it feels like home. I had to leave because I was injury and they couldn't find a position that I could still work. Wish I had never been injured.
good,It was a great journey i enjoyed the time i had at staples and i do appreciate all the experience i was given i had enjoyment at the facilityand the workers were good to be helpful
good,"Great Sales Team"
good,"Staples taught me a lot that my previous job had not. I learned how to become a good advertiser, a good cashier, and more aware of store opportunities. I had the privilege of working in the copy center. When it didn't work out for me, they placed me as a cashier. From there I knew how to work in both parts of the store and knew how to answer some customer's questions about certain products in the store. Even though I had a terrible store manager, I wouldn't say it was a good work experience and it taught me how to be the cashier/sale associate I am today."
good,Worked at the Copy&Print center there. Fun place to work. Can be a little stressful at times because sometimes the customers ask for things out of my power and become angry. Other than that it was enjoyable to help people and laugh with co workers.
good,"awesome staff, great managers, but unfortunately it is a part time minimum wage gig. it was an awesome learning experience, but you cant really live off it."
good,"The most enjoyable parts of working at Staples is the people you work with. Everyone is typically relaxed and easy-going. However, the average work day is often painfully the same, day in and day out, and the pay is only 10 cents above minimum wage, even when given advancement within the store. Also, every time minimum wage rises, and it goes above the pay raises given after reviews are done, the pay raises are essentially non-existent, and you're back where you started. It's incredibly disheartening. Despite this, it's a job. It pays. As long as you do your job and don't cause problems, you're never getting fired."
good,Worked for Staples for over 12 years in multiple roles in sales and business development. Great place to work. Work/Life balance was sufficient. Must be used to change.
good,This job helped me become more friendly with customers while also getting work done and achieving specific goals. Staples has advanced me as a person.
good,It's a decent place to work but needs better pay and better benefits.  The culture is cool and management is nice but there is much room for advancement.
good,its not a bad job for students. Not a lot of room to grow and definitely lots of politics. it offers basic benefits and does not give a lot of hours.   good only part time
good,"Staples is not a bad place to work, the environment is great and the work is constant. The work can be competitive, but the wages are not up to scale!"
good,"They were able and willing to work with my schedule. They listened to suggestions, but may not have always acted on them. the company was fair to work for overall and I'm glad I had the opportunity to work there."
good,"Right now Staples is pretty crazy and stressful. There are a lot of changes going on and I have a lot of uncertainty about my role and my position. My manager is amazing and always has my back, which is pretty common among most of the leadership I've worked with. With a new CEO and CMO starting in a couple of weeks, we all feel uncertainty about what we should be doing. There is a lot of red tape and hands in the cookie jar for many projects, which can make things challenging. The culture is usually pretty good, although lately it's been going downhill a bit with ownership changes. There are some really great benefits (working from home flexibility, hour flexibility, casual dress, in-building gym, ATM, coffee shop, and dry cleaner, quite a bit PTO, great cafe (not free)), however health insurance is not the best."
good,"Working at Staples has been a challenge; however, it has been rewarding with all the professional relationships that have been made in the two years I have worked for the company. The past year, since I was promoted to Supervisor of the Copy & Print center, it has been filled with challenges and situations that have allowed me to grow as a leader in the company. The store manager makes it a point to sit down with every Supervisor of each department and ask what they can do to help all of us do our job better."
good,"A typical day at work is very varied. You are never doing the same job. You can either be working on emails, answering the phone or helping out with back order or delayed deliveries. I have learned a lot whilst working at Staples Advantage as they have put me on various courses that have helped to build the knowledge I have in Customer Service. The management team generally are very helpful, however, as of recent a few changes have taken place that have left a few employees unhappy. The hardest part of the job is maintaining your standard of quality. The bar is constantly changing and as of recent if feels as if nothing you do is never enough. The most enjoyable part of the job is the team members and the customers."
good,"It's a very easy job and I'm actually upset that I'm looking at leaving just because of how terrible the management team treats their employees. Overall though, the coworkers are nice and the job is good."
good,I have worked here for 8 years. I love what I do here I just wish I was paid more. the yearly raises are not that great. I making more at my second job than I do here at staples and I only been there for 4 years.
good,"The team at Staples was fantastic to work with.  The store manager, at the time, made some real questionable decisions, but the managers below him were great to work with.  The customers were great, the workload was great, and the hours were really balanced."
good,prefer not to answer  with the exception that the DM for the area was an exceptional coach and mentor.  Outside of that I prefer not to answer any additional information.
good,"constantly working, problem solving, communication with co worker essential, most be patient, know how to be a listener, management is helpful, many different  cultures"
good,"It's a job, not a career.  You won't move up at a reasonable pace, but, you'll make enough to get by and won't hate it either.  Been there 10 years - 5 star rating from customers, amazing sales numbers, dependable worker with ""exceeds expectations"" performance reviews... still treading water midway up the chain."
good,"Enjoyed the ride of going from 4th largest in industry to first. There was a lot of energy, fun and enthusiasm during this time and a culture of hard work and passionate performers."
good,staples is trying to survive in the retail world by draining the most it can out of it's employees and offering little or no rewards or compensation for it's increasing requirements.
good,"Friendly staff,great team building exercises. Lots of flexibility with hours"
good,"People are job scared and management strategy is lacking at this point.  Run for your lives, but if you do take a job, the work / life balance is good if you work for someone who embraces it.  With CEO leaving.....who knows what Staples will look like."
good,"Most retail businesses are the same, in sales its about percentages and upsales;  There were mandates and metrics that were set as goals not with the customers in mind OR the employees. Customer service became awkward and I stopped growing skills as a technician.  Great first job or college gig. Don't work full time for staples"
good,"work was fine, management kind of sucked but beyond thta it was a good job to have, i found the work to be right up my alley and my co workers were great"
good,"This job has allowed me to work with a great team of associates and a better management team. Be prepared to stay busy and work face to face with customers. This is a very physical job, between breaking down the truck and constant up and down ladders with product. There are daily challenges trying to keep customers happy and maintaining the store with minimal crew, thanks to minimal hours. Be ready to lead by example."
good,"For much of the time working at Staples we were severly understaffed, meaning that it was nice because we always had something to do, but often were behind on the workload despite having a hard working and cooperative team."
good,"Over the years my job changed substantially from spending half my time writing a company magazine that no longer exists to being the lead product copy writer. In between I worked on education pieces for fellow employees and wrote blogs. I moved through several departments."
good,Working for years I have seen a lot happen and people come and go. The amazing team feel and positive recognition has more then disappeared. All departments are out for themselves.
good,"Need to be efficient and work in a timely manner to get things done. On-site lunch. Management was easy to talk to about concerns or questions, Management was friendly and easy going. Friendly co-workers."
good,"I loved my coworkers, hated working in retail. Of course, like any retail job, the customers could be the actual devil, and tried my patience. Also, low hours and low pay. Higher than minimum wage, but lower than what we deserve."
good,"Overall a great place to work. I was initially hired due to my techincal skills with PCs. I worked in their tech department most of my four years there. I would do anything from helping customers purchase new equiptment along with my recommendations, to diagnosing and repairing pre-existing hardware. During my last year there I became a Copy & Print Specialist and spent most of my time working in their Print Center. There, I not only interacted and designed/created items for individual customers, but with entire businesses, big and small. I think Staples was a great environment for learning multiple skills and honing them in the process."
good,"The workplace culture is great, it is like having another side of the family, however, that probably cannot be said for all locations. There is minimal room for advancement, in my experience, and years of dedication doesn't really end up paying off. New staff end up being hired at a rate equal to, or more than dedicated staff, which causes tension and hostility on occasion."
good,"Staples has a decent balance of time on and off. It can get busy during some days and around certain holidays it will be a steady but manageable work load. There are plenty of opportunities to learn about computer technology and printing services, though those don't seem to impress employers outside of staples, and they do promote from within. Staples provides reasonable break times and the other employees are usually really great people and the managers are friendly and willing to help with whatever is needed."
good,"Loved working there during college, just wanted something more after. The job was great, I loved working in the Print and Marketing Center, and I loved the people i worked with"
good,There is a lot of Staples specific software that is required to know. The computers are comically slow and corporate will not replace them. There are a lot of rewarding things such as getting to see completed large projects. The job is pretty stressful.
good,"Great place to work, and very tight community. Management team is very nice as well. Must learn things on your on most of the time, because everything is very fast paced."
good,Small independent division of Staples Print Solutions. Offers accounting office supplies and oil & gas products. Very popular accounting  and oil & gas holiday cards.
good,unloading trucks and breaking down the merchandise on the  pallets. i learned how to use different kinds of scanners. people were great that i worked with as well as my supervisor.
good,The typical day at staples is generally fast paced and includes sales and administrative duties. The most enjoyable part of the job has to be the customers that come in and make your day.
good,the management was very understanding and helped me develop many of my retail skills further then before and opened me up to new  workplace positions and responsibilities.
good,"Staples is a great environment to interact with the guest and making connections with our daily customers. Not all guest were happy, but they always left with a smile.  I loved that we would have competitions on who could sale the most back to school passes for 15% off."
good,A typical day at work in Staples was very fast going. I learned a lot working at Staples. Management was pretty cool. The hardest part of the job was when the truck came with new products every week. The most enjoyable part of the job was checking customers out and helping them with anything they needed.
good,"it was a part tie job during college, not something stable or permanent. Given that it was good job. the management was good. No complains. Hours were flexible"
good,its great to be apart of staples we work as a team I learned lots from each and every individual to make me better at my job the most enjoyable part of the job is becoming family to staples
good,Good experience. Manager was very understanding and firm. Quick paced. On your feet a lot helping customers and moving things around. Employers were hardworking
good,"Fast paced, Cashier and retail experience. If you enjoy Electronics or office stuff then this is definitly the place for you, if not you might become bored with the position."
good,staples is a good start for teenagers who are looking for their first job or a summer job. around the ending of summer the back to school sales are crazy and busy but right after the sale everything slows down tremendously.
good,Job corp taught me alot and provide me with so much without it I wouldn't have got my high school diploma. But it just need more teachers who cared and more safely. Need good food
good,"This employer is great if you're looking for entry level customer service positions, looking to grow. The hours rarely change, being part time only you get 25 hours a week. "
good,"Best reasons to work here would be flexible hours, opportunities to get higher up in the company & I feel welcomed. Flexibility, great management, decent pay."
good,"Long time employee of this company. Wonderful people and great staff but it is retail, so little to no more for advancement unless you want to jump through flaming hoops till the day you die."
good,"Staples is your typical retail job. The biggest problem you will have, especially at this Staples, is dealing with customers who believe they are entitled to everything their heart desires. Coworkers can be a little sketchy at times, but overall they are nice people."
good,I enjoyed working at Staples because of the fantastic people I met there.  I was introduced to a new payroll system and learned many facets of my job during training.
good,typical work day is filled with many different objectives to keep you busy. This company really forces you to multitask throughout your day. The hardest part of the job is truly giving every customer the personal experience they look for. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting that customer feedback with regards to which you have done a good job.
good,I've learned that production is the most important part of being a good employee. Staying focused and dedicated to the task at hand while keeping a positive and ethical work attitude are the keys to success with and career opportunity.
good,"Typical day at work mainly consist of addressing customer's issues and question. I have learned that even in the middling of helping people out , one can learn a great deal of experience."
good,"While in school staples is a great place to work. Flexible work schedules, Tuition assistance, and Weekly paychecks. However, once you complete your degree program I would suggest that you look elsewhere for employment."
good,In most companies this large it is sometimes easy to get lost. With Staples I never felt like a number. I enjoyed management and working with a team that supported each other.
good,"Busy, fast and multi-tasking"
good,"When I statred the job requirements were achievable, but then the requirements and commission changed every 3 months, and became harder. As soon as you stop selling they put you under the rader ( which I expected being that it is a sales job). My only advise will be not to have restrictions on who we can sale to or where we can go,because after a while all the business in the area are "" not interested"" and the rest don't spend enough money."
good,This company has decent benefits.  There are some weird and unusual things you have to get use to.  This environment can get kind of old dealing with all the rules
good,Managers do not care enough about employees. Everything is too laid back. Breaks and 30 minute unpaid breaks are not taken seriously. Would work 8 hours and only get one 15 minute break that would usually be cut short. Would make you stay later than you were scheduled even if you had other important things that you were obligated to attend. Did not take into account days that you requested off or hours that you could not work.
good,"helping customers with cash transactions"
good,"I worked in the copy and print department for over a year. The management and staff were amazing. They did what they could with what they were given. That being said, the company itself was lousy with hours and proving that they cared about their employees. I was only allowed to work 24 hours a week even when 2 of the 4 employees in my department quit. The copy and print supervisor and myself had to handle the department on our own 7 days a week which meant stretched hours with no real time to even enjoy our 30 minute lunch break. The manager did what they could to help along with supervisors from other departments,but the lack of care on the company's part led me to leave. That and the fact that their pay was too close to minimum wage for the amount of work and experience we put in to helping small businesses achieve their own goals."
good,Staples was a really relaxed chill place to work at. Demands weren't too high except for meeting a quota of warranties on products we had to meet which was sometimes challenging.
good,Typical work day would consist of greeting a customer that walked into my section. Assisting the customer in what they were looking for in my department. Also everything had to look very presentable to the public all items were put in very specific places that we have to remember.
good,"Overall it's a good company to work for. Management can be hit or miss, but most of them are fair and generally nice. The work is pretty simple, but they follow all the other retail guidelines: Profit. As a salesman/tech, I was required to fix computers in-store or in-home, and also expected to sell merchandise with warranties. The warranties regarding furniture are awesome, but the computer ones are mediocre at best. If you didn't attempt to force the warranty on the customer and add-on other merchandise to the sale (printer cable and ink with a printer, a printer, desk and chair with a computer) you were basically shunned. Add-ons are what drive profits, and profit is all they want."
good,Productive and fun place to work. Great place to learn and understand how the federal government division operates. A great place to work/ excellent work environment.
good,"I had an amazing time working at Staples, the environment and people made the job great. Always up on the latest technology and very competitive. A great company."
good,"Staples was all around a fun opportunity, It gave me a good head start into what to expect with deadlines and the print industry. But You can't make a career on $9 an hour. Use this job to get you feet wet, build confidence, learn your printing basics and move on."
good,"My typical day at work is mentoring and monitoring employees as they work,counting registers as well as helping customers, processing shipments and delegating employees.  I learned how to deal with many difficult customers and solve challenges.  Management worked together to make the business successful and each individual was assigned to different levels in store to accommodate customer orders and purchases.  Very fast paced and busy.  The hardest part of my job are small staff which at times ensure customer frustration and speed of the work day. My most enjoyable part my job is collecting compliments from customers about service from my staff as well as myself, having a successful day."
good,"A typical day includes some time working on computers.  Most of the day is spent working with customers on sales and computer issues, as well as floor inventory.  All of which would be expected."
good,"It was a short time, but I learned that in that job you have to be a hunter. It was very cut throat and unfortunately, there was only so much time in the day. Not having a boss on many days did not help and unfortunately I was lost at times. I did learn the skills of lead gening, objection handling, and cold calling, but in terms of process, it was not the best."
good,"I love working with the public. From the time I get in I have a chance to really help people make the right decisions in purchansing, answering questions, and just communicating with the public. "
good,"The store Managers have a good idea of whats going on but upper management seem like they have never even walked in a Staples store. In other words policies that don't make good business sense are implement constantly and yet they are counted as ""successful"" because a handful of stores were able to use them somehow even though a majority suffer for using them."
good,"Use to be a good place raised insurance over 100$a week cutting hours, they promote their budy before the people who is the most qualified, everyone is replaceable to them"
good,"I enjoyed most of my time with Staples UK. The superstore opened just as the university in Lincoln did, but was probably too big for the city at the time. Office World was in the same town and had been for a number of years."
good,"Loved working for Staples.  Spent the first 17 years managing Corporate Key Account from Ryder to Universal Orlando.  The next three years assisted with growing Staples  Print Business."
good,Staples is a nice place to work. Everyone is friendly and helpful so your not afraid to ask questions. They are also very understanding about situations in life that may occur and work with you on them
good,"A typical day at staples consisted mostly of stocking shelves and helping customers whenever we saw them.The customers can easily make the rest of your day great or horrible depending on what kind of mood they're in, which can make it the hardest part of the job sometimes. At the same time they also teach you to not take everything so seriously and not to be offended by what they say, to help keep a better attitude for the rest of the day. But it's not always bad, the customers can also be the most enjoyable part when you meet someone that has similar interests and views. My co-workers and managers were always helpful when needed and put the customers first."
good,"Management staff were young and did not have enough experience for supervising staff that was in their age group.  This location had no respect for the labor laws regarding minors working over a number of hours or for that matter pass the time minors are legally allowed to work.  If you are a high school or college student, I don't recommend you seek employment in this location.  "
good,"staples was my first proper job, it was very laidback too laidback at times that the managers overlook staff who are late or staff who dont turn up. there is no career progression but the people are very nice and helpful and willing to support each other. it was very easy to get a swap shifts and days off in short notice. there was lack of staff during trade hours cause there was no budget. head office need to have better communication with the stores especially on an up and coming promotion rather than leaving it to the last minute."
good,"Love the job and totally dedicated to it. Management is engaged, friendly and understanding. It can get very busy though so you can easily find your self running around like madman. Most of the time it is a team environment but often some associates slack off or take the lazy route which causes more work for everyone else. One of the biggest issues for me is the terrible computer systems that impead your abilities to help customers efficiently. Overall though I would say that Staples is a great place to work if you can get past the low pay and no overtime."
good,"Steady paced, productive workplace, easy to remember things due to repitition. Freight generally came on Wed-Fri to restock the store and back warehouse"
good,"Too much micromanagement, not enough training for new hires.inventory shipments are constantly wrong and/or late. Management is horrible, company is obsessed with selling a bad product called liquid armor, the company does not care about ethical sales. The tech position is a sales not a tech position."
good,I enjoyed it to a point. I liked to help my customers but when it came time for a raise I was actually very disappointed after a year of service to get a .25 cent raise.
good,quiet workplace i worked the electronics division of the store. I learned about all type of different electronic devices how to use and sell them. Management was good people i became very close with 1 of the managers and still friends to this day.
good,"•	Provide data solution and business recommendation at a client facing role"
good,Running a low volume store involves more time as an employee than a manager the business.  Low starting associate rate leads to less than qualified associates.
good,Boring but doable.  Can be hectic at times when very busy but not often. Coworkers were motivated and willing to assist if backup was required on register.  Hardest part of the job was dealing with belligerent customers.
good,"I have worked at Staples for about two years now, and although it can be a very busy and fast paced job, I love the people I work with!"
good,Staplesis a good job to work at if you are a student as the hours are reasonable and can almost always fit around life outside of uni and home. The management are nice and the staff are great.
good,"The job isn't very hard, pretty easy actually. The problems I've seen is usually form high ups. The usual, sitting in office and sending down orders, but don't really know what truly going on in the stores. Only see the numbers on papers and that's all. In the overall five years I've worked for Staples, I've seen a few district managers come and go, some are better than others. It's a fine line in my opinion, but if you're going to be a district manager, don't have someone do something you wouldn't. Emails are great, but stopping by, or calling in person to find out what the actual problem is tends to help a lot more than sending emails demanding changes to this and that. As for as store goes, help customers, get your tasks done, freight etc, not to hard. Somehow some people always manage to mess it up."
good,"Very friendly and nice place to work. Possibilities to advance in your career. "
good,"management was great. Some days, there was a lot of running around and feeling that I was underpaid. I am leaving/left because of cutting down hours, and I wanted my usual."
good,Great place for college students with flexible hours. Management teams are easy going and is a pleasant environment to work at
good,The job is easy. Good entry level job. Monday thru Friday no weekends is a plus. Managers are fair. Learned how to drive equipment.
good,"They have good prices, so we had a decent amount of customers to keep me busy.  I have learned a lot about repairing computers. They have a high employee turnover rate.."
good,"This is a very good part time job. It can be a bit demanding but nothing out of the ordinary. If you're looking for a full time job, it is mostly restricted to management."
good,Management is kind and flexible but work is often not completed because employees do not take pride in the work.  The company also seems to attract customers who feel they deserve a lot for little to no compensation.
good,Fast paced environment providing many challenges to overcome. Great promotion opportunity and a staff that cares. The company takes pride in its associates and always looks to better itself.
good,The copy Print area is a area to see one's work come to a full fruition.  The copy print associate receives an order and fulfills the required product in a very short time. Copy/Print professionals enjoy the beginning through end result of many Print products.  Most Print Jobs are fulfilled with in 6 Hours.
good,"I enjoyed working for Staples, the upper management team was always there to help and teach you to help further me in my career goals."
good,Come in and do your job. Learned to work as a team and how to pace yourself. Management can be slave drivers at times. Co workers are second family. Hardest part is racing time to finish. Best part is getting paid.
good,"The managers are (literally) yelled at from corporate to push sales of additional items creating an conflicting combative environment between members who's interests were to sale new computers and other members whose interests were to fix old computers.  "
good,"Taking over from other supervisor & re-allocating of shift."
good,"I worked at Staples for about a year, and I worked as both a front end cashier and an Easy Tech (now known as Certified Tech) associate. I worked here my junior year to senior year in high school, and I actually really loved it. The managers for the first half of working there were amazing, they were all very laid back and chill. They always tried to talk to me and made me feel good, but eventually they all got promoted and we got new managers. The new managers were actually the reason I ended up quitting, didn't really like their attitude and they were rude to many of the employees. About five others quit because of them, including me."
good,im a customer service rep and cashier i love working with people so i have fun with it i get to see almost everyone who comes in the store and i enjoy talking to my co-workers and helping anyone who needs it. I don't think my job is hard at all it doesn't challenge me anymore.
good,"Productive day, always busy, heavy traffic. Met a lot of beautiful people (customers and coworkers). I enjoyed talking to everyone I met because they showed me different things."
good,Staples is a great place to work in. The company gives back to the community by taking part in raise fund events. It also helps out people with special needs by preparing them for the workforce.
good,"Typical day was doing the cash office and then working the floor. I learned how to fix computers, how to open the store, and how to do the manager juties. Management we had to great managers and a new manager that started that was very demanding and lost alot of employees. My co-workers were great to work with got a long with all. Hardest part of the job was dealing with grabby customers. Enjoyable part of the job meeting new customers."
good,Team atmosphere even though we work independently as drivers. Management was supportive and confident of our ability to manage our delivery route efficiently. Eventually the company decided to hire independent contractors and they are laying us off.
good,Staples was a really solid company to work for. Management was supportive and listened to employees at the store level. I was allowed to run my department and always felt supported by the manager and assistant manager. I only moved on due to a lack of advancement opportunity in my area of the state.
good,The staff is very friendly and keep there work placed organized. Requires someone with patience and energy. At times you are required to be flexible in more than one are. Overall good job to start with
good,"good place to work, temperature controlled building, the work is fairly easy, fast pace ,good workout, my hours 5:30 am-2:00 pm."
good,As an easy tech I was able to expand my knowledge of how other big companies worked on computers and what they could and could not do. It is a great place to work if you have the time. Everyone was helpful and did not hesitate to give a helping hand.
good,"Staples is a good company to work for."
good,A typical day at work consists of providing efficient customer service as well as managing inventory. I learned how to multi-task and how to work independently. My co-workers we amazing and we worked as a team to get work done effectively The hardest part of the job is the constant physical pressure I endured from consistently putting larger boxes in the top stock section. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping the costumers and making sure they are satisfied with whatever they buy in the store or anything i help them order online.
good,Customers are very nice. I get to meet different people every day. It is very rewarding when customers from a year ago call to see if I am still working at staples because I gave such good customer service.
good,"Staples was always a great place to work up until the company decided to rebrand itself in 2013.  Corporate management became hard on employees and retail management.  Serving the company as both an employee and as a manager, I have seen the good and the bad of this multi-million dollar company."
good,My experience has taught me how to be able to multi task. Customers come first. That's the way it should be. Managers are great! I have learned a lot with Staples. Always busy never bored.
good,"Il faut savoir parler aux clients sans arrêts et toujours être de bonne humeur, être capable de soulever quelques charges pour placer des boîtes et aussi placer le stock. Il faut savoir être dynamique et toujours à son affaire."
good,The company did have an internal rewards program that was nice. If you were full time it was a great company to work for. However full time was scarce at best.
good,"Management is very helpful, they work very closely with associates."
good,"A typical day of work involved moving stock, cashiering, and doing store reports. I learned a lot in a short period of time but it was mostly learning on my own. The management was good but not great. The hardest part of the job was having to fill multiple positions without help. The most enjoyable was connecting with associates and customers alike."
good,"Work with a team of professionals who receive and deal"
good,Working for the Staples Advantage team was a delight. The management team was competent and supportive. Co-workers are team members who work hard to help the team succeed.
good,"Fast-paced environment with a steady flow of customers. I stayed at the front of the store greeting customers and assisting cashiers with returns, change from the safe, retrieving orders shipped to our store for customers, placing online orders. Light merchandising and stocking the shelves with product. processed mark-downs and answered product questions and inquiries. Fielded phone calls. Administered breaks and lunches. Open and closed store: counting registers and the safe, stocking register areas, armed/disarmed store alarm, key-holder. "
good,"Good working environment and everyone got along. Everyone help the other person. Always busy, time went fast. Work had good supervision."
good,"Loved the job.  Loved helping customers.  Loved fixing customers computers. I just wish I had a better boss, all he cared about was numbers and not customers.  Customer relations is the key to having returning customers."
good,"Typical day at Staples is: there were always orders that were not complete from last shift so when customers returned for there items and it wasn't done, they were upset."
good,"This company, albeit compensation was extremely low, was a company & position that I grew to love and hated to leave. The managers were professional and willing to work with you if a disagreement arose. The employees all pitched in to help and you were always made to feel like family."
good,"Corporate management is great at training set-up and daily"
good,this place is OK.. Not a great place if you are looking for a career
good,"Staples was a good company to work at. Most of my co workers were great to talk to and helped the day go by easily. Management was mostly good, but very unfriendly. My tasks were to help customers find items they were listening to, stock shelves, cash customers out and assist customers pick out computers or printers or cameras by insuring they have the correct knowledge of each product to make a good decision in which item to buy."
good,"My typical work day sometimes included:"
good,"While working at staples I learned a great deal about computers and computer repair. Knowledge that I can take with me wherever I go, and broaden my knowledge as I move on in my life. Computers have always been a hobby of mine.  To be able to work with customers computer issues to troubleshoot in a timely fashion, and was very rewarding when I solve the issue and the customer is satisfied."
good,"I learned what kind of products a customer would need and how to supply it in a efficient manner, brought my confidence up substantially, making connections and a smile to each customers face. My management was experienced and knowledgeable in the retail business. My co-workers made me feel apart of the team and helped me to learn what I needed to make sure I brought the best service to each customer. Remembering where every product is and making sure I led the customer to the right path was challenging when I first started working but began getting easier as I continued working with them. Meeting new customers and old customers but making their day with just finding the right product made me enjoy my position."
good,"Difficulty of the job depends on what department you work in. I have worked in all 4: Office supplies, Easy tech, Copy and print center, and front end. The only real difficulty is learning to deal with customers and still get your stuff done. Sometimes you get pulled away to sell a chair or computer and you have to constantly make up for it once you go back to tasking (stocking items, fixing displays, etc). Management is good when they work together. I've had the luck of having some of the most caring managers, but they weren't perfect. Back to school season is a nightmare for any store, but during the off season, things are somewhat slow and easy. The employees are all one big family, which can be good and bad. The pay isn't great, but it's provided for me for 3 years."
good,"A day working at Staples is always interesting at all times."
good,"good work force ,lacking on personal health efforts, building lacking any heating. caught pneumonia do to open ventelation"
good,"A typical day at Staples UK Ltd involves assisting customers with information on laptops, printers, tablets and other technology, along with this I assist customers on the copy and print centre which involves printing, copying documents and other print related items such as posters and business cards. "
good,"Fast paced, customer orientated, I made and designed things from business cards to large scale posters and document production"
good,"a typical day at work was having to deal with a lot of customers. Especially when Back to School season started. But it wasn't too bad. My co-workers were able to help me out if I ever need any help finding a specific item. What I learned was how to be a valuable asset in the retail business. The hardest part of the job was knowing what all the aisles held. But as soon I knew all of that, the job became easy. The most enjoyable was working with some friends I went to high school with. That made the experience memorable."
good,"The work day was routine, which was fine.Learned several different skills, I was cross trained and I liked that.Management was young and was just learning which was not good. Then the big lay off hit and they pretty much went to temps only. Doing it seems to get all full timers out. So then it was a rough place to work, then team work started to disappear, Then it was everyone for them self to keep their job. I found nothing hard about the job I really liked it so it wasnt hard it was a learning experience."
good,"Great company, Copy and Print center takes a certain breed of person to handle the repetitive demands"
good,I work hard each day for my company and my team.  It is my goal to make us all as successful as we can possibly be and I always achieve my goals.
good,"Most times a typical day is fun the associates are nice and we had a good relationship. I learned how to be a great leader. Management is okay, usually pretty laid back. The co-workers are nice and fun to talk to and deal with. When you have to reprimand an associate for something. I enjoyed the copy center and the customers satisfaction."
good,Attentively query customer needs and recommend what items they need to accomplish their various Technology Tasks.
good,As a production planner I was always the one who had to start the day off right making sure orders were entered into the order taking system correctly and making sure we are making our up-sells. At this job I learned how one up-sell can change the whole dynamic of an order bringing in more money. My managers were readily available whenever I needed them and relied on me to bridge the communication gap between them and the production associates. My co-workers were very reliable. I could count on them knowing that if I was not in the building they are still working as if I was there running the day. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to take charge and having management back you up and as well as interacting with the customers.
good,My typical day was always quite busy.  I never stopped moving and I was in constant contact with customers (which I enjoyed).
good,"Great place to learn and Work, with opportunity for advancement."
good,"Staples in elmsford, N.Y was stable place to work. A nice environment."
good,"they have a union so you have job security unless management doesn't like you, then forget about your union rights because they'll find a way to screw you. The older people that work there think they own the place and try to act like they're supervisors. Young people don't tend to strive there because the moment the older guys see a young guy striving, they get jealous or feel threatened and just like that you just might get blamed for something that you never took part in. Management really does suck here because they get no feedback from employees. They talk to supervisors only and boy are the supervisors dummies. I have no idea how the higher the position, the slower the person is, its crazy. lets not get into favoritism either."
good,"A typical day would be me working on register, greeting customers and having a positive attitude. The most enjoyable part of my day would be being able to help customers and the worst part would be when you can't help a customer. My management has been alright. I have a lot of great ideas that I wish I could voice, but I don't because I feel as if they don't really care. I have learned so much, such as working s a team in a work environment, and always having a positive attitude."
good,"I have to make sure that the Tech sales are always growing, coming up with plans that will make the store look better in the eyes of the company. The hardest part is being the fall person when something goes wrong. Sometimes being at a lead position has its benefits and other times it has it faults"
good,"A typical day at work : we check for any pending orders first thing in the morning and complete them right away. Help every single customer that walks in while not getting behind on print orders. "
good,"It wasn't a bad place to work,slightly tedious, bathroom time allotted was not much and it negatively affected your stats if you went over it, "
good,"Staples is a great company that really worked with my school schedule, I am a college student, and offers some great benefits part time and full time. Your managers make or break the experience. I have worked at over 6 Staples store from  Virginia to Georgia and the managers are the key every time. Good managers make it a good place to work and bad managers can leave a lot to be desired within the work place."
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with the most, but when I was hired I had very little training and after about thirty minutes on my first day I was left alone as the only cashier. If I needed help I needed to page someone and hope they came quickly."
good,"A typical day would include driving sales and company initiatives and priorities. Managing payroll and inventory, merchandising, coaching and role playing with associates."
good,It's a job. Be prepared to work your butt off and sell sell sell. The more you sell the more hours they give you and raises.
good,daily work includes answering up to 100 calls per day from staples ssociates nation wide.  knowledge of benefits and staples policies/procedures a must.
good,Good place to work. Was started at $12/h. No weekends. No uniforms. Very casual. Fast paced.
good,Staples was a great experience for me to grow my knowledge in the retail world. My knowledge grew so as so did I in the company itself. It was an awesome experience specially with the management that were there when I started.
good,"Company that is directing itself to online, streamlined sales model began to thin out store models and eliminate positions. While I was one of the favored managers, I did not feel that the long-term future with this organization was secure being a retail-based employee."
good,"The management team that I had the privilege of working with is pretty awesome. The only bad thing is, you don't ever get to move up. So there are few chances for a raise. And there will only be a few full time workers. So unless you are only in need of a part time job, then this wouldn't be a place for you. Not enough hours of work to live off of."
good,Enjoyed my time at Staples. Offered little advancement for the 2 years I was there. Typical retail hours. Management doesn't really care about the good aspects you brought to the company until you tell them you're leaving. Pay is decent.
good,Fast paced sales environment. Good overall product knowledge and sales technique training. Management sought input from associates to assist in improving store performance. Customer focused.
good,Staples Business Depot was my first real payin g job in my life. I got to experience first hand what it is like to work in retail and the challenges you have dealing with customers on a daily basis. what started out as a co-op job became a paying summer job in 2005 for me. I feel that this job is good for people starting out in the work place but it is not a career job as pay and benefits are low. This would be a great job for a high school student in the summer time and the busy back to school rush in August and September. It is not long term.
good,"we didn't have a typical day. Everyday was different. One day it would be busy from open (7am) to close (9pm). Other days we'd be luck to get 5 customers. I learned how to fix printers, copiers, and fax machines. My manager was very cool. Hardest part of my job was when I had no help (co-worker was on break or not there yet) and had a lot of people that needed something. Most enjoyable part was the stories I heard on a daily basis."
good,"I was a cherry picker, packer, I worked in inventory and quality control. The management here was okay but some of the supervisors were lazy and only concerned about themselves. The work itself was very easy and I adapted very well. There is room for promotional opportunities in various departments."
good,Working at Staples was fun and stressful at times. While working at staples I learned the importance of being a team player and customer service.
good,was very hard to meet precentages while stocking selecting was no problem people was very helpful trying to give you pointers and things to change
good,"Boa para se trabalhar no que diz respeito ao relacionamento interpessoal: clima leve, jovem e amigável. Outra vantagem é o fato de ser uma multinacional: a necessidade de alinhamento às metas globais da matriz americana, que é líder mundial no segmento, lhe serve de incentivo para buscar aprendizado e resultados. Empresa leal a seus compromissos e responsabilidades: pagamentos com excelentes benefícios, todos concedidos rigorosamente em dia, sem falhas."
good,"Staples is base mostly about sells starting from the copy center, computer sales , computer repair and selling customers attachments with their product. the most enjoyable part of the job is great associates and good loyal customers"
good,I worked at staples when i was a teenager and i had a good experience. i worked for minimum wage as a cashier.
good,"Store stays very busy. Each customer is different, some more complex than other."
good,"a typical day at work"
good,Staples is a good environment for working with a hard working team.
good,"I started up with the facility and was able to work with and learn many diverse technologies. I typically worked 10 hour days in which  I was very busy, very active."
good,"Responsible for cashiers and copy center, 3rd key - Shops: Cascais and Montijo. I learned a lot. With a work culture with little interest in human resources. Expected much of anyone it worked no return."
good,I work in a challenging department of Staples as Copy and Print Sales Manager.  Constantly on the move; very busy profitable area. B2B sales; customer service; time management.
good,"Very busy place to work. "
good,This was a great part time job that paid great for part time work. A typical day could range from very busy to very slow. the co-workers are what made the job enjoyable and worth while. Management could have used a lot of improvement.
good,"Emphasis on training, process oriented, in major overhaul of structure right now."
good,They really worked with me trying to juggle 2 jobs. They were very supportive of me and encouraged me with my success.
good,"It is a decent work environment.  Advancement is ok if your willing to relocate, if not then it is slow.  Max rate for most positions is $11/hr, after that raises stop.  Benefits are ok if your on the west coast, excellent if on the east.  United Health Care is useless for most things."
good,"A typical day at staples, as soon as you set foot into the store as an employee you are required to go straight to work and your work area. Well at staples i learned alot about teamwork, if someone is backed up with customers, whether they call for back up or not, you should always be there to help take care of customer.Management at staples was very good there was managers for every dept. of the store, co-workers were always nice and always did the right thing in any situation they are what id call a team.The hardest part of the job was trying to help anxious customers, if something wasnt instore by the time we said it would be or the online order form said it would be, customers got very upset and alot of them would either do returns or just purchase anything. I enjoyed helping customers and working as hard as i possibly could to help the store in any ways shape or form."
good,"As a tech its a fun place to work i loved the work, interacting with customers, and doing pc repairs."
good,"Good management locally for the most part, although some have left for other stores. Like any big chain of retail stores it all depends on the stores management. "
good,"Staples as a whole was a great experience for me.  I have been taught valuable lessons in how to manage people, the customers, and myself.  I have promoted twice, and was always willing to go the extra mile.  I have developed many good relationships with customers over the years.  They knew they could count on me to get what they needed done, and valued my knowledge and ability.  The hardest part of the job was finding quality people that wanted to work.  Some would expect a higher wage with no experience, and you wish there were people you could hire but couldn't pay them enough to stay.  I enjoyed my co workers.  They made it fun to be there, since most times you would see them more than your family.  "
good,"Enjoyed helping customers and working with most of my co-workers, however, the productivity of a single day depended drastically on who was working. It seemed there was not enough incentive to drive minimum wage workers to really try to do a better job."
good,It was a good temporary job for over the summer. I enjoyed my coworkers for the short period of time i worked there.  
good,"-Cashier or Copy and Print"
good,"Learned a lot in Staples as well as many other different areas in the store. Off loading Staple trucks working the stocking area, every month learning both worksheets & computer on what is new taught and learning how the product works. More training done in both the Print Center as well as the Computer Tech. "
good,"my review on staples business depot is that in an average day working it would have about 22% of people coming to buy paper for their printers or coping machines. i learned quiet alot while working in staples and got great personal and customer service skills, the management in the company has set goals for completion everyday. my co-workers were very open and easy to talk with if i had any situation involving a customer the hardest part of the job i'd say though is keeping the shelves organized at all times. the most enjoyable part working there was seeing that i've helped the customer find what they were looking for."
good,Learned skills to assist customers and how to operate things that are common in the work place such as cash registers and lifting devices. There was some disputes in the work place among my other workers due to stress and an overall general disregard for respect but otherwise was pretty good.
good,"A typical day at work is not too bad as long as their is an ample amount of focus on the sales floor. It can be fun at times when business is slow but other times the day can just drag on. There's a lot to learn from this company from a retail standpoint. My coworkers were great, nothing to complain about except for a few. I had no real difficulties on the job since I have worked for almost seven years but till this day I do face the challenge of meeting company goals in a store that doesn't generate high margin of sales. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I get to the end of my shift."
good,• Work with customers for in store and onsite education dealing with technology.
good,A typical day you would usually restock shelves with new merchandise. assist customers with their needs remove and replace any damaged or opened merchandise.
good,"Amazing place to work, Great surroundings and the staff was always really nice!"
good,As a company Staples is very customer focussed and puts the customer at the heart of everything. Sales training is good and ethical. Product knowledge training is available however it is a challenge to have time to access it as there is a lot of task too.
good,"Currently responsible for supporting the organizations top market covering a $250mm book of business, supporting 100+ sales leaders across four states."
good,"A typical day at work is providing customer service and handling customer issue. It also consist of supervising product distribution and coaching associates as well as maintaining reports and files. I have learned how to manage my time effectively, provide outstanding customer service and build a special repore with customers as well as my associates. Management team is always there to help and my co-workers respect each other. The hardest part of my job is being needed more places that I can be at one time and the time demanded of me. The most enjoyable part of my job is customer satisfaction and getting to know my customers as they become frequent shoppers."
good,The work environment is sometimes slow. I would assist with customers but sometimes there wouldn't any customers and would have be very slow. My co-workers would be great to talk with and be with.
good,Um dia típico de trabalho passava pela arrumação do posto de trabalho (caixa) e por prestar o melhor atendimento possível ao cliente.
good,Staples has allowed me to continue to work there even with my ever-so changing school schedule. I have been thankful for that since it gave me the opportunity to complete my degree while working to pay for school at the same time.
good,"relocate store aisles as per new planograms pre-assigned by staff managers, assemble furniture as required, clean merchandise, install Protex security system on merchandise, mount displays, install shelving and dividers, place mid-stock and over-stock according to ""Bureau en Gros"" standards."
good,"good place to work, for students. Long work hours.job hours differs."
good,"Days start with hitting the floor running and staying that way till you have to put a end to do the documenting. Brainstorming, collorbrating, experiementing, assessing, who could ask for a better way to spend your day? Then implementing the plan, the emotions of the associates trying this new idea for the first time. Will they like it? Will this plan work? How wil it benefit the customer?"
good,Hardest part of my job was setting end caps at change of season and looking at the plan-o-gram hated it lol
good,"I was great at my job, only Management had no interest to learn what I do to back me up"
good,Love the retail scene and the possibilty of advancement.
good,Working here has taught me a lot about prioritizing work and doing everything you can to meet deadlines in a prompt manor. I enjoy working here because i like working with stores to complete their jobs and i enjoy the printing field. My co workers are very friendly and courteous of each other and it is very much a team environment.
good,"A typical day last about 8 to 9 hours at work. I work from 8am to 4pm and i start my day off with a daily cycle count or a zero balance walk. I am in charge of all the inventory that comes in and out of my building, Two out of the 5 days I'm at work i'm usually breaking pallets down and managing a checklist of the product we have and get on our load. The biggest thing I learned working for my job for 7 1/2 years has to be patience. The management team I'm currently working with right now are great as far as personal level, but now as a work team. My co-workers are also excellent people to be around but they go off of the management team who sits around and does nothing almost 75% of the day. The hardest part of my job is not having help. I worked for 3 staple stores in these long 8 years and me being put into this store was to help and maintain it. Which I am doing the best I can but the help is not there at this store. The most enjoyable part of my job is actually having this job. I'm very grateful and appreciative that I have a job and I try not to complain nor take this job for granted. I'm a hard worker and at any company I have the motivation to show it."
good,"typical day staples was quite easy not alot of customers at points during the year, but good business."
good,"This job required me to explore many aspects of my skill set. I had to be high energy and fun with the children in my classes, as well as educate parents about class structure. I was required to lead on many levels, and gained valuable sales experience. This job required working in a small team, and allowed me to grow and explore my ability to build myself as an individual for a company."
good,Productive place to work
good,The schedule you work is very nice. They do not have a flexible Life/work balance.
good,A typical day at work is a daily review of the previous day on how you and your team sold. You look for hits and misses on sales and how to improve. Setting up goals for the day. Walk your department see what needs to be done.
good,I was working in the sales department at the local Staples. The job usually consisted of assisting customers with making purchases and providing them all the information about the products
good,A typical day at work would be watching the work floor while the management team met up and discuss the days goal. making sure there were no lines or helping with the speed of the line. My co-workers were all great. What I learned is that you have to have patients and you most learn how to provide perfect customer services. The hardest part of the job was doing all I could for a customer but still leaving dem unsatisfied. And the enjoyable part of the job was having Pot Roast and trying out different cultural dishes.
good,A very challenging work experience but the challenge made it worth coming in everyday to do my best
good,I worked here for two years. I miss working here at Staples. I've learned various things dealing with electronics and office goods. The hardest part of my job was lifting heavy furniture. I enojoyed my job most when I worked with customers find what they're looking for. The mangement team here was nice. Flexibility really wasn't an issue here. They pretty much worked around your schedule.
good,"Managers were considerate, friendly, and genuinely cared about thier associates as individuals as well as employees"
good,"Being a tech Supervisor was a good learning experience, had to keep up with company goals in sales and customer service, great co workers, lots of work in stocking the store and keeping it looking clean."
good,"I was a delivery driver, long hours and it's hard especially if your route has a lot of paper.The management is good but sometimes the supervisor is stupid"
good,"At first I didn't like this job because I hardly get my 8 hrs. It's busy when it's busy and it's slow when it's slow. Work depends on the volume. Some people like it some don't. Management are okay. They have their favorites. In my case, they would work with me when I need a Voluntary Time Off. I don't know if it's because I work hard but they are very good with others and I hear complaints from others. As of now, they are in a process to appreciate their employees more. They provide snacks and drinks sometimes and just now they are doing raffles for perfect attendance."
good,"Busy days with employee shortages. Management is organized, helpful and motivating. The enjoyable part of the job is recognition from the superiors and providing the heartiest of customer service and their feedbacks. unfortunately, the same can not be said for all the employees there which in turn sometimes makes the work harder."
good,Staples has a great work environment . Team work is highly recommended and in my point of view is needed to get through daily task. Working there helped improve my Customer Service Skills
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Staples. I was hired to be a Sales Associate, and work on the floor, however the managers noticed that I was much better and more comfortable on the registers therefor I was switched over to being a cashier. When I unfortunately was injured, they accommodated and I didn’t receive any push back, which is extremely rare for companies. Overall, I would recommend Staples as a place to work"
good,"When I worked for Staples it was a nice friendly environment. Sales Associates were very nice and supportive towards there new employees who start working for the first time, but as time went on and the managers cut your hours unfairly, even though you have told them in interviews that you have a disability, they will take advantage of your situation to cut your hours until you have no choice but to resign. I understand working in a retail store means you have to move faster and multitask to keep a company running and to keep customers satisfied. However, if managers have a hard time understanding that one of your employees have disabilities that may limit them on how to handle tasks and you try to get rid of them by cutting their work hours to the point where you only work 1 day a week, that is unacceptable."
good,Good benefits and compensation. Hours were very variable depending on the amount of orders that had to be processed each day. There was a lack of consistency in the set time and end time most weeks during the holiday season.
good,Company was a good place to work while I was there.  Management team was sypportive and good to work with.  Ownership changed hands so I am not familiar with how the culture may have changed.
good,An sich macht der Job Spaß und auch der Kunden Kontakt ist da sehr hoch angesetzt. Allerdings ist die Marktleitung nicht wirklich fähig und lässt mehr machen als selbst Sachen an zu gehen  der Grund:er kann es nicht !
good,Staples is a whirlwind somedays with people who have know idea what a computer is somedays and other days you have no customers. Management can differ but I enjoyed it
good,Overall it was a good experience. For me the hardest part was the commute. Communication can always be better and finding reliable staff. Both are common issues in the retail industry.
good,"good work place, great people. I enjoyed the customer interaction and the products are nice. the management was decent and the scheduling was also fair."
good,"Have been with staples for 16 years in various roles"
good,"The health benefits were great.  When we had the store inspection.  Staples came in as customers.  I was rated the #1 employee.  After that, my job went downhill.  Everyone came against me."
good,"A normal full time shift of working will be long, but i learned to be an order picker, and to count inventory ,the hardest part of the job is overtime and its manditory"
good,"I like that I work for staples. our hours are flexible, and there is not too much drama. Make sure you learn quick because you will get attitude if you repeat the same mistakes."
good,"If you work hard, they reward. Bonuses are given within teams and departments. I personally had a great manager and great supervisors that supported me and were very understanding."
good,"I love working at staples. I love the people and it is a great atmosphere. The people are what make me stay. "
good,"Staples is an excellent place to begin growing yourself as a customer service representative and to grow knowledge about how a work environment can flow. I would only recommend Staples as an introductory job for somebody looking to plan their roots in something with a stronger promise of growth or advancement; however, you will typically grow strong with those whom you work with and develop a strong team!"
good,"Very busy location. Back up is minimal, tends to be a bit stressful trying to complete the orders in que, helping customers at the counter, in self serve, and answer phone calls. My general manager is awesome overall the store is a great place to work if you can multitask and keep a positive attitude."
good,"Not a bad job really for what it is, the only thing I wish would make things better would be a good amount of hours, has some backwards policies on things but nothing too much to complain about really."
good,"I loved my job, I also enjoyed my coworkers. It was great experience for retail and for other helpful skills. The Staples store also has a variety of useful items for a variety of ages."
good,"I liked working here, all my coworkers were friendly and no one was ever rude or unable to help me. I enjoyed my time here and hope others can as well. The only reason I left was because there was issues with a new manager that were not being resolved and it made work uncomfortable. I hope it gets resolved but I never heard anything else from them since."
good,Brick and Mortar location with standard pay and practices. Team on a store level was wonderful. Company as a whole seemed to be in flux with changing direction on a quarterly basis.
good,"Working at staples was great. I liked interacting with customers. Being able to help customers throughout their store experience. It was a fast paced job, but I enjoyed every minute of it."
good,"I started with a GM that was later fired for messing with time punches. 6 months later I got an okay GM who didn't know much about the operation of the store but was much better with the employees. 6 months later after this manager left i acquired an amazing manager who knew everything. In summary, The pay is not great, but if the GM is worth his salt, it is a great first job."
good,"The hardest part of the job is keeping yourself busy. If it is not peak season then you do not get many calls at all. I love being around people and assisting customers but when we are not busy, it is hard to stay focused."
good,There was always something to do always something new to learn. 30 minute lunch breaks are a complete waste of  Time. Fun place to work as long as you don't mind being on your feet.
good,"Staples is a good place to work but it does have issues with how it presents the job to its' employees. Staples Corporate seems to want a relaxed sales experience where associates recommend additional services to every customer, based on what the customer came to the store for. On the other hand, Staples Retail is a different story, where General Managers are fiercely competitive with each other and said competitiveness trickles down to the sales floor and associates are often hounded into selling warranties and additional services at the threat of losing their hours by their sales managers."
good,good starting job the only thing that killed me was that i was uncomfortable being a sales person that is just not me as a person could be good for others
good,"Company is a great place to start out as a first job. Advancement through the company can be an added bonus, but you usually have to fall into a good situation where they promote due to someone leaving the company or moving up themselves. You can only climb the ladder so far despite years of service."
good,The job was fine. I had to have accommodations dues to the standing and bending. The best part was the flexible hours. I had an excellent boss who left right before I did. I enjoyed the team comradry.
good,Have good managers and okay pay for part time as well as good service they are pretty understanding if you need to take some time off or got other things to do
good,"I enjoy working at Staples.   Coworkers are friendly, as well as customers.  Days are usually fast paced and the work day goes by really quick.  Learned a lot about soft war and designs thanks to cpc."
good,The job is a fast paced environment with many goals that you have to meet each and every week. Can be very challenging at times to meet said goals.You also get to deal with the public on a daily basis which can be very challenging.
good,The best part of my job was launch and finishing the day and also helping customers out it was also making new friends at the job because if I didn’t know anything the would help me out
good,"The Company was very demanding, but the people there were professional and easy to work with,  Deadlines always had to be met with no excuses. The diversity at Staples was high."
good,"typically pretty busy on the average day. The people were great, however the management changes quiet a bit and some can be really lazy and no helpful to the store. Overall, the best place I have worked so far"
good,Staples was a great job for me as I was transitioning from high school to college. I had a great experience at this particular location. I was set to transfer to another location that was in the city my college was in but that particular location was not as friendly as my previous experience.
good,"It is a good place to work. A place where you can increase your knowledge of computers, printers and all the technical equipments required in an office or home. Great working environment."
good,"Greeting customer I learned how to  check and mark down overhead products, stock and inventory procedures help customers this is no hard part to this job if you love people and know how to carry yourself in a professional way  I enjoy meeting new people"
good,"working at Staples gives you lots of opportunities to meet all kinds of people from the public from all walks of life. Each looking for something different. Might be a business looking for desk, chairs or office supplies. Or a family looking for a new laptop. Or someone looking the ink for their printer. Each customer interaction is a unique experience."
good,"Great community of coworkers, the store environment was friendly, and it was easy to get to since the location was so central. I worked In the isles department stocking and front facing the shelves as well as assisting customers and filling in for cashiers."
good,"This is a great job to have while pursuing other ventures. It is low maintenance and pretty straight forward. The hardest part of the job is being pushed by management to hover over customers, but otherwise a pretty simple job. There is not much room for growth unless you seek to become a store manager."
good,"Staples in North Kingstown is definitely not the highest ranked Staples store in the state of Rhode Island and for that management tends to push us to make more sales so that our store doesn't get shut down. But other than that, working in the print and marketing department isn't a bad gig. More often than not, people just ask you to make copies because they're too lazy to do it themselves or they seriously have no idea how to do it themselves. But there are plenty of projects for local businesses throughout the week to keep it interesting. "
good,"I got a job at Staples while still in high school. It gave me a great first experience in customer service, printing, and dealing with customers. It was a great first job."
good,"Staples as an employer are simple in giving you the role that you have to fulfil and you clock in, fulfil that role and go home."
good,I learned a lot working with this company. I moved up really fast into a supervisor role within 7 months. However the particular store location was mainly about sales and many times forgot about the employees
good,"A typical day at Staples includes selling a few printers and shredders,restocking shelves, and cashing out customers. I learned how to remove viruses from computers and repair broken phones. Management at the time that I was employed was positively influential. The hardest part of the job was doing inventory. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting free food"
good,"I have enjoyed my career at Staples over the last 12 years.   I was one of the first to be hired at the Orlando Corporate office in 2006.  The company has evolved through the years, but things have changed since they went private.  As a Business Development Manager, I work as a liaison to the many offices I work with.  Amazon has made it more of a challenge to earn the customer's business.  The compensation was very good until recently.  I feel I have learned a lot over the years that will help me in my next career."
good,"At staples I got paid weekly at minimum wage which was great. Learned alot about things such as printers, computers and ink. I also was able to cross train in multiple departments and learned certain jargon from each department. Managerment was amazing and helpful, they knew how to communicate with their staff and customers which made things run smoothly."
good,I worked there as a part-time when I started college. Great place. Management was very flexible with my class schedule. Not many hours to work with but enough for part-time
good,It has became less fun more stressful to work there due to a rigorous selling culture leader are trying to implemented. Beside that it is a decent place to work
good,it is a Good job but it depends on if you have a good manager and if you have a good crew working with you. Its retail plain and simple try and have fun with it.
good,"North American Delivery was operationally focused on the end result of customer satisfaction. I was able to make the decisions needed to achieve that end goal."
good,"A typical day could fast paced of very slow, either given tasks to do what a tech is suppose to do or either helping customers. I learned how to managed inventory fix phones. General manager is cool to work with, but the other side of management worries too much about sales quota, which puts stress on staff and doesn't make for a good work place environment. Coworkers are friendly are good to work with. The hardest part of my job would be meet my daily sales expectations, and most of the time we don't meet them, management needs to understand we can't meet them each day especially when we're multitasking with maybe 2-3 assignments to do(inventory, change price tags, etc) and also helping customers all at once."
good,An excellent opportunity.  successfully gained multiple years of experience which allowed me to provide for my family. Met and collaborated with many excellent leaders.
good,"Generally fun to work at Staples, sometime the sales targets are unrealistic and change the dynamics of the work at both associates and management levels."
good,"Greeting customers, responding to questions, improving engagement with merchandise and providing outstanding customer service. Operating cash registers, managing financial transactions, and balancing drawers. ... Cross-selling products to increase purchase amounts"
good,"Good people"
good,Great place to get your feet wet and learn retail. Great place to learn to multi-task. Short staffed constantly but that's normal in retail now. District managers are very demanding.
good,"I learned how to work effectively and smarter, the hardest part was remembering how to work the software. Management are very understanding with everyone personal life. Some days it could be stressful because of how busy it could get at times."
good,During my time at Staples I assembled office chairs and stocked the shelves. I found the management at Staples quite knowledgeable and helpful. I enjoyed my time working a Staples.
good,"70% of the work at Staples is typical retail work, but members of the tech department and copy center spend the other 30% of the time doing work for their respective departments. From a tech's perspective, not enough time was given to work on customers' computers, either at the bench with the customer or in the back alone. Emphasis is put on computer sales and a laundry list of metrics with unrealistic goals and no commission or real motivation to sell aside from negative reinforcement. Company is more likely to go with an outside hire than an internal promotion, few opportunities to advance to management as an associate. Good managers and not a bad place to work overall."
good,Fast paced environment. Needed to know lot's of product information. Had to keep ahead of new technology and upcoming systems. Had to know were product was located within store. Everyone was cross trained in the copy and print center.
good,Working at Staples in the Easy Tech Department is not a hard job in the slightest. The main thing that you will need to be doing is pushing certain products and services that your managers will tell you about. If you have really good coworkers its not a bad job at all.
good,"Staples - For the longest, the #1 Office Supplier. Fast pace, Competitive business with lots of learning opportunities. Staples is truly a career that can consume your life."
good,"I enjoyed working at Staples very much. The management there made it easy to be motivated to do my best. However, working in the Copy & Print Center was stressful at times, when there was a rush or multiple online orders being juggled at one time. Still, I tended to enjoy the stressful environment because I like a challenge."
good,"Worked with the company for two years, management was rough at times but overall acceptable and mostly friendly. I learned a lot of written and verbal communication skills through constant interaction with customers. Co-workers were great to work with. The company did have unreasonable goals when it came to sales and not reaching these goals caused constant issues between the higher-ups and my managers, which then trickled their frustrations down to the my co-workers and I. Overall I would say the company was great to work for and would recommend it to others. I left when my location closed and I was relocated to a store where management was unorganized and talked down to my co-workers in ways I can only imagine are illegal."
good,It is a corporation. All stores are seen as the same. You have the same metrics as every other store even though demographics differ from state to state and region to region.
good,"I like the fact its not to fast-paced and the environment is somewhat relaxed, but thing I don't like is that part-time employees get part-time hours (of course). You can't really make a living with this job so you would have to find something that would advance your career whether its going to school or taking a few classes."
good,"Easy starter job, decent pay, close locations. High turnover and micro management by your dm.  I would recommend staples and think it was a decent job. I was able to move up quickly."
good,"After the recent change to a private company and all the resulting management changes, my value to the company was no longer appreciated.  Prior to that, It was a great company to work for, and I both learned and contributed a lot to improve software development in the IT organization."
good,"Overall good place to work. Quick pace but good job to have. The ware was 3rd shift but I had an awesome crew which made the job great. The delivery side just like any other job, you had your good days and bad days but more good then bad."
good,great working environment if you have good management which was the big issue.  The company does not hold their employees in high regard.  Some District managers where not good with talking to employees with respect.
good,"A typical day would consist of helping users with computer issues along with helping customers find exactly what they need. If their PC, laptop or printer was not worth the time and money to fix we would find the right system that would fit their personal needs."
good,It was really a pleasure working at Staples.  The people are incredibly dedicated and smart and the opportunities to try new things and advance your career are there if you actively seek it out.
good,"I primarily worked as the cashier and greeted customers when they entered the store. The most important thing to remember when interfacing with customers is that every person is different and has their own set of preferences. People want to feel welcome, and they want to feel special."
good,Really enjoyed my role here as a sales team leader. Great team to work with and had lots of happy sales and customers here. very understanding with flexible working allowances.
good,"I really enjoy working for Staples, but when you have a bad General manager, it really ruins everything. My store was one of the best in the area, and then we got a new General Manager, who was the polar opposite of the really good General Manager we had before that. She terrorizes staff, threatens them, and makes their lives miserable for no reason. "
good,"Everyone worked cohesively as a team which was good to experience. Sales is very performance based, although you may be extremely knowledgeable if you cannot sell an items you are not as useful."
good,"I love working at Staples Business Advantage in the Facility Solutions department because the management is very understanding and they seem to truly care about their employees. However after a year here the entire company switched from private to public taking away merit/cost of living raises, company functions, tuition reimbursement, and their 2 million and change non-profit grant program. These were the reasons I joined the company so with these things now being unavailable I believe it is time to start looking for a new career."
good,"Staples is a good place to work with great people. Other than becoming cross trained in other departments there is not room for advancement. Annual raises are very low. Technology is the most frustrating part of the day as the registers crash continuously throughout the day, and help tickets take days before gaining a response. "
good,its an okay job. some managers were really chill and laid back which i love. some acted like they dont care about what you do. place was chill. sometimes theres nothing to do except help customers. everyone works together and gets the job done. it was slow paced. staples usually in general is a slow store until its back to school time.
good,has a neat clean appearance & advertisement & persona for the company that Keeps both the Employee & the customer in a state of good Morale which will boost company sale
good,"I was learning how to work in retail. Had some great days at Staples."
good,It was a good company. The team I worked with is what kept me there. Overall a good experience. Manager was understanding and flexible. I miss my old coworkers.
good,Manage growing book of business. Goal is to sell premium plan to customers that have matured sales with Staples. Autonomy in the day to day work. I learned that the office supply business is really cutthroat and based on price instead of valuable solutions. The most challenging part of the position is to take a failing book to a positive position. You can have fun with this position and meet lots of new exciting people.
good,Usually  a good day start round 12 my shift cool environment cool co workers young and old music playing diiffernt cultures cool break room free snacks available sometimes
good,"I loved my job, but the fellow employees were rude. I did pretty much all of the cleaning work since I was one of the three girls who worked there. The managers were amazing, and when there were no customers we would talk and play around. The customers were always rude and grumpy."
good,Good Company To Work For. No advancement unless you want to go into managment. Good benefits for full time employees. Quarterly Bonus' if you make team goals.
good,It was a good job with steady hours and good benefits. It was also very cool to see the little KIVA bots running around and not alot of heavy lifting was required.
good,"really enjoyed the atmosphere in working there, the co workers are amazing, its a very welcoming environment which I enjoyed. They allow you to move up, but the pay raise isn't that big, which sucks"
good,"A stressful work environment however, fairly compensated.   Management was great until recently when the company became private company with a completely different vision and mission."
good,"Ensure that all customer deliveries are collected, loaded and go out on time. Work in the receiving and shipping department, picking, packing, and scanning orders using a palletizer and also doing inventory."
good,started out counting out the draw to make sure the money was all there. learn the sales for the week. working with staples i learned patience. the hardest part of the job was when i cant give a customer a discount cause the sale is over or coupon is out dated. The mot enjoyable part of the job was the customers.
good,The management ensure that customer service is the most important area of focus with all goals being at a close second. Employees are expected to meet high reaching goals under supervision of fellow employees as well as managerial staff.
good,"Overload with work upon entering, need to be one your feet for more than 4 hours a day, be able to communicate and relate to customers. Understand how to help customers benefits a returning customer every time. Leadership is needed when pressure and overload come in and no one is there to help."
good,Things are constantly changing at Staples and in the last year that has been increasing with the Company being acquired by Sycamore -- there is more uncertainty in many areas.
good,"Outside sales working with client base that entails Buffalo, and Rochester NY......Erie PA......."
good,"it a good work environment"
good,"Small store, but sales team worked very well together. This was my first job in retail and I am very grateful that I was given the opportunity to learn a lot about customer service with this company."
good,"Online purchasing has increased causing a lot of stores to close and jobs to be cut. The work environment itself was great and I had a great manager, but it wasn't secure work."
good,Really enjoyed the experience of doing new. Things and meeting new people. The part I didn't like entering those rewards in yhe computer. But enjoyed my work place
good,"Office Supplies is a competitive business. Staples remains focused on staying competitive and winning and growing new business over their competitors. It's a fast paced company, changes are made and employees are expected to adapt quickly and continue to contribute to the success of the company."
good,Collaborative fast paced environment. The layout of the store was easy to remember. The quality of customers were easygoing. There was a lot of opportunity for hours.
good,"Working at staples was very typical for a office retail setting. I was in charge of technology sales, services and diagnostic repair. This would involve me talking to customers and help them purchase the best item, for their technical needs, as well as servicing their computers,tablets or electronics even when there was a problem or issue with their technologies, I would diagnose them to see what the problem was and analyzing what the best solution was to repair them. The work place culture was pretty healthy, there was a lot of teamwork and most of my coworkers and managers provided a good experience when it came to working together to best help the customers. The hardest part of the job, is during big sales when the store gets an influx of customers at one time, but that is also the most enjoyable part of the job as well, because it leaves me and the rest of my coworkers a challenge that lets us work together to solve and overcome."
good,Bonne compagnie qui se concentre sur ses employés afin de maximiser l'expérience client.
good,"Most retail jobs are rather intense, whether it is because of facing many customers or because of stocking  large products on shelves or because of the lack of breaks. Work at Staples was less stressful. It is still a quick environment, but there are fewer customers at a single time on average than most other retailers or super markets. The management team is helpful and flexible generally speaking."
good,"My store management was the only reason I stayed as long as  did. The upper level management has no clue what it was like in the real world, they always expected 40+ hour a week work when they only allowed you to have 25-30 hours."
good,"I learned a lot about myself and my work ethic while working at Staples. We were expected to do the retail thing. But i worked in the copy and print center, and it was phenomenal. I loved being a part of that team and enjoyed what i did. I didn't like how little I was paid; minimum wage. And the hours were typical retail. But I made lifelong friends there and would definitely consider going back."
good,"Wasn't really busy. it was a big store with plenty of sale representatives. I learnt how to create signs for products, read sku's, and climb ladders. The manager was very laidback but still serious about her job. The hardest part was matching sku numbers. Most enjoyable for me was stocking."
good,"J'ai adoré l'équipe "
good,Dealing with customers one on one at all times during my shift taught me a lot about customer service. The hardest part of the job is managing time and being able to produce things perfectly under a stressed time limit.
good,"Very fast paced, cut throat and competitive , managed all employees sales and operations, workplace culture is amazing but stressful most enjoyable was developing associates"
good,It a good starting point for anybody looking to gain work experience and all in all it not a horrible job it just the low pay and the lack of advancement keeps you from wanting to stay with the company.
good,"Good place for work,learn how to use computer,printers,copy and fax machines.good management, the good  part it's assist customers, get the job done ."
good,"Staples is a great company with a culture that encourages hard work and a solid work/life balance.  In my experience, management truly cares about its people and wants all to thrive."
good,Staples was a decent place to work with respectable management and good policies. A typical day at Staples involved helping customers fix their tech devices and assisting customers with finding whatever products they needed for school or work.
good,"I truly loved everything about working at Staples, apart from the compensation.  The hours were very reasonable and all management was completely delightful. I made several long term relationships while there.  All of which I hold with terrific value."
good,"Part time only, no benfits, 30 minute commute. I would prefer 1 full time position closer to home with salary. Working 2 part time jobs an hour apart now."
good,The work to do helps pass the time and manageable. Like any other job you get out what you put in to it. Your manager can be good or bad to work for from a leadership standpoint.
good,"I was a contractor and was paid hourly.  Given the high turnover and the potential merger taking place, there was a lot of uncertainty and shifting in upper management."
good,"kept busy, pulling orders all day, fast paced environment, secure job, gave employees thanksgiving dinner, Christmas lunch, halloween parties and some employees dressed up in costumes"
good,I worked here during my high school years and I the job was adequate. Put gas in my tank and gave me spending money. I couldn't ask for much more as a high school student.
good,"Its a great place to work because of the people. The company over all changes like the weather with little direction. Changes in management are constant and happen every year. I had 4 different managers during my time there and I liked them all. Wished one of them would have stayed on for more then 6 months. "
good,Staples is a fun place to work at times.  I like the flexible hours and every step of the way my higher ups have supported me with any career path I wanted to take.
good,I started out at as a part time associate worked there for six years and became a full time key holder customer service lead I would probably still be there if the company hadn't eliminated my job title chain wide.
good,Completed daily sales goals and expectations each morning.  Received product when necessary.  Also completed Employee Evaluations.  We had a daily inventory cycle count that had to be completed.
good,Staples is a great company to work for. The compensation for a BDM is amazing. Wkly pay and good benefits. Relaxed environment and a casual dress code.
good,Great job for management work/life balance. Every day you meet someone new and/or new business. I enjoyed helping customers find solutions to their potential problems.  I always love that we can order a customer just about anything on our website.
good,"This is a good job to have during back to school hours , you get to gain a huge amount of customer service and also how to build patience. You learn ."
good,"All the associates that you work with here at Staples are great. Personality and everything is great at the workplace. The management needs some help at times. And sometimes there isn't enough employees working especially for tech. They need more people working at once, but then again they have limited hours to work with."
good,"The STAPLES Store Extension in Yorktown Heights seems to be a fine resort for your Office or, School Supply needs. My typical Day of work at STAPLES would be to assist those who are in need of finding anything and to save Product Sales by replacing expired price tags with valid ones. What I have learned by working presently as a Sales Associate is, that it is good to assist those who are in need and to do it to your best advantage. The Management in the Yorktown Heights Extension is good, (in some ways). The Workplace Culture, (to me), can seem a bit ""much"" at times...The most difficult part of the Job is, to please. almost. every. Customer...As well as the most enjoyable part of the Job is, either replacing tags or, be on my Lunch Break. Heh."
good,"I learned a lot working for Staples. The company culture makes you work harder and allows you to learn more than you expect. I have learned how to balance work and life there, and how to make work more fun"
good,"Staples was a great place to start in the real world. Typical day included basic retail needs, facing and stocking, assisting with customers needs and planograms in the store."
good,"Usually working on the floor stocking. Occasionally working registers."
good,"I had a great team that I worked with there but it was hard not to see that the climate was very political. The merchants can either be very positive and involved in developing their product specialists or look out for themselves and tear down their employees. "
good,"I started at Staples at a part time cashier and I loved my job. "
good,"Unloading pallets and inventory"
good,"Ordinary retail job. Managers okay. Coworkers sometimes crazy. Nothing out of the ordinary. Back in 2016 corporate told everyone except managers that no one could get above twenty-five hours, or that General Manager of store would get the ax. All because the president wrote that anyone working thirty plus hours should be given  health insurance and the like. Instead Staples corporate did what any corporation would do, and cut its workers down even more. Bad enough fifty years ago you could work a forty hour job and provide for yourself on your own. Now the people who hire you expect you to do a forty hour workload in under twenty-five hours."
good,"I enjoyed working at Staples.  It was a very small group of us working yet we made it work.  We looked out for each other and made sure everything was in check.  Store is huge with only about 10 workers at a time.  Still, we got through it.  Very easy-going job."
good,"A typical day at work included multiple tasks that needed to be completed before a set and expected deadline. Working as a Copy Center Associate in the copy center department required full time engagement with customers. In addition to completing their copy center requests, the team and I had to file/organizing their orders efficiently. I learned how to use the other members on my team to my advantage i.e. asking for assistance from another associate when the customer lines get long. If ever on duty without a fellow copy center associate, a manager on duty was available to help. Customers were typically greeted at the entrance of the store and assisted throughout the aisles. The hardest part of this job was creating an appropriate deadline according to the other orders that were already lining up. Despite this, the variety of jobs and level of responsibilty was by far my favorite parts of the job."
good,Every thing was fine. Some SYEP colleagues were inefficient. The managers were nice and helpful. I learnt how to treat customers in a professional manner and how the back end of the store works.
good,"Enjoyed my experience with Staples until the management decided to outsource our delivery jobs and close the Wisconsin warehouses. I cannot speak for what Staples is like now, but I enjoyed my job as a delivery driver when employed there,"
good,"Very busy day at work.   Cross functional campaign development, in heavily-matrixed organziation.  Everyone knows everyone and is very supportive. Organized people will find career growth."
good,"Work is typical, management is nice, the ups is the staff that are there. The downs are you still going to work at Staples. There are advancements to move up the ladder even if you have been there a little more then a year."
good,It was a decent place to work while I was in college.  The managers were good and the work was fairly benign.  There wasn't much room for advancement unfortunately.
good,"- Learned how to deal with customers "
good,Sometimes managers do not allow reasonable time to ramp up and learn the job.  Expectation is to be the expert coming into the job. Most folks start and end the day at normal business hours but some come in very late and leave early.  Some tend to emails in the evenings.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is that I am surrounded by great employees. Everyone is nice and friendly. The managers are easy to talk to in every circumstance. I learned how to give exceptional customer service under any kind of situation. I have experience working in a fast pace environment, which is during back to school time and the holiday's at Staples, helping customers with what they are looking for, and made sure they are completely satisfied with their in store experience. I have also learned how to train and supervise new employees."
good,"It's a good part-time job but I wouldn't make it a career. The people at the store I work at are very friendly and welcoming. The employees are always open to new faces but since you're only making minimum wage, I would suggest to find another job if you're looking for somewhere to pay more money"
good,"I really loved working at Staples. I did my high school co-cop placement there and so did my friend. It was really good! The people are really nice, and the management at the time gave us free supplies because she liked us so much."
good,Working in the Copy and Print department at STAPLES is fast-paced. I most enjoy providing outstanding service and products to the customer and seeing that I have met their needs.
good,"Morning Sales meeting with the Sales Manager and the entire Copy Center Team to make certain that all of my account jobs were on schedule. Also discuss all upcoming opportunities. "
good,While working at Staples my sales policy was changed in order to compete with other stores in the area. Due to this my sale dropped and therefore made it harder to do my job.
good,"Working at Staples was easy work, even on the bussiest of days. My coworkers were good people but often were not very capable of performing tasks independently. The best part, however, was learning about how a store is set up, and how the placement of each product matters."
good,Staff is nice and helpful. Only bad thing was working copy center with rude customers. Management is pretty cool too. Long nights in the summer though.
good,"Staples was a great place to work. I worked in their copy and print center and absolutely loved my job. I enjoyed the constant flow of customers, which allowed me to really challenge myself at time management, multi-tasking and patience. Management was great. Although, I thought maybe they could be a little more professional at times, they really had a good work-ethic, cared about their customers and really tried to motivate the team to be more efficient and productive. The hardest part of the job was maintaining the patience needed to interact with customers, some of whom were more ""demanding"" than others. The most enjoyable part of the job was when, after working hard to get an order/project right for the customer, they came in to pick it up and, showing them your end result, they would smile and be so happy with your work. Keep in mind some orders consisted of wedding invitations and signs, business cards which they would be handing out to prospects and people all over the city, etc. When you do a good job and the customer is beyond satisfied, that is the reward I was most satisfied with."
good,"Enjoyed working with the customers, management was on top of things, other employees enjoyed working with each other on a daily basis and at times would do get together after the day was done to boost moral."
good,"had fun at staples happy to talk to customers but had to leave when I started school, people were fun and always had a story to tell"
good,In actual fact I worked for Office World which was sold to Staples so I didn't have job security because Office World bought around 60 stores very quickly and there were a lot of management changes. However I enjoyed the work and enjoyed working as part of a team and had the opportunity of going to new store openings even though I worked in Head Office.
good,Staples was a nice place to work.  They had a nice bonus program at the time.  Even part-time associates could bonus if the store made its goals.
good,I have spent ELEVEN years with this company all in sales and customer service but feel it is time to move forward with a company with a retirement package
good,"We have moved the company from print to the Digital age."
good,The Staples supply chain infrastructure is one of a kind. Will the future be WMOS or OOO? What direction should Staples go with its delivery operations? More or less 3rd party carriers?
good,"I loved the workplace"
good,"Steady work, and decent hours. The employees were a pleasure to work with. I worked in every department from receiving to copy and print, all but management. Everyday was something new going on, so there was always work to do."
good,Staples is evolving as a company and can be a great place to work.  It really depends on the management team.  On my team we have fun and sold a lot!  Stay focus but do your best!  That's the key
good,"Though hard in the beggining, it gets easier and eventually becomes fun. The people are nice and the work is tedious but can be fun if you make it fun."
good,I liked working there it was laid back and I learned a lot. I learned how to do many positions while there as well as met customers.
good,"Staples is under transformation. It's a great company to work for if you're in a good team."
good,Good company to work for; lots of new ideas and experiences for employees. Management takes care of their employees. Lots of fun and you work with good people.
good,"Finishing any task from last shift, stocking merchandise, providing customer service in person, online and via phone. Providing information to customers with a given merchandise or question. checking costumers out at register install furniture for orders or displays. I've Learned to manage  my time for every task given to me and evaluate what were priorities. Making merchandise look neat and presentable. Management is good, communication was strong. Team was helpful and fun to work with every shift. Hardest part of the job was lifting up heavy boxes and searching for items when they are not where they are suppose to be. Most enjoyable part of the job is the co workers, they make they day better and supports you."
good,The company has great people working for them who put their hearts & souls into their jobs. I made friendships that will last the rest of my life.
good,Une belle place pour débuter dans le milieu professionnel.
good,"Working at Staples, We always had fun helping our customers find anything from pens & pencil to special order items. I enjoyed helping customer in our copying center where we helped design anything from business cards to books and personal calendar."
good,Staples was a great place to work but they didn't know print well. We were sold as the result. Good benefits - excellent vacation but worked for Staples Print Solutions & they sold us to Taylor.
good,"A typical day at work was to grab my paperwork before I started my route. Go out to my truck and do a vehicle inspection. Deliver all product in my truck, and unload my truck at the end of my day. The most enjoyable part of my job was delivering to customers. I also enjoy being outside all day and being my own boss."
good,"Nice environment  to work, and happy to work there. Good benefits , start working  only a part time scale to become full time and head of the copy center department."
good,"Throughout my almost 5 years with Staples I was very fortunate to work for many teams within the company. From Operations, Inventory, International Logistics and Strategy.  How much I enjoyed coming to work varied from the team I was on and my manager. I worked for managers who were extremely supportive in your personal development and pushed you and then I worked for those who were disorganized and micro managed.  Management greatly influenced my job satisfaction."
good,"A typical busy day at Staples is dealing with multiple customers at one time and closing sales within a five minute period. You also had markups where you would sale protection plans and accessories that go with the different products. At closing you would clean the store and lockup. If you were stocking you would have to be there at 5:30 am. The staff was great. However,  the management would accuse me of trying to get them fired. the enjoyable part of the job was closing deals."
good,"Good company with some upside. The management is very helpful when needed but the operations is still a work in progress. Most of my day is consumed of just project managing. Ensuring that my projects are being done and it takes away from me trying to do other things. In turn, this requires me to work longer hours than I would like"
good,"A good place to work but there was often too many managers on duty for the overall number of people working"
good,I love working at Staples. The atmosphere was great and I cross trained in all the departments. The pay was low but the people were great to work with. The only reason I left was because I moved.
good,The company offers exelent opportunities to grow. The managers are always willing to help if your having a hard time adjusting to store tasks.
good,"Altogether, I worked for Staples for about 2 years and it was a blast. The store I worked at had a cool team and everyday was just another day. "
good,"As management your shifts are 9 hours a day with 2 15min and 1 1/2 hour break, There are 3 shifts per day open, mid and close. Each store deals differently with days off i.e. 2 days off together, weekends off or 2 separate days off. It is great place to work, with good benefits.  The staff was great. The hardest part of the job for me was finding the time to learn everything. The best part of the job was helping the customers."
good,"Always was productive with doing something. Either helping a customer, or making copies for the customers. Very good environment."
good,"A very good company to learn processes and to develop own self professionally."
good,Loved staples. the staff was great and helpful. But they never had enough hours to give out. They did give good benefits and respected the employee.
good,"Working at Staples can be somewhat of a bad experience on certain days and very exciting other days.  Working in Easy Tech I deal with a lot of customers interested in new computers and customers trying to fix their computers as well.  Although the tech supervisor worked on most of the machines, I have learned a lot from him as he is very knowledgeable in IT.  Most of my time repairing devices comes with cell phone repair, mainly the screens and charging ports.  Management, on the other hand seems to be hot or miss.  One of the managers seems to pick personal favorites in employees and hold them to lower standards than other employees, however the other managers do hold everyone to a similar standard of excellence.    The biggest pro of working here is most managers want to help employees grow and perform better.  This has led me to adopt new techniques while with customers and while working on electronics as well.  My biggest complaint of working here is how understaffed my location is.  It seems as though a manager and myself, or another employee is always on the register as a line backups for one cashier.  My coworkers also seem somewhat hit and miss on their dependability as well as their attitude.  Many times a cashier will call out and I will have to fill in their position for the day.  Other times employees will shrug off suggestions for better work performance     ( whether from a manager or other employee).  The hardest part of the job, for me is lifting heavy furniture and electronics due to my back acting up.  The most enjoyable part of my job is when I see people"
good,"A typical day consist of selling computers or another type of technology and fixing computers. Through it I have learned different aspects of the hardware and software of computers and what I should do to fix the problems and have learned how to setup a basic home network. My co-workers and bosses are all really likable people, of course there are a few that I don't always get along with. The hardest part would be dealing with angry customers and sometimes work can be very tedious, but I really enjoy talking to the customers and working on computers."
good,"I loved my 10 years with the company, the people and culture and second to none. We were given full autonomy to implement the corporate and departmental goals."
good,The pay is competitive to the jobs performed. I've received vast knowledge about the Print industry. Upper management could use training for what their subordinates are working on. There seems to be managers who have no clue what their employees are working on or how to do their job. I love my co-workers and feel supported by them. The hardest part of my job can be understanding what the customer is actually expecting but I've learned which questions to ask to satisfy their requests.
good,Great work environment with friendly people. management was very encouraging and helpful. I never had a bad day at this job.
good,"Staples is a very good place to work for. You must have a flexible schedule and be able to work all shifts including evenings and weekends."
good,"company leading the industry"
good,"Little to no advance opportunities.  Not suitable with my education and experience.  Good job to start my IT career.  Retail is not my specialty; therefore, I seek employment other than retail to further enhance my knowledge and experience.  Hardest part of job is making the sale and especially selling the services that Staples offers.  The most enjoyable part of the job is troubleshooting, diagnosing, and repairing personal computers.  This part of the job is often not a priority and management minimizes the requirement to get services completed within a reasonable time as defined by customers.  In other words, management question why services are not completed on time; however, tasks assigned by management typically do not include service completion.  Priority of tasks are not beneficial to the customers.  Most, if not all, of my co-workers are not college graduates and do not have extensive knowledge about technology.  As a result, I am often responsible for training these co-workers which reduces productivity.  I am equal to them in every category (pay, benefits, supervisory) except working hours, knowledge, and experience.  The last two, I exceed the expectations of Staples and my co-workers.  Honestly, I have not learned anything while working at Staples; however, I have taught a lot.  There seems to be no concern with work attendance.  I have been called in to work for a no show multiple times since I began working at Staples in September 2015.  No consequences for absences or tardiness."
good,I learned how to work individually as well as in a team. Also how one persons attendance can effect the flow of work and cause delay.
good,Accommodating and reasonable. great communication and job culture. Cross training and management programs make it possible to advance and receive recognition for it.
good,Was able to learn a lot about the retail industry.  The opportunity is there if you want to learn about other divisions; was given the opportunity to travel on occasions.  Feedback was valued by management.
good,"-typical day at work is busy, but once you get the swing of things you can manage."
good,"Great place to work and great people to work with."
good,Only worked there for a few months but it helps being creative and helpful to the costumers and being an asset to the Staples team.
good,Good company. I loved my customer more than the job itself. it was a good environment to work. I had a good manager and a good support team.
good,"Starting at Staples will prepare you for any career. The hardest part of your day is deciding what to do first!"
good,"This was another great experience!  I went to interviewed with Staples and was basically hired on the spot!  The interview took place on a Tuesday, the next morning I was driving back to New Jersey and received a call saying ""are you ready to move"".  I did not know anyone in Framingham.  I looked for an apartment online.  When I got there, the apartment was a luxury apartment.  It included parking, gym, central heating and air conditioning and  it was approximately 1 mile from my place of work.  I was given a 3000 accounts portfolio and was told that it had not been worked for over 3 months.  Long story short... by December I had already made customer's relationships! Customers were calling me to let me know they had payments ready for me.  Accounts with credit balances were investigated for over payments, duplicate payments, etc and if refunds were due, those were processed.  Accounts in litigation were brought up to date. Accounts with small balances either positive or negatives were taking care. At the end of January the entire portfolio was up to date with my top 20, top 50 accounts established. Reviewed accounts credit history to established financial stability and to find out if the credit line remained or needed to be changed.  I left Staples because I had a family matter that required my presence.  This was challenging because of the portfolio volume and he lenght of time it had not been worked.  I stayed focus, put in extra hours to achieved what was required and to (in some way) prove to myself that I can do it.  The company made staying extra hours easier by having"
good,The job wasn't the worst job. The people that you work with are great but if you are looking to grow in a short amount of time do not hold your breath.
good,Management is great to work with and very willing to accommodate in the event of scheduling conflict or family emergency. Work was fairly easy. Not much to speak of in the way of benefits for anyone who isn't full-time.
good,on the ground level its a great place but the decision handed down from corporate are illogical. its a great crew and in-store management is some of the best even with the orders handed forced uopn them
good,"Overall Staples was a great place to work, the hardest part about being a manager at Staples was balancing your own job responsibilities with those of your subordinates. Upper management focuses on constant growth and accountability throughout the team."
good,The company was shifting many of its departmental structures so long term position wasn't available. Other than that it was a very accommodating place to work.
good,"Staples is a great place to work. the atmosphere is wonderful, coworkers are helpful. The only real problem with Staples is that they will not allow over 25 hours a week, so they do not have to pay for benefits."
good,"While working at staples it was nice. Especially some of my very interesting co workers, the only issue i ever had was the fact that some times the store was slow and had no customers and im more of a moving productive person who like to be able to get some type of job done while doing multiple tasks. There was also a few other things the manager the was what she called her self in her own words a ""brat"". Respected her authority but did not like er personality all that much but other than those few things the job was fantastic."
good,"Great place to work to keep up with the latest technologies. Developed and promoted several associates through the years. Very supportive manager. Most enjoyable part of my job was helping my employees grow, develop, and get promoted to higher positions in the organization. Developing trust and close working relationships  with customers."
good,"Enjoyable work place. The company is changing and hourly employees and managers feel that at all levels. While I personally had an overall positive experience, many at lower volume stores are being asked to do more with less. The company values hard work and results. It is becoming more and more difficult to advance as the company consolidates its position. If you are looking for a second job or a steady way to supplement your part or full time income it is an excellent option. Great for students or younger people with an affinity or interest in technology and sales. You can learn a lot here if you are just getting started in the field. The company struggles to maintain the privacy and personal information of its employees however. Neither managers, IT or associates are particularly security conscious when it comes to PII."
good,"I actually loved my job there, sometimes it was hard to keep production up. My supervisor was great she would work with anybody about anything they needed help with.  If we were shorthanded she would help select product."
good,"Engage clientele with a friendly professional demeanor as they entered the store. As a lead in the service department, I ensured customer satisfaction while processing purchases and resolved customer concerns through returns and exchanges. Provided guidance, motivation, and assisted in training and development of new associates while ensuring that tasks were performed with high standards of quality."
good,Fast paced work. worked together with a team of 15 to palletize product and load trailers. I learned teamwork and how to multi-task. the hardest part of the job was loading the trailers to fit 30 pallets.
good,"The job is not the best paying, but it has you communication with customers, and having you learn the run down on how to provide excellent service to consumer by making variable purchases on electronics. Your also responsible for taking care of every inventory in the store and with making sure that any laptop or tablet that the customer brings in has a checkup and has any form of protection. Whether it be a virus protection or a protection warrantee, the job is not difficult. The managers are easy to talk to and willing to help you out whenever your in a pickle. The only difficulty is knowing the product that you are not familiar with so minor research on whatever device is needed. So in short, Staples as an Easy Tech Associate is a great job for those who want to work in a retail store."
good,"work was based upon customer satisfaction, orders shipped was thoroughly screened and the atmosphere was all with an team effort."
good,"At this job I became proficient in Adobe, PowerPoint, Excel, and Microsoft Offices. I used time management skills to complete orders in an efficient manor and had to practice customer service skills. This job was an excellent way to perfect multitasking techniques. Though this job was an ecellent place to start it has little room for advancement as well as limited hours."
good,"Coworkers are very helpful and laid back, we have a lot of fun at work but still get a lot done. Plenty of things to learn and room to grow in the company."
good,"Inventory, inventory, and more inventory. Copy Center seems the most professional department. Always fun assembling office chairs for customers upon order. Don't take more than 15 minutes assembling a chair!"
good,"1.Overall good work environment"
good,"Staples was a positive work environment with opportunity for advancement and growth. Normal day at Staples is monitoring and QA'S calls, running reports, taking escalated calls, keep up morale and building rapport with associate's. Co-workers a easy to get along with and helping. Most enjoyable part of my position was the interaction with other's."
good,Secure company with good training.  Limited movement for others.  Culture was great and the company provides the tools to succeed.
good,Overall it was a nice experience except whenever a CEO or another person in higher management arrived. They often nit pit and make small matters big and confusing.
good,"Staples Advantages is a good call center, with good schedules, well-organized management, and reasonable workloads.  However, as I recently graduate with a Bachelor's of Science, I am either trying to get into Management with Staples or find something more suited towards my skills."
good,"nice place to work good staff and management"
good,"I enjoyed working for Staples! they've showed me so much love there. I've learned so many things there and I've made so many friends, which I keep in contact till this day. Management was okay though. They've gave me so many opportunities."
good,"Staples was a great short term job to transition me moving back to the Capital District while i was searching for the next move in my life career path. "
good,"Very fun to work with other associate, fast paced, learning experience good for those who wnt to learn about easy tech or Copy and Print"
good,"I worked for Staples for a very short time, but while I was there I was treated well and they tried to push me up through the management there. Though I was not interested in doing so."
good,"Loved it."
good,"Well you start off unloading boxes on the pallets and then placing them on pallets for each route.Then after all the trucks are unloaded and loaded to the pallets you just start loading your assigned trucks. This job treats you how to manage time and be organized. Management is okay at times. Co-workers are really friendly and helpful at many times. The hardest part of this job is having to put up with less hours since it is a part time, but the best part of this job is the hard work you put in."
good,a typical day at work was dealing with a lot of different kind of personalitys and the different moods that people had...long lines especially during back to school
good,"A typical day at consist of me greeting customers, helping customer and cleaning work area. The managers are pretty decent they do consider the customer a lot."
good,"The hardest part of this job was trying to make a living off the low pay you get as an associate, other then that it was a great job."
good,"The management here is pretty good, but if you want a place where you can move up this isn't the job for you. The work atmosphere was pretty average, your boss always pushing you to the very edge of your mental well being to make the $8.99 sale that is so crucial to them that they will step all over you for the all mighty dollar. I learned quickly how to deal with customers that verbally accost you to the point of tears and how to make sure I had no social life so I was always available. Don't get me wrong I had great job security and I got some recognition for all the hard work I put in, but I definitely knew moving up wasn't an option."
good,"The daily tasks differ each day, but there is always something to keep you busy. Staples customers are also some of the friendly people ever. There are a lot of processes and guild lines for normal daily activity. If you have the willingness to learn like me, and am extremely patient, there is room for advancement within the company. The most physically demanding part if lifting the heavy boxes of paper. ew"
good,"Had a good experience with company. Learned alot from my immediate manager. Benefits were expensive, Not a bad work environment. Co workers were friendly and helpful ,The hardest part of the job was rotating shifts. I enjoyed learning from my manager. I worked my way up from starting as a route driver moving up to a supervisor position, I am thankful that I had the oportunity to grow and learn with the company. Unfortunately the company opted to move the transportation portion of the business to 3rd party carrier which ended my career with staples"
good,"Overall I found it to be a great stepping stone, I have received a lot of experience from staples. The company itself is very willing to work with scheduling to meet my families needs as well as working with my School schedule."
good,Co-workers are phenomenal. More work than the pay is worth. Great being able to work in an environment where you can count on your co-workers and they are very enjoyable.
good,When I started with Staples it was an excellent company to work for.   Through the years the focus seems to have changed from customer service to profit. Laid off after over 9 years.
good,I have been with the company for many years and witnessed many changes. I have seen many people come and go and have been fortunate to have been promoted several times. I have nothing bad to say about the organization.
good,"Wonderful company to work however very demanding schedule as a manager. Sales culture, customer service is good but depending on the store you work at it can be better. Overall a 15 year career has ended due to a decline in retail sales"
good,"I stand at the front door and try to greet all customers, when customers are ready for check out  I ring them out. My managers are great. I get along very well with all co-workers, None of my job is hard. I enjoy meeting and greeting customers."
good,"always something new in this fast paced enviroment, great co workers"
good,"Staples is a company that changes a lot. I was only with them a year and they went through two different corporate/management changes. other than that it is a good job while your in school. If you are looking to build a career, staples is only good for filling you desk supplies at another job."
good,"I  have learned to use high speed dialer system Learned to fax important documents Team Work Was A number one priority."
good,"When working at Staples, you learn a lot about the work environment. This includes working with a team and by yourself, working with management, working with customers, etc."
good,"The SDO is a fast pace warehouse where I work in variable weather conditions during third shift. I have the responsibility of sorting and loading six delivery trucks in my shift. I have learned to multi task and be a team player. I work alone and help others as well. management trusts and confines in me that I am able to get the job done. My co workers are fantastic, there is a good level of morale. well organized operation."
good,"Personalplanung, Warenversorgung in der Werbezeit so wie bei Engpässen bei bestimmten Warengruppen, Sicherstellen der Tagesabläufe, Aus- und Weiterbilden der Kollegen,Ordnung und Sauberkeit der Filiale so wie Waren fülle in den Regalen gewährleisten, Kundenservice, Warenannahme, Ware buchen."
good,No job is perfect but Staples certainly isnt the worst place to work.  They have a great products to sell but the pay is dismal.  One of the biggest problems is that there are way too many supervisors and we end up stepping on each others toes too often.
good,"There are many different positions within Staples. IF you do your job and you do it well you can advance but the pay is very low. If you are a manager you may be able to survive on the pay."
good,"I would go in at 7:30 ,clock in, then get a radio and start working at the cashier. I would check customers out and help them find any ink cartilage. I would not be able to leave cashier that was my main job there"
good,A fast paced place to work especially during the summer and back to school period.
good,"I've learned how to use printer to their ability, print documents to customers specifications and customer service."
good,"Assignment (Tags, Stocking)"
good,"Get delivery trucks out the door and start delivering product to customers. Run reports and safety audits for locations. Resolve any issues with sales and customer service involving customers. Give ETA's to customers in regards to when product will be arriving. "
good,"Flexible Hours"
good,"For someone who is a college student, this would be a pretty good place to work.  Employee discount came in handy for back to school shopping, and Staples also offers a scholarship.  The employer of the store I worked at was very lenient and flexible with scheduling.  I learned so much about different computers and various programs.  The hardest part of the job was selling certain products.  I sometimes had trouble talking to customers about selling due to my anxiety, but the managers helped me through it."
good,"I was in sales in the technology department of the store so I had to tell customers on how electronics worked, what would be good for their situation, etc. I enjoyed the job and the people I worked with but the customers were unruly from time to time. I also learned abilities in stocking and delivery as well as P.O.S system and register."
good,This is a company that it really depends on the mangement to make sure the store is doing well and if that is not there then it is not a great place to work.
good,At Staples the main concern was customer service. Everything else such as stocking and maintenance however very essential to company productions came second. I learned how to interact with different customers according their needs. my coworkers were all doing their job no one was a slacker. The hardest part of the job was closing the store Basically maintaining the store's prestigious look.The management team was great. all mangers were willing to listen and accommodate all issues you had. The whole job experience was an enjoyable one.
good,The managers are great and really care about their employees. Everyone is nice to each other and work well together. There is always a chance to move up.
good,"It's a fun job, you learn a lot from a lot of different people and the management was really fun and encouraging"
good,"I enjoyed working in the copy and print department. The only problem I had at times was there wouldn't be enough coverage, so at times the workload and customer traffic would get a little overwhelming. I enjoyed how happy the customers would be when they received their projects I had completed. Overall a good company to work for."
good,OK if you like retail but low pay unless you manage. Fun place to work.
good,"Staples is a fast paced working environment, most people don't even know Staples fixes computers. Working for Staples has been a blast! As soon as I start my day I am working on computers, taking them apart to diagnose hardware issues or working to fix software issues. The management there is excellent, as long as you are doing your job they do not micro manage you and leave you to your devices and always have a positive attitude on the day. The hardest part of the job is dealing with frustrated customers."
good,"A typical day at work : retail on your feet all day from taking care of customer , too restocking ----products "
good,"a typical day at work is basically satisfaying customers, i learned how to handle all type of customers,the managments were very helpful,co-workers are very nice they help each other,the most enjoyable part of the job was when i see customer happy thats when i get happy."
good,"Good Company to work for that gave me the opportunity to grow within the company, as well as, give me the freedom to make my own decisions. The hardest part was just never really having enough employees so having to pull the majority of the weight to make up for the lack of help. My favorite part but also the hardest part of my job was doing damage returns to vendors and to the warehouse because it was tedious but also pretty rewarding to see all the work you had done in front of you."
good,"Gained customer service skills and product knowledge."
good,Good pay and the health insurance is fantastic. Job advancement is very difficult tho.
good,"Working for Staples was great motivation for me while I attended college. The shoppers in the community genuinely care about the individuals that worked in the area. On a daily basis, I monitored the inventory of the store. It was my job to communicate with vendors concerning their products and file all paperwork related."
good,"Depending on who you work with and the position you have, it can be a good work life balance.  It is a retailer so they are open all day and the hours can vary.  There was a large opportunity for advancement and they promote from within the company often."
good,Every day at work I feel like a part of a team. Great Atmosphere
good,Did basic computer repair and waited on customers. I spent more time selling than working on computers.
good,"I enjoyed Staples, it was great learning about all the new computer tech information and getting paid to do so! Worked around my boys school schedule! Didn't pay well, and didn't give out any real bonus money."
good,"Unlike some other retail stores where you are limited to one small section to which you are responsible for, BEG allows their employees to roam most all the isles (however this also means you must me knowledgeable of all the products). "
good,"Promise a raise after 90 days of seasonal employment , don't get until mid summer."
good,"You have to work in a fast pace or else you are screwed. Coworkers are nice for the most part, some nice managers others are mean. You have to be able to sell stuff or it's not the job for you."
good,"learned communicaion skills and customer service skills, learned to be a quick and effiecient cashier as well as strengthening sales skills"
good,Management tries to look out for the really good workers. The corporate culture was changing when I left. Drivers were no longer allowed to plan their own routes as corporate wanted to have a better idea of fuel costs. Overall drivers would try to help each other as best they could on a daily basis. There is something of an us vs. them mentality between drivers and loaders but for the most part everyone works together. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with other drivers and if a customer has a bad day.
good,"I consider Staples my first job, as I started there when I was 20 and stayed there for about 10 1/2 years.  One of the things I liked most about working there is the support I received when I wanted to work on moving up in the company.  They are willing to help anyone grow if you have the ambition.  The hardest part of the job was the continuous array of programs they would come out with us for us to devote our time to, and the fact that they continued to make it harder and harder to just let us concentrate on our customers."
good,"I would find the right electronic device, like say a computer or camera, for every customer."
good,"As a leader within Staples. I enjoyed training, mentoring and encouraging many of my associates to focus on customer service and company goals and targets. Building relationships with staff and customers that will last a lifetime."
good,"We would unload two semi trucks full of product along with what our 2nd shift would pull for us, then Load anywhere from 4,000-6,200 packages between 10:30 pm and 8am.  My co-workers made the job fun and interesting. The managers didn't really seem to listen to our ideas on how to implement new policies that we felt would make our jobs faster and make their associates a little happier."
good,"The store I worked in was a great first job in the Retail Industry. Smaller than others, low amount of customers. Management and employees were easy to get a long with."
good,Great Company to work for in some cases. But they expected you to be perfect at your job with little to no help or practical training. Then expected everything while giving almost no hours to practice or little to no help when needed.
good,Room for advancement throughout the company. Great incentive programs for all associates. Upper management visits the stores frequently.  Planograms consistently changing.
good,"*  Helping customers enjoy their shopping experience everyday"
good,"Staples was a great job to work, the staff and management are amazing, made me want to grow with the company. like any job working in a field that deals in customer service has it up and downs but it how you deal with it determined your experiences."
good,"Daily store operations"
good,Good management and peers to work with. Learned a lot and definitely a good team environment.
good,"Being that this was a seasonal job, I had a lot of fun. I enjoyed helping customers find the right school supplies, and meeting new people. The management team was very nice, and most of the people were easy to get along with."
good,"Friendly co-workers, Supervisors and Managers. A good ""Team"" atmosphere."
good,"Working environment was friendly that everyone cold really get along with each other despite diversity in culture. Teamwork was always the key factor in achieving goals. The only thing that employees miss to have is the effort of the management to recognize everyone's contribution in making things out for the good of the company, at least to even appreciate everyone in a very simple way."
good,"I was a cashier and was the first person customers saw when they entered the store so I had to make sure to be friendly and informative. I had to guide customers to the correct isles so the items they were trying to locate were easily accessed. "
good,"Everyday is different but I spend a lot of my day coaching associates, driving sales, reviewing results, networking and building quality relationships with our business and personal shoppers.  I can go from selling the latest technology such computers and printers to landing large print jobs such as mail out flyers and administration forms for large companies such as local car dealers and mines.  I pride myself in building a marketing department within the Copy Centre that is full of print experts that have successfully grown our sales despite the store's downward trend.  The store is very high paced and everyone wears multiple 'hats' to keep things moving smoothly and strive for excellent customer service and satisfaction."
good,"company has good core values and is open to new ideas.priority"
good,Enjoyed my time for the first 4.5 years until the purchase of Corporate Express the overnight growth and over price investment became a burden to the organization in the midst of a global economic collapse.
good,It was a great place to work and co-workers and management are easy to get along with and helpful.
good,A typical day consists of lots of running around completing required paper work while maintaining customer satisfaction. I have learned time management is key in having a successful day and that learning your co works strengths and weakness will help you complete your work quicker and better. The hardest part of this job is the awful commute through downtown Toronto traffic. It’s not fun adding an extra 3 hours to your day in travel time. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people daily and constantly learning and doing new things.
good,The management was fun but inconsistent with holding all employees to the same standards. It was enjoyable to establish relationships and communicate with local business owners to assist them in creating a larger profit and success.
good,"Managers were nice and understanding."
good,"Good for a part time job, it is hard to work full time. No commission on sales, but benefits for full time employers are very good. "
good,"As a technology sales associate, I never have time to stop. Multitasking is pretty much required and up selling is basically the motto. "
good,"Fun place to work"
good,"It is a decent place to work, not alot of room for advancement but its a decent place."
good,"I would recommend this job to anyone seeking one. The hours are great, the benefits are good, and the incentives are okay. There is a lot of work to get done in a single day and it can be stressful but worth applying for."
good,"face paced, deal with a lot of people, follow corporate guidlines"
good,"I mostly worked morning shifts, traffic was slow until midday. I've learned how to work on multiple task in a timely manner and ressolve customers concerns with the best of my ability. Management team was very consistent, they made sure each customer was given outstanding customer service. My work environment was positive each person was very helpful with one another, maintained a positive attitude on a daily basis, and was well organized. The most difficult task was back to school season, traffic was very high and coverage was limited. Overall I've enjoyed working for this company it has thought me how to work under pressure, work with multipe customers, prioritize my responsibilities, professional phone etiquette, and most of all communicaion skills."
good,Diverse co-workers with very high work ethics and good sense of humor. Had a great team mentality!
good,"I currently moved from Lowell, MA to Columbus, Ohio and transferred Staple stores. I am the copy center Lead and I am in charge of 4 associates. I have learned how to deliver good quality projects to customers. I love when a customer leaves happy with their final project. I am still learning some of the printing features and Microsoft publisher as I am still new with the company in this department. I started as Customers Service lead and was moved over to the copy center after 12 months."
good,Help customers sell products stock shelves Okay job for those in search for employment
good,Great company to work for. Training was top notch for management. Companies most recent business model will not be able to be sustained in todays retail enviroment.
good,Overall I had a positive experience working for Staples. The office supply industry has really been hit hard by the economy and Staples is putting an significant amount of pressure on its sales teams.
good,"As a co op student I got handed the same responsibilities as a worker, like stocking shelves and working in the copy center. Management was good, everyone was very friendly! Hardest part of the job was inventory. But the most enjoyable part was the satisfaction of helping customers and having some work experience."
good,"Staples has been a great place to work for many years, and is a company in constant motion. I enjoyed the people that I worked for and with and the lessons that I learned about retail and management as a whole. The ever-changing company goals and focuses made it difficult at times to lead a team of younger associates, however with knowledge of why the changes were occurring the associates always seemed to jump on board."
good,"A typical day would be working with customers on a professional level and handling any concerns they had with their accounts along with what they were purchasing and helping them make viable smart decisions. I learned to supervise six employees as the Customer Service Lead training them on various tasks to include cash handling, proper customer service and the sales of any add on warranties of products. I had and still have a great relationship with the management, sales team and associates and visit there often when I go back to my hometown. My job was not hard but challenging with lots of things to juggle if I was the manager on duty, otherwise everything went smooth and as planned. The best part of that job was the people I met and the relationships that I made with many of my customers and fellow co-workers. I am a people person and enjoy making people happy by finding solutions for their business or personal needs."
good,"Require a great deal of concentration to work, dusty. A caring team."
good,"Managed a team of 16 inside account managers with an average book of business of $4.3m. Monthly sales of over $6.1m with 99.7% sales retention YOY. Analyzed and strategized with reps to retain and grow their business. Provided coaching, and knowledge daily to achieve sales goals. Trained and coached new hire and created a new hire training programs."
good,"There were good days (productive and fun) and bad days (slow and busy work) but all in all a typical day consisted of fixing computers, selling and upselling product, and putting away stock/blocking. The management there was sound, but the pressure of working for a company trying to compete in a very specific market made it slightly difficult to stay on a path to improvement. Every 2-3 weeks there would be a new mission statement even if the previous one was never really fulfilled. Upselling made it uncomfortable sometimes, as everything we sold had a plan attached to it (on the tech side,) and it was hard for a customer to not feel pressured when they came in. However the offerings were legitimate, and every customer got great attention. The tech service at some stores is blossoming, so it was slow on occasion but it truly was a ""when it rains it pours"" kind of store."
good,"A typical day at work for me begins with me assessing the KPIs and sales of the previous day. I look at the information and analyse the KPIs to see where the store succeeded and what needs improving. After this I then talk to my supporting Team Leader about the days targets and what we need to do to improve in the areas needed. The rest of the day I spend most of the day on the shop floor trying to maximise sales oppertunities and interacting with customers, during times of the day I am not on the shop floor I look at what needs to be done in the store in other areas such as standards, associate improvement and any requests from head office, district managers or other stores."
good,"Staples has a great system for inventory and ordering, everything sold was deducted from the store inventory and when it fell below a certain level was automatically ordered and on a truck the next day."
good,"Reveiwing the production form the previous night. Working with 1st shift team on what is scheduled to be received in that day. Working with the replenishment team to insure that we are monitoring replen for maximum results. Working with the returns department to insure 24 hour turnaround for customer credit. Work with maintenance team on equipment and needs for their departments. Paying invoices, getting quotes for work to be performed at building."
good,"Helpful management, but not really a fulfilling job. Not enough responsibility passed onto staff, and no furthering of the job was possible. At the same time, there were no further opportunities for students at the part time level that I had wanted."
good,Has been an intersting experience so far. Work normal business days. management is good.
good,"really good company to work for,i was going for management training,but only option for me was to leave P.E.I.,which i did not wish to do,due to family."
good,Working there was a temp position. I liked my coworkers but the manage was much of a mean person.
good,"I loved working at Staples. The potential for growth was, and is incredible."
good,work environment was great managment wasn't the greatest but other then that pretty good place to work.
good,Enjoyed the work environment. A typical day was using my skills to be productive on the job. Also to keep the trucks on a timely basis. Nothing hard about the job enjoyed completing all tasks assigned.
good,"Staples is a good company to work for mainly because you must maintain your section of the store. you come in and find something to do like planograms, check prices and pull product down. you'll learn what each paper weighs, what the difference between an inkjet or laser printer is. managers as always differ but they usually have to worry about numbers. the heavy lifting. the feeling of accomplishment you feel at the end of the day."
good,Staples has a lot of opportunity due to its size and international presence.
good,The management at my store were nice.
good,flexible schedule and great availibilty of management. Oppoertunites to advance were a plenty.
good,Management is horrible
good,It was a very rare and fun experience to be able to work laker games and concerts and different events almost every night. i learned how to work with large groups of people at one time. I got a chance to meet and work with lots of different types of people. The hardest part of the job would be working 2 events in one day the hours would be between 12 to 14 hours a day. The most enjoyable part of the job was to watch concerts be put together.
good,"MY typical day at work was fun energetic work place. I learned a grea deal of my customer service skills here, plus money handling. Management was awesome to work for. Co workers were ok some were easier to get along with than others. Hardest part, honestly i cant remeber there realy being a hard part. The most enjoyable par was meeting new people."
good,I like to get a job. From works i can learn lots of things and get experience for life.
good,"I loved working for staples except for an incident where I was threatened by another employee and management played it off as nothing. That is what bothered me, but aside from that working for staples was good. My boss was always willing to work with my schedule for school and she was more than understanding. My typical day at work was fun. I would come in on time, greet all my co-workers, and get straight to the customers which is my favourite thing. I love to help people. When I am effective, efficient, and approachable and I'm told how awesome I was by a customer- that is what really gets me pumped. Except for how short staffed we were all the time. The fact that I would be the only closing cashier from midday to close is what was stressful and not only that, but there was a real lack of organization and if I were to be gone for a couple days, my front end would be completely messed up. I learned, though, it's better to just do as your told without complaint, keep a smile on your face no matter what, and always be willing to help even if it seems things are getting hectic. I learned that there CAN be community within the work place. I love my co-workers and I was blessed to know them. We would always be laughing and the customers noticed how upbeat we were and it made the atmosphere something to be envied compared to the other stores. I loved that about our store."
good,The employees were very nice and management was the best I have ever worked with.
good,A typical day was 8:00 - 5:00. My primary function was resolving invoicing discrepancies for assigned vendors as a Vendor Relations Specialist in the Accounts Payable department.
good,"Staples was the beginning of my foray into digital print, and I certainly learned and aquired great skill while being there in the Copy Centre. I left just before most of the major changes in technology and management styles were brought in from the states, to make them compete with Kinko's. Job security was a bit tricky at times, and advancement seemed to take a great deal of time, regardless of overall contributions."
good,"I loved working here, it was fast paced and fun. Everyone got along great."
good,go in workplace after reveiw from mangerment.If your a picker you pick order for customers.till breaks.If you are a restocker you empty skids and put product on shelves for the picker till break.You have percents of preformence to meet each day.Mangement always on floor and up on operation.Co worker get tire and cranky sometimes.Hardest part of job unloading toats and keeping 100 %. Seeing all the new products on the market.
good,A tipical day at work day after day all hands on deck.Direct comunication with costumers.
good,Great experiences in the clothing industry. The customer service aspect of this environment is very challenging and fulfiling.
good,Helping customers with their copy and print center needs. Providing them with all possible solutions for their needs. Producing order under pressure. Management was not as organized.
good,"Learned skills such as problem solving, money handling, customer service and time management. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to interact with a good group of co-workers."
good,Everyday was the same helping customers in store and answering phone calls.
good,Staples is good if you want customer service experience or a bit a tech experience.
good,Good company to work for. Need better flexible hours for working parents but good pay. Good environment and well organized in management and over all seeing of products.
good,"Overall good place to work. Job is very secure, but pay for hourlys leaves much to be desired. Alot of task expectations on management so its hard to have a very good work / life balance"
good,"I was a lead cashier. Did returns dealt with customers. Trained new cashiers. When days were slow it gave you time to talk to other employees for a short time. When it was fast, it would be during deals and school sales."
good,If you take the job seriously and make it clear you want to advance in the company you will. It is a great place to learn.
good,Opportunities are there for you depends on where you started and obviously if you are at a higher level of management then it could be a long wait.
good,"It is a definitely a great place to start working. However I have been there for a few years now, and the compensation is extremely below what you would expect. Management is great though. They are the only reason I have stayed so far."
good,"There was a lot to to learn at staples, the people were kind the coworkers had theyre cliques i worked with a lot of nice business people that were intelligent and knew i didnt belong there."
good,"I enjoyed my time working at Staples talking and getting to know the customers. I enjoyed working with my co workers, they were very nice. I enjoyed learning about the different products sold in the store. It was a great experience and gained a lot of skills during my time at Staples. They taught me how to upswell customers and I was very good at upwelling customers."
good,"As the department tasked with bringing in most of the stores income, you are responsible for ensuring every customer is happy and comfortable with what they are spending their money on. You have to be able to to create a relationship with each on, causing them to want to come back. Its always amazing, all the different cultures and families you get to be apart of when you open yourself to the customers needs!"
good,It was always easy to know what was going to happen and what was needed during the day. The management went through a lot of change while I was there and I left around July 2019 right when a new manger had stepped down so I can't say how it is with management now.
good,"Though there didn't seem to be anywhere to improve, it was a fun experience with very knowledgeable managers that were able to help out with anything."
good,I enjoyed my time at Staples although the consideration of full time students could have been better. I began to get less hours when my college semester started and that sucked because not only was I working and going to school I am a full time mom as well so the small pay checks I was receiving weren’t good at all.
good,It is a great place for learning and getting started. There were limited opportunity for growth and management can be a hit or missed. Communication among management could be better to help improve work culture
good,"not paid enough, can be a fun environment with the right management. its what you make it, doing the tasks can make the day go by faster, nothing is worse than a dreadful work day."
good,"Huge push to meet goals and there are several. However, prizes and rewards are offered for meeting said goals. Biggest downside is the drama. It seems lile someone is always talking bad about someone else."
good,"Everyone is treated equally, everyone works at the check out register regardless of position."
good,"i am used to working in larger groups with 50-100 employees. after working for staples with a group of 20 people, i am very satisfied with the work culture and working environment. i suggested that the walls be painted since the overall appearance of the inside of the store is rather sterile. red is the expressed color of the shirts and the symbols so the people and signs really stick out against the bland pale white walls and ceilings. i don't see a district or area manager do walk thrus very often so the appearance of the store is based on management direction and employee initiative with some corporate guidance. the housekeeping details could be improved as far as cleanliness and organization but the overall floor space or square footage is managed well. other than the overall appearance that i would give a 3 out of 5, the work culture and community focused environment are outstanding. since it's such a small group, getting to know everyone is easy and people have to know how to get along in small groups in order to succeed here. management has a primary mission, as most retail establishments do, to sell. the emphasis is on top down selling or offering the premium value first and moving down the list to accommodate the customer. some knowledge of office supply is obviously helpful, and a choice between print / copy services and technology is up the applicant / employee. that means it goes beyond selling the product but also selling the service and there is an emphasis on making sure the services are attached to the product being sold. this includes both technical services"
good,I loved the people I worked with and most of the managers. They paid you when you had to complete online training. I loved the majority of our customers and found the work satisfying.
good,It’s a very laid back environment. Cashier is chill and stocking has its perks. I worked with a lot of attractive people so for me that was a plus . Thanks
good,"The associates are the strength of Staples!"
good,"Staples was a great company at one time, I hope it finds its way and return to greatness.  They took away some benefits over the years to keep earnings up while still public.  I guess it was necessary to keep the company moving forward.  However, as an associate having benefits and commissions cut hurt at the time."
good,"It was a decent, and organized place to work. There load in days are rough but very manageable. Other then that schedules are kept pretty tight and organized as well."
good,I enjoyed working here before I moved. I wish I could have spent more time there. The people were nice and my manager did a good job of training and showing me the ropes.
good,"Realistic expectations on work requirements. Fair pay. Decent and fair management. Attendance policy is very reasonable. Due to the nature of work, some days are longer than others with longer days requiring mandatory overtime."
good,"stay alert, pay attention to detail, must stand for long periods of time. it's a relaxed cultured workplace. the hardest part is completing the task in a timely manor"
good,Bonne société évolution possible salaire correct bonne états d esprit équipe accueillant
good,productive and fast pace and a lot of times stressful and management was very respectful and they had committee that would organize games during breaks which would lighten up day if your having a bad one.
good,"I feel this job was more of an extra income job, would not recommend for someone that isn't able to work more than one job. Would not be able to support you and your needs. Hours are slim and pay is less than desirable for the stress of it."
good,"The only issue I had was with the general manager. We always butted heads. I had customers treat me badly because they were racist (openly so) and she would never handle the situation correctoy."
good,"Working alongside with the associates have been pretty good and the management has been fair."
good,"Most days working at Staples location in North Phoenix were calm and slower-paced compared to larger distributors. Since there wasn't usually lines of customers, it gave more time to one on one assistance finding and recommending the right product."
good,"Whilst at Staples Europe/ Marke Creative I managed all marketing functions "
good,"My only thing I can leave on the review is this, if you have a great store manager then your job is great. I mean, I can't stress this enough, Staples corporate as far as I can see lets the stores be self-contained entities meaning that the only thing which is important is who runs the show. I have had two store managers, the first being an exemplary case of management who didn't just manage employees but customers as well to a degree of excellence not often seen on this planet. The second manager I had, whose only job was to come in and change nothing to the already successful store, tanked the store's income in a span of 6 months. He was subsequently fired, but not before instilling a terrible work atmosphere based around lies and fear-mongering employees about their income. That's where the problem lies, is that if this was an outside hire who did this then you can see how Staples messed up. Not too difficult, but the reality of the situation is that Staples already knew this guy was worthless, a store had already failed under his guidance. They thought that it was simply the area the store was in (it wasn't) and brought him to the best performing store in the North Texas district. He proceeded to lose half his employee base, hire a total of ten people who all left for the same reason (management), and then ruined a lot of relationships that we had tailored with customers. He also didn't brush his teeth, don't know what was up with that. In a sense though, yeah it's a decent step but not a career in any means."
good,Worked for staples for almost three years . Had its ups and downs .. but everyone worked together to achieve a common goal. Sale was competitive but collaborative
good,"As a child I love pens and paper. As an adult I put that love to good use working at Staples. The people I work with have become good friends. There are stressful parts about the job, it is retail sales after all, but overall it has been a great experience."
good,"Good maintained equipment, safe environment and great management. I felt I was part of a team, and management actually cared about individuals. I would work here again."
good,"Management was really great, employees were treated well, compensation was what it was but certainly didnt feel that it was unfair. The workplace environment was very friendly."
good,.I learned so much working at Staples. The management were nice and made me feel comfortable and were flexible to work with. Nice environment and very fast pace so you get the excercise
good,"Very fast paced when picking the first 3/4 of the shift.The last 1/4 can be even more fast paced when finishing the last boxes of the night."
good,"Great environment to work in, easy going management, I would really push for overtime sometimes because I enjoyed the work. The positions change from putting boxes together to loading crates."
good,"This store was nice and easy going. The management was cool and worked with your schedule to make sure you hit at least 25 hrs or more. Copy Center was fun, a little stressful but you get used to it."
good,I have had worse jobs. Worked here for about 2 years aside from it being a hectic job at times I enjoyed the people I worked with overall. Of course some managers weren’t the best but there were some that were really there to hear you out if you had any problems with time scheduling. I worked on the floor helping customers and aside from these two things and cranky customers really couldn’t complain too much.
good,As an associate there is always work to be done and most of the time the customers were repeat customers so you had that rapport with them. As a manager you still had that rapport with them but now upper management wants you to push products onto these customers. the environment was good and it was nice to work but Upper management are always micro managing making it difficult to do your job. it can be a career move if you donate all of your time to them.
good,"Kind of a dead end job, but an entertaining place to work nonetheless. Management was sloppy on bad days and didn't really have a grip on the store as a whole."
good,I worked at staples after school during high school and found it as a good part-time position. I worked in the office supplies section and enjoyed the freedom of the work. I was given space to keep my section clean and stocked along with helping guests in my section.
good,Was a very good first job while I completed my tertiary studies. The manager was great and reasonable. Business gets a bit slow after September so you get reduced hours.
good,"-  Wonderful and friendly environment"
good,"I always found myself getting work done at an incredible pace with minimum to no errors. I created a positive work environment, and even created a relationship with many customers. Overall a very enjoyable experience."
good,it was my first job i had fun i made a fool of my self and people loved it but they can only have like 6  or 7 full time employee's so there was no real room for advancement
good,"I started this job in my latter years of highschool into my first College year when I left. The job provides excellent knowledge on products especially those who are in the tech roles and enjoy those types of products. Managment always felt new, with new policies and procedures that are easily lived-through but frustrating especially when its always more work same pay."
good,"Working at Staples keeps you on your toes, from stocking shelves, maintaining a fullly stocked inventory and also helping customers fijnd and purchase their items."
good,Upper management not very patient or nice if you have not been trained on something.  Then they get mad when you try to do it but they gave you very minimal training.  This attitude follows over in everything and manager keeps thing in chaos for you the entire shift....
good,Professional work environment under good leadership. Provides you room to learn and grow on your own as a employee and leader. They give you opportunities to perform at a high level and lead your own projects within the store. Lots of networking opportunities with local businessmen as well.
good,"Everyone was welcoming and helpful, but I worked at two different locations. One location was very fun, motivating, and beneficial all while getting the job done. The other was not very fun and was focused on work 100% and was almost miserable. Location of the job matters much more than I thought it did , for I have visited other locations while traveling to see what it was like and some were fun and welcoming and others were not welcoming. Good job for a beginner, but do not recommend to someone with multiple years of experience"
good,"Being there at sixteen, I was the youngest while all of my coworkers were in their twenties. The least fun part was that there were not many people that came in that were in my age group. The most fun part was that my coworkers and I would all joke around a lot and my sister was one of them! I learned a basic understanding of customer service. "
good,"It has been years since I worked here. It was retail, so the focus om the customers was absolute top priority. It my position, I was very much pushed to make sales goals,and holding my team member accountable on for their sales. Sometimes you are pushed to the extreme to make sales, sometimes even when the customer doesn't need a particular item."
good,"Es wurde kräftig aussortiert hohe fluktuation"
good,Great place to learn some basics in technology and sales. Room to move up if you are well liked by upper management. it takes time for that to happen but overall great place for a student to work at.
good,"Depending on the time of my shift, if I opened it was very relaxed and quiet, then the work would pick up around noon. It was a fun place to work because management was easy to get along with and coworkers were all very friendly."
good,"Working at the Staples store, I felt values and appreciated. My manager could see my potential and was always will to train me for other roles in the store."
good,"Working for Staples the office supply store. Is a great experience my typical day at work is to reach out to staples database and up-sell current and new customer. I've learned that most customers are very receptive of Staples advances because of every one love the office store."
good,"Working here is not a bad thing, it's actually not as stressful as it may seem as long as you have a good team to work with. The discounts are okay as well"
good,"Mostly the job is fairly simple, as long as you aim for your daily goal (varying on department) management will mostly stay out of your way. However, like any job its not exempt from having that ""one manager"", but if you keep yourself focused, they usually leave you be."
good,"Nice place to work. The people are nice and the benefits are good. I had a long run, but was downsized. Many nice perks and my job was well received with my customers"
good,"pay well for the work, especially for the area. can work an upwards of 72 hours in a week during peak week, but it only happens a couple times a year. they offer plenty of overtime."
good,You get recongized for your achevements  but not rightfully compensated. They did away with bonuses.  Management promotion is not easy from as associate level.
good,when I became aware of a possible theft in progress my manager refused to listen and or believe that it was even possible. ending result I recovered over $250.00 worth of merchandise for this particular incident.
good,Working here at Staples was a learning experience. They trained me on the electric pallet jack which lead me into advancement. The facility was always clean.
good,Everyday was always different. Fun work environment.Promotions and moving up the scale was based upon how efficient you work. I would recommend this job for a college student. relatively easy to work with and work around your personal schedule
good,"oversee the day to day operations"
good,It was fine. I worked in the print department through college and it paid rent. Its just not the career I want out of life. I liked it as much as you can like retail
good,Great place to work! I was very lucky because in my store we worked as a team and everyone was willing to help to one another. If you are willing to learn people will teach you new skills everyday.
good,otimos em tudo excepto em valorizar os trabalhadores
good,Everyone I worked with was great we all got along well and I feel like the store really flowed smoothly. No matter what staples you went into everyone was so friendly and such a big help even if you didn’t work at that particular store.
good,"The main goal is to show up and be pleasant to be around. As long as you do what is asked of you, you will succeed and enjoy your job. The pay isn't great but if you enjoy who you work with then it will be worth it. Easy job to understand and learn. Takes someone with a lot of patience to enjoy a slow paced work environment."
good,"I loved the work in the Copy and Print center, there was never a dull moment and time flew by. I enjoyed meeting all types of people and learning a new trade."
good,"Multi tasking abilities is a plus for this work.  A typical day is consulting with customers on printed products, and other business services such as shipping, scanning, faxing etc.  Work is fulfilling especially if you enjoy interacting with clients.   You also assist in creating marketing pieces.  Downfall was the management did not ask those who work the front line enough about what the customer's needs were and what customers were experiencing in their stores."
good,"I loved printing, it was fun, the day went by really fast and it was a challenge everyday, I love hands on work that is something new everyday and you get to do that at staples !  the people are a lot of fun too, very helpful and positive !"
good,I don't have anything bad to say about Staples. I joined the Staples team after leaving years of working with Party City. The work environment was much superior to my former work place. The staff was much better and the management was super reasonable and where friends with everyone. Great place for anything looking for their first job or any seasoned veteran in retail to join.
good,it was great for a first time job. i would recommend to friends who are just starting in the work force. great hours very easy and slow paced. lots to learn and do.
good,daily jobs are repiticious . the scheduling is acoarding to managment. basic customer service with attachment sales a plus. job security was nice along with department bonuss great.
good,"While I felt positively about my time with the company, it has undergone an acquisition since I left.  Therefore, I would not venture to speculate on the current nature of the company."
good,"The job was easy and laid back, however it gets hectic during back to school. I was hired for a temporary position during the back to school rush and let go afterwards in mid September."
good,Wages are low for positions. Usually short staffed. Staples is a respected company and you will learn a lot.  Self motivation makes all the difference.
good,Friendly and relaxed place to work. Fasted paced but still relaxed. Jobs where simple and easy to accomplish. They train you on all the equipment needed to complete your job.
good,"Opportunities to grow in retail"
good,Staples provides a flexible work environment.  It is a great place to work and will develop you as an individual and an employee.  Staples offers their employees great incentives at times.
good,Cool place to work if you dont mind trying everyday even when your not feeling it. You do have to deal with alot of new management alot younger then you usually with no experience kind of annoying .
good,Staples was a good overall company to work for but unfortunately compensation was not competitive. Good management and a good product to sell. The training at this company was excellent and made a great foundation for my outside sales career.
good,"Loved Working here it was a fun fast paced environment. However they focused too much on sales and numbers rather than what i felt was more important, customer service."
good,"those in need of a quick job this is the place to work, they are fast paced and hard workers i have recommended other individuals to work for this company."
good,"Overall working at Staples is pretty awesome. The managers are great and always radiate positivity to help store morale and drive store sales. Good enviroment, pleasant co workers. The best part of the is usually when you have a regular come in and almost everyone in the store knows them. Its good to build rapport with customers and  that is just another way for us to drive sales and give satisfactory customer service."
good,The environment is similar to any other DC. A lot of development went to internal hires which were eventually promoted to leadership roles. There was also yearly conferences which helped to bring the team together.
good,only thing I hate going in as the new kids on the block why do other employee think you are trying to get there job and all you want to do is learn the one you need to do
good,I loved my time at Staples i found the team i was working with to be lovely and the pay was decent for a student but head office could complicate things
good,This is a great company to work for.  The employees were good to work with.  They had a good safety policy.  Management was on point. I would have liked to have had better pay and more time off.
good,"Great pay and amazing Benefits, Was a Really Fast Pace Job Enjoyed working for them, Down Side was Management Not always on Their Point,  Friendly Environment and Team environment,"
good,"My time at Staples was enjoyed, but I had to leave as it conflicted with my casual hours job at St. Paul's Hospital. For most part, we helped customers find the supplies they needed and kept stock on the shelves. In the Copy Centre, the atmosphere generated from the work environment and customers grew difficult. Customers at the Copy Centre were more unsteady in comparison to the other departments. Overall the staff were nice and most customers we decent."
good,"Great job is you're comfortable staying in the same position.  If you're looking for a strong future with constant growth for your career, this is probably not the right place for you."
good,A typical day at work requires that I do my regular tasks as well as assist any customers that may need assistance.  My forte is technology although I can assist anyone in finding items on the sales floor.  I also make the customer aware of useful extended warranties that protect the value of their product if and when the product does fail.
good,This was a very convenient job. I loved working here because I love working with customers or anything in customer service but the only down side to this job was the lifting of heavy boxes.
good,An OK job that requires you to move around a lot and help anybody and everyone with whatever they need while keeping the store stocked and looking nice.
good,The company cares about it's employees through charitable donations given by it's own to take care of their own. They do great work for the environment and are always doing fun activities for staff. There are many lunch & learns about current topics and female guest speakers through the Women Who Lead committee. They do not overwork you but if they do you are compensated with gift cards or time off. I would recommend it as an entry level position however as the pay is limited and promotions are slim.
good,"I was the supervisor of the Copy/Print center.  5 associaties in the department. Very active and sometimes stressfull, but I also learned about the copy/print businesss and customer relations."
good,"Inside Account Manager"
good,"It was a fast but easy going job and atmosphere. How ever, the manager that was there at the time was not well qualified for their position and would make it stressful for everyone else."
good,"work is solid and fairly constant from day to day. the reflexive nature of the job can be stressful to folks that dont know how to manage that kind of thing although if you can its a standard job. clock on work, go home when the work is done."
good,"This Staples store is very busy in the print center.  Some work days the is extra people there to help, Sundays you work by yourself. The hardest part of the job is multiple people, you have to help at self serve copiers, UPS, and the walk up customers."
good,"It wasn't a hard job, but it wasn't very exciting unless you have a passion for office supplies. The job mostly consisted of helping customers find items on the shelf, stocking shelves, and doing inventory."
good,A typical day at Staple:
good,"Staples recently went private bought out by a private company and is going through multiple changes including reducing staffing, but LT still is looking for productivity to stay the same."
good,The once family like feeling has gone away. The best part of working at Staples Corporate is the people. If not for my co-workers I'd have been long gone.
good,I worked in the Copy and Print department and I really enjoyed the work but it doesn't pay enough to live off of. I thoroughly enjoyed being able to be creative at my job while I was there.
good,I had a lot of fun with Staples.  I learned about technology and office furniture.  it was fast paced and the time blew by.  I felt challenged and needed.
good,"Fast paced work, requires heavy lifting, standing all day, in freezing or extremely hot temperatures. Not a bad place to work as far as work. Management is ok some very problematic. Benefits are good"
good,Overall good place to work. yes its a corporation so you deal with typical junk from the DM's and higher up than that. What made this job great was the people I worked with at my location.
good,This job really helped me become a better sales person. I learned a lot. Made me more confident. Sometimes can be stressful and fast paced. Fun coworkers.
good,"In my position of management, I was expected to provide excellent customer service while delivering results on the company's core sales metrics. While maintaining a reasonable turnaround time on computer repairs, I was also required to push products, protection plans, and credit cards on customers (and ensure my team was doing so, as well). The team of associates and managers that I worked with were fantastic, but when the increased sales expectations and related consequences came down from the higher-ups, the store atmosphere changed. Everything is becoming more and more stressful with each passing week, and not many employees are receiving the training or weekly hours to meet these expectations."
good,"A typical day would be making sure I had a radio to communicate to fellow associate, make sure the counters had all the supplies necessary before my shift,  I also rotated the necessary stock and made sure the shelves near the register were full and any garbage was thrown out.  I would greet customers as they entered, and direct them to the aisle for the merchandise they were seeking.  There were times when I would assist customers with ordering their merchandise online in the store.  Also would use the radio to direct associates to help customers.  I would also answer light to heavy phone calls while waiting on the customers at the register."
good,Fast paced and at times a little stressing when you get behind or shorthanded with associates in certain work areas. Overall I enjoyed the work environment and the people and most of the management team.
good,I enjoyed my tenure at Staples because I could use my life experiences to hone my skills and deliver customer service to the highest of industry standards.
good,"The concept behind the retail end of the company is excellent.  But the managers are allowed to staff based on two areas of sales only, out of a category of 20+ .  It makes it tough to meet all customers needs when the staff is so short."
good,a day at work can vary deepening on the time of day and season. Ive learned that you should try to learn as quickly as possible. The management was very kind and helpful.
good,Managers are guiding and nurturing to help provide the tools necessary to move up and into new roles. The culture is very encouraging to try your hardest and give everything to move your team forward.
good,"In general Staples is a great company to work for. In my department the lack of opportunity for advancement is my biggest concern, however on a daily basis I feel I was challenged and felt I had every opportunity to succeed with the tools given to me."
good,"Everyone at Staples is very friendly and part of a team. You can't go there and not be friends with everyone who works there. Management is very lenient, so as long as you get your get your work done you are free to do what you need to do. Customers are extremely difficult however, as they can really confuse you or pester for one simple item."
good,Its a great place to work if you like doing cold calling out to company's its a very laid back place to work if you like doing sales they do provide you with training
good,Good place to work.  All coworkers and management got along which made going to work enjoyable.  The store had it slow times and extremely busy times.
good,"A cubical farm in a large office.  "
good,Okay company...Losing business as we speak.  Ecommerce from other sources are hurting this business.  Additionally every retail store now carries some sort of Office Supplies.
good,"was a great place to work, if you work hard and do the job required and go above and beyond they take the time to recognize you. great place to advance your skills and knowledge"
good,"Always moving to fulfill orders, music always playing over loud speaker for everyone to hear, decent leadership, and early release if all orders are shipped out fast enough."
good,Matters on what section you work in but i was a it tech easy job the only dumb things was how they logged pc repair and my manager over all my experience wasn't to bad just long work hours on my feet like 12 hour works days long
good,"Like any job it has its pros and cons. On occasion one does outway the other. Some days are really good, customers and coworkers are great and pleasant and other days things seem to go down hill. Management is ok but is currently going through a change of hands."
good,"Typical day at work involved putting out load and products. Lots of customer service and making the store look nice. Management is pretty good. Hardest part is when it's slow, they tell you to fill empty product spots and it can be very tedious"
good,"If you are able to work in a fast paced environment that requires labor you will fit in well here. Learning how to drive equipment is rare for females unless you are on 3rd shift. During 1st and 2nd shift, most females work in break pack which is packaging"
good,"consistent work and corporate structure. loaded trucks and managed delivery schedules to casinos with the traffic, the volume of people and errors in loads and merchandise."
good,"Always busy with not enough hours in the day"
good,You were given direction without feeling like someone was always breathing down your neck. Friendly staff that were always willing to help you if you needed it.
good,A good place for students who's looking for a part time job. If you looking for full time hours I do not recommend it and the pay rate can only support a college student.
good,"Depending on the location and team, Staples can be a great place to work. Working at a place like Staples is all in what you make it to be. It can be a very pleasant, its all in what you make it."
good,I worked at Staples as a contractor. My manager was very well balanced. Atmosphere was relaxed. New management or new owners are unpredictable as many layoffs are occurring.
good,Belle entreprise nous permettant de bien vivre notre vie familliale avec de jeune.
good,I would start the day by receiving items and moving pallets around according to importance of the items on it as well as the items that were out of stock on the shelf.
good,"The people I worked with were great, but honestly overall the job was just OK. Great for students, or people juggling other responsibilities. Also a great first job. Employee knowledge on electronics is very low, and they don't really have a system to help with that."
good,"The coworkers where I worked were amazing. I know, however, that Staples as a whole can be very stressful and focused on metrics. You are taught how to sell well. You do not get much in the way of training."
good,This is a great place to work if you get the chance to stay longer than a month. Hot sometimes single GIRLS everywhere and I am not talking about the ones that come into the store.
good,I liked working at staples I just didn't like that they wouldn't train you in more than one department so you could help out. I liked the managers and the people that I worked with.
good,Good place to work. Great pay. Can be a lot of work at times. You always get plenty of hours. The management is a little off. They have great benefits. I think they shouldn't be as strict as they are but i would go back to work with them.
good,"I learned a lot being there. I've helped train others that came in to being new hires, I liked that. I was asked to do a lot of things and executed everything the exact way my manager wanted me to. I would be friendly with everyone since I almost worked in every area. A nice experience."
good,"If it wasn't for my amazing coworkers it would've been harder, but it was a great job overall. You learn fast, good pay, and decent management. Do not get much hours advancement, but you have options sometimes to come in when workers call in, other than that, I stayed at Part Time for 2 years."
good,"Lucrative sales opportunity, racist management.  Great sales process, lots of flexibility and freedom with your schedule.  Essentially run your own book of business.  Management in North Carolina is the most racist and discriminatory cult I've ever encountered, I was forced to resign for moral reasons."
good,"I worked for staples for almost 10 years. The company really depends on managers and coworkers. The Last store i worked at everyone would cooperate and help each other. Corporate wants employees to ""make more happen"" with less resources. Corporate combines two full time positions into one part time position and excepts to raise profits, help customers and get operations finish on time."
good,"A typical day at work involves analysing your current pipeline and implementing sales strategies.  This includes contacting customers and setting face to face meetings, reviewing client accounts and identifying new opportunities and preparing quotes and proposals. Management strategy has changed recently towards a flat management structure particularly in middle management.  This is to create a leaner accountable team. Overall the workplace culture is good with many people supporting each other. The hardest part about the job is the amount of internal team and supplier meetings.  The most enjoyable part of the job is looking after customers."
good,"Utilize Human Resources practices and objectives as a means of providing an employee-oriented, high-performance culture that emphasizes empowerment, quality, productivity, goal attainment, recruitment and the ongoing development of a top-talent workforce."
good,"Employees are always friendly. Will always have job security. Great coworkers, and very productive environment. Smiles and giggles all day long. Great management."
good,"Staples is a great place to work, mainly for high school students looking for their first job. Very comfortable environment as well as friendly. they actually work with your schedule."
good,Laid off after 7 years after being told we wouldn't be. You only advance by who you know not what you know. Worked my butt off and didn't get recognized.
good,Very positive work culture  everyone is family  there is some pressure  to meet number  goals but it pushes for a productive sales team management is typically very understanding when it comes to personal lives
good,"I feel as though it's very hard to move up in this company just like any warehouse enviorment. This company could do better with letting the employees know that they care, I do love going to work and feel as though I can learn something new everyday being in the position I'm currently in."
good,"The staff at staples were great, but the company was struggling maintain its identity and was constantly changing goals and targets. generally because it didn't achieve the last set of goals."
good,"Pay is good "
good,If you love working on computers you will enjoy the basic aspects of this job. However be prepared to up sale and be put out of your comfort zone. It is a good for the beginning tech.
good,Taking calls from corporate customers looking for non stock items. Processing orders and returns. Working on multiple computer programs to ensure orders processed correctly
good,everyone feels like family and you really just connect with people it can really be a great friendship environment. customer service skills were always coming out on top and you can always find something to do. it was a simple job but you could always find ways to challenge yourself and keep you on your toes.
good,"Great customers, and interesting products."
good,"flexible overtime, contracted hours, national living wage, good working in a team and also a chance to work independently. As an associate the job role varies from sales, tills, working delivery etc."
good,The majority of the employees and managers are very nice however one bad apple can ruin the whole bunch and having one manager be very aggressive and disrespectful can make it very difficult to work there.
good,"the job i work is very flexible and my manager is amazing.its good for school and motherhood and isnt too labor intensive. Although the pay is good for the role, i wish we were offered more hours."
good,"Excellent training and help to meet targets, despite pressure to perform it is still a fun and rewarding place of work. Great range of products and capability to learn."
good,"I enjoyed working at Staples and sometimes I would get frustrated, but that's normal for most jobs. I worked at 3 locations and would work here again if given the opportunity. Management across stores wasn't always the best and it seems as though the good managers got treated unfairly while bad managers kept their jobs for much longer. "
good,"Work with customers, stock shelves, work the cash register.  Hours were flexible and was able to get time off when needed.  Looking for a job that did not include sales."
good,"I enjoyed my time there, however I did not feel there was any room for advancement in this employment area. It did have a good setting and very nice people to work with."
good,Typical day at work include stocking the merchandise unloading the truck and making sure the store is clean. Greeting the costumers as they walk through the door.
good,"Good part-time job"
good,This is a good job for a high school student. I was once very anti social but because of the nature of this job and having to constantly be talking to customers it made me come out of my shell.
good,"On the job training, knowledgeable staff, decent hours and scheduling. Diverse skills can be learned there. Good team atmosphere. Had the ability to work without being micromanaged."
good,"Staples is a team work based company. Everyone helps each other out, you learn great costumer service skills, and you really feel like your a part of the team when working there."
good,The staff I worked with were fun and great group of people. I easily fit in and felt comfortable with the the staff and tasks. If you're looking for a good part time for school this is a great place as they are very flexible and depending on the job you do you get to socialize with customers and employees and have a good time while having the time pass by... sometimes
good,"From day one everyone has been so great to work with, and things are dealt with in a professional matter, I've learned how to manage timelines and organize my work day based on them."
good,I have certainly improved my customer service skills and advanced in retail sales as technology sales representative. Staples training program has proven itself to be very effective.
good,"Great co-workers. Almost everybody is enjoyable to be around. The job itself can become very boring. Sales associates ask customers if they need help, and stock shelves for hours."
good,"Cashier, opening and closing the till. Counting money. Meeting companies goals. Reasonable hours to have. Staff meetings were good. Every shift we had a briefing."
good,"I started packing boxes and loading the line. Before my probation period was over, I was able to get a better paying, more technical position in maintenance. From packing boxes to controlling the product floor, I was able to move up fast, which included a pay raise. The management actually seemed to care about the employees, and the work was somewhat tailored to your abilities."
good,"The job is a pretty good place to work. Everyone is nice, & they pay weekly. They are also VERY flexible. It was the highest paying job I've had so far, even though it wasn't much. I only left because of the hours. Unless you're a manager or supervisor, only expect to work 3-5.30 hour shifts about 3 days a week average."
good,I worked here while i was going to school and they were very respectful of my schedule. advancement does seem to be an issue at the company but i didn't really plan on staying there long term anyhow.
good,"Staples day at work,repairing conveyor motor /gear boxes trouble shooting problem with plc or eye going out off line .short causing control to shutdown ."
good,Fantastic work environment to learn and to showcase your knowledge.Friendly employees to work with and who helps to achieve dead lines on time and can push you ahead when ever you get struck in the work having no clue.
good,"It's a nice and easy environment to be in. However, there are too few employee's to get the jobs done and the work can be pretty stressful at times. It certainly keeps you busy the entire time though."
good,Staples is a good company if you need a part time job and are good at socializing with customers. The management was nice and worked with me on my schedule. Pleasant working environment and plenty of work to keep me busy.
good,"There was a lot of things that Staples, my first job, taught me about the work force. It gave me money and people skils through cashiring and being a floor salesman with our tech products. Co-workers were great and easy to get along with as well."
good,Overall Staples is a good company. Compensation is decent for entry level positions and depending on your department and level in the company life can be great.
good,Different job assignments depending on ones certifications and qualifications. Most of the jobs have the same pay scale. Overall if one is looking for extra experience I would recommend working here.
good,"Great place to work for a customer service job. It had its ups and downs, but the people I worked with acted like a team and made sure that everyone was treated with respect"
good,The company was Corporate Express and I enjoyed going to work everyday but after Staples bought the company things changed greatly.  It was a lot of transition needed and the attitude and atmosphere of the associates changed.
good,"The time I worked hete was owesome, they gave me a chance to learn and develope my talents. I was very happy working with them."
good,"Managers and associates were well trained and for the first 10 years I found the culture was very exciting.  Associates were well versed on the culture, the company goals and understood clearly where Staples wanted to be as a company.  Salary and benefits were good, and all associates felt valued.  Over the last few years Staple's goal was to be number one in office products and furniture and had a mandate to take over its biggest competitors.  During this time it was obvious this was their focus  and the culture was changing. Unfortunately Staples were not successful in buying out their competitors and for the first time in my career there I felt uncertain of how we would recover and that job security was at risk."
good,As Staples was y first job I felt that I learned new skills that can be transferable to anywhere. I enjoyed serving customers to provide them with the service and products that they needed.
good,no sales culture environment. very laid back business attitude segregated departments not a lot of team work.  Moral is ok need to work on ensuring no segregation.
good,"I really enjoyed my team and all the people in the office were friendly. The office setting is more on the industrial side so it could be better.The dental benefits could be better and they did recently change time off to a set amount of days instead of separating it to sick, vacations and floating holidays. I really loved when the manufacturers salesman would visit and teach us about their new product and services. I also liked the everyday job of sourcing technology and finding the customer the right fit for their needs and cost."
good,"Lovely staff, poor wage, average customers. Very flexible hours and shift patterns, 4 weekly payment, lots of training and new things to learn. Very hands on and busy."
good,"As a manager my week would consist of meetings, conference calls, rally meetings with the associates, interviewinig potential candidates, responding to customer requests and or complaints, goal setting, coaching, merchandising, and making sure every customer that walked into our location was had all of their needs met."
good,Staples is an ok location to work.  There has been many success stories which allows people to grow within the company if you are working within the right department.
good,"The company offers many benefits and perks. The environment is clean; and the work and life balance is manageable. This company supports many causes such as helping the community, American Heart Association and others."
good,"When I first started, the company was customer focused. As time went on and overall company sales declined along with operating profits, hours were cut at the store level while service based sales were markedly increased. This resulted in stores unable to maintain proper store standards which left shelves unfilled and with deliveries to stores of product in excessive amounts for low sales and products in high demand short which resulted in break downs of operational excellence."
good,"Very supportive staff, allowed me to get myself situated in a work environment that will have many curve balls but is still fulfilling for a person that needs to have experience in a retail environment."
good,Everything is was OK except that they didn't had equal amount of respect. They didn't have enough hours to pay some people so those people had a small schedule.
good,"A typical day would consist of checking emails for any orders, taking orders over the phone and serving the customers that come in to the store. I would be expected to keep the till area organised and running smoothly. "
good,"While the day-to-day routine is fun for someone who enjoys to interact with people, overall it's a part time job with all that entails: no advancement in any regard. No amount of being able to enjoy anything from funny customers to an enjoyable challenge of trying to sell something as obscure as computer insurance will make up for the fact that it's a part-time job for a corporation that has no interest but to make money off their employers. If you're going to college, this job's going to be fine if you're comfortable making sales quotas. Being a good salesperson is not that difficult. But if you want something more out of it than a paycheck and to make a career, look elsewhere."
good,Great experience in a team work environment and good relationship between associates and managers...One of the best place i worked so far. on the top was just the respectful environment.
good,I worked at Staples Canada in Westmont QC in September 2008 until December 2009 as a Computer Assistant. My job is to guide the customers for the electronic items they wanted to buy and promote the additional insurance in order to improve the customer satisfaction towards their products.
good,"It is a very interesting place to work, there is always something going on. Events ranging from small receptions to working the Grammys."
good,A typical work day at Staples starts with servicing the customers with picking the right product for their orders. Management was very helpful by giving the necessary tools that were needed to service the customers.
good,"Love my job as a Copy and Print Associate. Keeps me busy easily. Since they only offer part time my social life and work life are easily balanced. It has decent benefits and if youbdo your job right and well you can get points to earn for gift cards and such. My management team is easy going, they dont overwhelm you with task. The job culture is easy going."
good,"Business that thrives in customer service. Making sure to get the stores their product in an accurate, efficient manor while maximizing the tote cube and load quality."
good,"Getting paid weekly was great and I was able to increase my hourly wage twice with little difficulty. However, the sales goal was usually too high every day to achieve. Sometimes, they would also ask for multiple tasks to be completed, but none of them can be handled at the same time very well. The products we were pushed to sell were usually not quality, which made it more difficult to sell. We don't get commission either. Despite this, I liked the supervisors and my coworkers overall. Staples has a huge turnaround, so it was relatively easy to get the job."
good,a typical day we had a meeting when we first got there then the supervisor would tell us where they wanted us to work for the time.my co- workers I enjoyed working with a lot of them .the hardest part of the job there really wasn't anything hard about the job .the enjoyable part of the job knowing I did my best for the day.
good,"This job was okay for something to tie me over, but I didn't see it as place that I would want to invest my time in hopes that it would pay off. The management was good to work for and also contributed to serving our customers as much as the common worker."
good,"Easy, fun people, good pay for a high school student. Friendly co-workers. Took care of customers and kept the shelves stocked. Trained with knowledge on products and offered on the job training to keep you up to date on new products."
good,"It was a great company to work for. Scouting out new potential clients day to day, to fulfill their business supply needs."
good,"my typical day I work and manage the copy and print center we engage with customers daily and take customer orders and build rapport to get a little bit of information out the customer to do their order. We make all sorts on our department from business cards, posters, letterheads, flyers, banners, canvases etc."
good,"My day at work is very fast paced and consists of many different tasks. It has developed my time management tremendously. Higher management in Staples is usually very supportive. My co-workers and employees are motivated, team players. The hardest part about my job are the long and fluctuating hours. The most enjoyable part about my job is being able to help my customers and grow my employees."
good,"Well organized, flexible, works well under pressure, takes initiative, outstanding inventory control, strong aptitude for handling material and operating equipment.  Can and will meet or exceed warehouse operation efficiency goals."
good,"Working at staples was a great experience for me as a first job. It keeps you occupied and its super busy. The hardest part of the job is when your the only person with 20 customers but I have great customer service skills and can multitask very well so its not an issue. It can be challenging at times, but that's what makes it fun. The scheduling for work doesn't fit my schedule because of school and I have no free time so I'm trying to work around that. For the most part its an ok job."
good,"great place to work at."
good,"Love to work here but need a growth and desired compensation."
good,Working at Staples was a great experience.  I enjoyed my tenure there.  Staples needs to give employees more hours.  I encourage anyone who needs customer service experience to work at Staples.
good,Staples is a very clean place to work. Everyday I was able to learn something new. My co-workers were all very productive.
good,helpful co workers with a great and positive work attitude always very helpful to others will never let a fellow associate fail always there to support one another
good,"I work very hard to meet sales goals, while multi tasking and keeping my customers happy.  I have also gotten very familiar with computers and payment systems"
good,Working at Staples has taught me everything so far of what to expect of the retail sector. It's a friendly environment which allows daily interaction with regular customers.
good,"Staples is a big company, I think the compensation should be better because it's such a large organization. Busy as customer service rep. customers are mostly angry and that's the hard part. systems and web applications can be better designed, they fail often"
good,"Everyone always has a good day no arguments or problems."
good,team atmosphere in tax department in which people work very well together. dealing with unreasonable auditors is the most difficult part of my job.  Most enjoyable is defending audits well saving the company a large amount of sales tax. Management is very supportive and give us the tools necessary to complete our work in a timely manner.
good,"Enjoyed working here. This organization gives us an opportunity to think like enterprenuer, behave like enterprenuer and take decision like enterprenuer ."
good,I enjoy working in the copy center at Staples. It makes me happy to print and help design items for different businesses or personal events. Management at staples however can be upgraded. I do find that management does not care for their employees as much as i would like. I wish management would be more hard driven to make the store the best it could be.
good,I am extremely dedicated to any position I've been placed in. I am constant willing to go the extra mile and learn as much about my current position and the next in order to be able to move forward to the next step.
good,This is a great place to get a feel for fixing computers and sales whats going on both sides on the company structure depending on who you're working with they will expose you to a lot.
good,"although it may be slow at times, there are many more times when you are busy serving multiple jobs at once, important to remember that some customer can be rude but it is up to you to work at a pace that does not create a long wait time as most customers need their printing/ binding done straight away. For a new associate working in the print centre there is a lot to learn but it must be done fairly quickly as customers will look to you to provide advice and direction."
good,"A typical day involves greeting customers, assisting them with any needs, and contributing to a team environment. This includes many tasks such as welcoming a customer with a warm smile as they enter the store, answering any questions they may have about any products or services, and putting through purchases, returned, and exchanges. "
good,"Daily routine was including opening and closing of  store. Counting the drawers as well as accounting.  Carrying Keys for locked management rooms.  Ensuring employees follow instruction, and sales numbers meant requirements."
good,"I liked working for staples, during back to school its a very demanding time. After back to school i was able to fix computers without to much difficulty"
good,Easy work place with mostly great managers. You sometimes feel like you are giving way to much work for how little you are paid.
good,"Downloading of route into PDA. Pre-check of truck and securing of loads. Delivery of product to businesses in the Greater Boston area."
good,"Staples is a good place to work."
good,"Company is a solid business with a great future.  The ""C"" level managers are great.  I recommend this company but the advancement is limited."
good,The culture is changing and it is no longer a fun place to work.  Demanding deadlines and stressful workload with fewer and fewer resources.
good,"During my time at Staples Disposables Ltd I have been given the great opportunity to grow within the company, beginning my career within a factory operatives role and with the help of supportive management and training, allowing me to grow and progress over the years, my role today is Chemical Team Leader and Health and Safety Representative."
good,Staples is a high intensity work environment. The associates and management are excellent to work with. I have had a number of promotions and opportunities while working at Staples. I have enjoyed working for the company and have learned a great deal.
good,"Staples was a good company to work for."
good,"Promoted to Certified Technician, was responsible for performing: diagnostic scans, virus removal, internal component installs & replacement keyboard / track pads for both Mac and PC. "
good,"Matrix driven, intense work enviroment. I've learn to deal with people from a financial view point. I'm a people oriented type of person, get along well with co-workers, self motivated, and determined. A person who knows, and undersrtands the importance of meeting a dealine, before the deadline has come."
good,Great place to work. They train very well and detailed to give you the tools to not fail. Many vendors hailed classes to teach on new product. Also had stock options for everyone. Cons were slow promotions and only yearly raises.
good,Working for staples has taught me the value of customer service.  This company based if prime directive on it.  Which is why the company is still around while many others have folded. This company is always thinking at least 5 to 10 years ahead in order to stay in business. Which is a great attibute any associate can use in there future endeavors whether it is moving up within the company ranks of if u choose to go on a different path. Staples has helped to shape me into the person I am today.
good,"The job was very rewarding that everyday was different with dealing with new and different situations and people. The hardest part of the job was that it was always changing, but that was always the most enjoyable part."
good,"I was a jack of all trades while working here. I was able to work all sections of the job. At this job, I learned that the harder you work the more the management is willing to work with you. My teams were amazing and always willing to back me up if I got behind in my work due to customers needing my assistance. In return, I would cover them the same. The hardest  part of this job would be Back to School time and Black Friday. Both of these times were stressful due to the high volume of customers in store. I loved the teamwork and comradery."
good,"I normally work from the time the store opens until we pack up for the day (10 hours a day on average). I handle the Copy & Print department alone unless it gets so backed up I have to call for extra help. This means I have to have my head wrapped around incoming orders whether they be via email, phone calls, walk ups, online submissions, and more. "
good,I worked for Staples for 5 years before being made redundant and I enjoyed the job. As an Associate the job can be a bit boring but if your willing to put in the work the number of skills you can learn from the managers is unbelievable.
good,My time at Staples taught me how to take pride in my work. I found great joy in helping customers with their projects. I will recommend Staples as a great company to start with as retail experience.
good,"I've gained an incredible skill set working with a talented, motivated and goal-oriented team. Every day brings new opportunities, challenges, and rewards. Being able to communicate with customers to provide them with exactly what they're looking for, and provide solutions and ideas they may not have considered."
good,The Staples I worked at was fast paced with a lot of consistent work coming in.  The work was busy all the time and included a lot of customer interactions.  The management knew how to maintain the facility nicely and kept everyone in motion to move towards a better workplace.  I enjoyed the customer interaction that came from the job.
good,"good place to work, friendly environment, need to be hard working and be able to juggle many things at once. You have to learn multiple different things and be able to work well with everyone else in the store."
good,"I've worked as both a regular Sales Associate on Front End and an EasyTech Associate for about a year now."
good,"Staples had an extremely adaptable attitude and made the best environment for me while I managed school. Having to make quick decisions and know that your team has your back is enlightening to say the least. I couldn't have done as well as I did in school without this company and it's team. They promote the individual's strengths the more motivation one shows the more room one has to wiggle. Though Staples may never be a permanent career for me, I cannot say that it couldn't be home to many individuals. I thank them for my stay these past 21 months."
good,"I'd come in at eight in the morning, and our team would meet on the floor and we would have a brief meeting and then start working. I learned how to audit orders that were going out, and I learned how to work a shrink wrapping machine. My boss was overall a nice guy, but he presumed too much. My co-workers were great. They were the reason why coming into work was so much fun. The hardest part of the job was finding out what happened to missing kits and fixing the orders. The most enjoyable part of the job was coming in to work and being able to work so well with my co-workers."
good,"Working with the Austell team has been a great opportunity to improve both personally and professionally. I have had the pleasure of working with some great people over the years and have learned so much. Special thanks to our FCM for making a ""great place to work."""
good,"Helping Customers"
good,Staples has wonderful benefits. It is not hard at all to move up with management. There are many scholarships that are accessible to employees.
good,"Its a really great place to work for as long as your doing your job well and right, a typical day is 7am to 330 pm, but that could go longer, the most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and driving all over Colorado."
good,"The management I experienced was very kind and willing to work around any scheduling issues that may arise. There is always the option to call in and have shifts covered if something is constricting you from working at that time."
good,"Overall Staples is a decent place to work. Management at my store is very good, but advancement opportunities not so much. Once you reach a certain position all you can do is wait for someone to be promoted or fired. Full time positions are few, and it seems Easy techs are the only part time employees that make a decent wage."
good,"Staples was my first retail job and I learned what it takes to be successful in retail.  At Staples, customer service is paramount, for you may only have one opportunity to make a positive impression so that the company is the one that they will return to for future needs. "
good,"Staples was a good place to work when I started in 1999 up to 2005 when policies changed when it came to bonuses, again its all about the customers and the stock holders never about the little people that works for the company who always get the short end of the stick but the most work to do. The most enjoyable part of working at staples was meeting different people and getting to no their own struggles when you think you're worst off its always someone with a story you cant believe."
good,"Contracted Recruiter/TA Specialist for Staples and responsible for sourcing candidates, prescreening via phone and forwarding information to hiring managers, follow ups and presenting offers and the processes that are required from the beginning to the end of the recruitment. "
good,"Overall Good company to work for, lots of perks, does best a big business can to take care of employees and benefits when possible."
good,working at staples was a fun adn enjoyable place to work! you can learn alot of stuff and help out others that needed to be helped.
good,I enjoy working at Staples Advantage. The company creates a great atmosphere for its workers and offers opportunity for advancement.
good,"Staples taught me a lot, including better sales and customer service techniques.  Overall management was always very helpful. Although I have had previous supervisory roles before, staples taught me a lot about more productive way to coach other associates to get the highest level of productivity out of them.  I was a supervisory primarily focused on sales and customer service, which allowed me in interact with customers on a daily basis, usually in a problem solving scenario but also trying to maximize sales for the company."
good,"Busy and fun  environment in every day basis. You meet/connect with various customers with individual differences. "
good,"Cashiering and customer service, computer, and printing jobs throughout the day. Also getting locked up items from back room or safe for customers. I learned a lot about printing and copying and also printers, scanners and computers. Management was great at least it seemed that way at the specific store I worked at. Hardest part of the job was finding someone with a key to unlock certain products or get into the safe. Most enjoyable part was my boss she was always so sweet and understanding and truly did her best to make everyone happy."
good,"Busy fast paced work environment. Great staff as well as management. The most enjoyable part of being in the Copy and Print Center is the ability to create a product for the customer, as well as give them exactly what they wanted while staying cost affective."
good,"Generally it was a fun place to work, friendly colleagues and managers and a good variety of products."
good,"I typically worked Monday thru Friday, with weekly inventory duties including Zero Balance Walk that needed to be researched (Monday-Wednesday-Fridays), with a daily cycle count inventory process. Had constant communication with my General Manger with any issues or concern that needed attention. Working, I learned how to mange daily process in finishing on time. I enjoy working with a close net of individual, working as a team."
good,Manage the computer department in sales and keep a well clean area to work in my co-workers were like family it was fun at work most of the time. The hardest part of my job was dealing with upset customers and not having enough workers to handle the customer flow. Most enjoyable part of my job was making customers happy and fixing there computers and teaching customers new things.
good,"Staples is a fun and exciting place to work at. A typical day at work is helping customer with their printing needs. Using various different machines such as photocopiers, fax machines, laminators, engineering printers. Helping customers print documents from various computer programs such as adobe, publisher, Microsoft word, and exel. Having fun with co workers and management while providing great service for customers. Balancing multiple customers at one time during peak hours and multitasking with many orders. I have learned a lot about balancing many tasks at one time while working alone, and being able to handle these stressful times. The hardest part of my job would be dealing with many copiers jamming throughout my shift, helping customers with self serve copiers, and juggling multiple tasks at once. I enjoy working with my associates and meeting many great people throughout my shift."
good,"Key Holder position to lead a technical  business machine Department and establish training programs for sales representatives. Analyze sales statistics gathered by staff to determine sales potential requirements. "
good,"Working with electronics has always been enjoyable to me, so my work always went great. The management could have been a lot better in my eyes, other then the management there was not too many things I saw to be difficult at the job."
good,you're on your own and can do your own thing but don't be afraid to ask for help because someone will always come to assist you. you are free to be independent while safe knowing there's always help there for you.
good,"no room to adavance, nice managers and not many raises. steady hours. Also there are some nice regulars that come to shop there."
good,"Great management team, always room for advancement...good benefits"
good,"come into work in the morning review the previous sales for the day before also track down how close to their goal our employees were in terms of service plans sold. After that meet with my general manager and discuss the days activities and what the expectations would be for the employees. hardest part of the day would be on busy days where we were under staffed and sometimes weren't able to meet customers expectations, but also the more enjoyable part was building a rapport with many customers who often stopped by just to say hello even drop off lunch for us."
good,"With the change in the buying environment, there are many challenges for the future of Brick and Mortar stores. Staples was a power house leading in supplies for your home and office as well as being one of the largest seller of computing and associated accessories. The downside is that currently both of these categories are on the decline for demand, which has forced a change in the company's strategy. With this decline the company has been forced to close stores and limit it's growth. At this time the company is focused on growing it's on line sales and introducing new product lines into the store's offering. Although there are job offerings at times in various locations, continued growth is limited and the long term future is unsettled at best."
good,I enjoyed working for Staples. I left the company due to lack of growth and poor management.
good,great place to work but poor management. enjoyed working with my co workers. hardest part of the job is dealing with management.
good,"I was part of a great team of drivers. We all worked together to accomplish the tasks of providing great customer service and ensuring  deliveries were accomplished in a timely manner. My boss was very instrumental in providing instruction in all aspects of this driving job, which made the day to day operations very manageable. While preparations were being made to complete the daily deliveries, safety was always adhered to, so that there were no complications in performing any assigned tasks."
good,I feel as though I learned a lot at this company and the people were great.
good,we mainly did a 8 hour day but have done some 10 to 12 hour days as well.worked well with most of my co workers. hardest part of my job was having to say good-bye to my co workers when I moved away. Most enjoyable part was working with my friends and learning how to use the new pack size machine which  made the right size boxes for the right size product to fit into without a whole lot of extra space.
good,very fast place not that fun friendly place to work n long hours u just get board doing the same thing over and over again
good,"If you are used to working in a high-stress environment, the Copy & Print Center at a busy Staples is the ideal place for it. During the 2+ years I worked for Staples I saw too many associates come and go, because they were not prepared for the work load. Product knowledge is essential, and an ability to work quickly on a computer and with specific computer programs is a necessity. It can be hard for someone who isn't experienced to manage everything. I really enjoyed this job because my skills were put to the test on a regular basis, and I was always learning something new and useful."
good,Staples helped me with my customer service and it was a great experience learning about the products.
good,"Two positive things stand out about Staples:  1) They offer (limited) insurance for part-timers, whioh is how I started out. and 2) As a supervisor/manager-on-duty, I was given an amazing range of leeway in making things right for the customer."
good,I enjoyed working there. There was always some kind of sale display changes to update. I also enjoyed the team I worked with.
good,"Staples to me is a beginner job. I started working here to gain some experience. It is a fun place to work around electronics, you learn about the merchandise, how to stock. I would suggest this job to a younger teen."
good,"All in all I like working at Staples, on occassion I do get the not so friendly customers but that comes with the territory and the way I deal with them is to smile and be polite. I've never worked in retail before this and I have to say it has opened my eyes to a whole different world when your behind the counter, I have a lot more respect for people who are in Customer Service. Most days I do get the really friendly customers and that is what makes my day. My management team is awesome, and same with my co-workers, they are all easy to get along with. My typical day consists of ringing people out with their purchases, greeting customers as they come in and out of the store, making sure the front desk and the registers are clean and organized, answering phone calls, and directing people to where the products are if they have questions."
good,"A lot of hours on your feet, but enjoyable. Team work. Cash handling, customer service and copy centre work was part of the fun"
good,my co-workers make my day more enjoyable and working with customers and having them leave with a smile on their face is what I strive to do.
good,"you must be patient, as some customers will try and test you.  With a strong staff around you the job is a lot of fun.  However there is also intense pressure to sell that must be met."
good,"My typical Wednesday night shift at staples is sorting out the delivery that comes in that day/afternoon/evening depending on the delivery times. This consists of unloading the delivery onto the shop floor and filling them into the correct places."
good,I truly enjoy working at Staples. Their focus is empowering their employees. They also facilitate a culture in which they encourage the goal of continual improvement and they are very service driven.
good,"good place to work, big company, plenty of co workers, choice of 8, 10, and 12 hour shifts, 2-2-3 schedule for 12 hour workers"
good,Tough to meet sales quotas. Find lots of new leads. They expect youto go on 8 first appointments per week and sign up 2 new accounts per week.
good,I love working with a variety of different customers and even received a letter of recognition in resolving a claim to a customers needs.
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job is being apart of a tight knit management team and having a direct relationship with the business and the customers. A lot was learned during my tenure here and had the ability to teach and grow others. I gave 110% all the time and as any company sometimes I felt like it was being overlooked. Corporate does have a slight disconnect as whats going on in the stores relying heavily on sales metrics while operationally stores and company standards fall. Some communication should be prioritized and sent to management in a professional and timely fashion along with the consistency of programs, operational activities, employee recognition and etc. Overall if you arent prepared to overlook some details, stay focused and put in your all in your stores you can come out on top. Management and associates depending on the culture of stores give 110% .Once was a very people oriented brand. Slowly losing that charisma"
good,"Everyone was friendly and helpful. It is fun helping customers while also tasking on the sales floor by handling damaged goods, building planograms, and selling computers and technology."
good,Staples is a fun company to work for. It is a very fast paced work environment.
good,I worked very hard in all departments.  I was crosstrained in every available department.
good,"Most of the people there were very friendly and great to work with, always had a good attitude with things and i enjoyed the experience."
good,"Staples does provide training, especially for Tech and Printer, but be warn, if you want to become Easy Tech Associate, you must pass A+ Certificate Test."
good,Have to do weekly one on one with all Easytech associates and copy center associates. Maintain a tracking system for the warranties and tech work sold as well as setting the weekly goals in order to obtain a company standard of 7% in sales on warranties. Handles all escalated customer issues. Sets a quarterly budget using tools provided for tech work needed.
good,"Working at Staples was a hardworking, but unappreciated experience.  I showed up every day 15 minutes early and acted in a business manor.  I would punch in, help a few customers find products, then check on how the store did yesterday and the hours before I arrived.  Sales wasn't my task but I knew it would help the overall store so I strived to sell a cell phone as frequently as possible and at least a protection plan or too; while my mian job was to coach cashiers in selling Staples rewards and other benefits.  Then the load would come in from the warehouse.  I knew we were understaffed, so I would help take in the truck, break it down, and put in on the floor.  Eventually verify the deposit from the day before, help the copy center, sell a few more protection plans, and call it a good day.  Even though you are underpaid and work like an animal, you are happy because you proved to yourself that you can do it day after day."
good,"Sell, process and complete all customer copy orders."
good,Simply not enough pay. Type of work is fun and always changing. Lots of advancement opportunity. Open to new ideas.
good,"A typical day at work starts the night before, I help my Trans Analyst plan the routing of the next day making sure my drivers are set up to make their goal for the day. I have a 3rd shift lead that checks in with me informing me of the load status we have a goal to get drivers  loaded and dispatched by 8:00am the next morning. Once the drivers get to work we have a morning huddle, go over any issues that I may foresee for that day we stretch and hit the road, the driver then will check in with me and my assistant throughout the day reporting any issues. Meanwhile I am working to get customer issues resolved, looking over expenses, paying bills, monitoring driver performance and meeting with those drivers that did not meet goal. "
good,"I work in customer service at Staples. I enjoy the different kinds of customers we get, and I love being able to learn new things about the products we sell. We sell a lot of technology, and we offer services in our easy tech department to repair computers and such. I really want to learn more about technology and every once in a while i get to wander over to their department and they show me a few things. I love a work environment where I can learn about the product and be able to give customers a good understanding of what they're about to purchase, to make sure it's right for them."
good,Diverse work community that allows development of your career while simultaneously fostering relationships with co-workers.
good,"What I've learned from staples is very little then what I already knew but as it is said practice makes perfect. The most enjoyable part of this job for me was when the customer left happy with the purchase's be it a laptop's or service's or both. The day is long until you make it fun include the customer and enjoy it together as I always think of this phrase while working. As for a typical day at staples this would be when you walk in to the store and go to any terminal (i.e. any computer) and punched in for the day. from the terminal you would walk to the back and make sure you are presentable for the day with name badge and tucked in shirt while putting away anything unnecessary for the time being. When you go to the floor you should analyze the situation and determine whether you or your co-workers need to help any customers or see if they have already been helped. when you have time (i.e. no body in the store) you clean your department, restock, and always look for customers coming in. once the day is over you go back to get your things if any and then punch out for the day at any terminal."
good,"Depending on the sale or season it was very fast paced. I always kept a very organized and clean checkout area, I dealt with inventory, and overall maintenance of the store. There was always room for advancement and the staff was a blast to work with."
good,Its the typical sales job with the standard pressure to achieve quota each month.
good,A typical work day consist of repairing computers taking in new work orders supporting customers via the phone and setting up new computers.
good,"•Department Management"
good,"Management was excellent - results driven.  However pay lacked competition.  Employees were proud of their job and title, but lack of advancement hurt potential talent pool."
good,I enjoyed working with Staples. Working for such a big organization has allowed interact with different departments and learn alot more.Staples corperation has been both informative and allows room for growth.
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job was that it was never slow and the day went by quickly. Always had enough work to do."
good,"I received my first best employee award."
good,"staples was my first job after graduating High school I was really excited  about working there and I thank the management team who hired me for really giving me a chance with no experience , they were truly nice people, I loved all of my co-workers still keep in contact with a handful of them of them present day. The best part about working there was everyone was so nice if you came in having a rough day you left with a smile on your face , and their always something new to learn and do each day . I'll never forget working there."
good,Good Job very flexible with hours. Managers are ok. A typical is just to help customers and drive sales.
good,Good company to work for I learned how to do all aspects of printing and binding.
good,Staples was a nice place to work.  I enjoyed it.  That is all I prefer to say.

good,"Good, solid company with established standards of performance and corporate direction."
good,"Responsible for computer intake, maintaining, troubleshooting, and repairing."
good,"There really is no typical day working for Staples Advantage.  I have a vast customer base that spans the entire Continental US and covers every vertical from health care to auto sales/repair centers and everything in between.  Staples Advantage provides office solutions for all of the customer's business needs.  The lines of business that I sell include Facility & Breakroom supplies, Furniture, Technology, Print & Promo, Safety & First Aid, etc, and no customer's needs are exactly the same.  Over my 5+ years of employment with Staples I have developed the ability to sell beyond general office supplies by picking up cues from the customer, finding the correct decision maker(s), and asking the right questions.  My knowledge and aptitude for sales has allowed me to consistently exceed company mandated Goals & Objectives.  My talents have also contributed to me being selected and successfully completing the 2012/13 Staples Management Training Program.  I feel this speaks volumes to the management teams I have been fortunate to work with throughout my career, and to my fellow co-workers.  We have collectively developed a unified office culture that thrives on associate growth and healthy competition.  "
good,Working at Staples has really opened my eyes. I have managers that care about each employee and have really strived to give employees a chance to learn different skills within the workplace.
good,"I enjoyed working here. Its a nice part time job. They very flexbile with your other priorites (school, ect..). Its nothing to make a living off unless you work in managment, they get paid$$! lol But overall its like any hourly retail job, you work the register they have different promotional items they want you to sell each month and they push those. They give you a 30min break and two 15min depending on how long your there. It can be very hectic during the days or very slow just depends on the day. Managament was okay just like any other managment team they can be ""sugar sweet"" when they want to and turn very moody other times. But you just learn to smile, walk away, and leave them be. Fellow co-workers were fun and nice working enviroment."
good,sales associate at staples.  the job environment is great i was young when i worked there but it was great exposure to the retail world.
good,"Great company, all about teamwork. Hours were good, and schedule was flexible. Co workers were great, including other managers from other stores.

good,"Typical work day: Calling on key National Accounts.  Working with additional Lines of Business Associates. Ride with days with vendors. Learned a plethora amount of successful B2B sales, account management and strategic selling with in assigned book of business. Management is receptive to fostering out of the box thinking to penetrate accounts with additional lines of business.  Co-workers are some of the best associates I have ever worked with.  Team players with a can-do approach. Hardest part of the job; contract renewals. The most enjoyable part of the job are the many professional procurement managers and buyers I sold to, while profitably growing my account base."
good,"I have learned to sell items quite well. The management at the California Staples are awesome. My co-workers there do there job and know what they're doing. The hardest part about the job is really everything that you do for so little pay, that's the thing that really gets everybody except for the managers."
good,"A typical day at work Involves helping customers with there personal or busniess supply needs, I also do alot of the computer troubleshooting and repair work that comes in from customers who are having computer issues.

good,"This job trains their employees well before they start working on the job. I got so much training and coaching to be successful at staples. The hardest part of the job is exceeding sales metrics in the economic condition the world is in now. The co-workers are always fun to work with and that was what made the job fun. There were constant corporate visits in the stores but if you were running your store right, then there wasn't a problem."
good,"I would open the store with about and for the first couple of hours put stock up clean each aisle and start and complete plannograms for different parts of the store. After lunch i would help the furniture associate with moving heavy boxes like desks and chairs around for display and help customers for the rest of the day. I was also a backup reciever and was trained on the forklift. Managment was great they always got me what i needed for the store as soon as they could. My co-workers were a lot of fun to work with we always made eachother laugh and i never had a problem with any of them, The hardest part of the job was having to deal with the odd customer who came in a bad mood and would be rude but i always helped them out hand had them leaving happy. The best part of the job would just be making people happy when they come into the store with no clue what there looking for and you help them find exactly what they needed and they left happy."

good,"I would normally have customers waiting at the door every morning needing contracts, pictures, or business forms printed as soon as possible,"
good,"If you a person that like to multitask, this is the job for you. I learned so many graphic design trip working with the computers and printers. Management is easy as long as your working the Staples guidelines. The store is all team effort, a team that works together succeed together. The hardest part of the job is when a machine breaks down and you have an order due in about 10 mins. I hate to lose money. The greatest part is when the customer is ecstatic about the project we produce for them."
good,"i really enjoyed my time there, i loved the fast pace of picking /pcking even though the hours could be very long, when we moved from sydney city to outer west sydney wanted to do something different and went into receiving office really enjoyed that, loved problem solving and i worked with a great team of people. when redundancies were offered in january this year i decided to take it as i wanted to return to new zealand to retire."

good,Really enjoyable place to work but management can be very bias and the treatment form manager to manager can be extremely different.
good,not a very busy store so it wasnt very exciting. coworkers were great. had great managers.
good,"In store training has been thorough, from dealing with customer queries/complaints to working on the till. Managers are professional and listen to staff feedback at quarterly meetings. Co-workers are friendly and helpful. Working as a team and learning new skills, i.e. health and safety and customer service, has been useful and builds up confidence in dealing with the public."
good,"The day would start off with cleaning my tech area, doing a check list to make sure all alarms were on and working. Making sure all inventory is put away neat and overstock put in its proper place. Enjoyed working with people being about to sale. Hardest part of the job was no hours and a very long drive for less money and less hours"
good,"Mistakes are not looked upon lightly at the Jacksonville location. Management is very well rounded. I enjoyed my time at Staples very much but it is not a great place to spend a lot of time. If another opportunity arises, take it."
good,"A typical day at is spent interacting and helping customers with a variety of different needs from printing to the purchase of technology, I have become a specialist in the printing department which provides services from basic copying up to canvas printing, i am a member of the management team and am on hand to help with opening/close of the store, banking and customer queries/complaints/orders, the hardest part of the job is being able to be in several places at once but prioritising your time means all areas are dealt with efficiently and quickly, the most enjoyable part of the job is being able to interact with the customers and having them leave knowing they have been given a good customer experience."
good,"On a typical day at work I find myself in a semi-pleasant work place with great co-workers. The management can only be faulted as far as their superiors, I find the executive level of the company to be as most corporations focused on money and the bottom line and not enough of true customer satisfaction. We have turned customers aways due to the over pricing on many occasions."
good,"good company, good benefits with chance of advancement. difficult elderly clientele."
good,"For an entry level sales position, I don't know that you can ask for much more. The job isn't hard, but at the end of the day it might not seem too fulfilling. You are mostly selling office supplies and facilities supplies (cleaning and breakroom) though they do offer other solutions like IT, Office Furniture, ect. Overall, if this is your first field sales position I'd rate it a 3.5 or so, but if you are experienced, it may not be fore you."
good,I loved my stay at staples.
good,"Great place to work! Flexible with the hours. Generally Management was easy to get along with, staff we fun and entertaining. Never a dull moment."
good,They keep you around if they like you and allow you to grow.They understand your work schedule and they are everywhere so you will always have a job.
good,A typical day at work involves making sure the customers are happy and are able to find what they are looking for.
good,"Working for Staples was a lot of fun. I learned how to transform my experience as a 'retail grunt' to an actual team member. We were taught how to work as a whole family and how to reach out if we needed help. Sometimes things would get crazy, since we did not have a lot of employees, but that enabled us to learn multiple departments and cross train."
good,Amazing enviroment to work in. Grate people with a positive attitude and lots of energy. the pay however could have been better but the position it self was grate form hours during school.
good,I enjoy working at Staples. I just wish that they had more hours to give. Working part time and trying to support a family is not working and it's not going to get any better.
good,"This was my first retail job position. A typical day at work I would balance time spent cashiering, operating cutstomer service desk, and stocking shelves. The company allowed me to learn about different products in different departments in order to better serve the customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers get quality products. The hardest part of the job was politely handling customers that were angry about their returns."
good,the people are great but i feel as if they can be alot better with customer survice.
good,"Provide high quality customer service by greeting others and by probing them on what their needs are or what brings them into the store. Other details about being on the job are maintaining a clean sales floor, developing interpersonal relationships with clients, and creating a market-basket for customers. The hardest part and the most enjoyable part about work was being on the competitive sales floor with the co-workers."
good,"My co-workers were amazing. Everyone got along and we helped each other out whenever we could. The work was a little bit hard, but it was easy to hit production. But once we moved to a new building ,the demands on us got a little bit harder and I could not keep up."
good,"If you are into sales, and commission or interested in sales of office equipment and supplies I can't think of a better place to work. Depending on the location it can get very busy. I did not like how hot it would get in our store due to the fact the climate controls were controlled by corporate. But a pretty good job and competitive pay and you do get commission incentives."
good,- Out of stock walk
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job would be meeting different types of personalities. Every customer was interesting in there own way, glad to say they were the best thing about the job."
good,Job was fun when it came to co-workers and regulars. was promoted with in 6 months. Hard work for the most part was noticed and acknowledged.
good,"Usually, it is busy environment at Copy and Print Center. Customers bring their problems about the print order which is sometimes really challenging. But I am always ready to help them and bring easy solutions which is actually exciting part of my job. I do my best to manage time-line because it is always very important to return finished order on time with the best quality.When we work as team brings positiveness in my attitude. Working with different print machine, different design layouts and meeting many different people are the most enjoyable part of my job because everyday something new to learn. I lke that we have good team and manager supports to win the costumers' order."
good,I really like the company and the management as a whole and left due to personal reason.
good,a typical day at work would be kind of slow in the morning but by noon it would start to pick up
good,"Company puts money back into building upgrades, updated performance time studies, expectations clear, 4 days a week possible, Good Associates"
good,"a typical day at work was as siting customers in finding the items they need, also doing the stock. We brought in the store stock off the truck by using handpicks, after that we stocked it on the shelves. I learned to be more organized and neat. Management was good along as we did i work in a timely manner. My coworkers were good friends, we were all around the same age so we had a lot in common. The hardest part of the job was working on the nightcrew. The most enjoyable part was my coworkers."
good,"The typical day at staples consists of restocking the shelves, pegs, and product displays; assisting customer with finding the right product to suit their needs, and making sure that the store is in ""grand opening"" condition every night before the shift's end. Though I was a supervisor working for Dr. jays; working for staples definitely helped improve my leadership skills with training, assisting and instructing my fellow co-workers on the ins and outs of the department being the seasoned employee. Management was very helpful, always informative, and tried to motivate employees as much as possible. The hardest part of the job was sometimes passing up on possible promotions for the good of the department. The most enjoyable part of the job had to have been dealing with pleasant customers and co-workers"
good,"As an Easy Tech associate, I was responsible for selling technology products, including but not limited to desktop and laptop computers, printers, cameras, hard drives, and networking accessories. Through this sales position, I learned selling techniques associated attachment selling and encouraging the purchase of extended warranties. I was also responsible for basic repair and diagnostic services of computers brought in by customers. Basic repairs included taking apart computers, replacing internal components including video and sound cards, RAM, cooling fans, and CD-ROM drives. I also performed basic configuration and troubleshooting, including the initial start-up and setup of a new computer and troubleshooting of both network settings and the windows operating system."
good,"Is an agency that can utilize my experiences, knowledge and education."
good,The thing I did not like about working at Staples was that they push you to sell products and services you may not believe in. I believe they care more about their bottom line than the happiness of their customers.
good,I worked for the Staples in Maryland. I love it. I t was a awesome place to work.
good,I've learned a lot at Staples and have enjoyed the job. I've gotten my technical knowledge and sales skills back up to the level where I want them.
good,Good place for part time work if wanting flexible hours and working weekends.
good,*Good start pay
good,"I enjoyed being able to use my skills in ASL to not only teach others about selling products but to help Deaf customers find what they need or do something in the Print and Marketing Center. I enjoyed being busy and always being able to find something to do. I enjoyed the encouragement that management provided to boost our morale in selling and doing better. The team built a good family bond together. However, the hardest part of the job is in fact convincing a customer to get a product. I only wish they paid more."
good,"Punch in start of shift,  exercise before work begins, go on a work ticket. Do your job which varies every day. My job can include but not limited to cleaning, look up product, UPS Rush Orders, Customer Service, cover lead personnel, train incoming temps, selecting by headset or by regular picks. Restocking when help is needed, Maintain inventory of supplies, Be certified to drive equipment."
good,"It's slowing moving at times and then super busy the next. It's important to be collaborative with other associates, know who is working with you because each associate in relies on the other. It's also important to be able to multitask at times since sometimes you can get cornered up by many customers at once (as a cashier). For, example, you will have an online order and at the same time, there would be a customer you have to cash out. So, while waiting for the manager to get the online order you can cash the customer out. I think that one of the most enjoyable parts about it is that all the associates are friendly, easy-going and relaxed so t makes the job more fun."
good,"Working at staples wasn't a terrible time for me. In fact I'd say I would apply still if I could go back in time. I was a tech associate, but really I did everything plus tech related sales and repairs. I'd recommend either knowing a fair bit about computers, printers, set up services and other things before applying. My team was supportive and helped me learn a few new skills, but I also felt like I was left on my own at times."
good,A big brand that is underrated and able to help people with their office supplies and local business needs with the most friendly and flexible customer service
good,"The work is not for the weak! Logistic skills needed, customer service and effciency is required. The Hub I work out of the average employee has been at for 10+ years, that says ALOT!"
good,"⦁	Increased Extended Service Plans sales by 400%. Exceeded goals for rate of attachment, Dollars Per Transaction, and own brand sales. In each location I have worked at, I have brought noticeable improvement in many areas, including Sales, Morale, work ethics and overall store performance."
good,quick pace great learning experiences and great benefits such as 401k dental vision and health that can be used for the family not only you staff discounts great coworkers and management that will talk to you one on one for any accommodations that you need.
good,A great job with friendly staff and management. Hours are very flexible and are accustomed to personal matters outside of work. Most enjoyable part of the job was the friendly environment.
good,"It was a job, it definitely could pay better . "
good,"Copy Center was very busy."
good,"The people were wonderful to work with, and the company was a fun place before going private. Management was always changing directions, and had some long term in-sites that were unattainable many times."
good,"- Work day is about 4 to 6 hours for non management"
good,"I was managing three departments so there was a lot to learn and I was lucky I had good training but it was rushed. I loved the staff but they were all fed up with all the work they had to do. I had so much to do in my role that I had a tough time helping them. I enjoyed helping customers and luckily, they have a good attitude toward keeping customers happy. I hated standing at the front while on manager-on-duty shift as I couldn't do my work or help staff...only direct customers."
good,"I learned alot of valuable skills while working for Staples. I really enjoyed the people I worked with and valued my manager's leadership. Pay was not so great and hours were 11am-8pm, so had to find something else."
good,"You have to be personable, great people sell service and know your mdse, bored find something to do, treat the store as if you owned it ,respect your management team ask for things to do learn other depts room for advancement"
good,"Staples can be demanding, I am in the tech department and the pressure for sales and maintaining operations with a small group of people can be overwhelming. They have a serious issue with a high turnover rate in my department because the sales manager puts a lot of pressure on them to get protection plans. If you are good at sales and in school this is a good job, if you are not good at sales and not willing to learn do not work in the tech department."
good,Staples a good place if you are looking for a first job the the people there are always friendly and understanding and there is sometimes competition between everyone to keep you on your toes.
good,"Phenomenal leadership, not the greatest compensation. Very healthy culture that gives employees the ability to seek the help they need to succeed. "
good,Great work life balance for the past 18 years of my employment. Looking forward to watching Staples transformation over the next few years. Change is exciting.
good,"Productive and fun, a lot of fun employee appreciation days. At times appears very siloed, groups tend not to talk and communicate with one another so certain times information is lacking"
good,"Good work atmosphere, good coworkers. Have gained a lot of solid work experience through the years. Have been able to move to different management roles."
good,I have worked there for more than 4 years and so far no issues.  My coworkers are nice and friendly customers can sometimes get on your nerves but like they say the customer is always right.
good,"Working at Staples wasn't the worst job I could've asked for, but it was far from the best as well. Perfectly average. Despite what people elsewhere may say, management at our store was great. Super friendly and willing to help out rather than hide in an office. Always providing support and willing to work with associates with things like unexpected time off or schedule changes."
good,"I learned a lot from staples. It comes in professional category."
good,Delivery was a good side of staples management is helpful and understanding best part is being solo in the truck just get your job done and go home always moving so day goes by fast
good,"None.  I have no real comments about my time at my current employer.  It is a fine job, but it has become stagnant with no future advancement opportunities."
good,"I would arrive and start at the cash register or start on the floor, depending where they wanted me for the day or for a few hours. I wore many hats in the store except managerial hats. The people were nice and I had enjoyed their company except for one manager that didn't like me too well. He couldn't fire me, so he found ways to coerce me to quit. He never took my advice, always thought he was better than me, and made me feel like an idiot in front of other customers. I have had customers come back to me explaining how rude my GM was. If I wanted to work for Staples again, it's not hard to pickup where I left off. Given the fact that I have not been working there for almost three years, the jobs were too easy, but stressful and time consuming if you were the multi-hat guy like me."
good,"I've always liked Staples. However, I had to leave the site I was working. Simply because I refused to work with high school students or people who have little respect towards our U S Military. Some of the girls who works at the store were not very career proficient, very unprofessional at all. When I report the problems to the supervisor or manager, they seems to careless. On top of that, I was taking on another position at different company."
good,"Everyone is very nice and doesn't have any problem with helping new workers in learning about what to do. Is very fast pace at certain times, but is mainly slow and customers are relatively nice."
good,The management at staples is impeccable. They really care about the whole person and are willing to work and compensate their staff. Their investment and training qualities drives results.
good,"This was where I learned the ins and outs of sales. Management was relatable. The culture is what you'd expect for an office supply store. The hardest part of the job was lifting xerox printers to the Shelves."
good,"Customer service is a daily toss up. You never know if you're going to have a nice slow day where you can take your time, or if you're going to be rushed through every thing you have to do, and then some. Coworkers made the customers worth it."
good,"Working in the Copy and Print department is hard at first, but once you get the hang of it, it is pretty easy. I honestly enjoyed this job for being college. I wouldn't want to continue this job after I'm done with college, because you aren't going to be paid enough to live on your own. You'll have to live with other people."
good,"It seems like working at Staples is a VERY mixed bag. For me as an Easy Tech Associate, fixing computers, selling tech and adding on additional services and warranties was relatively simple and consistent. Then again, Staples in other areas might be in areas where selling 'extras' is more difficult (be it due to low income households, businesses that won't allow their employees to purchase warranties, or people too stingy to bother purchasing them.) Not to mention being a cashier can be much less stressful and busy as someone being in the Print and Marketing department (Copy and Print) where the constant line of impatient, needy customers is almost a constant at all hours of the day."
good,"Now it's slash, burn and outsource and sell off as much as they can until eventually going public again with what's left while Sycamore pockets several hundred million."
good,I found management at staples to be inclusive and other staff to be engaging. Even though I was only seasonal the management seemed to take an interest in me and my other co-workers.
good,I worked in the print and production center of my Staples which was the most hectic part of the store and also held the most responsibility. Different locations will have busier production centers because it is in a business district while others may see community customers instead.
good,"A typical day of work is mainly stocking new inventory or moving inventory that has been put away on the shelves when there is room. Then cashiering occasionally and cleaning the back on a regular basis, while also maintaining a salesperson job when dealing with chairs and technology. Management is good but the general manager could definitely plan more accordingly with her decisions and didn't really tell me the truth about the amount of hours I would be getting but even still she is not a bad manager. The workplace overall, is very good it's like a little family and the hardest part about the job is trying to not let certain customers get to you when they are mean or cranky. The most enjoyable is when you make a customers day or satisfy them overall."
good,Staples is great place to work at. Sales position require consistent contact with customers and up sell of products and services through solution based selling.
good,company doesn't know how to keep good quality employees with a face paced environment and paying minimum wage and majority of the employees are part-time.
good,Sycamore is slashing costs and outsourcing a lot of their employees.  Long term job security is questionable. Used to be a great place to work but the uncertainty of future direction and longevity of Staples makes for unhappy employees.
good,Job includes picking and selecting orders for staples stores and distribution centers.  The job includes restocking and accepting orders for shelfs and fulfillment centers.
good,"Staples is a place where if you have a good team, then silly sales goals or rude customers are nothing. The opposite can be said for a bad team, if management sits in the office all day and complains for better results in sales, get out of there. Annual ""pay raise"" is a joke a few cents at most. Moving up in the company is a possibility most likely you'll be moved around to other stores to accomplish this. Overall, I would recommend this as a starter in retail. Learn the basics and become a sales person."
good,I was in the office one day a week and 4 days on the road. we were looking for new business. we used current customer to help us fine new. we work over 40 hours a week
good,I personally enjoyed working in the Office Supplies department but if you're working with Computers and technology then you need to be a great seller.
good,"Most people are nice and friendly, there are some bad days where there are bad customers, but usually its pretty good. Most of the other employees are friendly and willing to help when asked."
good,Was a great place to work . The management was good . The company treated us right . Time off was right period of time when request. The management worked with the employee to help with scheduling.
good,"It can get very stressful working here, especially during holidays and back to school time, but the other employees are always around to help. Eveyone has always been very friendly and you will easily make good friendships."
good,"in the 8 years I was with staples I had 7 different DSM’s (direct sales managers) and 4 different RSD’s ( (regional sales directors) - The department is no longer in La Mirada, ca anymore.  However, I made great money with staples and learned a lot."
good,"Every work day involves several inventory tasks to keep the shelves stocked and looking good. Our interactions with customers are key to the job though, we make sure that everyone knows how to get to the item they are looking for."
good,very busy. learned the in and outs of the buisness. The work place was enjoyable. Hardest part was management never trained the employees properly. Enjoyable was giving customer service
good,Fast work paced environment with friendly staff. Can be a bit overwhelming. Perfect for students who would like to work part time. Will work with your class schedule.
good,Company is high on customer service. Work 45 to 55 hour work weeks. Company gives tools and training to help  reach goals. Manage mostly part timers that work 15 to 20 hours a week. Manage staff to maintain store stock and meet sales goals
good,"They we well to work with and the managers at the time were quite responsible. I got to move into the Tech repair side and be part time retail floor. The hardest part was dealing with people but if you can learn that, you can apply it anywhere."
good,"Enjoyed my experience working here. Though it was a temporary position, I always felt at home. The staff all worked together as a team. Department was very supportive."
good,"The people who worked at the Staples that I worked at twice were always very nice and cared a lot about what they were doing. For me a typical day at work was stalking shelves and helping customers find products. The only negative side of the job was the potential of being robbed by the vey aggressive gang that hits up the store that I worked at, lucky I never had to encounter them."
good,Being my first retail job I didn't know what to expect. The town I live in is small we all know each other. With that being said there's the crazy ones and the not so crazy customer I would get. It was a step up from my highschool Job in pay and work level. Management was a little rough around the edges but that's with a grain of salt since nothing can be perfect. I do not miss my time of coming in and having a customer yell at me for not having a computer in store when it's only advertised online. I do miss my coworkers and the friends I made while there
good,Constantly learning new things and machines. Learning  people’s ideas and making them reality is a lot of fun. Easily the busiest part of the store is print & marketing
good,not too stressful. helpful to know your way arround a computer and have expirence in retail. the online training is bs but the person to person training is verry helpful. overall good place to work
good,"A typical day at Staples would start out with helping and greeting customers that walk into the store. Then the next thing to do would be to check our OMS/Tech Services system for updates to our tech drives. After that, check the status of any orders taken in from the previous day and either call the customer to update them on the progress or call them for pickup. I've learned a great deal about sales and how to make sales more efficiently and make it about the customer. The hardest part of the job is usually towards the end of the work week on our freight day(stock) which is mostly printers and tech totes. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to help people with their technology problems and also hitting my sales goals."
good,"It was rewarding to work at Staples for two years. Definitely a wonderful part time job. Not a dog eat dog environment, but still a job that a person can push themselves to be a better employee."
good,"Staples was alright for the most part, the maintenance manager was fair and he was easy to get along with, always took suggestions well and was willing to help."
good,"I rather not leave a review "
good,"I ran 3 different machines at staple print solutions.  My main duty was to run the 4 color process webtron web press on a daily basis.  After a coworker quit I had to learn two other machines.  One was a kluge embossing and foiling stamp press, the other was a hiedelberg die cutting press.  i continued to bounce back and forth on these machines for some time until staples was bought out by Taylor Communications.  I was offered to continue my service when they moved the webtron web press to savage and I accepted."
good,"Staples was  great place to work, with many of great managers and opportunities for promotion and success in future endeavors. The work environment was very exquisite and maintained a mind set of customer satisfaction."
good,"I loved working for Staples. In my experience at least, I was treated like a responsible adult: the manager told us what needed to be done, and we were given the autonomy, resources, and information needed to see that it got done. It was a great work environment, I liked my coworkers, and there are plenty of opportunities for fulfilling experiences helping customers. Add to that the fact that the company has a great mission statement that it actually does a very good job of following, unlike several companies I have had experience with, and you've got a foundation for a potentially great career. My only issue is the relatively low hourly rate; you'll likely need a second job to make ends meet. Even so, Staples, in my experience, was a great place to work."
good,"A great workplace. Generally its pretty slow except at our busiest time which is school season which is fine since its different than normal days, a change of pace is fun."
good,I learned my management style at Staples.  Worked long hours but enjoyed the culture and atmosphere.  I look back fondly on my years at Staples. I would recommend the company.
good,Business interiors by Staples was a wonderful company to work for. Their pay structure was easily understood and they paid very well. The team mentality was a nice touch.
good,Overall not a bad company to work for however some updates can and should happen for example advancement and wage increase. Would suggest as a company to work for just with those suggestions.
good,Best job I ever had. Supervisors and leads were great to work for. It really felt like a family working here. I would definitely recommend anyone to work here.
good,"Motivated people in an international and business casual setting."
good,"Acquired skills /Accomplishments:"
good,A typical work day included restocking shelves and ensuring they were neat. I learned a lot about technology and learned some craftsmanship here. Management was very caring. The hardest part of the day was cleaning the restrooms. The most enjoyable part of the day was closing time.
good,You are to focus on Up-selling protection plans and charge cards. very fun and easy to grasp. If you can do one thing you can typically do it all. The management is very involved and helpful.
good,Its pays good but very fast paced you just have to pack the boxs in a neat manner while you are picking correctly and watching out for your co workers so that you dont bump or injure them with a cart.
good,"Overall, working for Staples wasn't too bad.  Sometimes the sales goals were impractical and often times didn't get achieved.   Corporate really hammers on the head manager for failing to meet certain goals and often times that stress gets taken out on the employees.   "
good,"Working at staples was fine. Good work environment, friendly staff. Unpacked items and placed on shelves. Leveled, organized store. On your feet all day long"
good,"-Get a chance to work with the different community."
good,"As a manager- on the go, directing associates daily to accomplish company tasks and deliver platinum services while driving and growing all sales categories."
good,Lots of Prospecting and Cold Calling.  You have autonomy to work from home but are preferred to come into the office.  Typical weeks consists of 8-12 customer facing meetings.  You are acknowledged and rewarded for your success.
good,"Staples has been a wonderful place to work right after college. I am continuously learning from Staples associates at all levels. The people are great hear, and so willing to help you learn and improve. And internal mobility is highly encouraged."
good,"Staples as a company is good to work for. Associates are great and most of the management team are fair. Unfortunately since it became a private company on October of last year, job security was lost and several great associates in management roles were laid off. Vital positions were eliminated, stock benefits were lost. The face of Staples as I knew it for several years changed a lot in a negative way."
good,There was a great working environment here.  The relationship between store level management and the employees was great.  Everyone was willing to help out so we could reach our goals.
good,J'ai apris pamal de chose en entreprise avec la polyvalence
good,"Copy & Print Department was pretty much autonomous of store "
good,"each department comes with a bit of different responsibilities so you have different things to do most shifts, definitely no risk for boredom! and you can find some things to do when its slow so its not a total snooze fest when slow. anyone can work in any department they want. you just get trained a bit in a few departments and whichever one you like the most can be your department as long as you are good at it."
good,"Excellent team, excellent rewards program. Flexible hours,  different areas to work at, working at the Copy Center can be fun but also stressful. Chance to learn about computers and software to work in designs for customers."
good,Call center environment.  There are opportunities to advance with in the call center and other Staples divisions.  Also the ability to work from home.  Must like change since your job changes quite quickly with new clients and internal system changes.
good,I loved working at staples. my co-workers were great and management was extremely helpful and kind. It was a fun atmosphere. I loved interacting with costumers.
good,This is a great starting job for teenagers and young adults to experience sales and some people skills. Co workers are always friendly and make the job less tedious. Customers will always keep you on your toes and you are always doing something
good,Easy hours and easy job. Not difficult to learn and grow. Not many benefits and managers are not very understanding. lacks staff at times but overall a good school job.
good,"Staples allowed me the ability to have fun and help many people with their computer, technology and printer needs, The management largely was great to work for."
good,"I have always loved working at Staples. They are very sales oriented company. Thanks to Staples I have learned how to sell using customer service. Here recently I feel the company is more focused on certain sales metrics than actual overall store performance. Despite the tough sales culture I have always enjoyed the environment at Staples Great management support, great customers, and great associates. If you are sales oriented and enjoy working with the public this would be a great company to work for."
good,I work for Staples. It has been a interesting journey. Even though there has been sime difficult times here I would recommend it to others. The salary is good and you are rewarded well if you work hard and do the job.
good,I had a great manager while working in the copy center. She was willing to take the time to train me to use all the machines as well as the additional functions on the register. My coworkers were fun and it made the time go quickly.
good,"I was unable to divorce my husband and afford an apartment, I worked very hard and dedicated myself completely to staples and had nothing to show for it."
good,computer programs were developed to help us run analysis based on various criteria to help with our responsibilities.  Often had vendors in to introduce new products and answer questions.
good,"My position is perfect for a supplemental retirement income. Pay is pretty good, and if you're willing to work hard,  you'll do fine.  You just have to ignore a lot of people who are lazy. Turnover is high, mainly because a lot of people find out they actually have to work, and that it's not a social occasion. Management will not bother you if you do your job without being led around by the hand. If you're lazy,  please don't come here !!"
good,Nice place to work. At times a typical day can be hectic but a hard working person can be able to get by each day. The pay is fair as compare to other companies
good,I'm currently working here and I have very few complaints. The management is nice and the fellow employees are also very nice and helpful. The hours are flexible and the breaks are fair.
good,"A typical day at work as a removalist offsider is hopping into the truck going to the first house/unit help load up the truck with furniture and unloading the trucks which takes abit of energy, heavy lifting and  you need to have good listening skills. "
good,"I worked as a cashier/customer service rep. I assisted customers with purchase decisions both in store and online. I ran the Point of Sale machine and placed online orders. It was a good position but paid little for the hours worked. The management switched, which changed the work environment and lessened the hours available."
good,"Selling print and marketing services is difficult with ANY company.  It was a little more challenging here, because the teams you're required to work with didn't communicate well and weren't willing to go the extra mile to ensure customer's satisfaction. This resulted in  declining sales and lay offs.  "

I believe they have a lot of programs and organizations that can allow you become more apart of the company and your community. They do quite a bit for you and offer good benefits, but I believe than can do even more and still be profitable to make things excellent!  Obviously the higher you move up, the better it gets, so keep that in consideration...."

I also had alot of freedom and gained a good amount of sales experience. After hitting my 2 year mark with the company i began to feel pigeon held in the position i was in. i didnt see myself moving to a management role, however a clear career path was not outlined."

good,Management offers great flexibility for a professional environment. Offers a remote option which is a great opportunity for those who are not willing to relocate.

good,I only worked part time with not a lot of opportunities to advance from their. It was a fun and easy going place to work for though. Management treated employees fair and with respect.
good,If you are an associate life is easy for you but if you work in the copy and print department or tech the pay is too low for that amount of work.The customers who come always rush their orders .
good,"Its alright, could pay Copy centre associates more for the work load they have opposed to a simple cashier."
good,As a temporary job this is a good place to work.  You get to meet a lot of people as your customers.  You get to expand your selling skills but sometimes are pressured to upsell additional items like cables and paper.  Get to stay in shape since you have to carry new items coming to the store.

good,"I worked with Staples for about 15 months , it is a great job. You meet different kinds of people on a daily basis , just being able to satisfy a customers needs is a great feeling . Only disadvantage is that all position's are part time except for management. Another disadvantage is it takes a very long time before you're given the opportunity to grow from a sales associate into management . Otherwise overall , i enjoyed my 15 months working with Staples."

The store was a very thriving and bound determine to go the extra mile for their customers!! I really working there.it kept me very busy. The big bosses came for vist they was also very impressive of all our work abilities!!"
good,A typical work day is fast paced. Lots of orders in the Print & Marketing department. The job is very stressful dealing with a ton of last minute clients as Staples endorses a sometimes unruly turn around time. Luckily my management team was incredibly supportive and helpful. The Print & Marketing department is not for the thin-skinned.
good,I learn a lot at staples. I work my way up from installer to lead in staller with a crew and became very proactive in helping customers. The best part about the job was seeing the finish work of installing all of the cubicles and office furniture.

Most of all fast paced company with good people."
good,Each day is honestly so different it could be busy with lots of orders to complete or it could be slow to the point where we push our efforts more towards the rest of the store. It is usually fast pace work environment and is great of detail oriented and multitasking people.

good,"About Staples Per Wiki:"
good,"I am fortunate that I work at one of the best stores in the district with management that expects nothing less than the best to keep the store on top. This isn't the same for all stores, unfortunately, but for the ones that bring their A game constantly, from the managers on down to the part-time people, it is a great place to be. I am proud of the store I work for, and that is not a complement lightly given 😊"
good,i worked in the copy and print center. I did a lot of different things throughout the day from coping to cashiering. I made posters and binded books for customers. I made many copies during the day.
good,Good place to work at as a part time associate but there have been lots of changes in the past few years that has caused some uncertainty for the future.
good,Teamwork is the key to having a successful retail store. A successful manager should always be willing to perform the same duties that he or she expects his or her co-workers to perform in order to create a positive workplace culture. I enjoyed coming to work everyday because I am a people person who love making every customer who visit Staples and other places I worked shopping enjoyable
good,"Until I was transferred to another division, it was the best work experience I've had in my career.  Management was smart, encouraging, and supportive.  I was middle management and loved every minute of it (until transferred).  My boss and my team were the most enjoyable part of being there."
good,"Decent Part-time job. Not much room for advancement however and they really only focus on protection plan sales which can get tedious. The people that work there are nice though, so a good work environment."
good,Staples was really flexible with their hours. I was still in school and they were understanding. The hardest part of the job was when you had customers and also had to pick up the phones.
good,"Staples was a good job. The worst thing about it is how terribly bored you will be at times. They do not get very busy, and every now and then you'll get a cranky customer, but other than that things are pretty simple. Management is nice and very understanding. Nothing to complain about, just really boring."
good,"The staff is what made the day, Customers can tend to be a little demanding when they bring there last minute project and expect it to be done in 15 minutes."
good,"Great company, learned a lot about management and my senior leadership really cared about my development and enjoyment of the job"
good,"Not actually a bad company to work for. Management is slow and some process's are a bit odd. Typical retail job. Enjoyable enough to work there for 5 years. "
good,"younger employees there can be dramatic,other than that the employees are nice.always a constant work flow and the trainers are amazing at their job!Set schedule,decent breaks,opportunity to move up to full time."
good,"Staples had an excellent corporate structure, tried to take care of employees. They had a partial plant layoff, otherwise I would still be there."
good,This place is very laid back and super friendly to customers along with each other. I wish this place was my full time job and not part time
good,Fun place to work at but It's below what I have to offer and nowhere to grow for someone who doesn't want to work 50 hours a week. If you actually wanted to grow you would have to stick to sales and work a whole lot of extra hours and honestly I would rather do something else that uses my abilities.
good,"In the 4-years I have had the pleasure of working for Staples, I have been afforded dynamic opportunities for learning and development. My leadership has been dedicated to my professional growth with the company and I have enjoyed the support from many internal teams that I have had the good fortune to collaborate with."
good,Staples is a good average job for any teenager looking for an easy going job and average pay. Hard to move up in the company without having full open availability which is hard for people who attend college
good,Day at work was very busy and long. I really didn't interact with management very often. But co-workers were friendly and easy to get along with.
good,"Working at Staples, I learned working in retail is different than people think. I experienced working from open to close, unrealistic expectations and meeting sales quotas. Typical day of work is walking in, clocking in on time, being greeted in a creative way by my managers, then checking in any computer set ups or repairs to begin my day. Previous friends from my high school worked here, so I had fun with my co-workers. The hardest part of the jobs would be repairing the computers fast and efficiently. Though I enjoyed my time selling and meeting the sales goals making me feel successful. At one point I was top salesman in the region for a certain product. Although Staples rewarded me with ""points"" to their employees through a rewards system, that only works if I put 8 years in the store."
good,Fast and there's always something to do. The customers really appreciate being assisted with different merchandise and suggestions. Learned something new about the company almost daily.
good,"I enjoyed my time with Staples.  Everyday was fairly busy, some days more than others, never overwhelming.  I was paid extremely well for the duties I performed.  I worked with a great crew, and always used them to motivate myself even more.  I also worked for an intelligent supervisor, who allowed us to do our jobs and only addressed when absolutely necessary.  The only, and I mean only negative was with upper management not using a routing software in an efficient manner, and not allowing some driver flexibility.  Getting to know the customers, some on a daily basis, more than offset any negatives. I would return to Staples if the opportunity were to present itself."
good,"Staples was  a good place to work,. We had CS rep relationship events twice a year for a week. We did monthly events by an engagement team, of which I was personally involved to  give reps, and management competitions, food contests, etc.  Management was Always very good to deal with. They were Always approachable, patient, helpful. with a smile."
good,"A typical day would to do a morning checklist, consisting of security of product on the floor. During this time I would also take the time to take a look around my department and identify problem areas, stock is low or missing, product not properly secured with security wraps etc.. "
good,"Love my coworkers love my customers the only thing is there isn't enough hours to make everyone happy, but if you work, you will see the hours guarantee, management does what's needed for store and does NOT control payroll. People should understand that"
good,"good co workers "
good,"jai aimer travailler a cet endroit ,mettre des boites sur un palette jeter les poubelles jai adorer travailler de soir"
good,"Just a good place to work and a good place to start your enjoyable work force, to learn as much as you can, and as fast as you can to move up the ranks quick."
good,"i learned on how to put items on where they go, to know where everything goes in the store, help other team members and help customers if they needed help"
good,"My time at staples has been great. The management, while often over extended due to shortage of employees, really worked to keep things positive. Congratulating employees on their work ethic, and working to advance those employees where they could was a daily occurrence. Overall, I found it a great place to work, even though the work itself is pretty mundane and typical of a retail position."
good,"Staples was a sales driven, customer oriented company that was my first job that I worked from age 17 to 19.  It was a good part time job to have while going to school."
good,"The teams of people in the trenches, at store level, are the best at what they do.  Most Associates are young, energetic, and eager to learn and make connections with regular customers.  This cordial/familiar atmosphere is what keeps regular and repeat customers coming back."
good,"Depending on what market you are in, it is a fast-paced environment. Like any other retail position, it can be difficult at times but I have met some great people and established lifetime friendships along the way. Overall, it's like a little family and that's part of the reason I've stayed so long."
good,"best place ive worked for in the retail field , i couldnt have asked for better .best management ive had all my life in all fields of the job ,"
good,The ASM restated all looked good...all he needed was the SM to get back to me in 2-3 days. Never happened. No call back. Maybe that was why the questions were more about generalities and not the usual close to in depth about the applicant.
good,A fast paced warehouse environment with very hectic deadlines and production goals. I have learned vast amounts on the warehouse logistics side of the business as well as production monitoring and control. Management was helpful and effective. My co-workers were very dedicated and goal oriented with attention to detail and quality. They were also a fun and diverse group of people that made it enjoyable to come to work every day. The hardest part of the job was trying to make deadlines with a very short supply of staffing and a lot of different deadlines taking place at one time. It made delegation and follow up essential. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to see the end result after all the hard work and planning that was done.
good,Very friendly employees and very decent management. Fun workplace to be in. Always doing work but never a dull moment. This is all I have to say to about Staples. Nothing else i could say about it.
good,Decent place to work assuming your team is competent and the job experience will vary based on locations much like any retail job.
good,There are fun good years and tough years but management is always looking to evolve with the changing economic culture. For those who look to take advantage of opportunities and advancement the support is there and HR is trying to be more proactive about advancement. Good people and many who have been with Staples for 10 and 20 plus years. Good focus on the importance of diversity and inclusion and access to senior leadership
good,"I have been working with Staples Advantage for over two years and I must say that this is a great company to work for. It is a great work environment, well trained instructors. They really help you to be able to get the most out of the job. The management is very open to newer suggestions and is keen on seeing their associates move up and advance in their career."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of me doing a lot of merchandising and putting clothing back where it would belong. I also tended to customers when they were in need of help. I also had a set goal to increase sales in JCP credit cards and online catalog orders. I learned how to use the register, answering phone calls, closing registers, money handling, merchandising and stocking, and how each department worked. My managers and co-workers, i never had a problem with. They were all helpful and all of us got along just fine. The hardest part of the job would have to be when all registers are full and people are in line, unhappy. The most enjoyable part of the job, was helping customers find what they are looking for and getting discounts on clothes."
good,"Great manager, supervisor, and associates! I loved my time here, very calm and relaxed and easy to get things done. Once you get to know the store things become so easy."
good,Lots of pieces to the job puzzle as an account manager or specialist. Only trained on a few pieces but held responsible for all of them.  Horrible follow through from management but pay is excellent for what we do.  Great hours and benefits are nice but double the cost from any other job.
good,Custer service is promoted. The team work is one of a family. I learned to work behind a cash register and how this demonstrates customer service as much as working on the floor.
good,"Co-workers are nice and understanding."
good,"During my time at Staples I have learned how to interact with all sorts of personalities. Also, I've reinforced my problem solving skills as their are many parts of the business world that conflict with one another. The easiest part of the job was learning the systems because of the well instructed training programs."
good,"A typical day consists of project management, and business development.  Paying close attention to detail is important at Staples and in the print industry, as there are many creative forms of marketing and specialty print involved.  The commercial print marketing industry is a relationship driven industry, trust and dependency is key when gaining new business and more detailed costly projects.  Management at Staples is great, there are many motivated individuals who have earned their titles by exhibiting their desire to see others succeed.  The most enjoyable part of this job was the amount of creativity and diversity of each project as my book of business included clientele in numerous industries."
good,Great place to learn and experience retail and better you're communication skills. Also teaches you about different technologies. Staples is a great place if you have a tech background.
good,"A very enjoyable company to work for. Store teams are always close and have a family feel to them. Hours can be unpredictable if not on a full time contract, and salary is pretty low for management positions."
good,"Staples is great company to work for if you have a good boss. Reasonable hours, good pay, and my coworkers where happy and great friends. However, upper management thought my store was't doing well and changed the management of the store. The new manager was a nightmare. It always felt like you where being watched and he was breathing down your neck about selling more every five minutes. I was an excellent associate who built up a loyal customer base, but his push almost made drive them away by selling them products they didn't want or need, and if you didn't sell enough he would dock your hours. He also almost got me a citation on purpose by sneaking me onto the schedule when I told him to take me off without informing me. Luckily I caught it and quit the same day. It was a shame as it was a great job for a long time."
good,"A work day would start out by checking if products were in correct aisles. Management was great I learned a lot through them from dealing with certain products for certain customers, working with co workers was what made my job enjoyable and fun. best part of the job was seeing a satisfied customer."
good,"I have successfully completed my Co-op at Staples Canada, Barrie as a supporting technician in Easy Tech department. My roles and responsibilities were to do full computer setup, configuration, maintenance, complete care, Data backup and migration, Data wipe as well as customer service. "
good,"Staples is a great place to work for work/life balance, upward mobility, and empowerment. Benefits could be better, and"
good,Working on sales and use tax audits and personal property tax audits daily. Learned how to interact with audtiors and our management team to close audits timely and reduce any sales tax exposure by providing necessary documents to satisfy audtitors requests. Coworkers worked cohesively as a team to assist each other in meeting deadlines. Hardest part of the job was trying to obtain sales information that reconciled to what was reported on our returns.  Systems are home grown and antiquated. Most enjoyable part of job was closing audits quickly and under reserve.
good,A typical day at work usually looks like a couple of cashiers on stand by to ring up costumers and managers rooming around the store helping costumers.
good,"Depending upon who you work with and where you're working, Staples can be a fun and exciting, fast-paced job. But, like other major retail jobs, it has it's slow periods of the year and can become very repetitive day after day. Definitely try getting cross-trained in different departments. That way you become much more trusted and engaging in all store activities and the days won't seem the same all the time. This can also open up the door to better opportunities and advancement especially if you have knowledge in more than one department."
good,"Good place to work, not much room for promotions or anything unless you wanna work there forever. Otherwise, they provide very flexible schedules for part timers and student, and pretty much anyone who needs a flexible schedule. The management varies from store to store, but mine was 1051 in Ellicott City at the Long Gate Shopping Center. There aren't many benefits, they do provide health insurance and all the basic stuff though. The pay is what you'd expect of a retail place. Overall was a good place for a first job, lots of customer experience to be gained, sales experience as well."

good,"Staples is  a good place to work through college or school, however their is little to no upward movement within the company itself"
good,"- Helped with customer inquiries"
good,"I can't say much about other stores, but the one in Stephenville, was AWESOME!! Still see one of my old managers every time I'm in town! They taught me so much about everything. Pay was OK work was easy and fun. Go work for them!"
good,"All in all, it's a great starter job for anyone who is lacking in work experience and needs a place to grow and develop some work ethic."
good,"Staples advantage is a challenging place to work with high call volumes, some including customer complaints. "
good,:Lots of opportunity to move within the company. Co-workers make the day enjoyable. Upper management has high expectations and too many ideas to drive sales.
good,"Needs more training for associate advancement especially those on technical dept. The top management should give full time associate a regular schedule and let others do cross-training to other department. Generally, new management is striving to do more fun activities for career growth and open to suggestions which is good."
good,A typical day day at work was steady. In my department I was soley responsible for the EDI errors and processing along in addition to working with a team of about 3 people for end of month force billing for hundreds of companies. Our management team was helpful if we had questions or needed guidance on an issue we would face.. The hardest part of the job was the thousands of emails we would get daily but it was also enjoyable to be able to stay busy and see what a great job we did getting our clients paid properly every month.

good,"The place was great to work in because employees were given many options to work in."
good,I enjoyed working for Staples during the time I was there. There were some issues and concerns that caused me to resign my position but I will not share that information as it is confidential information.
good,"I learned so much from working here. The management was good and very supportive. However, I was only considered part time even though I would often work full time hours."
good,I enjoyed working for Walmart.My reason for no longer working there was because I relocated.Walmart is fair within benefits and growing within the company opportunity was offered who showed the effort of giving a team player roal.
good,I would pick and pack orders.  Had the perfect part time schedule and the pay was great for a production worker.  Benefits are good as well.
good,"Staples was the most unique place for me to grow as a retail manager. Previously I had grown sales by formulating interesting and new displays or bringing in new items in order to drive sales. At Staples I had to learn how to sale technology and to do that I had to break it down and make it simple for not only my associates but my customers to understand, bring the ""WOW"" factor to life."
good,Staples is a process driven company that recognizes talent and will advance you very quickly. They create a family environment that encourages its employees to have pride in what they do.
good,"Good place to work, Manager was super hardworking and pushed all of us to be better. Most times they worked around our schedule. I must say it was a very good place to work. But again pay was below expectations."
good,"Company treats their employees fairly, with chances to move within the company. Days were pretty repetitive, but always a challenge."
good,I spent 13  years developing a clientele to support and turned a low performing store into a highly efficient self sufficient store with a low turnover rate and community approval
good,"delivering supplies to current customers in san bernardino and riverside county.  i have learned how to multi task and to work together to meet corporate sales goals and stops per hour goals.  management seems to struggle due to the strict timelines, but is able to keep the team positive on a daily basis.  the hardest part of my job is explaining to customers as to why their order is not being delivered in full.  this is due to lack of fullfillment and lack of communication between customer service informing the customer that a product is backordered or not available.  the most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with my customers and helping them find a product that fits their needs."
good,"Working at staples was very rewarding, I had a great time and I got to interact with a lot of people every day. I got to work with a lot of different copy & print services as well which was a very rewarding experience. The co-workers were great to  be with generally a great group of people that help and support each other as a team. The hardest part would be having to constantly get on top of tasks which may be tough if you don't know how to work quickly. The most enjoyable part of the job is making all of the customers happy."
good,"Staples was a great place to work, they had awesome mangers and staff. The normal day at staples would be either opening or closing depending on your shift, stocking shelves with inventory from the back, helping customers and sometimes working cashier. I learned a lot about communicating with people and how to always ask open ended questions. the hardest part about staples was writing the sku's on the box's before putting them above the product. most enjoyable would be the awesome benefits."
good,It is face paced with customers wanting a different variety of things.  But with determination and the love of dealing with people I carry out my jobs as effectively as possible.
good,"It is a very task oriented job but also requires a lot of thinking of ways to step out of the box to make sure that customer service is at its best.  I've learned how better to allocate jobs to other employees, allowing me to exceed the expectations asked of an employee in my position. I enjoy the relationships that I have the opportunity make on a day to day basis.  Building relationships with customers and employees makes my day.  Honestly, that is the most enjoyable part of my job.  The opportunity to meet new people and build relationships drives me everyday to be the best that I can be."
good,Staples is like that home you can always come back to. Now I was blessed to be put in a store with a great Gm.. Its what you make it to be honest. then my position got eliminated an now im still here. waiting for a better opportunity..
good,"The days were fun at Staples, i would handle major accounts with enterprises and industries all over the US, and would handle purchases over thousands"
good,"Staples is a good place to work especially if you enjoy office supplies.  If not, you might get bored selling and working with those supplies."
good,"Working here was fun enough, it is just another retail store, which if that's what you love to do then great, otherwise it's not a bad place to make some money if you can't get into a job area that you prefer. My coworkers were great, and the managerial staff was very friendly and informative. There was a quick sense of family among the coworkers, and though I only worked there for four months, I witnessed five people getting promotions. The pay was above minimum wage, but could be better, but that's the fact of life with every retail job."
good,"Worked for company for 31 years.  My manager was outstanding and  my co-workers were wonderful."
good,"Staples works at a fast pace, placing priority on the customer, as it should be.  Tasks such as restocking, blocking (also called recovery; pulling products on the shelves closer to the customer), operating the cash register, and customer service, as the name suggests, were designed specifically to please the consumer."
good,"A good place to work, the management there is wonderful."

good,"You never know what your day will bring, driving from location to location constantly meeting new people will push you to new boundaries."
good,"I work in a fast-paced environment print production environment that suits my talents well. As Retail Print Production Coordinator I am responsible for making sure jobs coming in and going out of the facility are done correctly and on time. A typical day involves a morning meeting with my Operations Manager and production staff,  then many phone calls to plan projects with Account Managers and Print Experts from over 130 Staples locations. This involves extensive planning and validation of specs based on customer requirements. One of the best things I enjoy about my job is bringing an idea to a beautiful finished product. My boss has great faith in my abilities and therefore does not micromanage my work which is a plus. I work with 2 other employees in the front office staff that are always helpful when I need to bounce an idea off them and are quick to offer assistance with getting jobs out to the production floor. In this business I've learned that your reputation is everything, so I make sure I have gathered all facts before committing to a specific completion time on any project."
good,"- Days we had shipment I would go in and work the freight while helping customers on floor. Sometimes it was busy, sometimes it was slow and could focus on shipment. "
good,Managers had out your assignments day to day which you complete and hand in for QA test. Requires steady hands and a measure of independence.
good,"The work atmosphere is fun and friendly. Coworkers get along easily."
good,"I really liked working at Staples Promotional Products,because the job culture was about selling fun products to our clients organizing events.I learned a lot about selling and dispatching tailor made products on time and being flexible with clients,even in short notice."
good,"Always a pleasure to assist customers with their office supply needs. The culture of the company is changing to a performance based company or evaluation process. Staples, will significantly improve the talent base of employees and customer service levels will increase."

good,"Pretty good job. Nice managers, Been working here 2 1/2 years don't make enough. otherwise not bad work place. jhiuhiuhiu"
good,"The typical workday goes so fast because Quill.com is a lean organization.  Through turnover many employees are not replaced. "
good,"I have been working at Staples for almost a year now and I have enjoyed my experience for the most part. During a typical day at work I ring up customers items, clean front end of store, deal with any questions/concerns customers may have and take care of recycled ink and go backs at the end of every shift. Management at Staples is actually very understanding about school and/or another job and they try to provide a happy, enjoyable work environment. As for my co-workers, most of them are outgoing and very nice but there has been two who do not do their jobs and management keeps them around because of how well they sale warranties and any other promotion we have going on at the time.  I don't agree with it so I have brought it to managements attention and nothing has happened. The hardest part of my job is dealing with the ink people bring in to recycle. The most enjoyable part of my job is simply dealing with customers and providing them with the best customer service I can."
good,Loved this job. Awesome bosses. Meet some great people working here
good,"Fast paced work environment."
good,"Very clean and enjoyable place to work , only drawbacks I found were the requirements of peddling insurance plans on furniture and hardware."
good,Staples is moving in the right direction.  Customer Service Functional Area is a bit behind the times.  No W@H for those support Customer Service.
good,Copy center was always busy considering the store is located right by CU Boulder.
good,"This was a seasonal job which I enjoyed working at the employees were very friendly as well as the managers. It was like another family referring to how cool everyone was. I learned how to use a cash register and the hardest part but nothing I couldn't manage was back to school time, the lines were extremely long and we had to work at a fast but steady pace. The most enjoyable was how we all connected during work hours kept each other smiling or  laughing during the day just so the day went by so much better."
good,"A typical day at work would involve a morning meeting followed by 1 hour of checking and responding to emails from assigned accounts, then 2 hours of outbound sales calls to your account base. Followed by lunch and 3 hours in the afternoon of outbound sales calls to account base and answer any emails that come in throughout the day."
good,Working for staples was a great experience. I was able to get a great deal of experience with customer service. I personally spent extra time outside of work learning about customer service and learning about new technologies.
good,I've worked at several Staples location throughout my university years and it is one of the best company I've worked for. Very flexible with schedule and provide tools to help growth and development. With the experience and knowledge I've gain from working with this company is beyond explanation. Im ready to take acquired knowledge and utilize said skills to improved my talent and growth.
good,"clock in stock shelves, assist customers, learn from vendors and reps, sales merchandise. There really isn't a hard part about working at staples it was a fun work envioirment very at own paced type of workplace."

good,I like working here. they have given me a chance to grow with the company and move around in other positions so I could learn everything about the store.
good,"The Staples store that I worked at has great people, everyone there is great to talk to, fun and easy to get along with, but very hard workers who get their job done."
good,"Days come and go, but the ever changing business at Staples is always the same people come in and we talk about their technology, how to setup a new home or business network, how fast their new PC is or how slow their old PC is. "
good,"I enjoyed my time at staples thoroughly, the opportunity to gain retail, IT, and sales experience at the same time made this job especially rewarding."
good,The copy center is and will always be a high volume and fun environment provided the right employees that work with you.
good,Staples is a great place to work during college. They put considerable effort into working around your classes and other scheduling conflicts. There is always something or someone to keep you busy and plenty of room for growth!
good,I learned alot working here I just needed more experience. I enjoyed helping customers find the products they needed.
good,"I was still in high school when I got this part time job. My GM was amazing, he let me bring my homework to work  with me so I could do my homework and not have to stay up late, he would help me with my homework, and has always been so understanding when it came to family emergencies. I loved working there."
good,"This was an eye opener for me, I enjoyed my co workers and for the most part i enjoyed my job, I find that in most retail settings no matter your experience or certifications the people that work there the longest get the special treatment, but aside from that, I loved the way the did things tech wise and I love the way the company as a whole handles their employees."
good,"Staples was my first job, and when I started, and for a number of years after, it was an amazing place to work.  Sadly there was a pretty huge shift in the company culture a few years before I left.  This came about when the company decided that managers bonuses were based off of warranty sales.  It was at this time that the whole focus really seemed to change from helping customers get the best product and experience to ""Who cares... did they get the warranty?"".  It was at this time that I really lost my enthusiasm with the company; especially when one of the employees was actively lying to customers to get warranty sales, and was being rewarded with shifts and praise because of it.  "
good,"I learned many thing during this role as i flourished as a copy center operative, retail assistant and sale rep"
good,I enjoy going to work love meeting new & old customers. Great team to work with. No day is the same.
good,Corporate side of Staples.Cold call to build customer base. Build relationships with current and new customers.
good,"Great Team, learned profile management, co workers were fun."
good,Great place to start a career and gain experience. Solid management who want to see you succeed.
good,"Most days were 10 hr days assisting customers with their office supply needs.This was my first retail management job and being a quick learner, did not take long to catch up on the day to day running of the store."
good,"Working an 8 1/2 hour day starting at 8:15 and ending at 4:45 wasn't the hard part. The hard part was being 6 months pregnant and constantly on your feet. In the morning as soon as I would arrive I would go to the back room and get my till. After I had brought it out and put it in my register the fun would begin. I would start with making up the break schedule. Whoever started first would be the first to get a break, whoever started after them would be the second to get a break and so on. After I had the break schedule done I would then clean up whatever was left from the night shift the previous day. That could take anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours. As I would clean up the undone pricing materials from the previous shift, I would get a pile up of clearance and new pricing items for me to do throughout the day. I often would end up finishing that and leaving nothing for the next shift to do, depending on how busy the store would get during the day. However, if I did end up leaving some for the next shift, I would end up having to finish it off the next morning. If I had finished my work for the day, I would stock the candy shelves around customer service and clean the counters of customer service. When this was all done, if there was any mess I had made throughout the day I would clean it and organize my work place so it wasn't messy for the next shift. When I had finished everything there was to do I would write in the cashier blog and let the next shift know whether there was stuff left over to do or not. I would do all this throughout the day while dealing with customers"
good,"Working at staples was good experience. I learn a lot from my management and co workers."
good,"Staples as a company is a great employer.  Every manager that I have worked with is genuine and cares about every employee.  "
good,I liked the other associates they made me feel really welcome as well as the management
good,"Fun, fast-paced, friendly work environment. The part I enjoy most about this job is the employees, team work helps provide a friendly place to be.  I am looking for employment elsewhere because I am nearly finished with the veterinarian assistant course in my education plan, I would like to work in an animal related environment."
good,"Cross-training in all departments available, very good management, productivity always runs smoothly"
good,The individual commitment of each and every person in the field at Staples insured a bright future for their transition as a retailer.
good,"Strong training "
good,Not a bad place to work if you're willing to meet the sales goals required to move up.
good,open and close store daily count safe daily cleaning store and making sure employees know there tasks for the day
good,"The philosophy at Staples was to hire people who could carry out their responsibilities without much supervision.  The real estate people could cover the spectrum of real estate activities whether it be land acquisition and self development, negotiating leases for a build to Staples specification or the leasing of an existing building."
good,"- A typical day at work would be restocking, doing cashier."
good,"A typical day at work was spent mostly behind the customer service desk. I learned how to answer multi line telephones, handle customer issues, do returns, etc. My coworkers were very helpful. The management was spot on, very organized and diligent about customer service being our top priority. The hardest part of the job was standing in the same spot all day. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers, by far I enjoyed helping them and getting them the products and services they needed."
good,Management was great to work with. They allowed the employees to really prosper and created a great and inviting atmosphere.
good,"Typical day for me at Staples, take the garbage down to the loading dock area, usually 3 trips as cardboard had to be separate from the garbage. Answer phones from clients looking for on-line orders, greet drivers with incoming shipments, filing, maintaining a clean warehouse, to secure all cages end of the day."
good,Although sometimes understaffed and short on hours the management and flexibility on hours are unmatched in all other work experiences I have ever had. I only wish I had more hours/better pay.
good,"Typical days at work are rarely typical."
good,"Great experience, It was time to move on, didn't regret working there."
good,"Being a manager is a rewarding role at Staples."
good,"At Staples, every day is customer centered. As an employee, I worked in the Copy and Print Center where my typical day consisted of taking and producing copy orders. I learned numerous new skills while working in the copy center and now have an expert knowledge of many Microsoft programs as well as a few PDF programs. In the 5 year I have worked for Staples, the management and the management structure has changed, but for the most part Staples employees quality managers. Each department in Staples has a lead, which is a full time position and the rest of the department is made up of part time employees. I have like the leads I have worked with, but it is hard to always get alone with other part-time employees. Most of the part time employees have a full-time job and only work at Staples at night and on the weekends. They work for the extra money, but this job is not their main priority. The hardest part of Staples is customer service. Each customer is an individual and has unique needs. Meeting these needs and provided exceptional service for every customer is a bit overwhelming at times. At the same time, the job is very rewarding. I get to see part of people lives, from wedding invitations, birth announcements, to business cards. When I can see that a person is happy with the product or service Staples has provided them, it makes me feel as I have made a person day better."
good,"Concord, NH territory."
good,My coworkers truly make my day and dealing with a variety of customers also allowed me to improve my customer service.

good,Some area’s are offered telecommuting creating a great work/life environment.  The management encourages professional growth and provides great training.
good,"I managed nine B2B mid-market sales consultant's. A typical day consisted of reviewing weekly metrics, field rides, conference calls, checking customer quotes, and preparing RFP responses. What I learned was patience, listening, interview skills, and coaching versus managing. The hardest part of the job was/is coaching each associate to their own unique personality, and helping them develop their own daily/weekly structure. By far the most satisfying part of the job was seeing growth and promotions for my B2Bs."
good,a typical day would consist of working to build a relationship with customers and as well sell cellphones. Walk around have conversations but also try to make it fun by having a funny pitch.
good,"As a part time associate in college, this was a great job to fund projects and fill up my gas tank.  Staples is a really good job to introduce you to retail and give you the proper training to be successful at customer service.  I unfortunately could not move up in the company due to my class schedule which made it difficult to save for a car or pay rent, leading me to move back in with my parents for some time.  I ended up having to leave in order to make ends meet. If you're a high school student looking for a nights/weekends type of job, this is great.  Other than that I wouldn't pursue Staples as a career unless you become at least a General Manager."
good,"High paced, fast enviorment, management is understatding"
good,It was a good work experience. Very customer service oriented and showed me how to strike up a conversation and how to be a good sales man.
good,This is one the best inside account management position I had the pleasure of having.  Staples is a great company to work for.  My day consists of managing over 400 account nationwide.  I contact all of my clients within a 90 day rotation either on phone or by email.  I am responsible for retaining and growing several different verticals within each given account.  I am tasked to network within the account with the purpose of building new relationships in each department.  My day starts at 8am and ends at 5pm.  I have the ability to flex my time any way I see fit. If I need to leave early on a Friday I can back 30min of time each day to be able to leave at 3pm the earliest.  This position is a base plus a commission compensation plan. My co workers are great to work with and will support you when needed.  The hardest part of this position is not being able to visit some of my top clients for the purpose of business reviews.  There are times when I feel that they need my personal attention for the purpose of retaining them.  The most enjoyable part of this position is the low stress level which is achieved by the flexibility of the hours worked.
good,Working at Staples was great. I loved meeting new people. The employees are nice and welcoming  and the customers are more nice then mean.
good,"If you are looking for a part time or even a full-time job, check out staples. They have helpful managers who are willing to take their time helping you succeed. They are understanding when you need time off, and they provide good incentives for success."
good,I loved working there. Wish I hadn't had my hours reduced. The economy bit me.
good,come in  see if there is any task to be done check daily numbers for the store goals to be reached for the week/day. continue repair and services of customer computers etc.. is a great day in all hardest part of the day is when you have a lot of customer to help and you don't have enough people to take care of them all. all the coworkers are the best ever great personal friends they become. management cares a lot of their associates they show it everyday. most enjoyable is customers reaction when you deliver them to yes to their needs results.
good,Staples Advantage has a great work environment with fantastic coworkers.
good,fun place to work if you like people. But there is not enough hours to go around for staff.
good,"Working at staples in the computer sales and repairs is very challenging even though we are not on a commission basics, we still a board on which we write down our daily stats. Coworkers are very friendly, bosses are nice never aggressive. Selling is the greatest feeling at the workplace. Trying to sell warranties, installations and accessories to customers is very amusing. The down part is that for my expertise and experience in the retail sales and customer service field is very deep, hence I am not proportionally paid for my services that I offer towards the company."
good,"A great place to work."

good,Had a the great experience working for Staples.  Pay was not bad and I was able to advance quickly.  You will advance if you do good work.  My co-workers were my family away from home and I was new to the state.
good,Good company. Long days and hours. Does not promote from within
good,"A typical day at work consists of motivating my team. Currently, the big seller is ""Back to School Savings Passes"". All stores in the district compete with each other in selling these. Entering work, viewing the results of earlier in the day or the previous day and coaching employees to find more appropriate ways of selling is a normal day. Supervising the floor, making loss prevention low, assisting customers, filing paperwork, and handling the stores finances are my main responsibility. The hardest part of my job was dealing with my team when they were not motivated and finding new ways to keep them going. The most enjoyable part was watching them succeed."
good,"On-site appointments scheduled appropriately, provide the opportunity to provide excellent service to customers.  In store environment fast-paced with learning tools available."
good,"I worked in inventory. I liked my job, but the pay is very low and almost zero chance for advancement. Managers and coworkers were great."
good,"Don't apply for this job expecting to be a dedicated computer tech. This is retail and a tech job smashed together into an amalgamation of stress aided only by decent people and the friendly atmosphere. Also, don't expect to make anymore than you would down the street at McDonalds. Starting pay is abysmal for the amount of work required and there is no clear path to advancement. "
good,"Management is great when corporate isn't breathing down their neck and subsequently yours. Co-workers are the best part of Staples, they are some great folks! "
good,Well staples is a very slow paced environment to work. Its a great first job for most recent HS grads. That want to start getting retail experience.

We use tools offered by Staples to deliver options to customers based on their needs. As we come up against something we don't know,  our team will research and seek out each other to find and answer. "
good,Coming in to work I relate to people in a open friendly accepting manner by acknowledging  everyone. Then I report to my Mgr. and we talk about action steps needed to accomplish team objectives. then I get into my role by conveying clear expectations for assignments. I also learned how to seek diverse ideas and points of view to achieve business success. The hardest part when co-workers call off. I LOVE when we ACHIEVE store level earnings and sales goals. The store get money for planned events.
good,Filling of inventory and Talking and helping with customers
good,"Boa empresa para aquele que tem vontade de aprender, espírito de iniciativa e ambição"
good,Strong company to work for! Overall pretty sound business plan and good business structure.
good,"The day was pretty easy going, not to busy, not to slow. Depending on the department and the supervisor, you pretty much operated without being micromanaged. Co-workers where fun, yet catty like most office jobs. Office politics are pretty much the same as any job. The most hardest part of the day was getting started in the mornings and the most enjoyable part of the day was of course the hour leading to the end of the day."
good,- Customer service and front end management that requires constant care
good,Veel werk en de klanten ontvangen.
good,A typical day at work consists of checking the priority list made the night before. completing all priority work first and then moving on the next. Computers were also repaired in store and on site. Answering customer questions about computers on the phone and even in person. Also assisting in sales as well. Any issues that were above my head management was always there to ressolve my issues. The only difficult issues were when computer repairs costed more that what the computer was worth. I enjoyed the hands on work with computers and the interaction with customers.

good,"Great company to work for, although you worked 36 to 40 hrs you were not considered full time and it's hard to pay bills when you did not have a consistent income."
good,"The copy center is fun to work in, we get to create anything from menus to church bulletins. I've learned a lot about different types of copying/printing machines and finishing techniques. Overall, the managers are great and caring. Most listen to any issues you are having and are more than willing to help. All of our co-workers get a long very well and sometimes socialize out of work; we're all friends and maintain the friendships even is someone does leave the company. There isn't really anything hard about the job, except that one difficult customer that can never be satisfied - no matter what you do, but that can be found in any retail situation. The best part of the job is creating something that exceeds the customers expectations; seeing their appreciation really makes you feel good and makes up for any rude customers."

good,"A day at Staples is always different. There is never a day that is the same as the last. As a Staples manager I am consitently having to adjust schedules to work around the different surprises that happen on a daily basis. Customer serivce is the only part of my job description that stays the same every day and that is to help, talk and please the customer with whatever needs they may need. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to meet new people every day and get to know them, so as to assist them the best of my ability. The hardest part of my job is keeping up the ever moving world of retail. Staples is constantly implementing new sales, reports, techniques that i have to coach and train all the associates while still being able to complete my daily tasks."
good,"A typical day there is quite hard to describe. Some days were productive, others were nearly at a stand still. It all depended on the amount of business the store got in a certain day. If there is no business, there is no need to restock, or no customers to assist. Some slow days we may do things such as re-organize the storage to make it a bit easier to find certain product. The best things I learned at this store are organizational techniques."
good,"My typical day was finding new clients, build relationships with existing clients, and maximize sales with in existing clients."
good,"Staples Advantage is a very comfortable place to work at. Its managers down to the staff members are very good. Personally myself, i enjoy working at staples on a daily basis. However, for educational qualification purposes, i would like to embark my career on the topic which i like doing the most, which is quantity surveying."
good,"I would make prints, posters, and various office materials with technology"
good,Working in the copy center as a specialist was a pretty good experience for me. I did enjoy interacting with the customers.
good,well the company is outstanding but the management could be better at some stores
good,opportunity to work with costomers inventory control some good some bad good nothing costomer relations
good,"A typical day at staples was very busy. Phone calls, special projects, dealing with vendors, and checking employees as they leave the property. Management was not really up to par at Staples. My co-workers were all nice and helpful about the Distribution process. The hardest part of the job was really dealing with management. The most enjoyable part of the job was that we got paid every week."
good,"Work was enjoyable and i looked forward to coming into work. All my co-workers were great people and i enjoyed working with all of them. A typical day was basically ringing people up and doing work on the register. The hardest part would have to be, that it was during back to school time and we were really busy. I enjoyed most the environment and people i worked with, and also being payed weekly."
good,"Excellent company to work for, great management team overall. Competitive industry so it was sometimes difficult to acquire new customers."
good,To be a successful manager there you need to have a strong understanding of how to drive sales and build selling skills in associates who are mostly new to selling low margin items that require sales to have attachment items added on to them in order to be profitable.
good,"I am very technology savvy so working with electronics was right up my ally! My co-workers and managers were very easy to get along with, it was a very laid-back environment and we were all doing what we loved to do. I managed stock, handled returns & damages. Helped customers find which laptop/camera/phone/printer/calculator/scanner was the right one for them. I am very knowledgable about these things so it was easy for me to accomodate to my customers needs. I helped parents shop for the new school year, and did copies & faxes in the print service center."
good,Was laid off as a result of a restructuring and consolidation within the company. The whole office in the Northern California Region was laid off.
good,Staples was a good environment. The facility itself was a little old for the demands of the business. I was not given many opportunities for advancement.
good,"I did my summer youth job at Staples. I learned to be on time for my shift, and learned how to be more of a team player. Interacting with the customers was a great experience. The work environment was friendly, and educational. Different departments, I learnt different things."
good,"Okay job but not my passion and it was hard to work lots of hours. not much to say. low end job, pays minimum wage. fun staff that are helpful but customers are rude sometimes"
good,Learned a lot on the job and I hope to continue growing my skills. I felt that I learned a lot about behaving appropriate on the job and I learned about the kind of career I want.
good,This was my first ever paid job. I learned and grew a lot while working at Staples. I spent my time on the sales floor which in the beginning wasn't my strongest attribute. The employees that I worked with were great and helped with anything I needed. Overall a good workplace.
good,Our store manager bought us pizza as a reward of being the best. My fellow associates were phenomenal at their job. I loved the interactions with customers.
good,I like working at Staples because it was a nice job and I got along with the people and I miss the job and they used to treat me nice and respect and I used to treat them nice and respect and and that was a good work.
good,"Great experience as a shopper and member. "
good,"When I first started at staples, the management was larger than now, but that does not mean the store is in any way worse than it used to be, I enjoy working with the people I now call friends at the store each day. The managers, even if they can be hard on us at some times, like how any person can be, they are very helpful and they are always willing to help out and look out for each of us associates. I moved from being a store associate to a copy center associate not too long ago, to increase my wage but more importantly expand what I am capable of doing for the store and the job. I find it to be more work in front of me, but that does not stop me from working hard everyday to help and push towards our monthly and yearly goals as a store together."
good,You're often given a task to complete and if you do that you can move on to do another task. Some of the other employees don't do much but that's a given at any work place. Back to school season is a little rough but if everyone works together then it will go by smoothly.
good,"I started out in the print and copy centre. Lots of jobs to do, from printing to, creating new clients following the rules - and still doing customer service work. Eventually, I moved from Copy Representative to Cashier and sales associate. Quite often they would have me flexing in all areas when it was busy. I would reconmend this as a first time job."
good,"A less stressful UPS job, good management some heavy lifting but rewarding work. Travel around the city meeting new people every day and you stay fit."
good,"good company to work for, pay was fair and the company offered good benefits. Cross training was encouraged, which i feel greatly benefits the company and its employees as well. Work was fast paced and difficult sometimes but also very rewarding."
good,"It was a good job for the month during summer for students, it was a safe environment and everyone was friendly. It was a small job to have some money in your account for the summer."
good,Enjoyed meeting new people with different job titles and resources. Able to learn different ways of how technology can be used. Opportunity to use my customer service well
good,There was an extremely high turnover rate at Staples. My supervisor had only worked there for about 3 weeks longer than I did. They promised bonuses but that never happened because the store as a whole was not profitable.
good,Staples was a solid company that gave me consistent hours that do my schedule. Management communicated well with employees and the environment entering work was often upbeat and positive.
good,I loved working at Staples. The on going training added to my skills.  I was given my own work station and was able to personalize it. I was able to sharpen up my communication skills with the clients. I was given respect from Staples.
good,"Great place to work, people are fun, hours are decent, but pay isn't enough for cost of living. Good job for part-time work and there's decent growth abilities for anyone looking to advance into managerial duties."
good,"Working at staples provided the experience in retail sales, cashiering, customer service. The only drawback to working at staples was that non-management employees were held to working less than 40 hrs and were only considered part-time."
good,"I am very happy working at staples australia and moreover it was really fun, joy, friendly people, caring and helpful its really  good experience. Staff n management was really very good."
good,"Cake day"
good,I work there off and on over the years and the managers are great. They will help you out if you need it.They treat you like family and they work around your schedule needs!
good,A good place to start putting your self in the workforce as a beginning job. You are responsible for keeping your areas clean and organized and is a very fun place to work at
good,"Accuracy is very  important"
good,"It was fun to work at staples. I learnt a lot from the management, and everyone is very helpful and friendly. Although, the chances for the advancement is scarce but it was knowledgeable experience."
good,"Toujours du nouveau, bonne culture de management. "
good,"Staples is a great place to work. Work/ Life balance is acceptable, and responsiblity is equivalent to pay. There is opportunity for advancement with in the company on many different levels."
good,productive and fast pace learning workplace self motivating team building  team spirit easy hands on learning great work schedule ability to work from home
good,Productive and fun workplace.Here are the fax templates that we use. The “3 Attempts” fax is what we send when we’ve tried to call the member three times and haven’t been successful. The second one is the “Appointment made” fax which is what we send the doctor after we’ve helped set up an appointment with them to request office notes of the appointment.
good,The interview experience was good I enjoyed working there. The hiring process well fairly easy but was very helpful. I enjoyed my coworkers and my manager was very easy to talk to.
good,"Overall, Staples it's a great place to work. My experience showed that the company cared about its employees and customers. They are flexible and there is opportunity for some advancement."
good,"When I worked there, the management was not very and the coworkers I worked with wasn't very nice. I worked mostly at the register but, the most hardest part is not getting time off."
good,"If you don't enjoy people, don't work at Staples.  Excessive customer interaction is necessary with sales goals expected by management.  The particular store where I work is in a major change of management - trying to recover from an exceptionally bad manager.  There is a lot of pressure to get the store to profitability, clean, and to correct and restock the inventory.  The current team is doing their best and management did a complete overhaul of employees.  I have seen many positive changes in the short time the new team took over.  If you don't like people, don't like sales goals a measure of performance then this is not the job for you."
good,"workplace culture was very competitive, also they were strict on dress code, they would not let me wear a head band, and I was having a bad hair day lol"
good,Had a good time working there for almost 12 years  And it was fast pace and we were can competitive with other D c's and management group along with supervisors are really respectful but is really fast pace and hard work.
good,Great working at Staples Center. Flexible hours as well as good management. Gets slow during the summer though. But during NBA/hockey season it's a perfect second job
good,Staples has a good work environments and has really good team that will help you with any problems you come across. co workers are great and easy to get along with.
good,Georgia is firm but understanding. The staff was welcoming and detailed instructors. I didn’t like the fact that they prefer for you to work on a time frame instead of earning your 40 hours per week.
good,"The experience I gained from working here is what made it worth while. Having a chance to get more experience with Computer Repair and Software was my main goal and it delivered. A good starting job, but I wouldn't want to stay here forever."
good,"Many new faces and different personalities come in and out on a daily basis you never know who you’ll get, however it is a great experience to be in with the company"
good,"Management in Store is awesome but...  Upper management Stresses everyone out. Major focus on numbers. High ticket Items are sold at a loss , so you are forced to bundle more goods and services. On the plus side people are nice and hours are flexible."
good,"Management: the managers are all nice. They don’t bother you unless you aren’t doing your job. "
good,It's a good starting job in order to get experience. I find the environment to be stimulating and good balace at multitasking. The sales are not bad. The employees are well respected.
good,"From clocking in to clocking out, the Print and Marketing business is flooded with customers. I've been able to build lasting relationships with local business owners and feel like I have become a valued member of the city. I've been able to turn customer ideas into real-life marketing tools/products to help them build their businesses. The best part about the job is the thanks I get and the updates I get from businesses letting me know how much I have helped them succeed."
good,Be prepared to do a lot of work. From merchandising leading a team to management overrides and customer relations. Very challenging but little room for growth unless willing to relocate.
good,"I enjoyed my time working in staples. I had great employees, awesome managers. Work very well with everyone and greeted with a smile at all times. if i could go back with better pay i would."
good,"Was a nice place to work, easy going environment. Managers were for the people with no issues with co-workers. There was room for growth and had a culture that included everyone."
good,"The managers and staff at the Staples in New London are absolutely amazing.  They are kind, understanding, helpful, and really care about you.  Working in the print department can be very rewarding, there are a lot of interesting projects that come through and some very sweet regular customers, but it is also incredibly fast paced, involves a lot of multi-tasking, and is very difficult when we are understaffed.  There is a lot that needs to get done, and a lot of times not enough time or staffing to do it all."
good,"It's an ok place to work It's easy to get to by bus, straightforward policies, helpful coworkers. The store I worked at did have some issues (details unknown) but they've since started fixing that when new management arrived six months before putting in my two weeks."
good,"Good first job to have, gets your foot in the door with customer service and sales. I was able to work in multiple parts of the store to gain knowledge of how they each functioned."
good,"Worked there a long time ago worked with great managers and co workers 😀 fun environment , great learning experience , people were friendly , customers at times could be rude , but other then that it was fine"
good,Teamwork is good the structure is great Ive been around for a while and learned about sales and communication with people learned additionally other knowledge in different departments while working there
good,"The team I work with currently is a group of pretty fun people to work with. They all are very caring when one of the other employees has something happen. Everyone works hard, but the management that is currently in place has no idea that the realistic numbers that come out of the store, in relation to what they expect, do no match up. This location simply does not have the traffic required to meet such high sales standards."
good,Good for someone just starting out. High-school students and college students looking for part time work. The management was good and pay a little above average.
good,It was a great place to work they offer good benefits and its very flexible with schedule also they offer great training programs . Also they have a great program to move up in the company.  I learn how to  understanding and how to resolve customers issues .what  I most enjoyed was helping customer with all there business needs.
good,Very busy work environment. In my position you need to be on your toes 24/7 to stay ahead on top of your game. Customers tend to need to be walked through step by step
good,"Responsible for providing exceptional customer service and creating a customer centric environment. This person will also be required to perform store operational tasks as needed. General Purpose: Customer Service, Basic selling skills, Front-end operations, Merchandising and retail operating standards."
good,"I loved the job culture at Staples.  The managers looked out for their employees and the employees all looked out for each other.  When they hired in a manager from the outside, it threw things a big=t out of whack cause she was terrible, but otherwise, it was awesome!"
good,"the employees were nice and the pay was good. my job was easy, i wasn't a security guard but i was responsible for incoming and out going mail and packages."
good,Good company. Overall culture is one of stasis and low risk. Since the company has gone private there is a lot of change and less job security. It remains to be seen if the rapid changes and rebranding will reap the hoped for results.
good,A typical day at the customer service will include helping customer at the checkout and answer their queries. Ideal place to have customer service experience.
good,This was a good organization to be apart of as they truly take care of the people.  Strong leadership from top to bottom and incredible training program for new hires
good,"Staples is a good entry level work place, especially if you have no prior work experience. I was hired and was given adequate training time. One problem is that the customer reviews on receipts are taken a little too seriously. We will have meetings if one person who just had a bad day somehow ended up getting a review card. To worsen the issue, expectations of how the customer did the review were way off. We needed like 5 out of 5 stars or else we got a penalty. Other than that though, the workplace was friendly, supportive, and conducive to a good store."
good,"I never saw a true work team like at Greece Staples Print & Marketing. It's one of the top-rated ones globally. Obviously this means you've got your mellow manager, that goes without saying. Then basically everyone else has their own personality. But zero sickos, no other way to word it."
good,At my 3 or more years at staples.. I had my sales incentive taken away . (bonuses for sales ) Then their was store closeures due to the company trying to present it self better for purchase or merger.. hours where cut and we where not given raises as we should have been.
good,Great place to get started in the workforce. Probably not a long term place to work unless you move up quickly to your desired needs. Not much in terms of benefits unless you are a full time employee or have worked with them for a number of years though.
good,"The job was super easy, but it was super slow.  This meant you spent a lot of time just standing there waiting for something to happen. Other than that they are super lenient on certain things and easy to work for."
good,"This is what I consider one of my first ""real"" jobs, since it's given me the most relevant, important skills out of all my work experiences. Thumbs up"
good,A typical day at Staples is very busy. Helping customers and coaching team members. Staples provides a lot of training on the computer and hands on training as well
good,Low end job that lets the customer spit in your face and then you smile and say thank you for that.  It is numbers based like all retail stores and would not recommend if you have respect for yourself.
good,the management that was there when i was there was enjoyable to work for. Went to work in uniform punched in and started working. Copy center control of projects
good,"i loaded trailer and off load them leaned how to drive the equipment as in forklift, stand up, pallet jack rider, i really enjoyed working at staples cuz they helped me get my forklift license and the management always trusted me and they new i will get the job done right and fast"
good,"Was a great company to work for, Management was great Manager was a very easy going guy, Awesome people to work with Clean Environment.  We worked Monday to Friday, The company really cared for their employees, I also like my hours. It was a non stressful environment."
good,Staples is a innovating company and is always offering new products to drive sales. Great team building company. Great training programs and they believe in promoting from within.
good,"Open store, customer service, make sure that daily operations were followed by policy and procedure to ensure excellent customer service. Sales and customer services expert."
good,"Managers are nice"
good,In my opinion I learned so much working at staples. We went through a lot of ups and downs with management. A lot of turn around with part time employees. I would recommend getting a job here if you would like to pursue a job in retail and take the time climbing up the corporate ladder.
good,"Great work environment, co-worker made working enjoyable and fun. Also, it a lot of standing and walking around depending on position. GM very demanding on making sales"
good,"Management does a good job of pushing the employees to do there best. I really enjoy the people who work at my branch, all around very good, nice people."
good,"This is a good side job, relatively reliable and slow paced. Learned a lot about printers and finishing techniques. Everyone is pretty laid back and go with the flow. The hardest part as dealing with people coming in all at once to get several small jobs done while doing big orders. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know the customers."
good,The typical day would go by pretty fast with how busy we always were. I learned not everybody is nice in retail and if they don't get there way it is the highway. Managers were very nice and fun to be around.  I would say the hardest part would be having to do multiple things at once and still trying to sale protection plans as well. I enjoyed my coworkers and making sure my customers were always happy.
good,"fun place to work.. A lot of learning required, from sales to technology knowledge. There just wasn't much room for growth without a college degree. Also management could get nasty if you didn't meet sales quota for the week."
good,"Was able to work at home a couple of days of week.  Company was very flexiable "
good,"I start my day unloading pallets from trailer using electric standing pallet jack, answer emails, prepare product for return to stock or vendor pending product disposition, process pallets to return product.  I learn something new about production process every day.  Everything from receiving, shipping rules, hazmat updates, vendor compliance, or just daily work updates."
good,Fast paced they teach you everything you need to know the room for growth was huge they let you work at your own pace but don't go to slow it will mess up the flow of things
good,"A fine organization that protects workers rights and safety. allowed me to get enough training to be efficient as I began to work, also abide by rules of minimum working hours for certain age."
good,"The customers make the job real fun. It's great to help out a stressed person who is looking for what you have in stock. Once you become knowledgeable of the product, it's great!"
good,Staples is a great place to work and the people are friendly and the building is clean and very safe and they on guard security with very nice eating.
good,Great starting position for people looking to get experience in retail. I worked here during summers between college semesters and it was nice to have somewhere to work while I was home.
good,"Staples is a great first job that can teach you a lot about floor work and at times putting together chairs. Customers are easy , it’s too bad we can’t take tips because people offer a lot."
good,Company and manager were good to work for. Great for individual just starting out in their work life and wants to go into retail work. As a Computer technician was also responsible to make sales.
good,"The thing about Staples is, it's a very good place for growth. However, you have to work for where you want to be. No handouts will be given to you, you have to motivate your own self to really be on top"
good,"Good place to work, very friendly people and a Great manager who is very understanding. Everyone who came into staples was friendly and very easy to get along with!"
good,Could have been better but it is a electronic store after all. Everyone who works there is just barely scraping by making the absolute minimum to survive.
good,Have no issues with this company. If you enjoy working with people this is great. Unfortunately business is extremely slow and stores are constantly closing
good,Staples will give you a well rounded resume. Work life balance is good. There are many associate programs you can utilize. As a manager you will learn all aspects of running a business.
good,Fine company. Depends on what position you are taking. Better for traditional retail roles. New ownership is in the process of making the organization better.
good,"Flexible hours. Learned how to do cycle counts, inventory control."
good,"If in management flexible schedule. Visual standards working with planograms. Processed RTVs and RTW. Team is a unit with the all focused on the goals. And watching payroll hours. Really cant say there was a hard part to the job,"
good,Good part time if you are a teenager. This is the place you want to work at when you need just a little bit of money to fund small things. The people there when I worked there made the job a lot better.
good,A typical day at work consists of checking in queed jobs and assessing progress on various projects. I assist Print&Marketing customers on a daily basis. Most days follow a similar pattern.
good,"a great place to work "
good,I enjoyed my time there very much and would even consider working there again if given the opportunity. A place for potential growth if you're a hard working individual.
good,vraiment instructif. ambiance de travail relaxe. merci
good,"This wasn't a bad place to work.  You usually work 40 hours a week Monday thru Friday.  Sometimes the company provides snacks or meals for everyone.  The benefits aren't bad, but I wouldn't say amazing.  With the position I worked I was told I could top out at about $18.00 per hour and there is room for growth if you want it."
good,a good work environment. required to multi task. enjoyed creating business cards and building positive relationships with customers. Positive work environment with great co workers
good,"Pay was decent for what it is. Management often seemed confused bu they cared and worked with the employees. If you worked hard, showed initiative, and were willing to relocate then there was an opportunity there for advancement. Can't beat getting paid every week."
good,"I did not work for the company to long, but what I can say, is the people I worked for and with were amazing, it was like working with another family. I was afforded amazing opportunities with them, and with the position I held I was able to learn a lot of thing I would have never know when it came to electronics and computer programs and services."
good,Everyone working there has a lot of fun and laid back a majority of the time. A little unnecessary pressure to sell warranty plans. Great for students looking to gain experience.
good,"Depending on the time of year and during sales, staples can be a very fast pasted environment. Giving great customer service and always helping is required."
good,Staples was a great company to work for....The people that I worked with were like family.  Good work-life balance for the position that I held.  Nice collegues.
good,I am a sales account executive and I find I am given all the tools needed to be successful.  The company values its employees and is focused on growth.   Benefits and work life balance are great it you work hard.
good,"Loved working there, just wasn't enough hours to be had and customer interactions were often negative because they were just shrewd business people. I don't blame them for it but for some, it was not easy to handle"
good,"Customers were probably the ""hardest"" part: you get a variety of them with odd problems, or just didn't know how to take care of their computers. But, it comes with the work so I can't really complain."
good,Staples has been a great company to work for. I am looking to broaden my experience in the retail management world and grow within the company. I have gained immeasurable amounts of experience working for staples as a General Manager and look forward to taking those skills to another company.
good,"Staples in my experience hires management mostly from within.  They are always looking to move people up into leadership positions, and the pay is good."
good,Staples was a job where you could learn many different departments. The work culture at times was overwhelming but for the most part acceptable. The pay and overtime was great
good,It was my first job so I didn't know exactly how to work things out. But i did learn as i went on with my days. Unfortunately due to education i couldn't continue to work there.
good,"Managers are nice and understanding ."
good,"Most days were alike, similiar routine."
good,"Working at staples was a great experience for me. I learned a lot about a working community and working as a team. The management was great, and I was able to trust in them with all concerns."
good,"working here you have to be creative and make sure the customer needs are being satisfied by creating something they asked for, or making it better. a typical day at work would be talking to a customer to find out what they need or what their looking for, for example they would want to make a picture they have into a poster size and then bulid a boarder around it , making the picture bigger takes time alone just to print out and then you have to put color and laminate it . you just have to be creative in everything you do."
good,they are really nice.  they give us training time by time in all departments. It is not really hard for me because i love my job and i give my best in my every job whether i like it or not and  i am always willing to learn new things
good,I was a furniture associate and i enjoyed working for this company.  great company to work for and amazing manager.  I learned how to build furniture and make orders for customers.
good,"Great staff. You will  not get very many hours when you first start, and Staples has closed a lot of locations so not a reliable job if you plan on working there for more then a few years"
good,"A typical day at work consists of managing what work that needs to be done on computers and phones for repair, coaching associates on selling and customer service and reviewing sales and customer service metrics with associates to give them a better understanding as to why it pushes the business forward. During primetime hours it can be stressful, but that is to be expected in retail depending on the size of your store."
good,"Staples was my first job and a great place to work at. Mainly due to the friendliness of the employees and everyone willing to help each other when needed. Since I worked with a great team, they made working there not only productive but fun as well, making each shift feel short. "
good,"i worked in every are of staples except manager office supplies,copy center,easy tech,and register all of them had some some similarities like making sure that your area was clean at the end of your shift alot of customer interaction with all the roles stocking and making customer orders fixing computers and virus removal all thing i had to do on a daily basis."
good,"i picked things. i left because of the management. some were good, some were not. the people they hired didn't care enough about the job and it slowed the work place down."
good,"I wanted a boring and simple job while I went to college and this job (kind of?) fit the bill."
good,"Staples is a great entry level sales career for any aspiring sales associates. With opportunities to improve ones self, there's also plenty of room to grow."
good,I would come in a work on making sure the truck shipment is unloaded. Making sure that sales number are on track. Organizing the Tech floor and also over looking other parts of the store.
good,It was a very good place to work there But the hours were not enough for me and I had bills to pay and my rent as well so I had to find something better for me.
good,This job will bring the techy out of you if you have it anywhere in you. The job is fun while at times it can get too competitive between the workers. You get to meet different people while working there. My only quam was a specific manager but other than that I'll recommend this place to work
good,"Quite a good learning environment, as you should always expect challenging tasks. It gets more challenging, having to deal with the many demands of customers and building collaborative efforts withim team, without the support of management."
good,Staples is a great company. Everyone really works as a team. I however do not like working in retail but the managers are very friendly and easy to talk to
good,"Winc (previously Staples) is an enjoyable place to work and the employees are easy to talk to and to ask questions if required. "
good,"Where I work the managers and employees are amazing. The hours are horrible though. On average I get around 15 hours a week. I was hired for full time. I did recently get a raise but not enough for me to be happy with where I am. It's very competitive also. Also it can be very stressful, hard, and fast paced. Especially when the beginning of the school year comes around. If I work a four hour shift, I get given too many expectations that aren't realistic to do in 4 hours."
good,"Staples has a very friendly working environment. Great customer service, provides great experience in life and good teamwork within associates. Great customer interaction"
good,This was a great place to start your first outside sale position. I loved the culture but you have to prepare yourself for a lot of cold calling. You have to be a pushy person and be able to handle hearing no over 40 times a day.
good,Staples is a clean friendly environment if I had a choice to work there again if I was not seeking a job in my career I would definitely return back and do it all over again.
good,"Being a retail manager is a life all over the place! Fun, rewarding, Stressful and ever changing by the minute! Over the years, it has taught me that no one day is the same! I love being able to meet and help new people every day!"
good,"Different departments to choose from."
good,"In my four years I have grown withing the company into management. There are always alot of things to do, there are always metrics that need improving, but the smaller store size leads to a more relaxed than typical work environment with a tight knit community feel."
good,"Great systems infrastructure, funding for projects never an  issue, large RIF's  lost too many   good people. Great manager who was unfortunately not respected by her superiors"
good,"As a print and marketing supervisor who had been with the company for a few years, the transition from copy center to print and marketing wasn't the easiest. they need to listen to their employees opinions better on software and what equipment is needed in that part of the store. the employees know what is best for their returning customers and have a good idea on what the perspective of new customers will be."
good,I was a manager so I was able to talk to different people on a daily basis.  You're always on the go and encountering different issues every day.  It was good.
good,Management is fine and easy to get along with. Customer base was heavily business type. Most days I would leave work exhausted and ready for bed. Thick skin is a must.
good,"upper management lacked openness about future of company. did respond well to suggestions in workflow. infrastructure needed improvement when i worked there. network lacked capacity, and cramped cubicles created a claustrophobic atmosphere. overall experience good, but needed more responsiveness from management."
good,i learned how to deal with sales. The management was rough at times but overall the managers were good at their jobs. The hardest part of the job was dealing with sales because sometimes you get the customers that don't want the warranties and it would make it hard for you. The most enjoyable part of the job was the discounts.
good,"always had a job to get done"
good,"This company runs on typical warehouse operations and functions, if you are skilled in logistics and have an eve for detail this would be a good fit for you. They were able and willing to work with my schedule. They listened to suggestions, but may not have always acted on them. the company was fair to work for overall and I'm glad I had the opportunity to work there."
good,This job is very demanding but also very rewarding and enjoyable. It takes a very strong level headed leader who can manage a team and multiple projects as well as liason between clientele and outside sources.
good,"Staples is flexible with hours, for example I worked 25 hours at Staples and attended school for 15 hrs. They were able to find shifts that worked with the nigh classes I had to attend. The work itself is rather easy, the only thing that could be difficult at times is the customers."
good,Enjoyed working there.  Other employees were always easy to work with.  Insurance was good for full time employees.  Working conditions were always good.
good,"Like any other workplace, you have to move around a lot. You have to take in consideration that there are people that need help as well as trying to restock the aisles in a fast pace to free up space in the loading dock. Check out and offer discounts to customers so that they have a great shopping experience. They let you know what you did wrong and also go the mile to appreciate you at the end of the month with a meeting well at my Staples store. But I'm guessing at all Staples stores too. Overall a good place to start working if you really want to get some experience."
good,a day at staples is easy. all i have to do is make sure my department is clean. i have to sell technology and make sure they have a protection plan on it.
good,Working in Staples as a co-op student has been good to me so it got me into a work environment and how it feels. In the period as a co-op student I learned about customer service and scanning items
good,was a great place to work. I spent 20 years there. I would still be there if my job had not been eliminated. The most enjoyable part was the customers.
good,Staples is a job for people who like customer service and im one of those peopl...it is an easy going environment and the hrs are flexible and they are understanding
good,"Arrive early, ensure that the operation is running properly and work with my team to maximize the work day to service our customers. Review metrics to help make adjustment when needed to help achieve the goals desired. Handle any all employee issue that may arise through my day."
good,"Staples requires the same as any retailer in that you must stock product, you must help customers, you must keep the store clean. In addition, you must learn about computer hardware and software in order to talk intelligently with the customers. The company provides formal training on products, but you will learn just as much from other associates."
good,Staples has been a fantastic place to hone a few key skills in today's society. The company regularly checks up with you in making sure you know your role as well as offers real support from management on a regular basis.
good,"no day was the same although the tasks were the same:  consulting (in person and via e-mail) and creating the customer's copy center order, ship center, bookkeeping, recycling."
good,Staff was great hours was parttime I was able to move up in position I was still attending school so couldnt move up in position I left for better intrest in what I went to school for .
good,"learned how to be a part of a team and work with others, being responsible, learning and becoming more comfortable with interactions one on one. Learned how to become a leader not a follower."
good,was good first job experience as a team and for starting to move towards goals i want to succeed with. stocking moving and cleaning. rearranging  stations and building projects desks ect
good,"A typical day on the job involved boxes being broken down, machine operations, sometimes even new skills gained, and then some. The management team was very helpful and in demand. Not much of a strenuous job if to as me. Certainly enjoyed my time there."
good,I enjoyed working here and I learned a lot from my coworkers. It was interesting to understand how large corporations operate on a smaller level. This was an important experience for me because I learned a lot about retail and customer service.
good,B2B roles at Staples are inside/outside that almost anyone can do. It is an entry level sales position that focuses on selling office supplies to local businesses. Fun work environment!
good,"Customer service for the last several years.  Set up, install, copy center, assist customers with purchases.  Every day retail work. "
good,A typical work day would consist on servicing clients' electronic devices who were submitted for work. Also selling products and restocking were daily task expected of associates.
good,"Fun place to work, employees were friendly, customers needs were met. Kept you on your feet. Very organized place. I stocked shelves, cleans, and worked a cash register."
good,"Dealt with customer enquiries and complaints face-to-face and over the telephone, resolving any issues quickly and efficiently and rarely had to escalate them to management to resolve. A brilliant job."
good,"I worked at Staples part-time (Little more than a year)"
good,"- Not the best pay"
good,Veldig fornøyd med denne arbeidsplassen. Var først utplassert og fikk jobb etterpå. Totalt sett var dette en veldig fin jobb.
good,Great place to work management made it a fun place to work. Competition was a ongoing culture at my store. Must be able to sale and have a pleasant personality.
good,"I enjoyed helping small business owners with their needs.  It was fast paced, and the company treats its employees pretty well.  I worked with and for some amazing people during my time there."
good,"I've had the privilege to work at Staples Business Advantage for the past 15 years and have seen the many changes that have taken place in the office products industry.."
good,"Staples is a great place to work, but is also a rapidly changing company. There is growth opportunities for an individuals willing to invest in themselves while also investing in the companies vision."
good,This was also a job I enjoyed working at with an environment that promoted independent thinking and teamwork with a very open forum for you to communicate with those in any position.
good,It is a cool place to work if you mainly want to do graffic design or just something to have. you learn how to deal with customers. how to make cards and books.
good,At this company you will grow  and it doesn't matter what department your in there is a push to grow and go higher. I learn a lot from being in mostly all the departments in the company. The work culture is great. The most enjoyable part of this company is that you can GROW.
good,"I loved my job & my coworkers! The main warehouse manager was part of my decision to quit. Wish i woulda stuck it out at Staples in Eugene, Oregon! I had trained for 6 positions in a 5 week period due to other employees quiting & I absolutely loved the work I did & how much I learned while employed there!"
good,"it is a good place to work with fun employees and great employer/employee relationship. The work load is reasonable and sometimes the customers are easy to communicate with. However, they do not have good benefits given their pay rates."
good,"As a college graduate, it was a very good position to start. I learned a lot about problem solving and working with Account Representatives and Executives."
good,"The home office was very involved with every store location, we received regular visits and feedback. There was never any question of which direction the company wanted their stores to go."
good,Its a great place for high school or college age kids to get a part time job. Definitely not a place to go if you are looking for full time work. Not really a family friendly place to work.
good,Just okay. Print and marketing section was stressful. Advancement began to become hard because they started to take away the supervisor roles in my store.
good,"It was enjoyable working here for the time being I learned a lot about computers and software that I originally didn't know which was great, the staff was hands on as well."
good,"good place to work, also an nice atmosphere, team players, managers very supportive, nice benefits, help you with college, good job for first experience."
good,"I love this company! Job was challenging and worthwhile. Changes occur often. Must be adaptable. Goals are hard to reach, but attainable. Customers in the queue usually have a positive attitude while interacting with specialists."
good,"Great job to have for someone who is just starting out in the work industry, who is not is not sure what kind of career path they are wanting to take."
good,"On a typical day of work usually went really well and was a fun job to work learned how to use a computer system to scan in stocking items, the work place was good to work in fans all the way around and in the winter time there was heat, management was very understanding about things that happen in everyday life."
good,"It's Not the worst department store to work at. has like 2 busy seasons otherwise it gets pretty boring throughout the day. not a whole lot to do, but because of under staffing you have to do everything opening and closing."
good,It’s a good company I learned a lot from that client I learned many thing from project manager I thought of continuing with this company  we are unable to do .
good,Staples is going through a massive transition right now. Job security feels  like it is in the balance and  your constantly looking over your shoulder
good,Management was involved with the personal growth of each individual working in the store.  Work was standard retail environment.  You were expected to add on sales to the base sale of a product.  Often I would feel uncomfortable selling a 26 dollar USB cable for a printer.  Some days were very fun as management allowed for some wiggle room for their employees.  Some days can be frustrating depending on customer attitudes.  Wages for employees started at minimum wage and went up depending on employee performance.  It was a fair system however the amount your wage went up was almost negligible.  Think 20 - 30 cents per review.
good,Surrounding Staples in two different Staples I was on the truck team I enjoy doing that I learned about stock the people there were good we weren't good together it's was a good experience for me.
good,I really enjoyed working here. My coworkers became some of my best friends. There was advancement opportunities which was great! I would recommend this job to anyone!
good,Everyone was great to work with.  Very family friendly and great work life balance.  Unfortunately the pay scale was a little on the lower end and the health insurance was pretty expensive.
good,I had a good time working here. I learned a lot about technology and types of products out there. Staff and Managers were very friendly and welcoming.
good,Staples is an ok place to work mostly for college people or people who can't work very many hours. Some mangers are great and some employees are good 6o work with.
good,"I will start by saying that I have only worked at the Keene, NH store, and I've heard things to suggest that we're unusual. I can't speak to all locations, just my own."
good,"Overall a strong company."
good,"The environment was really good, the people were actually pretty nice. The business was well put together and clean. The workplace culture was great and the diversity was outstandingly good."
good,"I was at Staples for two years. Like all corporate environments, there are good people and people you want to avoid. My boss is one of the people you want to avoid. "
good,"Overall, I liked the job a lot. I think the management and the other staff were great to work with and conflict was handled well. I will say that hours were hard to come by, even if there were more hours that needed to be filled at times. However, I think this was because of myself and other employees being flaky, not because of the management."
good,"Nice job with interesting customers. Work can be overbearing, but does have periods of rest. Copy center is always busy, Tech center is quick to help, and registers lines are quick to clear."
good,"With the experience of the years you understand better your job and can work most of the time almost independent. Never known the ending time, depends the volume of each day. Very good peers very friendly people"
good,"fun place to work, but not enough hours and pay rate was low. "
good,"I order to advise you must be able to adapt to the culture, which depends on states and depatment your in . If you able to do this you will  succeed.."
good,Staples was an amazing job this is where i learned my customer service. it was a fast paced job but very competitive. But also very friendly some times it can be slow.
good,Staples is a great place to learn valuable customer service skills. The managers and co-workers there are very good teachers and will assist you whenever you may need it.
good,Staples is a good place to start out for a first job.  After that the career advancement is limited.  The warehouse is a good place to go.  They have competitive pay and lots of different jobs at different levels.
good,no review required for this job i worked there it was ok. i only was there for a month not a long time and i don't have anything else to say about it.
good,I really enjoyed working for Corporate Express as a office manager. The only down fall is when the company had to relocate due to being bought out by staples
good,"Typical retail duties involved helping customers, restocking the products, working on the till, keeping the shop tidy. Minimum wage, both part time and full time work available. Supportive and helpful management staff."
good,The sales manager position at Staples was what you would typically expect. You work with the sales force in order to make sure that your team is up to date on the current sales promotions. You assume role of MOD when the store manager is not in the building and open and close the store on a regular basis.
good,"I was employed by Staples for over eleven years in various sales roles, and I always felt that the company provided invaluable tools and training in order to create an environment of professional success, opportunity and advancement. Leadership was always willing listen to feedback and develop strategies that enabled our company to be an industry leader in an increasingly competitive market. I enjoyed my time with the company, and would recommend working with Staples to peers."
good,"I prefer to work at warehouse."
good,good job to have if you are looking for a better job for yourself. you just need to find the right group of people to work with. the past few months have been in an uproar because almost all the high level store people had left for better jobs.
good,"This company, or at least my managers, have been very good to me over the time I have worked here. The environment is very relaxed. We are expected to know our jobs and are given the freedom to do them."
good,It’s cool place to work depending on your manager. Just come to on time be prepared and customer focused. Daily maintenance is the hardest part of the job.
good,its laid back and balanced. Pay was not adequate for the dept i was in. The point system needs to go. certain people are allowed to be late daily but others are not and suffer for it.
good,"I worked part-time, mostly evenings and weekends. The job consisted of diagnosing and repairing customer PCs, as well as offering sales advice and recommending products and services."
good,My typical day is checking any orders that have to be produced for businesses both big and small. Maintain a clean and safe copy center environment for both employees and customers alike.
good,loved the people hated the job constantly changing its policies and benefits.I was with the company for 5yrs the first 3 months i got 3 raises then at the end the most i got from a raise was .17 cents. The last straw was when a highschooler fresh out got paid the same amount as me when ive been there for five yrs when asked for a raise or compensation i was declined manger said i had to wait til next yr for a promotion.
good,Very competitive plenty of room for advancement with the company. Friendly staff and customers and wonderful discounts on office supplies. Easy to get to location also.
good,"Staples is a good company to work for, they expect you to know your tasks and job and to do them in a timely manner."
good,"liked the people that work there full of character definitely worked with a lot of hard workers, I was put on a great route, great pay, enjoyed working there."
good,"Staples Advantage was a good place to work, great training and great management.  Always helped when I needed it.  Very flexible with any need you may have."
good,"A typical day at work is being on the floor, stocking and assisting customers. Also going up to the front to ring out customers. We also do planograms and endcaps."
good,"Even though you are being paid to sell office supplies to the public, the best way to survive in the business is to connect both professionally and casually with your coworkers.  The General Manager will likely be very sales-driven and not always emotionally available.  On an ideal day, all employees take their jobs seriously, do not complain, and help each other when needed.  Something as simple as taking a customer service call for the cashier when the cashier is very busy is a great feeling.  One of the most important things I've learned from working retail is that your experience of the job is what you bring to it.  Get to bed on time.  Stay focused.  Give people the benefit of the doubt.  Eat breakfast.  Count your blessings..."
good,"This was one of my favorite jobs ever. I had the greatest hours ever for a retail job. The management staff was awesome, We made the work environment fun. inventory was always the hardest part of the job."
good,"It's a good place to work."
good,"Staples as a company should be widely for high schoolers and fresh out of high school.I was sorta fresh from high school there. I am looking for a position within a company where I can contribute and grow. I realized that the opportunity to grow wasn’t available to me and that in order to continue to improve myself professionally, it was time to move on. Although it was a good job, I felt as though I had learned everything I could and wanted to move on to a new company where I can continue to grow professionally."
good,Great to work with Customers enjoyed learning how to upsell and do inventory on the store. Crew was great and always got along management was always willing to help
good,"This is a great environment to work, and you are continuously trained to keep up with new developments/policies in the workplace."
good,"Especially for students looking for part-time work. Good hours, steadily easy work to get done. & possible opportunity for growth within the company as well."
good,"It is a productive, friendly, fun place to work for. It provides many opportunities to enhance your career. It's a team player oriented company. I have nothing else to add at this time."
good,"Staples is a great company to begin a career. There are numerous ways to advance or gain experience to use in later stages of professional growth. "
good,"It's a great environment to work in, everyone is willing to lend a hand and help you learn your position. The managers are more than willing to help when they can. Super friendly people to work with."
good,good company to work for. Treats staff well. Competitive pay. I enjoyed being the operations manager I like to fix processes and have them work efficiently.
good,Staples is filled with talented and ambitious people from all over the country/world coming from other great companies. the experience you get working alongside people of such caliber is a unique experience matched by very few. I have learned just as much about business and how to navigate around conflicts and issues to strive to the top all from being a Staples employee just as much as reading any book or attending a seminar. i would highly recommend anyone to work fro Staples if they want to be challenged and work for and with the best.
good,working for staples is ok. I will not go into much on working there. Staples is ok. It has it issues just like any other company and they seem to be working on it.
good,Staples treats their employees well.  Working in collections can be stressful but the company helps make it better with the fun events and togetherness.  Rewards and recognition is great.  Really good company!
good,"enjoyed working, nice work place and co workers were awesome, got an understanding of the call center environment. management was helpful and gave good training."
good,"I have followed my GM to two cities. This is my work family, and it truly is an amazing place to work for, I have never been treated unfairly or poorly and work closely with my management team."
good,"A typical day was very rewarding. I really enjoyed customer service, meeting and talking with new people all day. The workplace was fun and productive. I got to learn about your typical cash register which is handy to know, and other machines such as fax machines, printers, ect. The best part was the social environment, the worst part was having to leave for high paying jobs."
good,It is a competitive place to work but also fun. You make good friends and over all job satisfaction. The managers are great and great to work with they help you along with what you need.
good,A pretty good company to work for. I would still be there if they wouldn't have closed the warehouse. They had sufficient breaks and the pay was good.
good,it  was  good   pretty  good  environment     learned  about  selling   customer  service   the  most  enjoyable  part  of  this  job  was  assisting  customers  and interacting  with them
good,"Management training program was excellent, their training programs for hourly associates was sufficient for their job duties, the interaction with customers was the most rewarding part of the job."
good,"Staples in relaxed, laid back.  if you do your job there is nothing to be considered about. Management is very understanding, willing to work with someone that may need special hours or to make up hours."
good,"The overall experience here was great. I learned a lot of a new things by this being my first job. The hours typically were good. Management wasn't the best while I was working there, but I hear they have gotten much better. It sometimes seemed to be a bit of unintentional discrimination going aroud, but not so much to the point that I felt uncomfortable in the workplace."
good,"Started as a cashier in 2004, and over the years with college developed into a supervisor and manager. Focusing on sales, coaching staff, using metrics to hit budget and be successful."
good,The quarters were cramped but it was always productive and the team members were very supportive. The job supported walk-in customers and provided desk-side assistance.
good,"Staples Business Marketing Representative was a fun position developing, building, establishing new and existing business accounts.  Marketing using  product presentations and closing sales leads."
good,Very customer service work environment. Hard work and reliability rewarded with promotion to limited number of full time positions per store. Highly recommend for anyone with retail/tech experience looking for advancement with in company.
good,can be a great work environment. can get pretty busy and stressful at time but as long as everyone is working together you get through it and things finish up well at the end of the day.
good,"Large selection of office products, computers and office furniture. Full service Copy Center. Values are mixed but you can always find a good deal - the fun is in the search."
good,Great company to work for. There is always room for advancement within the company. There is never a dull moment working with the fast pace fast pace.
good,"This was a typical customer service job. I worked here in highschool, working around 25 hours a week. I loved one of my bosses, he was awesome. It was a hard place to work since it was a corporate job and wasnt as personal of an experience."
good,"Staples has been an excellent place to work in so far. Within the location I work in the management makes sure to be functional, but doesn't push their employees to the point of exhaustion or being sick. They care about their workplace. "
good,"* good work/life balance"
good,environnement très compétitif vis a vis les ventes avec une excellente équipe
good,"A typical day at work involved selling electronics, repairing customers hardware, stocking the floor, and working the register. I was pretty savvy with computers going into the job, so it all came natural to me. The hardest part was definitely dealing with the customers when their device wasnt repairing properly or having issues. Most of the time it could be fixed, but we had to ask for permission which usually ended with more questions and confusion. The most enjoyable part was working as a team to tackle issues and meet sales goals. It was a great group of guys."
good,"For the most part, Staples is a great place to work. But the only main issue I really had with the company, is that they expect so much out of you, but don't nearly pay you enough."
good,Enjoyed my tenure at Staples.   Had some outstanding managers.  Would absolutely consider another position.   Best part was the dedicated employees I had the pleasure of working with either direct reports or across the entire organization.
good,Staples is a comfortable environment. The people are friendly and informative. The job isn't complicated and the training is very thorough and knowledgable
good,Learned many selling strategies along with the responsibilities of an outside sales representative. Responsible for scheduling and attending meetings with local business owners to win their business. Management is extremely helpful and motivating. The hardest part of this job is there are a lot of competitors out there doing the same thing we do. This job is very enjoyable because you create your own success.
good,"Good atmosphere and culture"
good,"Great company with great customers. Back to school was a busy time with great deals for the customers. Christmas was a breeze for a retail store, but ran out of sale items at times"
good,"As a Inventory Specialist you are responsible for Supervising Office Supplies, Inventory Management, Key Holder, and being Manager On Duty when necessary."
good,I enjoyed working with my team in the store. The problem with this job is the same as any retail job not being paid enough for what you are doing for the store.
good,Each day was not like the last. There was generally always something for me to do. They asked me to stay longer but I needed to go back to school in the Fall
good,I enjoyed my short time working there. The people I worked with made it realistic. The GM was very understanding. CP supervisor worked with you and helped you to understand what you are working with.
good,Great place to work associates are very friendly and helpful .management team always there to help. there are opportunities for advancement its a great workplace.
good,"If you are in the Print & Marketing or Easy Tech department, you job can be stressful. Its a great environment to learn how well you work with other and how you react to deadlines"
good,"its retail, just with a focus on the home office and school supply needs of consumers. Only real issue with organization is their management staff can be hit or miss. As with many retailers, they always see their Store Manager as the best of the best. Often times this is an oversight. The leadership is better in the next tier down. This causing unrest and a goal to make everyone miserable, find the blame, and get rid of the competition."
good,"Overall was a good first job experience. I was hired as a Tech Sales Associate. Staples gives paid training which is great because it just means you get paid to just sit in a room and click along with their training videos (aka easy money). My supervisor was really great and did a good job teaching me but I think he has left to do bigger and better things now. I learned a lot about customer relations but not as much as I hoped about technology; I learned more about how to sell a piece of technology better than how the technology actually functioned. Still a fun job though; the coworkers were definitely the best part. They are all cool in their own weird, quirky ways."
good,"You start work at 8am till whenever you finish doing all your stops."
good,Working here helped me with my patience. Some people would come into the store angry because their product isn't working or the lines are too long etc. But overall a cool environment.
good,"the culture is very nice. Co-workers are wonderful to work with. Learned alot about time management, direction. Most enjoyable part of my job was helping others."
good,"Not a bad place to work supervisors were cool "
good,The company was like a family. As a Staples associate I completed the typical work day. Maintained a clean and working environment. Greeted guest with a warm welcome. Assisted customers with finding a specific product. Processed money transactions. Answered all calls and assisted customers. I disliked the cooperation when it came to working around my school schedule.
good,The work environment is excellent and management is very supportive when it comes to family issues.  Wish I could have stayed on permanent.  The culture is great and they are involved in the community.
good,I enjoyed working for the company but when company moved away everyone was left behind. Was up for the next position of supervisor and was willing to take on the task at hand.
good,"Met great people at these location, some ups and downs but the learning experience was great will always have fond memory working at these places.  Love my employess."
good,"What I enjoyed most were the people I worked with, getting to know the customers, ensuring customers left the store with what they needed (or knew how/where to get it), and learning as many of the areas of the store as I could (cashier, sales, stocking, cash office, print & marketing, price auditing).  Some of the most difficult parts of the job were understaffing and technology that could not keep up with customer or employee demands. Overall, the management treated us very well and we all seemed to get along pretty well."
good,"The day to day is pretty typical of a retail outlet nothing groundbreaking to mention."
good,"Staples was a good job, it had a strong team environment. Management was great or ok depending on your supervisor. I would work for them in the future"
good,It's a good job. Managers are very nice. Coworkers are generally pretty good. The discounts are really nice there. Good environment and advancement opportunities.
good,"good at sales n distribution, one of the top companies in australia. Friendly atmosphere with good wages n 5 day week. no wrok pressure all the time, only during busy schedules. only day shift."
good,Always something to do. You have to know all the departments. Enjoy working with everyone. You always have to stay up on technology. Never enough hours in the day to get things done.
good,overall its a good place to work compared to the other warehouses in the area.fast paced. but relaxing.  management is relaxed not pushie.  the y have great attitudes. are fun to be around.  they grow on you fast.  no hard part of the job.  y=the job is enjoyable all the time . unless something breaks down and have to hand do everything which takes longer to process the orders then everyone gets upset and it starts showing in actions
good,great sales environment for self motivated individuals that are attempting to provide a little extra income. Managers and employees alike enjoy working for hickory farms
good,"the people you work with makes the job great"
good,"Wonderful experience, management very personable and  flexible.  Great team to work with on floor; train well, and encouraging for advancement within departments."
good,Staples in Surrey is a great experience that has opened me to a wide and diverse range of customers and has helped me grow my interpersonal skills greatly. Management is kind and will genuinely put forward their best effort to help the employees or customer.
good,"A typical work day is working throughout the floor helping the customer and making sure the product is in the correct spot and priced correctly. There are four main areas of the store. Easy Tech, Copy Center, Sales floor, and register."
good,"Achieved high sales percentage with consultative, value-focused customer service approach."
good,I have learned how to use the cash system at Staples I like cashing out people's items because it is easy to do. I am still learning where all the items are located in the store but I am getting more confident where things belong. It is a great place to work.
good,Awesome place to work staff is very friendly and understanding as long as you show up and work you will have a job  I can honestly say it's a good company to be with
good,"Nice company to work for. Management is understanding. Lots of benefits. If you are a student, they work with your schedule. Hours are more flexible than most other jobs."
good,"it was nice to get a foot in the door straight out of school. Not everywhere will give people who have no experiance a chance, i did start as sale associate, but it didn't last long as i have my degree in IT anyway. they wanted me to get the hang of things from any position in the store almost."
good,"I great job for anyone looking for a retail position.  The company offers many opportunities for advancement."
good,"A Typical day at work meant dealing with customers in a warm and friendly environment.

People constantly call out and when you are the manager more than likely you must cover duties of manager and associate.

I left the company for school out of state and they got me a cake and gift cards to buy school supplies. When I got back for summer break they instantly re-hired me to work for the summer and were just as amazing. The upper management seems to be a little more difficult and unorganized.

Managers were great but had high expectations for warranty sales and would often give almost unrealistic sales goals.

good,"From my experience at Staples, there is room for promotions and with the right management staff  Staples is a great company to work for.  I have been fortunate enough to have very supportive managers, I'm not to sure about other locations.  My managers have always had my back, and supported me in any decisions.  They do not belittle you for errors, but instead coach you to do the right thing for future situations.  I love that they offer benefits to both part time and full time  employees.  Sometimes they expect a lot and don't pay enough, but you can always try and ask for a pay raise, if you feel you are deserving of it and they will look at it and take it to consideration ( I know from experience).  I work with a lot of great individuals.  The hardest part of this job, is probably the customers, but that comes with all retail jobs.  You just got to learn to kill'em with kindness.  and they usually will work with schedule if you have kids or are in school."
good,"Enjoyed working with the public."
good,"Overall good people  and good management , good pay good benefits"
good,I enjoy working at Staples because everyone I work with always has a positive attitude. I've never heard anyone say that they hate working at Staples. But the thing I love the most is that my boss is very flexible with my schedule. He knows that I am a full time student first so he doesn't have me working 30+ a week like I did over the summer.
good,Staples is a great place to work.  It has a diverse environment.  It has allowed me to grow as an employee and embrace my opportunities.
good,"I enjoyed working at staples; however, the pay should have been much better for the amount of work that you do."
good,A typical day at work is managing multiple projects at once that are all very high prority.  I've learned how to juggle everything at the same time and keep everything moving without dropping the ball.  My co-workers are wonderful.  The hardest part of the job is traveling so much.  The most enjoyable part of the job is resolving complex problems.
good,Very comfortable environment to work in. If you're willing there's a lot you can learn from an office point of view.
good,It was all a learning process learning how to deal with people and satisfy there needs. This was basically my first step into my job experience. It was short and brief but a good start.
good,While working at Staples I had a great experiance. I was able to work with good managment and associates. Staples has a great work and safety culture.
good,Assist customers with any inquiry they may have as well as place sales orders for them while offering promotions and up-sales. This being done over the phone with helpful management and team oriented goals. The most enjoyable part of the job is reaching goals and earning incentives for customer satisfaction.
good,"My day starts with checking the sales of the previous day, setting my goals and planning to achieve them. Then review the notes left from the previous technician to continue where he left off. I would focus on the work on my bench and get through required data wipes from returned items and cover sales floor breaks when needed."
good,A challenging and positive work environment.  Same basic work week and the people were great.
good,Learned necessary tools for business performance. Now I am fully familiar in all the tools companies need to function each day.
good,"Overall it is a decent company to work for.  I worked there for 9 years, and I worked full-time for a few years, then part-time when I went back to college.  They were great at working around my school schedule and giving me as many hours as possible.  Management was ok depending on which manager you worked with.  I learned many skills while I was there, mostly because I worked in the Copy Center, which allows you to learn sales techniques as well as basic computer and printing skills."
good,"Work is fun, always have something to do. TIme flies when ur busy. A work shift seems like only a couple hours cuz of the steady pace of work."
good,"Management was helpful, honest and open to ideas. It was a friendly work environment and everyone made a genuine effort to get to know one another and assist one another. The only drawback was a lack of challenging work, making things very routine and not very interesting. It was fun helping customers design products for their business in Copy and Print, and working in that department was a good way to get a feel for what it is like dealing with deadlines as well as building team communication skills."
good,"My typical day at work consisted of operating the forklifts, picking orders, working on the dock, and loading trucks.  I learned all the operations of a functioning warehouse. There was a great team atmosphere at my facility which is why we are consistently ranked as one of the top facilities in the company.  Working 5 nights a week was starting to become a bit exhausting and I am just looking to work more preferable hours."
good,"Took this job to be employed after being laid off.  Was in the copy department so got some experience with copiers, binding machines, laminator, etc.  Co-workers were fun to work with, but I didn't like the retail scheduling required."
good,"Staples was one of the best companies to work with. A fun workplace environment, management was very helpful in fact one of the best management I have ever seen. Continuous learning everyday    , customers profiles, up selling, cross selling, etc. Most enjoyable part was the training period learned lot of things along with doing fun."
good,"My experience at Staples given me insight of how a job can produce sales but at the same time can make a great experience for customers. I learned how to effectively manage our inventory stock in the store and to organize where the product goes. Helping the customer was a key priority and that is what I believe set us apart from other office supply stores. Since we have many sales throughout the year, it can be very difficult at times especially at peak seasons of back-to-school and Christmas which could be the same situation at most retail jobs but the lack of new workers at those times make our jobs much more challenging to face every costumer equally. The atmosphere at this job is very nice as the goal of every day at Staples is to make the customer satisfied, it is not to say that managers still do have a strong goal to get the most out of every customer. Protection Plans gives little incentive to sell yet managers push you every day to sell plans with every furniture and technology purchase. Other than those things I felt my time working at Staples given me experience of working with people with a broad range of backgrounds and many different questions of items I have never heard of until this job. Even with many challenging issues, I still think my three years at Staples gave me the needed experience for my first job to start my career in life. "
good,"I didn't have a problem while I worked at Staples. The only problem was my store didn't get a lot of business. So that meant I didn't get a lot of hours and it was often very boring. That would have to be my only complaint. It's a nice little job to have while you're in school. One other bad thing is that the store is so big with such a variety of things. So in order to adequately help the customer, you had to kind of know a little about everything and you had to know where everything was in that big store."
good,"Open or closing store, all cash procedures, running sales floor, managed associates on sales floor and production area, inventory, cycle counts and plan o grams"
good,"Ive only worked for staples for about 4 or 5 months now and I have to say this is a great job for someone starting out in this area. The hours are grea, the workplace is too. "
good,"The good:"
good,"This company asks too much of you for too little pay.  The stores are staffed with very few employees,  because of this you need to do the work of 2-3 people.  "
good,"One will be on the phones all day apeaking to new or exsisting clients. However, you need to make sure your stats are good or they will fire you. The base pay was great and if one worked very hard one will receive great monthly bonus."
good,"On a typical day working for staples I would often be walking in to the lions den.I would come in at any time after my last class to piled up jobs orders and a growing line of consumers. My duties included customer service and consultation, multitasking (running multiple copy order, fulfilling large scale print orders assisting self service customers, faxing and ringing out customer). Many people don't realize it's a fast paced industry and it's very demanding. It was very difficult but very rewarding."
good,This is a good place to work for if you looking for a career in sales. You get to interact with customer on a daily basis. 
good,"My typical day involved assisting customers with PC issues. Installing and repairing Windows OS. Removing viruses and repairing any other PC problems. Going to customer/businesses to perform onsite repairs and setups."
good,"Imitative for the future, Fresh new ideas, new business. Create great Customer service."
good,"Interacting with multiple customers to assist them with their orders. Ive learned to multitask very well, and I've learn how to time manage. The co-workers and the management team are great. The most enjoyable part of this job is meeting different people and getting a chance to make they're life easier by simply producing a great product for their business, wedding or any event they may have."
good,"My sincerity and dedication gave me the promotion as an Inventory Control Specialist where I Learned new skills like time management,how to meet deadlines,Inventory control, loss prevention."
good,"Make your skills and talents standout and you are surely to receive recognition, either through an award or promotion. Hard work and consistency gets paid here."
good,"good pace, learned how to operate equiptment and to become a better worker. For management wise good communication and co workers are a great team. Theres nothing hard about the job just always little challenges but communication is key to get around any obstacles. The most enjoyable part of the job is the great environment and surroundings."
good,I loved working for this company. I enjoyed my hours of work. I had an option to work from home. I was recongnized for the excellent work I provided. This company did weekly Quality Assurance. Monitoring calls to ensure a high level of customer service was upheld. My scores were always within the 100% to 98%. There are opportunities to branch out and advance. Which I did after one year. The work environment was very pleasant and fun. I learned alot from this company and was asked to mentor and assist with new hire classes. Managers were encouraging and assissted in anyway to help you advance. I enjoyed helping the customers and resolving there issues. I would recommend this company as a great place to work.
good,"Working at Staples was real fun . Even though it was seasonal, i still had an good experience . I got along with all my co-workers as well as the managers."
good,Typical day at work is dealing with customers who are in a rush and very impatient. What I have learned in working here is to have a lot of patients and always keep the customers interests in mind. The management team at Staples is very friendly and they really listen to what their employees have to say. They take majority of things into considerations. The hardest part of my job is dealing with unresponsive customers. Trying to help them in any way possible and you get no feedback from the customers. But I would have to say that the most enjoyable part of my job is dealing with different customers and seeing their business grow with the advertising staples copy center produces for them.
good,"My typical work day would include: unloading semi trucks and PO receiving, along with assisting out on the sales floor and cashiering. Management was very fair and equal."
good,Had a great experience and time working there.
good,was very open and great
good,"Great management team, you can ask them anything and they'll give you an answer."
good,"On the up-and-up. Uniform policy in place, but not consistently enforced, especially when it comes to black socks. Not a lot of national support and advertising."
good,very professional managers work for Staples with a vast amount of experience and knowledge
good,"I have the privilege to work with a great group of people in the Customer Insights department at Staples. My job is to make various aspects of Staples easier to use for its customers and employees; this includes all customer touchpoints (the store, the website, marketing vehicles, etc.). The hardest part of my job, but also the most rewarding, is convincing our partners in other parts of the company of the value of user research, since value cannot always be measured by ROI. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with a multidisciplinary team and reaching or exceeding our end goal, whether it be increased sales, CSAT, or something else unexpected."
good,"Excellent associates, hard working people and not a bad company to work for."
good,A typical day consists of in-taking computers with problems ranging from failed hard drives to missing drivers. The management makes the job really enjoyable at times. While there is some downtime the operations of the store always keep you busy. My co-workers are awesome people for the most part and don't mind helping out when things get hectic. The hardest part of the job is back-to-school season because of the traffic during these times. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting customers computers back to the way they should be!
good,I have enjoyed moving up at Staples and gaining experience for the past 7 years.
good,"I worked customer service, helping with returns and other needs of our guests. I learned to be patient with guests who were not happy with occasional equipment problems, or product failures. Management usually let us do our jobs without much help, once we were trained. My co-workers were helpful to each other, and nice. The hard part of the job was the scheduling of hours. I enjoyed helping people find what the needed."
good,"im the one whos always singing ...out of key but singing none the less,a typical day at work its rather quiet unless its back to school,ill cash out or do returns for a lot of pleasnt customers or very upset rude customers but i am a very positive person so why not give them a smile warm there heart a little,if u respect while someones being rude thats your battle won,ive learnt that it doesnt take much to put your self oout there and be your self which most of my associate are i think to worried that someones going to say oh look at her or dont do that im myself all the time at staples my bosses love me for it,my co workes are sweet mellow but sweet the hardest part of my job learning copy which i still im every chance i get not becasue im suppose to becausae i want to.the most enjoyable part of my job doing isles i jus amin my own world helping customers,singin and dancing down isles while restocking"
good,"I learned quite a bit from them. i learned inventory management, payroll, how to train other employees, i started there when i was 18 and worked there until 30.lots of great co-workers. i learned how to run a multi million dollar businesss with the great training.The hardest part of the job was when new RVP took over and took stores that ran on 700 hours to 500, and expected the same results, so if you were in a busy store like i was at times it made it very difficult to keep up the standards, if you were in a low volume store it wasnt bad."
good,Did inventory count and got updates on promos in morn meeting . Team members always helping.
good,Great opportunities for advancement. Great training and leadership.
good,"Good Employment, Very Competitive and enjoyed working for company."
good,"A typical day was repetitive as any other day. Mornings would be getting drawers balance and put out, out of stock item filled or tags if we were actually out of stock. The management team was great and fair, I was a part of the management team, we provided fair scheduling, time off and showed a lot of empathy towards our associates. The hardest part of the job was seeing someone go whether it was letting someone go or losing someone to another company. The most enjoyable part of the day was hitting our numbers in every aspect on a daily basis, this told us we have a great team and are doing what we are suppose to beyond what we are expected to."

Management addressed every concern and gave incentives for hard work. Most coworkers work well as a team.

The most enjoyable part of my job was working as a team and getting our job done in a timely manner

good,"A typical day at work for me would include coming in at 8 am every morning to open the store. I normally start my day off by reviewing any notes left from the night before. Then I attend to anything noted. After I print off reports that I need, such as VIBE reports. I check out my department. I'm the electronics lead so I focus in that direction. Typically I'll make sure everything is clean and the shelves are filled. Then I go into more projects such as planograms. Since I am a keyholder of the store, I have access to every lock, lock rooms, cages, cabinets and lockers. I also have ""numbers"", meaning I can perform manager overrides. I like my management team, everyone works good together. I think that is because my GM is absolutely amazing and she resolves any issues immediately. The hardest part of my job is balancing out tasks because I'm constantly being called to help with management duties such as overrides, getting items out of locked rooms etc. However even with the obstacles I manage to finish all my daily task in a timely manner. What I enjoy most about my job is the positive feedback I get from my team. We all work together and make our workplace welcoming. Customer always mention that our store is very welcoming and I'm proud of that. We work hard, every single one of us and we get recognition. The only reason I would leave is to get a job in the field I'm certified in. Considering I'm paying off student loans, I would love to start my career."
good,"run day by day business operations. hiring,training,coaching and developing, customer service satisfaction"
good,I learned a lot from this place all the managers and co-workers are persons that were always willing to teach you every step and tips to succeed.

good,Always busy fast paced good benefits never boring always something new the days flew by
good,My typical work day would be in the Copy and Print Center taking in orders and producing them for the customers. I learned about different office equipment and software that I had to use and was to really see what the customer needs. My management was very knowledgeable and helpful for the most part. The hardest part about the jobs was when there was a big order that we had to make in a very short time. Sometimes I was the only one working on it while trying to take care of the customers for that day. I really enjoyed working with the people I did and it was so good to be apart of a team.
good,"I have learned how to manage the bank and cash handling with this job, assisted clients with product details. Assisted clients with their projects and printing services. Directed customers calls and customer service."
good,"The hardest part of the job is when there is no customers. I have learned how to manage the bank and cash handling with this job, assisted clients with product details as being a product consultant. There were no co-workers, one person works one shift at a time."
good,"Typical day at work at staples is usually helping tons of customers. You take orders for the print shop through out the day and also work with computers as well. The things i did learn was how to bind books,laminate things and become a very good listener."
good,"I started as a part time electronic sales person and moved through the company to Sales Manager. The journey was not without it's bumps, but over-all it was a good experience. I also saw others advancing there careers along the same paths. As with any retail, the hours are hard and as a manager you will work very long hours. I always felt that the company valued my contributions and those of other employees."
good,A typical day involves helping customers find supplies for their home or business. the management team always supports and encourages me and fellow coworkers.
good,"staples, sadly doesn't offer the kind of vertical mobility I am seeking now that I've graduated collage, but was an incredibly stable and reasonable position for me during collage. they are very serious about training their technicians to a competitive level and i largely regard the training I received as the most valuable take away from the job itself."
good,"fun environment, competitive and educational. People were pleasant and work load was reasonable."
good,My typical day at Staples is helping all work at home agents if they are having system issues at home. I help to trouble shoot and determine if coming in the office is neccessary. I also coach to ensure great customer service is delivered to our customers. I have learned to coach effectively over the phone with webinar as all agents eventually work from home. My team won team of the year in 2010. We are like family at Staples and my co-workers all work together to ensure that we all contribute in our strongest points.The most challenging part of my job is working with the reporting that is offered to us. The team that supplies that reporting is a new team and is in the learning stage of what is needed. The most enjoyable part of the job is coaching and seeing the positive results of my team.
good,A typical day.
good,Working with different customers everyday. Helping them find the right products that are needed for their everyday use.
good,This was a pleasent place to work. Thier was a team atmospere in the building and everyone seemed to get along good.
good,"The day goes by very fast assisting customers and answering their questions with technology products.I learned to be a better leader while working here. Management is understanding and easy to talk with. Co workers are all amazing. The hardest part of the job is to be able to help out more than one customer at the same time when we they don't have enough people working. The most enjoyable part is selling products to people that they need and not because we want to get the sales up, its all about customer service."
good,"If you want to make this your career, you need to get into their manager trainee program. Otherwise, it is a good place to work and has advancement opportunity."
good,"I enjoy working at Staples. I have learned the Warehouse procedures, a VERY multitask environment. My co-workers are very helpful and GREAT. My managers has a STRICT policy on there ""open door"". There is nothing ""hard"" about the job. I know my responsibility and I know how to get my job done on time. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I have to help out an employee and that I've succeeded."
good,Staples organization is a good place to work.
good,A great company to work for. Unfortunately it is difficult when you have a sorry team and HR takes forever to get rid of them. But overall a great company with great benefits.
good,This job is demanding but very rewarding. It takes a while to become familiar with the machines and how to use them properly but training is provided and the company is interested in helping employees grow alongside it.
good,"Very good place to start your career. Company gives a lot of exposure. I learnt to sell a lot of different products since the company is offers a wide variety of products. Also, made many good connections with corporates."
good,"Great place to work. Great culture, managers and very flexible with the schedule. The only downfall is there is no commission made after sales, which leads to being unmotivated to sell."
good,The company places to the customer first and do  anuything to make the customer satisfied.  Take the time to  settle where the places are whlere all the products reside.
good,"Be on time, and do your best. You will get a lot of overtime, the mangers are easy to talk to. Good benefit. Everybody will a raise soon. The wearhouse is in a good location."
good,"I get along well with management and co-workers. Work can be challenging, but overall not too stressful. I enjoy helping customers find what they need."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time overall with Staples. Like any job, it had its ups and downs, but I'm happy to say that I look back on it fondly. I learned a lot during my time there and made some of my closest friends. In all honesty, the management at times could've definitely been more concise and focused, but the majority of the time was very objective-oriented."
good,"I have worked in three different Staples locations in CT (Wallingford, Newington and Middletown) and have had positive experiences with managment and customers. Hectic during back to school and tax time."
good,Great company to work for with excellent benefits. A work day consists of setting meetings with C-Level executives and discussing their business purchasing needs.
good,"I was surprised with how busy the print center is. I thought at first, with advances in technology we wouldn't need so many physical copies and faxes nowadays, so working in this department would be a breeze. I was 100% wrong. Almost every day there's a queue of 10+ people and some of them get impatient and rude, but you have to keep it together. If you struggle with shyness, anger outbursts, freak out under pressure, or feel like you need an extra push to get going, you won't make it. I've heard the print center has the highest employee turnover out of all departments because of how demanding it is. That being said, the employees and managers are kind and helpful with a good sense of humor."
good,Staples provides a very flexible schedule and they encourage you to push your limits in sales and teach you about electronics and day to day articles.
good,My time at Staples was typically fun and easy going. The entire staff was mostly easy to get along with and didn't engage in any outside the work place drama whatsoever. Management was impeccable with maybe one bad egg for the duration of my time there. It was easy to get shifts covered if need be and they more often than not gave me the scheduling I asked for. I would still work there had I not moved across town.
good,"All companies have their challenges but Staples got the culture right and is full of a ton of good people that work hard."
good,"love the work culture and management are helpful. i also like the personal time off and ability to work from home. a relaxed work culture, great place to learn"
good,Management was extremely flexible with my student hours and the employees were positive and accepting. Customer service what always 100% leaving almost no customer unsatisfied.
good,"While working at staples in Willowbrook Illinois, the staff was great and overall it was just a great job. We were all team orientated. Hours were consistent and flexible. The managers truly encouraged their employees to get better with sales in a positive way."
good,It’s a great store. It has a very nice system and clientele. The work is beneficial especially when needing of skill.....Great place!.................
good,Staples is een internationaal bedrijf waar ruimte is voor persoonlijke groei
good,Very team based work experience where working with others in the work place to help better customer service and experience was encouraged and enforced
good,I really enjoyed working for Staples because of the face to face contact you have with the customers.  It allow you to build a trusting relationship and bond with each and every customer on your route.  When you have that trust with customers it gives you more flexibility and enjoyment to meet all the customer needs.
good,Typically I was closer and would have to clean the store  (which I didn't mind). But it's a nice job for people looking to make some money. It's a nice paced area and everyone helps each other.
good,Staples is a great company that helped me develop as a manager over the years and also taught me a lot of lesson throughout my time with the company I am very great full
good,Had amazing management and was really taught how to sell at Staples Business Advantage.  Was really lucky to have one of the bet mentors there.  Training program taught me everything I needed to know.
good,"It was challenging and stressful job, but also there were lot of stress busters events year around in corporate office. Loved the Staples SOUL and way they treat and value their employees."
good,"Be upfront with your manager. They are willing to work around your schedule and have a consistent schedule week to week. Fun environment to work in and if you want to move departments you can. There is room for advancement. All managers are friendly. Regional manager comes in from time to time and genuinely cares about how you're doing at work. I would 100% recommend applying for a position in this company. I was an associate for over a year while I was in college, this was my first job and I LOVED it. Highly recommend."
good,Wages are based on city size not store volume. This can cause issues in high performing stores. As stores with lower volume can have a higher wage and perform poorly just do to being in a larger city.
good,Typical day at work was mostly laid back except during holiday and back to school. Managers always treated me well. Good job while I was in college. Working in the copy center was very rewarding.
good,"Company undergoing major restructuring and adding jobs in some areas, but cutting a lot of other jobs at the same time. Good place to work though. High turnover but you build a lot of good relationships."
good,"I enjoyed the team I worked with and the work performed. The company doesn't pay enough to live off of though. It is fine for a second job or part time for extra cash, but you would be hard pressed to make a living working here."
good,Ik heb mij van klantenservice medewerkster in een paar jaar tijd ontwikkeld tot storemanager.
good,Staples is a great place to work. Management was very productive and professional.They offered me great opportunities for job advancement. I learned alot from Staples and would recommend their company for employment to other applicants.
good,Great management team that strives to take care of their employees. All of the associates are like family and they have open arms for anyone who wants to become a member of the team. Only hard part is you have to be able to keep up with the fast work pace and you have to be able to commit to the hours. Besides that Staples is definitely a good beginner job or for someone who wants to advance in their career
good,I have worked for several Staples stores in the past. I have enjoyed working at most of them however I have found that a bad manager can spoil the work experience. Overall I have only experienced a few bad managers.
good,This was a great part time job to get me through college. They worked with me on my schedule so that I was able to go to school and work at the same time.
good,I really enjoyed my time at Staples. I was offered a very flexible schedule while in college and had opportunities to move to full time post college. It is a fairly easy job that can be a lot of fun with the right staff. Probably the least stress retail job out there.
good,"The workers really make this job enjoyable. The friendly and uplifting natures of everyone who works here are infectious and help me get through the day. Typical day at work requires you to show up 15 minutes before your shift, even though they don't pay you for that, and it's even harder when you have to show up 2 hours before the store even opens to do stock."
good,Working at Staples was a great experience for my first retail job. Every day I was learning something new about the business and the skills to help customers and drive sales.
good,"a typical day at work would be to clock in and get started on whatever task needs to be done such as throwing up left over stock, cleaning the floor, making sure all items are stocked as much as possible, taking care of any customers out on the floor. management is great, they always communicate with us, encourage us to speak up an basically brag about ourselves when we sign up customers for accounts and things of that nature. workplace environment is very relaxed but filled with expectations. the hardest part of the job to me is fixing other peoples' mistakes. for example if someone puts something in the wrong place or is not paying attention to how messy the store looks. people care about how the store looks when they walk in so it is hard to stress to someone that does not care about the appearence, that it a very difficult and critical part."
good,"Overall my four-year experience has been a great one as it helped me in areas that would be beneficial in the world of work after school. "
good,I worked at Staples for almost three years as a part-time job. I enjoyed working here until management changed up. This is a slow-paced job and fairly easy to learn.
good,"I liked working there, it was pretty simple but it was good enough. It got kind of boring sometimes the business is not crazy except for the back to school season"
good,Job was really relaxed with much opportunity to make money in relation to bonuses. Much of the shift you are roaming the store and assisting customers. No real person to report till the end of the night.
good,"Walk the shop floor, and answer maintenance calls. Most the work is easy, and some days will require machine repair. "
good,Had a family environment until they were bought by that retail company. Became more of a kind of grind it out job where it wasn't as easy to be happy. But great management and culture seemed to survive.
good,In the later years the store became more for Staples and less for the employees. It was sell sell sell. Add this to go with that. And they kept count.
good,"Very stressful at times but overall it is a fun and easygoing place to work. With really good benefits for full-time and part-time associates! I was able to move up to a management roll in about a year and a half but I don't see it going much further, unfortunately."
good,"Was a nice place to work, nice people, nice management."
good,It's a great place to work. Professional and friendly people who are easy to get along with. I mostly had great managers that were flexible and supportive of my home life and quick to praise me when I did a good job. Upper management is approachable and strives to keep associates informed of company objectives and market performance. Continuous personal and professional improvement is encouraged with a tuition reimbursement program.
good,"this was the longest job I kept and I really liked it, we went thru a few managers but I got along really well. I was promoted and trusted to count the safe and send out the deposits every weekend. I worked 10 hour days, made really good money. Only sucky thing was that if its not summer you aren't allowed to work more than 25 hours as part time."
good,"Staples is an excellent employer to work for.  They value their associates, especially older associates.  Expectations of management are reasonable and fair and management is generally supportive.  There are excellent amenities, including a cafeteria, gym, and quiet/collaborative areas.  It is an environment where if you do good work you will be rewarded.  Certain positions also offer the option to work remotely."
good,"I have absolutely nothing but high praise for the management and staff at this location. Great work environment, easy to move up in this company. Training is exemplary."
good,"Advancement is easy if you have something in your head. Have to be careful with company politics as usual, Most stores are dirty and the people who work there are apathetic."
good,Very fast-paced always learning dealing with customer issues coaching employees training new employees answering phones dealing with three different departments getting on calls with other stores
good,Staples provides great opportunity for employee growth and development. It develops associates and provides them with transferable skills that can be used in almost any industry. The company is extremely effective with cross-training associates and notifying of new opportunities within the organization.
good,"You stay busy throughout the whole shift, teaches you to stay focused and to do multiple things at a time. The managers treat the employees well and the employees seem happy."
good,"Good Management, friendly environment.  Learned new programs and how to multi task in a timely manner.  Loved the people that I worked with felt like working with family and friends."
good,"Overall my experience here was great. Majority of coworkers were amazing, management is nice & lenient, hours were great, pay was good. It was a bit stressful at times but its tolerable and enjoyable. I'd highly recommend working here."
good,"SBA, the commercial and contract division of Staples, recently went private and is now focusing on profits and margins over customer satisfaction and a positive corporate culture. There was great room for lateral and vertical movement internally, but a high turn-over for employment. Compensation was very fair, but appropriate training was not always provided - to work here, you must take initiative and be willing to deal with copious red tape."
good,Supervisor was excellent. work was busy and fun. There were multiple projects each day to keep you busy and entertained. Wish I could still be working there.
good,"On a typical day you are recommended to have at least 91 inputs and outputs (incoming phone calls and out coming emails) put together. This can be stressful depending on what line management has you on. If you are just taking payments then you have nothing to worry about, but if you're working on corrections or concerns then it can get a little stressful."
good,Staples is a great place to work. There are opportunities for advancement although they are minimal. The best part is what new skills you might learn and the people that you will meet!
good,"Eu candidatei-me para trabalhar na Staples pois conhecia bem a empresa e a sua cultura empresarial assim como os produtos e serviços que vende, foi o meu 1º emprego oficial e durante o ano e meio em que trabalhei no centro de cópias e impressão adquiri bastante prática sobre atendimento personalizado ao cliente e de vendas em geral, cumprindo e elevando sempre os objetivos estipulados pela empresa."
good,Everyone was expected to pull their weight which is great. The teamwork was also great. Overall a great place to work. The staff is very respectable and also very friendly
good,I started as an EasyTech & moved to cashier when we were shorthanded. I was later promoted to team supervisor. Back to school time at Staples is crazy but fun!
good,Great entry level position even if you don't want to work in sales.  Full benefits and excellent base salary for outside sales. Only required to be in the office one day a week.
good,great place to work. management was awesome and always helpful. co-workers were great to work with. amazing discounts. great learning experience in all departments.
good,It’s a great company to start building your work experience with and definitely provides many opportunities to grown within the company and provide great customer service.
good,depending on customers demands determined the amount of orders that needed to go out. staples is a good place to work when it comes to job stability and advancement opportinities
good,"Here is a great place to gain tons of experience including customer support, tech knowledge, sales, warehouse work and all around being a hard worker. the management was great but tended to be a bit biased in other words the managers tend to relate to like people more than everyone as a whole. all in all its a great place to learn and expand your horizons."
good,"Every shift i would go to the warehouse and look for a skid that i could work on. I really appreciated the management and how caring they were due to any problems that occurred, I learned a lot from working here!"
good,"i loved my work my co workers are so nice the management was so strict but they are nice to us, we work below 12 hours per day and they gave us high salary"
good,This job has taught me a lot about myself. This job has been difficult at times because of technical issues with the equipment we had. The ability I had to interact with customer on a day to day basis made my person to person relations even better.
good,"Working here was one of my best experiences. although only temporary work. It was a blast. Loads of fun & everybody got the job done.  "
good,"The company provided me with a first hand look at how the retail industry is run. The crew members I was fortunate to work alongside with helped me to understand how to meet productivity goals and teach me the fundamentals values on having a reliable set of sources to draw from when under the pressures of fast-paced, high volume traffic. It was enjoyable to find a balance between the social sale interactions and the physical demands of inventory maintenance through daily practice of realistic expectations."
good,Good job for single employees. The pay is very good. There are tons of different job opportunities within the company. Job is Monday thru Friday with overtime .
good,"fairly busy"
good,"As Regional Vice President i was able to lead and motivate a great group of District Managers, Support staff and Store teams to lead the customer service culture which innovated the EASY culture for Staples"
good,"Monday- Saturday can be busy all day with a few down hours sometimes. Sundays are here nor there. They can be slow sundays and busy ones too. My 3 managers are awesome, super friendly, and very helpful."
good,"Staples is a great family atmosphere to work for. You can start in one"
good,no in company advancements once  mastering a position there really is no way to make your way up the company ladder and i really was looking for a career i could grow in
good,I loved this job because I excelled at managing other people in a retail environment.  Motivating and training were what I enjoyed most.  I went for the 5th level assistant manager to a store manager in 13 months.  The only draw back and the reason for leaving is I moved to 5 different cities in 3 years opening stores.
good,"Great Culture to work in. Tough is you have a territory that has too many reps. Company only promotes internally which is a plus, but takes awhile to achieve a better paying position."
good,It taught me a lot about how people treat those who work in customer service. It's not a bad company to work for it just didn't give me the room I needed to grow nor the money I needed to sustain. My managers were awesome at both locations.
good,"most everyone has a positive demeanor, customer service is paramount and there's a decent benefits program. employees are respected by management and our opinions are always listened to."
good,"L'équipe du magasin Bureau en Gros où j'ai eu la chance de travailler était génial, nous avions une bonne complicité et le travail s'effectuait efficacement car chaques membres était impliqué dans les tâches quotidienne et l'atteinte des objectifs commun que nous avions."
good,"Great work environment, never had much to complain about, great training and learning capabilities throughout the company. Wages were comparable to the industry standard"
good,"I started in the copy and print center and worked my way into management great company to work for,   workplace culture with all associates is great.."
good,"Worked for them for 8 years and it is a very professional organization which strives to help all employees reach their full potential."
good,"Very friendly and comfortable place to work. "
good,"Over the years work load went from a bit overwhelming to a task to find work to do."
good,"Manage team, nurture customer service ethics with said team, deal one on one with customers and any issues.  Recommend and sell technology.  Train owners in new technologies in a way that makes them feel comfortable."
good,Enjoyable workplace culture at Staples. They hired quality employees. Most positive note - Staples invested in systems and technology enabling productivity/success. Other companies sought Staples out for knowledge-sharing to learn how to mirror the cutting edge successes Staples was achieving in planogramming and inventory management.
good,"Really enjoyed working with this company, they take care of their employees really well. Lot of areas to advance in the company!"
good,"Perfect for highschool students and college students returning home for break, however would not consider it a life-long career. Never went through a promotion as I was never around for long enough, but the pay was good, customers werent horrible, and policies were tolerable. I feel fortunate to have had great fellow employees and great managers."
good,Great place but I couldn't workout so I had to leave. Management said I could have the days off but refused to change my schedule.
good,"I worked at Staples as a Sales Associate, Easy Tech associate, Cashier, and Truck Crew Member. I thoroughly enjoyed the environment of growth and development in this company."
good,"Generally, employees work 12-15 days out of a month, and pay is decent. Production numbers are difficult to meet. A typical day there involves order selection and general warehouse duties in a relatively clean setting."
good,My time at staples was extremely enjoyable. The staff was wonderful and the management was exceptional. I learned lots about customer service from that place and made a lasting friend or two.
good,"Staples was a good company to work for, which gives employees many opportunities to advance their career.  Upper management is willing to listen to all employees."
good,Staple was a great place to work. Staples always keep you busy and focus on hand. They always had events for the employees for there hard work. And working hours was great.
good,"I didn't expect to find such great people at STAPLES. I leanrned a lot regarding time management, customer service and meeting sales goals."
good,"All the staff were very helpful and friendly, including the management team. The place had a nice atmosphere, making it easy to work and get on with your job."
good,"Staples is a great place to begin your career in retail if that is what you are going for, otherwise is also a flexible part-time job for high school/college students."
good,I love the people there but boy can the managers get to you. Great for a first job in retail though. It really gives you a taste of the terrible world of retail.
good,"No room for advancement  "
good,"Overall great experience. Good benefits and a good balance with family and work. Lots of ""employee day"". Back to school was really busy but fun. Working weekends and nights were hard once I had my kids."
good,Staples was a big part of my life. From 2010-2016 I worked for Staples and genuinely enjoyed going to work daily. As part of the management team I had a lot of responsibilities that made me a well rounded individual. My entire team of 20+ employees all got along very well like a tight knit family.
good,"Staples Business Depot provides its employees with exceptional training and a healthy work environment. They are a business that puts a lot of money into training their associates to not only become greats sellers and helpful employees, but also to become better individuals outside of work. "
good,"Loved the people I work with. loved the scheduled...Provide a full range of support services for Vice President and Employee’s. In charge of document preparation, confidential file management, mail handling, supply ordering and email maintenance. Coordinate and carry out special events, request, projects and communication plans. Planning and scheduling meetings and appointments. Domestic and International travel coordination."
good,"There has been a lot of room for advancement, and the management team is pretty open to ideas on how to increase sales. Being a sales job, it allows you to meet a wealth of people who come from all walks of life. That, for me, is one of the most enjoyable parts of the job."
good,Fun environment but serious at the same time. Learned many things along with feeling appreciated. Enjoyed my time there.
good,"A typical work day includes helping customers, replenishing items to shelves, and doing your best to greet and in detail help each valued customer you get. The staff is by far the best i have yet to work with, they are so full of life and enjoyment."
good,"Staples Business Division provides aggressive pricing and service to businesses, within categories from furniture to copy paper."
good,"Very friendly, open and fun place to work. Training is a lot harder than the actual job. The job was extremely repetitious and easy. Everyone is willing to help. They keep the job interesting by having themed celebrations. The brake room is awesome. Family friendly and very welcoming. I loved working there minus the review process. They record your calls and computer activity during the call and do three random calls with you every month. I hate hearing my calls but I understand why they do it. I think they should do it a lot less often. I also didn't like that they deactivated my entry access card three days after I gave my 2 weeks notice. That was rude and very annoying. The 1st day they were working on it, the 2nd day they thought it was fixed and reactivated it, day 3 I get there and I'm locked out again. I went home and never went back."
good,"While I am not overly fond of staples as a company whole, my experience working in the ramsey location was great. my managers cared a great deal and everybody worked hard as part of a team."
good,"When I first got hired at staples the management was amazing at the store. I was put in the copy center, which was always moving we had private clients, as well with everyday regular customers. But once management changed, everything was sort of changing. People started leaving, on top of that going to work I wasn't one bit motivated to go. At one point of time, the managers just kept giving me write ups for little reasons. Which of course I found ridiculous... But overall the coworkers were always a blast to be around with the benefits were good, and the hours didn't disturb your personal life as well."
good,I did enjoy working for this company and so glad they have helped me grow in management skills as they have. Great leadership in the management system.
good,Hardest part of the job is to learn on an individual different background; as well as one's different learning course. Being at a 100% of giving customer satisfaction & not in control of how the sales go on a daily basis.
good,"I work on the floor so when there is stock for the night I have to finish it, if there is no stock or I finish it before my shift I have to fill the isles. While I'm doing my tasks I help out clients at the same time, most of time I sell chairs to clients. At the end of my shift when I work at night I have to do price changes if theres any."
good,They do a good job of teaching you a lot of different skills and it's a good place to start if you want to get into sales or management.
good,"As a Copy and Print Associate, it's required to be proficient in multi-tasking, detail-oriented, and efficient.  Most days are hectic and we really do depend on each other to get our work done.  The hardest part of the job is being patient with difficult customers.  I've learned that in those situations, it's better to let the customer speak, really listen to what their demands are, and stay calm.  Those skills also apply to the customers who aren't difficult.  They appreciate when we take care of their business because they come to us to help expand their brand.  That would be the most enjoyable part of the job. It's knowing that they left satisfied and that they'll come back."
good,"The group was very innovative in that we sourced the usual Staples products (Mead notebooks, Weyerhaeuser copy paper) from less expensive sources, thereby creating new brand names. Since the sourcing locations were anywhere from Canada to Asia, the department was called ""Total Global Sourcing""."
good,"I didn't work for the company but a few weeks because of school break, but the staff was friendly and the management ran a tight ship which was good. The district manager was also great (store 1166)."
good,Typical day runs fast so long as it is known what you have to do and the time you have. Working in teams are more beneficial than working alone although it makes you more creative when accomplishing certain tasks. Your boss varies but they all have similar agendas. You never know who you are going to meet but I can guarantee that this job will build you or break you
good,"I personally liked all of the managers I worked under. They all had different management styles but were still able to work together, and expectations of staff were still consistent."
good,"Relaxed work place, good management, nice customers, enjoyable work, friendly co workers, flexible with hours, hardest part of job is dealing with rude customers."
good,"I loved my time at Staples, I miss It everyday! everybody was so nice and caring. Everyone treated equally, and I got paid for exactly what I was doing, I wasn't over working and getting under paid."
good,"Friendly and enjoyable working environment with a great set of managers and associates. Focus is on employee development from head office to store level. "
good,"Great Work Place with very supportive Team Leader/ Manager, The most enjoyable part of the Job was liaising with the Customers and working alongside some of the best colleagues I have ever worked with."
good,"Great place to work.A Lot of involvment in the community."
good,"i would say this a nice place to work as a young person not knowing what exactly what they want to do wit their life.At the same time gives someone a reality check and shows someone various trades they could go into like computer support,graphic design while learning how to be good at customer service"
good,One of the best places I have worked at. The management actually acknowledges real world problems and actually lend a hand to help during a time of need.
good,"A typical work day allowed me to interact with hundreds of customers as well as work with knowledgeable associates. The hardest part of the job was working overnights during the back to school season. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the employees and all the customers that I came in contact with. Overall, a good place to start a job."
good,"Its a fast place environment, keeps you on your toes. Lots of knowledge to be learned and friendly atmosphere. Can learn about different departments while working together as a team."
good,"Being a part of the logistics strategy team, our responsibilities were to look at the entire network and find out the right balance between warehouses, inventory and transportation cost."
good,"Great starting point for computer repair work, able to work around a flexible schedule. good way to experience a large array of different computer issues and the fixes for them."
good,I really enjoyed my job at Staples every time I went. I have learned a lot of leadership and logistics skills. I have some of the best coworkers because they were hard-working and all-around good people. The hardest part of the job was the learning curve that the job had. The best part of the job was be able to help many people with their needs and meeting different people.
good,"The management seemed frustrated because they could not give out enough hours to part time employees. Working in the copy center, you could not get more than 20 hours unless you were a supervisor which was very irritating."
good,"I learn so much from this job,I absolutely love my role with the company.It is very healthy environment and very supportive management.The one of the best part of the job is working as a team, all the team members are very supportive.There are lot of variety in what i did each day, ranging from the monotonous tasks to new projects that were challenging and exciting."
good,"This job is very independent, but you have all of the resources you need to be successful.  Definitely a great place to work if you are a young, aspiring salesperson who is goal oriented.  Definitely has room for advancement, especially if you are relocatable.  The company is making great strides to grow and gives you every opportunity to do well.  My co-workers were always extremely helpful to me as I started this position and they never failed to get me an answer.  The hardest part of the job is getting used to the time management portion as you are always in the field and may need to be creative on how to access the internet from a remote location.  The most enjoyable part of this job is definitely having the independence of planning my day or week."
good,"I enjoy the energetic culture at staples. The managers are approachable and encourage employees to succeed and explore career growth within the company."""
good,"If you like hard work an do it good along with some long hours during peek times,Staples is a great place to work.They have their policies an regulations but that comes with every job.Staples is in the process of downsizing core associates,but still enjoyed working there."
good,"A typical day would be slow in the mornings, from 8 to 10 am, two or four customers would come in, mostly for print shop. During that time, I would be tagging ink for shelves, and restocking the front area. I would also clean the register areas, make announcements, and restock advertisements. Around 10 am, business would pick up. My co-workers would be both professional and fun, and made it easier to work during the hard hours. The hardest part, would be making sure that everything would be finished on time, this was mostly due to lack of workers during the morning shifts. The most enjoyable part was the customer interaction and fast moving pace."
good,"When you think of Staples, you think of it as an office supply story. We see it as a destination store. You don't typically go to an office supply store just to window shop and browse. Customers go to staples looking to buy a specific product: That's where we come in. Retail is considered one of the most demanding jobs in society, and I completely understand why after working here for over two years! Each season has it's own kind of rush! Back to school is of course the busiest time of year. Without a hard working team, the stores fall massively behind and get very disorganized. If you're good with team work, can keep up with a fast pace environment, and still have the best customer service attitude day in and day out, then Staples is definitely the job you're looking for~"
good,"Staples was a great place to work. Daily coaching and development of associates was key with Staples. I learned a lot with Staples. How to facilitate classes with teaching new Store Managers and the ability to publicly speak was one of the greatest things I learned as well. There really was no hard part of the job. If you had the right people and they were in the right seat on the bus, things were very rewarding."
good,"Staples was very kind to me during my stay with them. They were willing to work with your schedule as long as it was reasonable. For the position I was working I was paid minimum wage however that was to be expected. Employees are given benefits even if only working part time. The job security wasn't fantastic however as the other store in town was forced to close due to financial pressure. The management addressed concerns I had about different aspects of the job and were generally clear in their expectations. The other employees were willing to give guidance on various procedures which was a great help. There was a slight bit of drama I was annoyed by but it didn't affect me directly so I can't complain too much about that. All in all, probably one of the better retail jobs out there."
good,I began working at Staples when I was in high school and continued to work there throughout my college career. They are flexible and help you with paying for college by offering scholarships for employees that maintain 20 hrs/week.
good,"An amazing place to work at!. With good and qualified Leaders to Support and work. "
good,Never had a problem working with Staples. If you wanted more hours they would give it to you if you asked. Always worked over 40 hours a week and the pay was decent. Cant complain.
good,Working for Staples enabled me to learn things that have helped me progress and escalate internally. These skills have enabled me to be able to prepare me for day to day norms.
good,Staples is one of the leading employee company. A career oriented and safe working environment. Fast pace and clean warehouse. Employees are competitive and work extremely hard. I enjoyed working there.
good,Good company. Management turnover is high. but it's an up and coming facility with potential year to year growth in the next 5 years.
good,"I currently work at staples as a front end sales associate. The job is more than simple, your just cashiering basically. I work the night shift where I need to vacuum, sort out ink and collect soda and drinks from the back and put it up front. Everyone works at the very least, four hours per day. As a part time associate, I am able to get around 12-20 hours per week. The pay is great and my coworkers and I are like family. The only real problem with the job is that when things get slow without customers, there is literally nothing to do. You can only clean the registers so many times. It gets extremely boring at times but other than that, everything is great. This job has actually taught me how to talk to people better and more professionally, as well as sell products very efficiently."
good,Fun environment and a really good place to hone your skills in selling as well as inventory management. The training is fantastic and very instructive and the policies are very easy to understand and follow.
good,"I am very grateful for the time, respect and advancement the company and management gave me to advance in my future endeavors. All the co-workers were always nice and provided the strength and power to operate at such a high level to keep up with company and customers needs I value greatly all the time they have given to myself and especially others, most importantly. I would recommend anybody to be apart of this company as a stepping stone to advance and excel in their future endeavors."
good,Good company to work for. They are laid back and flexible. You do your job and they will work with you. I loved how they were understanding with you when it come to being a single parent.
good,"Warehouse Supervisor with extensive experience in shipping, packing and receiving items for incoming and outgoing orders of the company. Supervised a team of 8-10 employees at one time and worked with top management to establish protocol and procedures within the warehouse for safety and efficient measurement"
good,"As my first real retail job, it definitely is a place to begin when learning to work well with customers.  There is plenty of training even when you think you have it all down.  The management is very laid back and welcoming so its not hard to talk to them.  The hardest part of the job is keeping calm with unruly customers or unsatisfied customers.  The most enjoyable part is probably closing time."
good,"The store I worked at was great! I loved my coworkers and management, work was manageable and easy to advance, but pay was not great and took a while to get a raise. If I was not already moving, I would have been promoted to management, but we had to relocate. If you like customer service and are good with people, this is a good place to work. The toughest part of the job was keeping up with sales quotas, warranties, etc."
good,"Have to move fast every day do to the amount of stops, I learned to deal with costumers on the regular basis, the local management is very cool and easy to work with. My co-workers are very nice and are willing to help other drivers when needed. The copy paper is the hardest part of the job. The best part of the job is that I get to meet new people every day."
good,"A typical day at work is contacting customer's and discussing issues and resolutions for their account.  I have learned that utilizing resources that are made available to me will assist in customer satisfaction.  My co-workers make me feel as if I am part of a team.   We feed off of each other's knowledge and when I face a situation that I feel may defeat me there is a team member willing to lend their guidance to finding a resolution.  The most enjoyable part of my job is the team bonding because it allows us to take a step back from the work, regroup, and get a fresh start on the work at hand."
good,"At staples my main duties take place at the copy center. Unless I am needed at register or office supplies. In the copy center I recreated documents, presentations, posters, and banners. To quote the company I ""Make almost anything happen"". I got along with most of my coworkers and managers. The hardest part of my job is the request of doing almost everything. Usually when something goes wrong or a supervisor is out for vacation or maternity leave I was left with the tasks of the supervisor. Being requested to do so much and being stretched so thin and in my opinion I wasn't paid or rewarded for it at all. My managers gave me a verbal thank you when it was almost over but its not enough for me. I love the job, using my imagination and creating almost anything and making my customers happy that was the best part. I am mainly looking to move forward and make more and do more and receiving the paycheck that I feel like I deserve from the hard work I provide. I have been told that I have the ability to be a supervisor of the copy center but there are no positions available."
good,"My previous employment at the Staples facility in Montgomery, NY was a wonderful experience.  I really enjoyed the work because it was challenging and I was always busy.  I will miss the work and my co-workers.  We were a great team."
good,Everyday there were clean-up and tear down duties such as cleaning the area and shutting everything down. I learned so many things including how to diagnos computer issues and how to properly execute them.  The people i worked with were very friendly and it was always a relaxed environment.  The greatest feeling about this job was successfully selling the right products to the customer.
good,"I get on with all my managers and co-workers."
good,"Excellent options for benefits;"
good,Staples Inc is an awesome company to work for.  I felt comfortable being brought to the table for discussions and streamlining efforts to reduce costs while delivering the perfect order to our customers.  I've learned to strengthen people skills as well as advance skills in data analysis and designing projects to ensure sustainable benefits are captured. I really enjoyed being able to own projects/assignments in the field like Driver Academy and go through Green Belt training that fitted me with the readiness to apply what i has been learned and put it into practice.
good,Co-workers were friendly and helpful. Managers were understanding. The copy and print center was fast paced and challenging.
good,"Working at Staples has been exceptional. It is a friendly environment where the coworkers and managers are easy to talk to and always ready to help.I learned how to deal with unsatisfied customers and  attend to their needs in the best way possible. The team work is one of the best parts of this job. Whenever I needed additional cashiers, my coworkers helped when available. We kept the line moving with ease. I also learned how to check inventory in order to help customers buy the right amount of a product they needed. Over all, it is an enjoyable job with a lot to learn from."
good,"rewarding because of people you work with."
good,A good starting point and Learning curve for me in customer service. But look beyond to put my skills to a better organization into service.
good,"Out hitting the streets looking for new business"
good,"nice overall place to work...a few changes are needed to overall make the job the true ""perfect"" place to work..2nd shift is the hardest shift to work for due to the long hours and start and end time of the shift that kinda makes it hard to have a social life outside of the job. i give it a overall 4 out of 5 stars."
good,Easy going and plenty of hands on customer service. Co workers are very nice and we all depend on each other to learn and help customers get what they lookin for.
good,"Shift meeting was at the beginning of our shift. Manager included the orders expected to be processed for the day.  After the meeting the shift would look on the line-up to see where they would work for the first part of the day.  Once at our designated area of work we would preform our duties.  I was a line starter most of the time. That entitled me to make the correct size boxes for the pickers on my line. I would also have pick the front of the line to keep the line moving. I really liked working with my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was when it was busy. Had to keep up with the incoming boxes on the conveyor belt. There was also a light that went off for a buzzer when the line wasn't fast enough to intake the boxes. I work well when its busy, it makes the day go by faster."
good,"The co-workers were always nice and friendly, everyone helped each other out and looked out for each other. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the heat inside the building, the day would consist of packing and shipping out supplies."
good,great team environment with drive management is fun and goal driven
good,"Since working here at Staples, I have learned so many aspects of the company. The management staff saw my potential and did not let it go to waste. I appreciate the support they have given me to advance and the appreciation they have for my dedication. "
good,"A typical day at work would include moving stock from receiving onto the shelves, pulling stock from the upper levels to the customer accessible ones, working the register, and cleaning up at the end of the day. I was also expected to help customers with their furniture orders, being one of the bigger employees at the store. "
good,came in and everyone was always in a good mood. managers always had something good to say customers enjoyed the at home feeling
good,Same with the other staples job i had. The people are nice and courteous. i love working there.
good,everyone one was nice and out going when needed help with something co-worker went out their way to help
good,"Staples is a great job for a college student or a single parent wanting a job that works with their schedule. Working with customers and providing them some of my knowledge on products is something I love. I built a great client structure and met a lot of friends along the way. Best coworkers I've worked with by far and management was pretty laid back. Growing in this company takes time and there aren't too many benefits to back it up. Average hours in a week were 20-30 tops. They worked around your schedule and treated you like family in a sense. Staples has a good system but it's just fading fast. Keeping up to date on electronics has sadly been a downfall and continues to be each year. They are strictly about office equipment and don't provide enough accessories for their electronics. It's basic and I understand that it's for the everyday customer. That being said, our technology advances quickly in the U.S. and so does the average person's knowledge. Without providing the customer's full needs, it's potentially pushes customers away to competitors like Best Buy, Cosco, and other tech related stores. A great job all around but the company doesn't have much to offer."
good,It's a tough industry right now. Loved the job but wasn't going anywhere fast.
good,"This job was just as could be expected. It was a small store and it was one where relationships could be made, even as a cashier."
good,Stress free. Management is wonderful and associates are pleasant.
good,Good place to work. Good family work balance with a lot of up potential.
good,staples is a fortune 500 company that treats employees like family. great salary and bonuses. great chance for advancement
good,"Great place to work, with great pay. Very family oriented environment."
good,"A typical day at work for me would be to start out by checking to see which computers need to be urgently repaired or diagnosed while keeping the customer up to date with the status of their computers. I've learned through out the course of my time working as a tech to calmly deal with customers that come in very upset because of some sort of miss understanding. I have also been fortunate to work with a great management team that have always helped me excel and were also willing to let me offer some input on certain areas that needed attention. I can honestly say that I have gotten along with all my co-workers, they made the hard part of the job a lot less harder when it got really busy. The part I enjoy the most of my job is when I boot up a customers computer for the first time after service and I see that smile on their faces followed by a thank you and shake of the hand."
good,"Enjoyed the work and flexible hours. Sold and fixed electronics, stocked aisles, cashier duties, reset planograms. Found the job to be easy and my co-workers were friendly. Management was positive and I still have strong relations with them. However, most people cannot survive off a part-time minimum wage position these days but this job is great for college students."
good,"I enjoyed working here and loved that they were always willing to throw new challenges my way, and let me cross train in nearly every department. The variety of work from one day to the next was nice. Management was wonderful. The only downsides were that there were not enough hours available and no benefits for part time employees."
good,Before the store would open getting my stuff what I needed to be able to perform my duties as a Customer Service person. I would make sure bags was stocked and the Phone line was working and anything that needed to be done I would go and handle it. The Store would open and calls would come in I would greet customers and help them with anything that they would need and answer the phone line and if they needed a certain department I would transfer them. I have made many friends while working there and if we have parted from there we still have remained friends. Working through the Staples company we was more like a family than just individuals working there.
good,"Staples was a good job, but you must be dedicated to put time and effort into it."
good,Great managers and Associates. Work was pretty straight forward provide exceptional Customer service and provide a wonderful shopping experience for our customers.
good,"I only worked 8 hours a week at Staples. It was a good way to get some extra money, and to be part of another massive company. I was in charge of technology and machines. Which meant that I would sell computers and other equipment to customers."
good,I worked at Staples a long time. It is a great retail place to work. There is plenty of room to advance and there is recognition for hard work. The company has good benefits along with a stock purchase program. My only gripe is that the management was poor. This seemed to be mostly set around the store I worked in though.
good,"I came into Staples only PT and still am only PT at my store. I like working for the company, believe in them, and work at a great store, but the pay is pretty low even if you have a lot of retail experience in which I do from Walmart Stores, Inc.  I was hoping to start at $9.00 or $10.00/hour, but they couldn't do that since there was a company restructure recently that dropped the starting wage down I believe?  Either way, for OS (Office Supplies) you are mainly helping customers with questions and/or getting a product for them (i.e. chair or desk), stocking product to the floor, blocking (rearranging) the product on the shelves, doing a pull list (bringing inventory out to the floor), and running the front register as needed or requested. The most difficult part is dealing with the customers and business of ""retail"" and finding product to restock, based upon the store you work at. The most enjoyable part, for me at least, is helping the customers and putting away product making sure it's done right. I've learned more about understanding inventory and making price signage for various products. Management is pretty good for the most part and delegate work and makes sure things are running smoothly - much better than Walmart! Overall, Staples is a great place to work, for sure, but it's better if you're in high school or college and need only a PT job while in school or whatever. Apply to them and get in PT and you may eventually go FT at another store in a different position. FT positions for retail side are limited, though..."
good,Great workplace just needed something that offered more. The staff was amazing and very helpful.
good,"I normally worked an 8 hour shift which included opening the shop for the days proceeds. I would make sure all the stock which could be out is out and then assist customers."
good,"The company was based on communication, get it done and prove your numbers.  The other associates, including management, were very family oriented.  The hardest tasks involved multi tasking and delegating the programs and goals."
good,Launched a new project (ET4B) designed to provide services to business from 5 – 75 employees. The objective was to make technology easy for business owners by providing total end-to-end technology solutions that cater to their unique business needs
good,I started out as a cashier. Within a year I had completed the training to be in the Tech department. Because of those skills I often helped in that department and later became the Customer Service Lead. The managemnt made it an enjoyable work environment.
good,"Je recommande Bureau en gros, c'est une excellente entreprise"
good,"A great work experience with lots of training on customer service and retail management. Low pay often leads to low motivation. "
good,"My shift always had its routine, and that's the way we all like it. We all knew what was expected of us and where and what had to be do and by what time. Everyone i ever had the pleasure of working with was always on top of things, customers and our job were number one, especially our customers. The hardest part of the job would be customers that feel like the world owes them something. Those customers are rude and verbally abusive and yet we MUST keep our cool. I have the best years of my life with Staples, Good and Bad."
good,"Your co workers and managers are friendly, helpful people who genuinely care about both you and your job.   "
good,"The company recognizes that associates have a life and priorities outside of work and are flexible as it relates to time off, working remotely, etc."
good,"i did alot for this company (70% of the annual tech sales) and got overlooked at every advancement because i am ""too young"" what a crock"
good,"Staples Business Advantage is a great place to work and develop relevant skills that will propel you into a successful sales career. The company culture is great and my direct manager was awesome! The hardest part of the job is work life balance, but it can be worked out over time. Overall, I would recommend Staples to anyone looking to work for a great company with great people. "
good,The management is excellent and the work environment is very good. 
good,The pay was not so great but the job was always fun. I loved meeting customers and I loved selling products.
good,"Team Leader information technological department and Customer Service, Computer Repair"
good,Can be busy. You have to know how to multitask. Customers can be ok.
good,"Work as a Senior Technician can be stressful, but is definitely manageable. Through this job, I gained confidence in salesmanship and fine-tuned my computer repair skills. I rapidly advanced from a basic technician to the Senior Technician in a matter of 2 years. Heading the department for computer repair is difficult as there are very high expectations with little to no bonuses. It is a rewarding job though due to the look on a customers face when they see their old junky computer light up and run like it was when they got it when we finish a tune up."
good,To assist customers with shopping needs and info on specific items and give details to how they are used. to know any and all areas of the store and to perform all duties to be sure the store is kept clean and organized.
good,Great environment to work in. Working in the copy center gave me a sense of importance and alot of responsibility and respect. Although employee turn over is high in other parts of the store; Staples is a good company to work for with lots of benefits and room for growth.
good,"Wonderful place to work, managers are awsome and very understandable."
good,"As an Office Supplies Associate, your day primarily consists of stocking and organizing shelves, while assisting customers. Often times however, you will also have to find furniture in tall places that weighs quite a bit. Precarious work situations will often have you questioning the safety of your job, but failure to perform will result in harsh stares and glances from your fellow employees. Every weekend you will change tags on items in the store, unfortunately the tags are often premature and/or not available in your store, but you won't know, and may spend hours searching in vain. Management expects results when selling memberships and promotional items, even when customers refuse, and are often nowhere to be found when you are in desperate need of assistance."
good,"Staples can be a fun place to work if you enjoy selling. The most important things in a typical day are customer service, selling services/protection plans, and in stock for the customer; in that order. The sales culture has a lot of pressure to keep you on point. Staples offers great benefits which include stock options with discount, 401k matching, health, dental, eye, and a scholarship reimbursement."
good,the job was very productive at work the managers and employees were like family this was a very diverse place to work at and i enjoyed it.the hardest part of the job was when we accidentally mess up a clients work order.the easiest part was when things ran smoothly throughout the day
good,"I am a sales professional and broadcaster (radio) by trade. I approach my day as if I am a business owner. I take pride in the work that i do. Every job has its challenges, but I am able to adapt to the challenges whether it be changes, new co-workers, etc."
good,I love working for this company. I have yet to meet a manager that I haven't liked. My one regret about this company is that they don't offer a lot of full time positions. This job is fabulous for someone who is in need of a second job or is currently attending school. They work with virtually any schedule you may have. It's a fun exciting place to work with some really great people. If the hours and pay were better I'd make Staples a career.
good,"the best part of the job for me was working 3-12 hour days. Once a month you would have 7 days off in a row. Just like having vacation. It was a very productive day. Kept busy all of the time, but your time went by fast."
good,"Good company with Training, friendly and helpful associates, great spirit and overall a good company to work for. Dealing with customers, always improving something in the store, promoting a selling culture within the store. Merchandising and setting up promotions etc."
good,People were great. It was an entry level job. Hours were flexible.
good,I have learned about taking care of the customer and making things right. I have truly felt like there is one Team . Together we can really resolve situations and grow the business. I have learned how to go outside of guidelines when it makes sense to gain or keep a customer and to take ownership and pride of this.
good,"Staples has great customer service and promotes helping customers have an ""easy"" shopping experience."
good,"Most of the day as a computer sales associate is spent speaking with customers about the products at the store. A customer will come in looking for something and you will take them over to it and explain what it is, compared to the others that are on the shelf. The whole point is to inform them so that the customer can choose the item they want. Also it involves cleaning up around the floor, facing items at the end of the day. You will also need to get the heavier items from the back or front lock-ups for customers if they choose computers or monitors or printers. This also means that if a product is missing, you can substitute shipping an item in from another store in the district."
good,• Sold computer products and services which provided customers with the total solution.
good,"Depending on the store or manager the work environment varies, most of the time it's stressful. But the people aren't bad to work with but the lack of work ethic needs improvement"
good,"Typical days were 13+ hours, four days a week. I was able to grow my management skills and how to lead other supervisors. The management was good to work for and good at helping you to be successful and to be able to succeed. The group of supervisors I worked with was the best part of the job and helped to make the days more enjoyable. The most difficult part of the job was the amount of paperwork that was required daily, weekly on each employee and having to complete all of this by the end of the shift. The most enjoyable part of the environment was my co-workers and the opportunities that were given to me."
good,One of the best jobs I ever had. They treat the employees so well I can tell this company will go far. Even the part time employees can recieve eye and health insurance and even qualify for the scholarship.
good,Nice place and fun very respectable people and understanding people.
good,"Worked in Quality Control Department checking customer orders, in direct contact with corporate office to review better working practices."
good,This is a fast paced environment where one learns anything and everything. The hardest part of the job is a constant feeling of being worth way more than you are payed! The most enjoyable part of the job is working on your own.
good,"Staples is not a company to take lightly, they do well and plan to exceed expectations of being just an office supply store. In my time there they were changing to meet the needs of business technology in all types of businesses. In that regard they are ever changing as technology changes everyday. If you like fast paced workplace that teaches employees how to best service a customer, I suggest applying at Staples."
good,"Good environment to work in, you get to learn alot using computers and doing printing jobs."
good,A great company to work for. I only regret that because of a workmen's compensation issue I was unable to continue employment with this fine institution. I really enjoyed working for this company.
good,"Bom ambiente corporativo e trabalho em equipa, formação constante e acompanhamento excelente por parte das chefias."
good,Great team dynamic. If in a stressful situation there is always someone to assist.The management is always easily accessed if needed. The training and support is great. Everyone is very laid back.
good,"focused on sales and credit applications, but understanding of failure to convince customer. "
good,"Staples is a really inviting environment for both customers and employees, and we are always trying to take care of our customers and help them find everything they need for their homes or businesses."
good,"The work atmosphere is really enjoyable wile still professional, the management and staff are very flexible and understanding! I loved the short periods of time that I worked for them!"
good,"Work is varied and fast paced.  Have to love making lots of phone calls and selling products and services.  Learned how to work under pressure.  Management is hands on.  Workplace culture is diversified, casual in dress.  The most enjoyable part of the job is helping your customers."
good,I enjoyed working for this company. Great training program. Fair compensation. Wonderful rapport with my management team.  When my daughters medical needs began to interfere HR went out of their way to try and accommodate us.
good,"Other than the fact that certain positions are underpaid for all the work they do and responsibility on their shoulders, it's a great place to work. I have stayed with them longer than I probably should have (underpaid) because I have truly loved my job. There is a lot of room for advancement, if you have what it takes."
good,"Been there 3 yrs on Oct.12. Work environment is good, people and customers are great once you form a relationship with them. Go in ready to work and you will be fine."
good,"Typical day at work was walking around and helping customers after receiving the project of the day from a manager. I was considered one of the stronger employees and would work the weekends to early week to work on the shipments. If one department was struggling because of how busy it would get, i would offer to help and do the best of my ability to do so. Before i would leave my shift, i would tell the next associate i was working on and would tell them what tasks they should be working on since i would be gone."
good,"Work is more challenging that one would think.  Some aspects of the job are boring.  Environment is laid back, advancement is possible if you are dedicated to the job."
good,This job is very energetic and quick paced. Great opportunities for future career enhancements and maybe even promotions. Start building your success :)
good,"Good workplace with decent compensation, but sometimes the workload could be a little hectic especially during back to school. The store I worked at felt understaffed, but that meant more hours for those of us there."
good,"I worked multiple jobs at Staples Business Advantage. Great people, great company, but the industry is a bit unstable. Staples is constantly shifting focus on its go to market stratagy, which can make things frustrating day-to-day. The Sales Consultant role is a tough grind, but can be a lot of fun too."
good,enjoyed my time their just wasnt a fan of the pay for the role. i exceeded all sales goals but comparable compensation satisfactory for the work needed
good,I have been working at Staples for almost two years and they are really awesome with accommodating your schedule and are a very understanding management.
good,Great work/life balance as there are no overtime options and somewhat flexible schedules with weekends off but the ever changing commission structures are usually unrealistic as are the 3 hr talk time goals.
good,"Pretty laid back on the overnight shift, go in get the job done and go home. I can’t speak for the first or second shifts, but I enjoy working the third shift."
good,Over all good place. Enjoy dealing with customers and workers. Have a great balance or work life and family life which is important. Challenging but easy at he same time.
good,Staples is such an amazing workplace! I moved here and they hired me so quick and I instantly made new friends and learned so many things. They helped me with my organization skills and I learned how to handle tough customers!
good,Staples has a place for you. If you like to be more artistic then apply for the copy center where you can help create customers orders. If you like technology then you should apply to be a tech sales associate (they also work on pc's). If you just want to sell furniture or cash people out then apply to be a sales associate. If you dream a bit bigger than you should go for a management position. Staples is a great place to get your first job. They are very flexible with hours. I happen to be a full time college student and a single father and they work with me so I can make enough money to pay my bills even with a crazy personal schedule.
good,"the hardest part of the job is to sell guarantees for chairs and electronics, the reason why is it hard is that you have to have your own way to convince the clients to get the protection plan, it'll get better with time. Otherwise, its a very decent place to work."
good,Great 1st job taught me responsibility and knowledge in retail.Good job for students and part time unless you thinking of management the benefits are good.
good,"The management is awesome. We would run the cash register, sign up people for the staples cards, and organized the floor. It was a great place to work."
good,It's a normal retail job. It's not always the most glamorous but it is what it is. The pressure to meet in store goals is high but usually with no repercussions if you slip up. Heavily rely getting protection plans balancing between being pushy and just doing what you're supposed to is a fine line. Overall they just need to communicate with their employees better as to why goals the way they are but also take into consideration just because one store can get a certain metric consistently does not mean all stores can. There is a large difference in the type of people that shop at your stores based upon geographic location.
good,"For an entry-level job, this was a pretty easy and comfortable environment to work in. My manager tended to my questions and difficulties, as well as my coworkers."
good,"Very helpful. Opens you up to new things .  Very intelligent manager. Get what needs to be done , done .  Impress workspace .  Suitable for part-time internship ."
good,You will get what you put into the job. Staples provides the basic structure but it’s up to you the manager to make it special. If you put your best foot forward and want to succeed then you absolutely will find success with Staples. I’ve seen managers come up and make a name for themselves while also seeing others not live up to expectations and leave. The job is what you make it. It’s not for everyone but you will find yourself and discover your management style if you put your best effort. Recruiting and training are key to developing a great staff in order find success at Staples.
good,I like working for Staples however i am not advancing. I have been here long enough to move up and make more money but my boss feels like i am the best at what i do right now
good,Staples is a great place to work if you are the type that likes to stay busy. There are always tasks at hand which drive the company to be the best they can be.
good,"Fun environment where everyone works as a team to get things done. Because of the excellent training I was more efficient at my job, and It's easy to get accustom to the rhythm of the work environment."
good,"There is a very great team spirit at Staples, the major challenge is challanging yourself to beat your sales target every week. The management staff are cool and easily approachable."
good,"The only downsides are that the public is sometimes difficult to deal with (as in any customer service position), and the push for selling protection plans. It puts a lot of pressure on associates. My management is great, and my coworkers are all pretty great as well. Pretty good company to work for."
good,was an amazing experience working at staples where i got to develop my interpersonal skills and taught me how to communicate with people on a higher level.
good,"Fun place to work, very collaborative. Fair pay with vacation time and ability to work from home and flex hours. Hit or miss with managers, some ore great leaders, others are allowed to hold themselves too high and are detached."
good,I met many great people while working at a fulfilling job which allowed me to learn many different techniques in several lines of business. One of the best places I had the opportunity to work at.
good,"Good company, good store, great experience even better people to work with.Great opportunity to work with people, both colleagues and customers. Enjoyed the overall environment."
good,"Within corporate Staples you get what you give. If you like wotking hard, you will do very well. The only con, is the micro management. You have tons pf flexibility on appointment days, and you have a lot of support from management."
good,"In a typical day you deal with commonly ask questions from customer and you will need to find your own approach to up selling items."
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with immensely and learned quite a bit.  I was hired into one position and then after a while they decided that the position I was hired for needed to change to a much more technical skillset.  Unfortunately that left me out of a job.
good,I overall enjoyed interacting with customers about their technical needs. It also wasnt overwhelming for the customer so the environment was generally relaxed.
good,"It was very relaxed, the person who trained me took his time and showed me the ropes. Very educational because you get to learn about certain equipment."
good,"Good work ethics.  People friendly, very busy work schedules never a dull day.  Great for customer service.  Best part of the job was the feeling of helping customers choose the right product for their needs."
good,Staples was a great company to work for and had many advancement opportunities with great compensation and benefits.  It is too bad that upper management mismanaged finances so much.
good,"Fast pace, must assure pickers are picking items accurately and supplies are available in their area. Supervisors must ensure all packages make it to quality control before leaving for the day. Sometimes this can take a little longer during the holiday season."
good,"Really liked working there.  Great company culture, very flexible management,  comfortable office with  many conveniences. "
good,"Friendly atmosphere, great management team, employee team players, all smiles. Daily deadlines, must have excellent customer communication. Must be organized and reliable."
good,Easy and sometimes fast paced. good place to start and get experience. good management and customer base. good hours. underpaid for the work you are putting in.
good,Very easy job. Had a lot of benefits. Useful experience. Special occasion dinners. Can be extremely slow occasionally. Same customers usually. Certain positions were a lot more stressful with a lack of manager assistance.
good,The job wasnt actually super enjoyable like you go there do hard work and go home the workers are very anti social and never associated outside of work If you looking for a job that you get hours and make money in every week then staples is awesome if you want to bond with other workers and have a more enjoyable job then probably not for you
good,"The environment was very comforting with the easy to memorize isles and the straightforward managers and workers, they told me everything I needed to do and I have been able to do everything I needed to do."
good,"I was hired at Staples when I was in high school, and continued to work there through college and after.  Moved into management, then backed off to go to grad school.  Staples is a great employer.  Their training system is excellent, and it can be a fun place to work.  A great option for high school/college students looking for some extra money during the school year."
good,"Staples was my first job and I'm glad it was, it taught me so much customer service skills that I will remember for the rest of my career life, I'm forever grateful!"
good,"A typical day is spent assisting customers to find the best items and services they need for any and all tasks they might ask about. "
good,"Though the job isn't my ideal landing spot, I've had a good time so far and my coworkers and managers are very helpful and laid back. Working in my section is almost like being on an island, no one else in the store really knows how to operate there so when it's busy it can sometimes feel overwhelming. But nothing I can't handle."
good,"Staples has nice people working there. A lot of people who have been there for years and years, which unfortunately, with digital transformation happening, it's not always the best. I enjoyed working for Staples but it was very hard to drive change."
good,"Staples was a great company to work for, it was one of my first jobs but I wasn't able to stay. I was only able to work 25 hours a week max, and that wasn't enough hours."
good,"Staples in Ponca City is a great store. They offer great products, have an awesome staff and are as accommodating as the can possibly be on scheduling. The biggest drawback, Ponca City is a small town, with a Wal-Mart and rumors of a new Costco. This makes for a very slow work day 90% of the time. For some this would be heaven, for me personally, I prefer to keep moving and doing!"
good,"staples is a very small warehouse which allows you too get to know all your co workers. a very friendly environment, no matter what problems a team member may be having management find a way to make things work for you and still be about the customer first.  ive never seen an employee fired sense ive been there. ive seen people walk away because every work place is not for everybody. we have great benefits and just an all around great team. management is always on the floor with us, if you need them their rite there. i believe that anywhere people have their favorite employees but at staples you would never know because we re all treated the same according to work house rules. we start at 14.25hrly which is great compared to all the rest but, we dont get our fully time hours. so, if you live alone and have this one job and your of coarse have bills etc.  you could drown.."
good,"Lots of room for improvement. Started as a cashier and moved up to a tech associate, supervision and am currently the inventory specialist/supervisor."
good,"the work is boring, and the air was so dry at times that my throat would hurt. but regardless the people are very well-mannered and very good at what they do!"
good,"It was a very busy store. I learned to be patient, kind, understanding, and fast. Management was very understanding and always helping out difficult situations. The culture was very diverse. Hardest part was not always satisfying every customer. Most enjoyable part was the work environment."
good,I love my job at Staples! We are encouraged to excel at every goal that is set for us. We are also provided with the training and tools to help us succeed. We all work as a team and treat each other like family.
good,I enjoyed working there and they never had a problem with me. I was a fast learner and when ever I had a question someone was there to answer it.
good,Puedo trabajar en armonía; es una empresa que te da la oportunidad de escalar te aumenta el salario o te regala bonos a final de un periodo justo
good,I really enjoy working as part of the copy and print team at Staples.  They have trained me very well and I love the work.  The managers have been wonderful and extremely accommodating.  They treat their employees very well.
good,"My first day on the job my managers were extremely welcoming and kind, my coworkers were willing to help anyway they could, and none of those have changed in the months I've worked there. On my average day I run a register, which involves answering customer service calls, returns, order pick-ups, etc, none of which are challenging tasks. I enjoy my coworkers, we all try our best to do our jobs even when customers or life make it hard for us to do. Without a doubt the most enjoyable part of my job is working with my coworkers to achieve the common goal of achieving customer satisfaction and going home on time, but I also like working on the floor, as it gives me the freedom to move around the store and spend more time working with individual customers. "
good,"Stock the shelves. Place received merchandise on the floor."
good,you have to work very hard but its very rewarding and fun. The managers are very understanding and flexible with your schedule. They want you to succeed.
good,At Staples my team is very willing and compassionate about what they do at the store. We work hard and strive as team to help the customers at what they need. The management at the store is very good and they're understandable. Everybody has their own part and they do it very well and accomplish the goals needed at the store.
good,I really like this job because it is not physically demanding. It is a good paying job with chance for advancement and security for my family.
good,"very productive, l learned that patience goes very far. mangement is very approachable. I enjoy going to work,  seeing my co-workers they are like family. Home away from home. hardest part of my job is when you can't make everyone happy, although you try. Most enjoyable is when you make your customers happy and they leave satisfied."
good,"I worked there as a Cashier, And did Customer Service. It's a friendly atmosphere. Co-workers are a great team. Store hours are just right to serve the customers at their convenience."
good,"i started a a cashier and learned  early that i prefer to stay busy, i moved over to the copy center after i thought myself how to use the machines. i enjoyed watching children coming shopping for school supplies and being able to assist when asked. Most of the employees were pleasant and got along."
good,"A typical day at work was working to deadlines, picking and packing products working for the dispatch labels and sheets. i learned a lot about working with a big worldwide company and also about working with a very fast paced warehouse environment, The management were very friendly and helpful if you ever need their help, my co workers were very friendly people from all different background and nationalities and were very easy to get along with."
good,"I  loved my job some days were challenging, learned many different skills.The management, were always friendly and  one could  go to them for anything, my co workers were awesome we became like a family"
good,"I loved working there. Our managers bent over backwards for us, when they didn't need to. Very fair. It made us do our job better."
good,"Great place to work, great place to grow.  Love my time here at Staples.  I worked here 4 years, moved, and came back to get hired again.  I love going to work every day, and enjoy seeing old customers who remembered me from being there."
good,"I can only speak of the location I worked for, but it was a wonderful experience. With its ups and Downs, but the people there and the Work Culture made this a Great company to work for."
good,"an future group company, was first time working experience in retail, learned about retail, well reputed company, friendly management and team."
good,"Staples is a good Office Supply superstore to work for. Whether you are looking for a part-time job to build your skills and talents or your also looking to grow within this company in a potential management position, Staples is a great place to start."
good,Staples has fantastic leadership in place and rewards hard and smart work with advancement.  Great education and training!
good,I was a 2nd shift bulk employee working part time. They are very flexible with scheduling my and my overall experience with them was excellent!
good,"Let me start by saying the pay is not great.  I've overheard criticisms because other businesses with similarly aged/experienced workers are starting to pay more."
good,"no hassle about work, just do the job and go home, simple. The people and management are easy to get along with as well. Showing up to work on time is a big deal to this company. Not missing any days during your 90 day employement is vital as well."
good,"On a typical day, I'm usually a cashier. It's all basic knowledge: If you know how to read a total to a customer, you're set. One of our merchandisers left, so now I took over her spot. I guess you can say I moved up? So now I do both, cashier AND work on the sales floor. I am still waiting to learn more about the Copy & Print center."
good,Working at Staples is a wonderful experience. The management truly cares about their employees. I learned so much through this experience that will hold me in good stead anywhere I go in life.
good,"I like Staples, the overtime can sometimes interfere with family/personal time though. It's a fast paced environment that will keep you busy. The best part about the job is the coworkers and that it's an easy job to learn and do."
good,"A typical day at work would be started by talking to my manager on any special duties he needs to get done. If not, then i move on to what I know I should do and that is finish truck if there is any left. If not, then I move on to filling the shelves that have no product on it. As I work I would be asked by customers to assist them with laptops, tablets, or printers. I ask them a few questions to obtain an idea of what they need so I can recommend the correct product.   "
good,I absolutely LOVED the environment. I had great relationships with my co-workers and I LOVED my manager and my supervisors. We were like a little family.This has been the best job I've has thus far.
good,"A typical day on the job is answering calls in a timely matter,  providing valuable information and technical support for our customers devices. I liked my job because it allow me to learn something new about the latest mobile phones that was being  released and its features. My Supervisor was great, he help me with the tools I needed to advance in the company as a Quality Analyst. I will recommend Asurion as a Employer if seeking a position."
good,"Enjoyable work including Point-Of-Sale system use, inventory maintenance, customer service"
good,"The best part of the job was the relationships built with my client"
good,Fast paced work environment with many deadlines to meet for several projects at a time. Working for Staples has taught me to keep projects on schedule and to thorough and detail oriented. I have great support from management and co-workers are positive and productive. The most enjoyable part of my position is putting together product/promotion for my clients and seeing the benefits the promotion had for my clients event or my sales.
good,"High level of multiple project management"
good,Great energy from the management team and always willing to lend a helping hand.
good,"The average day at Staples Advantage include but isn't limited to order entry, customer care and problem resolution. I feel that the job taught me to be quick on my feet with suggestions, resolution ideas, and alternatives to customer needs if certain products were not available. The management is very involved, and high energy, which helps keep the team motivated and excited."
good,"Relaxed work environment, with promotion and advancement from within."
good,"Staples is a good place to get your start in a corporate office setting.  The jobs are challenging, but the people you work with are very good, and management is very helpful."

good,The job was active. My supervisors were respectful and clear headed. My coworkers were fun to work with too.
good,This was my first job so i learn alot. I learn time managment and what it feels like to earn my pay check
good,Working with Computers and serving customers on sales floor
good,"Ive mastered the copy and print center and learned alot from my co workers, my co-workers are a great help and pleasant to talk to; hardest part is dealing with angry customers, the most enjoyable part is making them happy."
good,Will cross train. Co-workers become family. Managers are understanding.
good,"I had a great time working for this company. Staples Inc. promotes from within, (may be only for the management, though.)"
good,Loved working there. The management were beyond nice and helpful
good,"Everyday is different in the Copy Center. I learned how to prioritize my work, how to handle customer complaints, and how to identify potential customers. Management have always been very professional and effective in every outcome. My co-workers were very friendly, cooperative, and team work oriented. The hardest and the most enjoyable parts of the job are all ideal with working and learning as a person and with others."

Moving here from out of state I came knowing no one and they gave me a work environment that was comfortable and professional where I could be myself without judgement and give the customers overall satisfaction as soon as they step through the door. The hardest part of my job is not being able to provide the customer with the information they need since I am still in the process of learning. What I enjoy most is that I'm not under a strict law with the company and everyone has a laid back and loving personality.
good,"My typical day at work would require me maintaining the counter, while producing high end copy and print jobs."
good,"-Some days were fast pace and busy, other days were very slow"

good,"A typical day at work for me in very enjoyable, i love keeping bussy and making sure each custumer is assisted if needed and leaves the store satisfyed. i learn that to be part of a business you have to work as a team and always make sure your job is done right! My co-workers are a big part of my working day. We all work as a team and keep in mind the the custumers are number one. The hardest part of the day is letting an unsaticfyed custumer leave the store and the most enjoyable part of the day is helping people out and making there day that much easyer when they walk in."

good,"I come to work dressed, clock in for work...go to the regrister & help check out customers, answer phones, then stock when it's not busy."

good,Stapples paid a fair wage and was produtivity driven. If you did your job you were treated well.
good,"I started at Staples when I was young, and my managers helped me grow as both an individual and as an employee. They are the nicest group of managers you could ever hope to have. The best part of my job was knowing that when you go to work, you have a group of people who genuinely care for you as a person, not as a coworker."
good,Staples was always a fun working environment to work at everyday. The managers and other staff were always respectful and honest. I enjoyed my time spent working there and learned a lot throughout my Staples working experience.
good,A typical day at work started after school in the afternoon never a dull moment. I learned how to handle a lot of issues with customer with no frustrations. Management were nice understanding people. My co-worker were young and productive like myself we all got along well the age difference wasn't that bad. The hardest part of the job was getting home at a decent hour but other than that I didn't really have any complications. The most enjoyable part was the compensation every week.
good,"Lots of training was provided, Great team of associates who help each other out between stores. Lots of competition between stores, cannibalisation. Learned the details of running a store with a very good mentor."
good,"Overall, Staples is a very good company to work for. I am glad to be part of the team. There are benefits, 401k, and stocks you are able to buy. There is room for advancement if you meet the needs. Co- workers get along great. Our store is a family."
good,"Wonderful environment, employees and people are friendly, great positive productive environment!"
good,Management is good at my store. The only downside is if you work at a smaller store (like mine) the scheduling is lacking a lot in the break department. Other than that I can't complain to much. It's retail folks so don't expect to get rich doing it. just go into it with the right mindset and you'll do fine.
good,Typical day is either doing tech work or on the sales floor helping out customers and future tech customers.
good,A typical day would be using a ticket system to repair computers based on priority and date entered in the system. If no computers are to be repaired then time would be spent taking care of tasks around the store like selling to customers and setting up new product and displays.
good,i really like working there i learned alot there from customer service to upselling iteams.
good,"Strong basis on values, and leadership. Company prides itself on being the leader in office products."
good,Staples is a great place to work I wish there was one in the st louis area so i could transfer there instead of lookibg for a new company
good,"Good place to work, move into hire positions and cross training, Good communication and ethics are in place. Role specific duties that allow you to develop your own in-put."
good,"The culture here is great, I love my manager and all the upper management.  They are all down to earth and have an open door policy right down to the VP's."
good,I enjoy working with my managers and the rest of my coworkers. The most enjoyable part of my job is communicating with customers and pleasing them with excellent service.
good,"I spend much of my time selling the best strategies to go with buying electronic items, the customers are always interesting."
good,"As a sales consultant you are expected to schedule 6 meeting per week minimum. And also are expected to close around 4-5 customers per month. A ton of autonomy as most people in this role are in the field 3-4 days per week. Great base pay and training program as well as a commission subsidy in your first few months in the role. However this role has a high turnover due to the increased pressure to hit always increasing quotas as months go on. Our customers/leads realize this and sometimes are frustrated by the wide amount of people calling them. Management has been great overall for me, but its hit or miss for others. The work environment is laid back and we have a lot of team events. The reality is in this job if you dont hit your numbers you will be fired, period. But it is a great role to learn sales tactics and earn a solid salary/commission!"
good,"I really enjoy working at Staples, however, I do not believe that the pay is enough compared to the amount of hard work and pressure that is put on every employee."
good,"They are very accommodating,  it is truly like a family there. Everyone including all of the managers are fun, happy going people and it is a joy to work there."
good,This job is great for those that are just starting out in the job market. There is room for some advancement if you show that you want it and you do a little more than is required. This job is great for those looking for part time work or those attending college.
good,"I loved my time at Staples so much. I loved the coworkers and I loved what I did. It was always a lot of fun. The only down sides were the customers and corporate trying to promote some new policy with credit cards or some other jazz. As much as I loved what I did, we had to shove rewards signups and credit cards down customers throats, which I hated. Staples is a dying company. There's no way they will be open in 2028. The industry is changing. The other problem I had were the customers. I worked in the Copy Center and I'll tell you that those are the most ungrateful human beings on the entire planet. Some were very very nice and understanding, while others complained over fees. Corporate wanted to promote the 'rush fee' as if it were a discounted price for waiting instead. And a lot of customers didn't understand that it's a 1-hour guarantee. Not 20 minutes. 1-hour. I had customers whine and moan at me constantly."
good,"Staples is a great place to work, though not perfect.  As with any job, it has good and bad."
good,Staples has been an amazing company to work with. A typical day work would be very busy and at time require overtime but there has always been support and guidance available from the management team. The environment can at times be intense but there was always room for fun to relieve the intense times. I enjoy my management and my team that always pull through and support each other.
good,Great people to work with. I have formed some life long relationships from this place. Always listening to what you say. You work together as a team. Help is always available
good,"travail productif,travail constant. clientèle habituelle et exigente"
good,"Staples was a great company. I put almost 10 years in and was able to move several times within the department. Unfortunately, it was a little tougher to get me through the management courses, so I eventually left for a full-time management role. However, I owe a lot to this company as I grew the most here."
good,"A great place to work on your salesmanship, the staff and your coworkers are always there for you. If you ever need anything just ask one of your manager, they are really nice about things. Always do your best to meet your sales goals and you should be fine!"
good,"Staples is a learn while you work place of employment. You learn about the new technology coming out and what is better or more useful. You also learn about the paper section they have because you fax and make posters and cards, etc. Also you are making chairs in the back and selling supplies to corporations (like desks and chairs, etc). So you tend to stay up to date in what is popular or more preferred in company styles."
good,"Responsible for supporting our Business Development and Account management teams in Western Canada.  "
good,"I would start my day off on the floor helping customers and unloading boxes to put merchandise up on display. Occasionally would be called up for cashier. The job wasn't difficult was a good learning experience, but was also fast paced. Everyone was nice and helpful. Management was good and they were also very helpful. The hardest part on the job was closing up the shop, especially on back to school week. Most enjoyable part of the job was being at the front ringing customers up"
good,"Great overall. I enjoy it because they keep it fun and have weekly meetings with 3 cohorts that get together. Own cubicle, plus good benefits. Great ethics."
good,I mainly liked working at my Staples because my boss was incredible and he was great to work for.  Hated just the customers coming in right at close asking for something that takes 3 days to complete and also the systems they use are as old as the company.
good,your day can change at a moments notice. was a cashier tech and copycenter attendant all in one day. the headsets can get warm on hot days. bad temp control in store.
good,"GM, Managers and Supervisor are great to work with."
good,"The policies and rules make the place a good place to work. Continuous learning and friendly environment to work."
good,"Every day working at staples warehouse goes exactly the same. I go in punch in and go to the team meetup, to discuss safety protocols, what to expect for the workload that day and what to expect the following week, after that we would get to work by packaging up boxes and sending them out to be shipped. The workplace was very diverse with age, race, and gender, and that was one of the reasons that made it a good experience to work in. Management was good as well, they were always there to help the workers if they had questions and they were very patient and understanding. There really wasn't that much difficulty during the job, only in the beginning when the work environment was very different to me and I had to catch on how things worked while working in a fast pace. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting the employees, I made a lot of friends with the workers who I would not have expected to be so friendly with because of our age difference."
good,"Great company to work for at the time. A wonderful culture and lots of smart, talented people! Had a great time working at the company! Enjoyed everyone I worked with!"
good,A typical day at staples would include a team meeting to let us know what is the plan for the day and for the quarter to let us know if there was anything we needed to work on to ensure that our customers was leaving with the best service as possible.  then i would go and   count my draw to make sure that it was the correct amount of money and change in my draw. Staples was a very fun job for me not only did me and my Co-workers get along so well the customers that came in to the store was friendly and great to talk with. Me and my  Co-worker would set up days where we all went out for dinner and drinker with each  other and their significant others.

good,It's very rewarding when you see your team succeed and meet their goals.  My team was always on the top market basket and square trade selling goals. They show me what great leadership was.
good,In the copy and print department there is a lot of one on one time with all different customers so there is a lot patience required as well as good listening skills because people do not like repeating themselves. Its a great feeling when you complete an order and the customer loves it.

good,"I was a part -time cashier and I loved greeting customers, and helping customers out with purchases and refunds. I would also help customer purchase online items that we did not have in stock."
good,"The work at Staples is explained and as an associate you do your job. The longer you are an associate you learn more and the work gets easier. The employees and management are great as you get to know each other you become a team and pick up where one has left behind and know how to. One of the best things at Staples is the part-time benefits. Overall working at Staples has been great, my only major complaint is the pay sucks, even though its considered a ""starter job"". I think they should  pay more based on experience, availability and quality of an employee."
good,"My day starts depending on what route I would do that day so it could be 6:3--8:15 where I would load my truck and head out for my day. My boss is awesome couldn't have asked for a better one, the people I work with are pretty cool and funny we laugh most of the morning The most challenging thing I find that I have to do is I have to learn every route we have in the building which some routes are easier than others because we have what is called desktop deliveries and I would have to remember which floor what part of the building the customer is in and deliver their packages to either their office or the copy/stockroom. I like the freedom of being in the truck driving around the city and talking to my customers"
good,"Staples is a great place to work if you are looking for a team environment with lots of room for advancement. I started as a cashier at staples and within 2 years was an assistant manager, The most enjoyable part of my job was working with customers and associates."

good,"A typical day included working the cash register, stocking inventory, and assisting customers finding products. I learned how to have good customer service and work as a team in a retail environment. My co-workers were friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers.

good,"I enjoyed the job overall. Like any job, it had its ups and downs, but it was very easy and usually the customers were friendly."
good,"Provide assistance to customers on the sales floor. When needed at front end for checkout, returns, and online ordering. When I'm not assisting customers I would clean and organize the sales floor. At the end of a shift, an associate balances daily cash register paperwork."

good,"co-workers are phenomenal, very enjoyable place, love the management."
good,"I work in the copy and print center witch requires the ability to produce high quality product  under high pressure situation. Staples offers a full survive copy center so over the last year I have learned a lot about printing and finishing equipment. Also I am the copy and print supervisor which has taught me how to manage a productive team, and the responsibility of meeting a quarterly budget. The team that makes up my department is great, we all work together to create quality products that satisfy our customers. You learn quickly that time management is very important, sometimes it can be hard to balance all the projects that you have to get done but regardless when working at this job you will get better at time management. The most enjoyable part of this job is customer satisfaction, having a customer like the job that you just produced for them and building relationships with them."

good,"I help customers with their office supplies needs while, at the same time, keep a clean and presentable floor."
good,"as per CV"
good,"Always something to do at work, I loved the high energy and the on the go mentality I had to have. Made life long fries working here."
good,"I would typically answer phone calls, work as a cashier, and work the sales floor.  It was nice working with my coworkers as we each helped each other.  My managers were willing to help us achieve our goals and help the customers with their needs as well.  The best part of the job was just about everything; however the least enjoyable part was having to work on Black Friday."
good,"Start the day with a rally meeting, followed-up by individual goal setting and high spirits.  Discuss progress with the team mid-day, and course-correct where needed, praise where applicable.  Management of budgets and hours, as well as interviews and performance reviews.  All of the aforementioned items and more make up a day at Staples.  It is a fun company to work for!"
good,"le travail d'quipe  et l'humanité des supérieur"
good,"Everyday is different at staples, I get to learn how to interact with different types of customers, and helping the customers with what they are needing."
good,Long work hours. Flexible scheduled time off. Mangers change frequently. The hardest part of the job is the long 14 hour days. The most enjoyable is the company activities.
good,"Great work environment.  All the employees are wonderful people to be with, However i wish there were more options for positions, and availability to chose more hours."
good,"Has its high and low moments of work. Basic duties of a retail store including cleaning stocking assisting customers. But nothing too hard"
good,needed more hourly pay for means of living. company was great. good security and benefits
good,"I have been an associate with this company for three and a half years "
good,I enjoyed work in the Facility. everyone was family to me . I was employed there for 18yrs. most of the employee work there for 8yrs or more....we were a great team!
good,On a typical day I provide exceptional customer service and ensure customers orders are done to satisfaction.
good,"Working with Staples was wonderful. They moved me from seasonal to permanent, and then promoted me afterwards. Management was fair and hard working. My only reason for leaving was that I needed more work hours and my store only employs part time. Other than that, great company."
good,"Every day that I went into work at Staples, I helped customers find products that they were looking for and suggested other items that they might need. I stocked shelves, assembled chairs as needed, helped co workers here and there, set plan-o-grams, unloaded and loaded trucks, and cashiering."
good,"Being the supervisor of the Copy Center, I oversee all the custom print jobs coming and going. I get to have a relationship with the customers and watch the joy on their faces when the finished products returns correct. On top of it all I get to have conference calls every Monday to learn new ways to grow the business and help my associates. It can be stressful at time but very manageable."

The management is very good. They are understanding of sick days or anything you need to take care of. The environment is fun and friendly and the most enjoyable part of the job is hitting budget and making some extra money for working very very hard."
good,i love working in a fast paste. I enjoy working with my co-workers. I have to say the most thing i enjoy about working is that its my place to show what i can so.
good,"A typical day at work for me at staples was easy and fun. Usually its the same group of customers that come in throughout the day so we got the chance to actually know our customers by name and thier prefrences as far as their purchasing habits go. The managers bring themselves down to your level and treat you as equals withing the company rather than considering themselves as superiors. Overall i loved working for the company, they value their employees and would do what they needed to do to ensure that we were working on the top level of performances. The hardest part of the job was selling service plans and getting people to sign up for the rewards programs. the most enjoyable part of my job with staples was just coming to work everyday."
good,Seeing this store from bare walls to the finished product was amazing. I really enjoyed the people I worked with. Customers seemed to enjoy their shopping experiences.

good,Great experience highly recommend for anybody looking for a great peaceful job and that's willing to please the customers for whatever they need and direct their item
good,"Working as a cashier for Staples taught me to do be efficient and diligent with cash handling for I was held accountable for all transactions made by cash or debit/credit. Also, working in the Print & Copy department, allowed me to enhance my flexibility skills among other essential skills such as time management, efficiency, detail-oriented and instruction following skills. It was a pleasure working with an ambitious and reputable team"
good,"Staples can be a very fun and fulfilling environment, but only if you can put in the effort! You must have the drive to succeed and must be competitive. Stores are always competing against one another in a friendly way and corporate expects each store to meet certain goals weekly!"
good,"I have no issue with staples the management was mostly nice and easy to talk to my co-workers were good people, but my job was repetitive in a way that I really didn't like I was essentially placing things on racks or organizing them. It's not really a complaint about the store just the position I had my experience with staples was a nice one"
good,"Low volume store with a great team of associates. Most days are not busy, but there is still work to be done. The busiest time is back-to-school, but compared with other franchises during christmas it's nothing."
good,"Overall I enjoyed the coworkers and time spent with them during my shifts. Managers were pretty flexible, and kind. Never a bad encounter. I would return"
good,"I worked as a cashier, it was a typical cashier job . The managers were really flexible when it come to my school schedule. Back to School season is really intense  with all the sales , but if you are able to work well in an intense environment then this place is for you ."
good,"Excellent job for a multitasking and active person. Needs to like customer service, and be possitive with customer. Print and marketing area is a good place to see orders get done fast."

good,"Very busy store, Great on going training and Perks."
good,"I have really enjoyed working for Staples. I have a great management team here at Store 1275. I have been with the company for about two years now. It always has had that friendly work aroma. I have learned a lot sales wise working here. How to ""market basket"" a sale and how to really close out on a good sale. Working here has also provided me how to provide great customer service as well. The hardest part of my job is probably lugging the heavy chairs up and down the ladder but the most enjoyable is when I help a customer greatly and they leave with a smile on their face."
good,Managers encourages all employees to continue their schooling
good,"The main thing that I really do enjoy about working for Staples is the fact that i am in a position where i am constantly busy. I have learned plenty things from this company but the main thing that comes to mind is accountability. The managers and co workers are extremely helpful at that store, they never hesitate to attend to any of the other associates in time of need, and they are always open to have questions that any of the associates have. The hardest part of the job is probably having to be able to multitask between whatever project you are working on and the customer that has some questions. The best part of the job is just the sense of accomplishment after getting off an 8 hour shift."
good,Very comfortable enviornment to work in. It was easy to dedicate time and hard work and at the end of the day felt like it was worth it.
good,"A typical day for me starts with down stocking the shelves. I work aisle by aisle, while also maintaining a strong presence on the sales floor to help customers. I walk each customer I help to the product and provide excellent customer service. I answer any customer service calls or transfer them to the correct department. I also work in the Copy and Print department. Taking orders, answering phone calls, and using two copy machines, a fax machine, and our computer is a must. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help my customers get everything they need and seeing them leave 100 percent satisfied! I love the family environment that Staples has. All the employees are close friends and get along with one another, including the managers and supervisors. The managers are friendly but also know how to maintain a professional relationship with every single employee. I have learned a lot by working at Staples. From providing excellent customer service, to building relationships with our customers."
good,"I liked this job at first, but the only thing was the pay raise wasn't that  great. I started out at 7.05/hr in 2007 and was only making 7.75 when I resigned in 2012."
good,I was able to apply for benefits for Staples but I was not impressed with medical coverage by Aetna for part time associates. Staples coworkers are very easy to get along with. Overall Management is very easy to get along with and work very well around preferred schedules.
good," I was working as Client Services Rep, At Saples i was Multitasker i worked as Copy center rep  print copies ,design  business card, wedding cards calendar's  custom made stamps, binding copies  made flyer, banners, poster it was very functional job + handling cash register  dealing with 30 to 50  clients in day   every client has a different type of  requirement i make sure we met client requirement in minimum time period&takecare  quality standard + i worked  administrativeAssistance back office assigned tills to cashier ,  closed all  cash register review all transcations  and filed all paper work report to Manager."

good,"A positive mission statement outlines the goals and demonstrative behavior that exemplify the highest commitment to quality and service to each other, the company, customers and shareholders. The company sets out to achieve its goals in ethical, honest ways with an elevated sense of purpose to improving the planet and humanity."
good,"While working in retail i have experienced, and learned many things. One of the most important aspects is building customer relations with every customer that walks in the door, and helping them, and making sure that they keep coming back to the store for further transactions. Another, is being able to work comfortably with co workers to make the work environment a better place."
good,I loved my position at staples it was a great mix for me to be with customers and design to put my artistic skills to work taking inventory on supplies for my department and ordering more
good,"bonne entreprise , j'apprécie vraiment mon manager il m'aide vraiment à m'améliorer"

good,i like working at staples because it was always a good company to work for as well as they had good benefits and it will always be a good company
good,"Staples easily beats out the competition, and they have a set program that really works for them. Its no wonder that they are the number 1 office supply store out there!"
good,They fired me over a unpaid monster that I paid for later and when I checked myself out with my employee number by mistake they fired me over it and I loved the job and I just think it’s bull that I was fired over something that was a mistake
good,the job was easy. mangement there wasnt good. they would pick favorites . it was a slow store
good,"I've worked in the retail industry before, and working at Staples has given me more insight or a different perspective on retail stores. I've learned how merchandise is handled, received or removed, and skills in working with the team and customers. I am a fast learner so I picked everything up fast and found myself training the new employees in no time. I am relied on for much that goes on at staples, including removing bale, ensuring stock room organization, merchandise imagery on sales floor, and deliveries through UPS. I am amicable and have met great people at Staples, including staff and customers. I don't imagine there to be a hard part of this job, only that it doesn't compensate enough and my bills are overwhelming."
good,"Nice management."
good,Had a wonderful time learning the copy center duties and trying to learn other areas in the store as well
good,"This is a good company but I had a bad experience. I like all of the products and services I was selling at staples, but the management team was a little off. The weekly schedule would often change...three times a week! combine that with only getting 20 or so hours a week in the first place and you can see where the frustration comes from. The managers would reprimand us for showing up late or not showing up at all because the schedule had been changed in our absence and we had not been informed."
good,I've learned that the the only way to move up is to leave. The job is not challenging at all so you can do your job without much brain power. Good work life balance however.
good,"Awesome Job to bad it closed had lack of work, lived to see their happy faces when they came back for their job. "
good,you are on production you got to be able to scan listen and count fast to get at least 100 products scan and packs no vacation time or benefits at and you have to be at work 11 in the morning  you never  no what time you are getting off though
good,"Benefits are minimal, job environment is good but no chance for advancement. There is only one person for each department which makes it difficult to keep up with daily duties and give good customer service."
good,"A great place to work, this store was not as busy due to poor management. They didn't have a vacumn that worked. They had great cash registers, you could take items off if the customers changed their minds. I was part time there, too. The hardest part of the job was a family hardship that arose. My mother in Arizona was diagnosed with Alzheimers, her caregiver had a stroke, my brother went down there and then he had a stroke!, So I had to go help. I had not been  at Staples for 90 days, so they let me go. I had let them know about the family emergency, but that manager, didn't even call me to tell me I no longer had a job. I  got back and told him we  Mom moved to California, I was gone a month. I even called to keep him informed."
good,"I worked at CPC and it helped a lot with being organized and multitasking and working with others and getting good communication skills. I liked this job, I would go back."
good,It Was A Great Job I Just Had Problems At Home That Came In Conflict With Work Managers Had Favorite People So You Know How That Goes But Like i Said It Was A Decent Job
good,New general manager desperately needed  she showed no knowledge of leaderships and general management lack of basic math skills and always bent the rules for certain employees
good,I learned a lot about how to truly handle different types of customer's needs.
good,"My co-workers didn't want to work as a team, it was everyman for himself."
good,My time working here was well spent but it fits more with a High school to College lifestyle unless you are in Management. Only during the back to school time does the company tend to wax and wane on you.
good,"It's very slow paced veginebers job unless you are a technician .It miserly made to fix computer and sell computer /office quipmentt ,but I beleive they hire great employees and have great customers come there daily"
good,"A very nice place to work it just doesn't pay enough to live on.A typical day as a cashier is to ring up customer's purchases, answer phones, place orders on Staples website for different product we don't carry in store.Stock the snacks and make sure the cooler is full."
good,"Ringing up items"
good,It is good if you want to start off working and get the job experience but honestly the company is very picky. It is easy to learn the new material they want but they will switch it up on you in a few months you have to keep adapting.
good,"I'd rather not comment on the company, thank you. "
good,"This is not a dream job for a fresh out of college wide eye young person. However, it is a great job to have while in still college. Pay is okay, if you are not paying rent, or have children to feed. And you get paid every week! Can't beat that!"
good,Retail is not my cup of tea Waking up at 5 am to stock shelves was not a part of my job description but i did it every friday. It was an OK job at best only because i got paid 10 an hour despite it being part time.
good,Everybody works hard on making sure that the customers leaves satisfied. Management is very open and schedules are flexible hours could be better but its a great place to work if you need some extra cash in your pocket.
good,El Cerrito was a little under staffed and management was poorly chosen but with a strong team great company to work for. The location was ideal for a lot of customers but also brought in a lot of theft and lack of associates to keep eye out for potential theft.
good,"Loved my job, advanced fast to management. However, due to company cuts..I was chopped down to part-time and asked to take a 1.80 per hour pay cut. I chose not to stay."
good,"The owner of the company was a great person. He was firm with his needs, but not overpowering and making you feel less than him. he respected your opinion, and really stepped up when you shared your concerns or ideas with him. this was a great company to work for."
good,"At least at the store I was working at, one of the assistant managers and the district manager have very bad ethics. Basically ""do ANYTHING it takes to get more money"" out of the customer. Included making false positives on virus scans and ""half-way"" repairing a computer and calling it completely repaired."
good,"I was a cashier, taking the customer money, credit card however they pay for their merchandise."
good,It was great job. I got to help customers face to face which was good for me. I became more of a peoples person and It also showed me that helping people is something I really enjoy doing. Overall I wouldn't mind working here again.
good,Good company. They treat you well and help you understand the customers need. Management is not to bad they help you achieve your daily requirements for the day.
good,"Delivering outstanding customer service, giving great advice on product/ merchandise which can further their business/ company to the next level and also provides them with supplies"
good,It is a good place to work to be advanced to a higher position and learn how to be a Computer Technician. It is a positive atmosphere and the workers are friendly.
good,Prototypical warehouse and delivery driver work. No real culture but a lot of trust and respect for the employees. Senior leadership was inspiring and forward looking.
good,"A typical day at Staples is me going into work and clocking in, signing in to the cash register machine and cashing out customers and putting in their rewards phone number and cleaning the register before closing the store."
good,"Management team was wonderful. "
good,I will love to go back to staples. The people working at staples treat you like family. they are the best at working as a team an would recommend anyone to work there
good,"a productive workplace from the moment you clocked in, until the ending of shift.  Everyone in the facility worked as a TEAM. There was always an opportunity to make extra earnings with overtime."
good,"You went into work knowing what you will be doing. Great communication every day about anything pertaining to the work day and the company as a whole. I learned to drive 5 different forklifts and the software- Sunbeam & pick-to-light. Management was horrible, I was discharged at a time when management was looked at poorly. My brother and sister still work there and said the corporate came into the warehouse and let go of the bad management. Co-workers were great, except the ones that were slow. That means someone's slack would have to get picked up."
good,"It was very good regards to company but when it comes to work it was very much confusing in terms of reporting to the senior managers. Management was not in bangalore they were sitting in else where which we cannot directly communicate to them. "
good,"Hard work, long days. Great group of people to work with. learned: patience and customer service. Deliveries upstairs with no elevator is the hardest part of the job. Freedom of being out on the road"
good,Staples is a great place to work for people looking to maintain a jb with cusotmer service where you will be directly assisting people on a day to day basis.
good,I loved working at the copy and print center. It was a whole new experience for me. It was fast pace and down to earth. I loved working with different types a cards and photos. A new experience is always a good one!
good,The employees are awesome but the store itself is just okay. Nothing good about how they treat the employees. I am not to fond of staples and probably won't work there again after I get a better job
good,Working in the copy centre is busy but rewarding. i have learnt many new skills working here from price changes to copy centre.
good,"No chance for advancement but a fun place to work, I love my immediate managers and my customers are great the downside is its an hour away from home"

good,"It's a job. If you want to work part time for a really good company, in a very easy and laid back work environment, then Staples is the place for you!"

good,"A typical day included helping customers on the sales floors, writing work orders for computers, restocking shelves, cleaning easy tech bench. i learned how to manage stock, help customers with certain needs, the fundamentals of customer service. management was excellent, never not helping. All co-workers got along very well and worked together as a unit. hardest part of the job is to put the printers on the top shelves as some of them are very heavy. best part about the job are the customers and the stories they have."
good,"I liked working there, but my boss was a jerk when it came to personal obligations and emergencies. The company itself is starting to focus more on competing with online sales versus in-store sales, which made it difficult for our store. They stopped stocking the stores with computers and furniture because they wanted us to sell the item but then get the customer to order it online in the store, which no one really wanted to do. So overall it's a nice place to work, but the company needs to realize that they should keep focus on their in-store customers, instead of trying to compete with Amazon so much."

Over time was always needed.
good,"Greeting, meeting customers, seeking out what they need and then showing the good, better, and best option. Learned not to prejudge someone and their buying ability. Management is down to earth and yet very professional. Co-workers like their job and show it, some work harder than others, but most pull their own weight.

good,"manager was crooked, stole hours from us. store was closed not long after."
good,Staples is a great opportunity to develop customer service skills for those that are people lovers. However for a full time position the pay is below average and the management team rarely recognizes associates hard work and dedication to the company. Schedules vary every week and they are not done in advance. It is difficult to organize family-friends activities.
good,"I’m a good listener very attentive to my surrounding, patient and respectful to others, honest, friendly, self discipline very observant I like to think outside the box sometimes"

good,"Easy to manage even when busy "
good,Great company to work for. Provided great incentives and benefits. The only reason it did not work out for me is that i wanted to advance faster then the availability allowed.

good,"Great people to work with "
good,Its a nice place to work. But same story as another retail store. They to really expect a lot from you and the stores are not really that busy most of they time but only back to school. BUT they don't give you any benefit and also pay so less

good,"Staples was a blast at the store level but once corporate came in and started making changes, profits went down and customers were less satisfied."
good,"People love to shop at Staples so we are busy most of the time. Customer service is the priority than comes processing merchandise. I learned after customer service,  speed is everything when working in high pace and high volume environments and getting the customers in and out as quickly as possible is key to making customers happy and come back to us. Management works with you when it comes to scheduling, hours, and when you need help. My co-workers are very helpful and team oriented. We get the job done! The hardest part of the job is balancing out helping customers and processing the truck when it comes in on those days.The most enjoyable part of the job is when the customer comes back asking for you."
good,"Not a bad company.  A lot of expectations for the money if you're a computer associate.  Your experience will depend mainly on your store managers, as in most places"
good,"A typical day at work is when I have to go on different section to stock and sort shelves in each aisle to become organized. What I learned from my workplace is that it teaches me how to stock in each aisle so I can learn quickly and efficiently and I learn how to build a chair. I've managed to work through my time because I was using time management to get all the work done as best as I can. I met my co-workers because I help them get stuff they need for cashier, office supplies and copy/print centre. The hardest part of the job is this; I have to work on different section such as cleaning the aisle, cleaning computer/tablets and cleaning furniture to keep them all maintained for the environment.

good,Good company to work for had great 12 years working for the company until the shop were I was working closed.
good,I worked on computers and diagnosed computer related issues.
good,the only problem with working here was the power struggle between the managers which confused the staff alot

good,"Provide customer service, andswer and direct calls, put out new items."
good,The company ideals and vision excel in the common economy and business practice environment.

good,"Staples typical work day will always start at 7:00am one-hour before the stored opens it start by cleaning the restrooms and sales floor. Management would always be there for stores opening. Management wasn't to strict but fair because they will always assign you something when finished your usual previous task. Least enjoyable part of the job was truck night it start at 6am."
good,"I love working here, but they gotta step up and give more hours to employees because instead of giving more hours, they sometimes ask us to take long breaks to cut down hours."
good,It's a decent place to work but you get stuck in one job without a variety.  Same thing different day and couldn't talk management into moving me to the floor so I could move around and not get stiff from standing in one spot
good,"Staples is a great place to start to learn the sales process and either be promoted or look elsewhere."
good,"I enjoyed my time working at Staples as a copy and print associate. It was always busy with lots to do and never any down time. It kept me on my toes, learning new things everyday."
good,Advancement for higher/better positions are very limited and are not clearly outlined and explored. Furthermore this company can offer great opportunities for further career options but unwilling to provide those to their current qualified employees. The opportunity to advance would be given to an outside worker instead of recognizing their current talent pool.
good,"Courier/Driver"
good,"My overall work experience at Staples was wonderful. I learned a lot during my time also the management was great. I really enjoyed the workplace culture because everyone was so friendly and treated each other as family.

good,"Working there was a very challenging and rewarding experience. It taught me about being productive and sociable. It also taught me how to interact and work with others. The hardest part of the job was directing people to the product they asked for, due to the fact that the description they gave me wasn't precise. The most enjoyable part was interacting with customers and the other employees."
good,I would have loved to stay with the company but there was no room for movement for me. I worked in the copy center and Our manager was there a long and wasn't going anywhere soon so I took a better opportunity.
good,"I was able to get two promotion while at this company. Started as a tech, went to the supervisor, then became Mobility Tech Supervisor. I was able to really build and thrive in numbers in the sales department."

I learned a great deal about upselling in a positive and productive manner by asking open ended questions, dealing with the same techniques asking what they needed; if we didn't have we would endeavor to find it for them within our system online and in real time always receiving positive feedback."
good,Great place to work while going to school. Copy is amazing but customers can be a bit crabby. People work together nicely to get things done.
good,"I worked here and was asked to come back after I moved back to the Florida area, after back surgery."

good,"i was working good till i had to go to college, but now i can't find a good job that pays more. i learned from the bottom and worked my way up to mostly everything"
good,"Typical Day at work is going out in the field to the appointments you set on Monday and Tuesday. Attain invoices and create savings analysis. Present them the savings and negotiate a deal to close the sale. I gained knowledge on how to consult, negotiate, and amazing time management skills."
good,"Staples is a great place to work--large company but small company work environment due to local sales office; great co-workers with synergies to enhance productivity, comfort and efficiency. There is no typical day as work challenges change by the minute. Best part of the job is outside customer calls, presentations, reviews and building existing business, customer support. Learned that best environment for success starts with T.E.A.M. Challenges occur when one fire comes into play when I am dousing another one--but that also makes it interesting as I need to set priorities on the spot."
good,It was a great opportunity that expanded  my social interactions with customers and team members. They taught me how to approach customers that were looking for a particular item and help them with fixing computers problems.
good,"Worked in one department of the store. Typical day would be coming in to see what was in queue for copy jobs and keep the machines running while taking in and scheduling new orders based on type and complexity. Working with customers on finishing possibilities with more in depth projects, businesses with packaged advertising services, assisting customers with the self-serve printing area, maintaining and working with various printing and finishing machines, graphic design and file management, training new workers, and covering for front cashiers when they needed breaks. Management at the time was hard working, focused and sales orientated, easily approachable if there was a problem/question. Co-workers were various but generally as reliable. The hardest part of the job was customers who felt unethically entitled, but that's everywhere in retail, sadly. The pay was very low considering the skills and speed that the workers in my department were expected of. I was there for just over two years, had a degree in commercial printing, had consistent positive customer reviews, and even covered for print departments at other locations, but never made more then 9 an hour but I was told by co-workers that mine was much more than what they made. There were small employee perks but I'd rather bring home a better paycheck. Better pay also would make employees stay longer. So many came and went due to this problem. Constant training and not yet educated employees were a factor in customer reviews. Other than the pay, this was a good clean place to work, with realistic management. Hours were"
good,"checking customers at register, sales, translating, inventory, I enjoy assisting customers, hardest part is picking up other co-workers responsibilities"
good,"Staples being one my favorite stores, I was glad to finally work there and be part of the company. The only thing that they lacked were hours, although the hours did increase during back to school but was looking better hours weekly."
good,I like it but you have to be willing to work in a fast pace enviorment and sometimes it show so you have to do things to pace time.
good,"I enjoy working for Staples very much.  Although it has no relation to the filed of addictions, it keeps me busy and around people and the public.  I enjoy working alone or as a team member and I feel I go above and beyond for this company as far as the scheduling goes and the availability I have made myself available for at short- notice; mainly.  The management treats me with dignity and respect and speaks to me as an equal.  They have sat me down 2 times and said that I was going to be promoted to the head of my department which is office supplies and they have recognized and appreciated all of my hard work that I have put in for them.  I don't get paid much but I do enjoy having a schedule which is set for the employees each Thursday and I like the consistency of the work I provide and the work that is expected of me.  The hardest part of the job, I feel, is coming up with alternative ideas for certain projects or items the customers may be looking for.  I find that it can be challenging at times but it forces me to be creative and to show the customer that the services I am providing for them during their visit to Staples- be a pleasant and enjoyable one!  My coworkers are all very helpful and work extremely well as a team.  We all get along very well and I am very comfortable working with them- we have a lot of fun and laughs throughout our shifts, usually.  They are a majority of high school and college students so sometimes I feel a little ""old"" but I can keep right up with them with the energy and charisma which I try to portray to both my coworkers and to the customers."
good,Nice 8 hours shift with half an hour of lunch break. Access to new tools and systems. Management always ready to listen suggestions and try to improve the things. Over all good working condition. Thanks.
good,"très positif:"
good,"Massive staff made it hard at times to stand out in the team of your department. Did enjoy my co workers with merchandising and facilities. Very tough to find and apply for full time direct hire positions within my departments and skill levels. Despite that, I would love to work for company."
good,"I ENJOYED WORKING HERE..however, the Manager and I clearly did not see eye to eye..and was convinced I stole a measly soda..even though I saw otherwise..then terminated me after NINE LOYAL YEARS"
good,"my second job and i learned everything from here , co workers would help anytime i needed it and the managment was awesome as well"
good,The constant job threat if you don't maintain sales is disheartening but at the same note it is a great job
good,it was a fun a great place working with the company and great people
good,"great people to work with and very productive,great boss who made sure you had everything you needed"
good,"Greet all customers and associates in order to keep open lines of communication and offer support."
good,"Best job i ever held ! The pay is low but i love the company as an all. There was little room for advancement but they were always good with giving me hours and overtime. If you enjoy putting your skills to the test its the perfect job. Not too many employees, but when we got busy it was hectic. But, they were always all for the employees, they would buy us lunch and do surprise parties all the time ! Felt more like a family than work."
good,"Responsible for staff training"
good,"I'm a driver at Staples in Coppell and have been for over 10 years. I love being out in my truck, making deliveries. We have high turn over in some positions that directly affect drivers, this makes things a little chaotic. The work is stable but I don't see much room for advancement. Overall, it is a great place to work and I highly recommend being a driver here."
good,staples is a good job for a hard working person. mamagment does not listen to your consrens
good,"My stay there was nice even though I only stayed for a few weeks, the workers are very helpful and was very patient with me asking them work related questions. They make me feel like i was part of their family. The job was fun because i get to walk around, arranging the items and help customers. Even then, there are days that are dragging. Some days has few customers and no new items to be placed."
good,Staples overall is a great place to work. Co-workers are easy to get along with. Advancement in the work is accessible. Room for growth.
good,I worked mainly by myself since I was a driver and on the road making deliveries. Co-workers were fun and enjoyable. The hardest part about the job was the physical abilities. Some deliveries were difficult to get to and the order could be hard to deliver to the customer. Enjoyable part was knowing the customer appreciated the effort and timely manner that the deliveries were made.
good,"I had a great experience working for staples, great managment and co-workers were great. Only part I didnt like was pay wasnt good and didnt work with your schedule."
good,"No room for advancement BC DM's frequently changeover. Typical day consists of walking floor, planning out employees tasks. Checking sales figures every 3 hours and reviewing each employees sales figures for day. Going through each of the 30 record keeping books to enter numbers."
good,"Good and positive energy, I learned a lot from a great staff of managers and my co-workers are the best people I've ever met. The only bad thing will be that Staples is consolidating buildings therefore, we'll have no job."
good,Responsible for managing a team of 5 employees for remolds.
good,"Management made it a very friendly store and easy for employees to receive respect and services they required. Customer service was key focal point for Staples. Worked very hard in office supplies [which ended up being ""where-needed"" position] for 2 years learning many of the stores operations on my own. Unfortunately, even though i worked hard through my entire time there, i had to leave on my own due to an argument about what they had promised me and what I actually ended up with in terms of hours and employment classification."
good,I love working at Staples. It is a fast paced work environment with great associates. Staples has taught me a lot about customer relation skills and given me an opportunity to grow my leadership skills with my current position.
good,A typical day
good,"all my co-workers were so nice and friendly, i learned a lot from them.gave me a better prospective."
good,"Responsible for interacting with customer, whether they are buying or asking questions. The management team is wonderful to work with, but the pay is minimum wage. The most enjoyable part is interacting with the customers, but the hardest part of the job is the pay.2"
good,a typical day at work consist of faxing dealing with the public copy and print
good,"itr was fun, and easy to do. making sandwiches was easy and baking cookies."
good,"In a typical day of work at Staples, one would come into contact with many individuals. Working at this company taught me different ways to interact with the many personalities of people who come in to shop our products. I have gained leadership values, time management, friends, and I have learned many problem solving strategies. The management is always friendly and willing to help associates and cutomers. My co-workers were always like family to me. Very good people."
good,"I worked at Staples many years ago, for approximately 2 years. Overall it was good. If you work hard and meet target, there are some decent pay bonuses. They do regional contests regularly. It's a great job if you like people, and know your product. My only complaint is that our store went through 2 store managers in a little over a year. This created some instability as systems and procedures were regularly being changed."
good,"I've been working at Staples for 6 months now. As with every job, there are upsides and downsides. The environment in my store is actually fairly nice most days. I usually feel appreciated and important. The general manager and assistant manager definitely could use an attitude improvement but overall it's a pretty great place to work."
good,A typical day at staples starts with going through security and clocking in then checking out MHE and scaner signing in to scaner then i would pick up work load (orders to be picked) and start salecting.
good,Being in management requires an all around communication skill. In which you need to apply with not only customers but your staff and crew members. I am excellent with communicating and solving problems under any kind of stress.
good,I feel at home with my coworkers. We work excellent as a unit. Every employee looks out for one another on the Sales floor. The customers really enjoy our services. Customers are always happy when we attend to their needs.
good,Let me choose my hours and come in whenever I wanted if I wanted additional hours. I could take off work for extended periods of time if needed and it was perfectly fine. My managers and coworkers were awesome and we had work dinners occasionally when they have store funds left over!!
good,Staples is a decent company to work for. The management needs some improvement but the culture is pretty great. This job has really helped me better my skills and knowledge in the field.
good,productive and fast paced with room for overtime according to business needs.Management at staples is top notch and very concerned when it comes to employees needs.
good,"I had a pleasant time working for staples.  A lot of leadership changes and lack of advancement were an issue in my role.  They were closing stores and being the store manager for so many years just proved to be a dead end for advancement."
good,"Supervise eight employees and assist with customer satisfaction."
good,"Staples is a great place to work, with friendly staff members and management. The winter can be a little slow, and the hours short. The summers can be physically and mentally challenging during the Back to School Season."
good,"i mostly value the management team. they are the most respectful, understanding individuals I have ever worked with. even when other managers would work a shift at our store they were just as friendly. staples hires good people."
good,Very good working conditions. Management always available for questions and training. I enjoyed working here because i was always learning something something new.
good,"It is a fun place to work, one thing i like working at staples is that you work on your own, no one bother you as long as you do your job right, and keep a fast pace to meet the company's goal of the day. The only thing that make the environment chaotic is the fact the associate have make production goal,  which make it sometime hard because everyone is looking out for themselves."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Staples thoroughly and feel I was regularly recognized for my contributions."
good,"It depends on who your management team is, but there’s typically 2-3 managers, and 3 supervisors for each department. So if you don’t get along with one there’s always more to talk to. It’s a pretty easy job, and very easy to stand out as a good employee. All you need to do is show up and on time, they’ll train you in any department you show interest in and are rather quick with promotions. I started as a seasonal back to school cashier and went on to do: easy tech lead, copy Center, cash office management, lead cashier, and inventory specialist. Again, I just showed up on time every day and management threw me any opportunity or challenge I was up for. Easy job for lots of different retail experiences."
good,I absolutely enjoyed working here. Management made working here like a second family. They made me feel like part of team even as just a cashier. Miss my second family
good,"the politics and the way the company handles promotions are completely unreasonable"
good,"A typical day at work would generally involve resolving issues from previous staff shifts and completing left-over work while servicing new customers and scheduling new work. Many tasks must be completed at once in order to succeed. In the Print and Marketing department you will likely be working by yourself a lot or ideally with one or two others for a small overlap. You must be able to do many things at once or you will drown in the workload."
good,Pay was low and hours too short for a decent income.  Most of the managers were awesome to work with.  One was less than professional and needs to work on her people motivating skills
good,"Staples was a laid back culture. There was a very relaxed dress code, and having a beer in the office was not frowned upon (as long as you were getting you work done)."
good,If you want to go to school and work decent hours to have money this job is perfect. During back to school they’re like oprah Winfrey with extra hours.
good,"At the particular Staples I was working at, we had a strong selling culture and competition between associates with created a fun work atmosphere. What would bring it down entirely was the General Manager bickering with the Sales manager.  There was a great deal of favoritism too. "
good,I lift up boxes and throw on assembly line and put pallets in correct location. Pick orders and label the sticker on boxes. load trucks build boxes level high on the truck.
good,"A bit monotonous at times, but perfectly fine. All of the managers are very helpful and it's easy to catch onto job details quickly. It's also a pretty straightforward process of advancing."
good,"^ That pretty much covers it, I quite liked working there.  It was an interesting new experience.  I like doing computer stuff but I've had a hard time getting a job with anything like it anywhere so Staples was a welcome change."
good,"Typical days at work can be stressful but fun as well. As a manager, I devote a lot of time to my store. Whether I am at work or not, I am almost always working. The hardest part of the job is actually having time off. The most enjoyable part is helping people to accomplish their vision and bring it into fruition."
good,"great customer service, great staff, works well with student schedules, advancement opportunities, clean and organized store, weekly pay, easy understandable job."
good,The work environment is pleasant and exciting. Training for different parts of the job were very well done and management is experienced and supportive!
good,"The management is good just upper management (DM and higher) are pushing impossible to meet matrix for a dieing company. However, for a sales associate position the pay is decent"
good,I use to love everything about this job but I was fired for no reason. I was told that I didn't make my production goal which was 85% in two weeks but I got a 79% for one week because the second week I was on lite duty.
good,Company is great. There is always that issues you can have in your store. Sadly open door policy sucks. How ever company has treated me with full respect.
good,"Great place to work."
good,"I really really enjoy working with all the other employee's, the work place was good, managers were very understanding and hours were really amazing. Staples is probably the best work place I have ever worked in so far. I learned that patients is key and to never let a customer talk you out of something you said to get something better."
good,"I have loved my time at Staples Loughborough. "
good,Staples has a great benefit and compensation package for management. General manager is the only salaried management in the building.  Days can be long.
good,"Fun place to work I git trained on several departments and learned an out planograms and how to use them."
good,The overall experience with management and employee's is great had a great work experience here at Staples in Palm Desert. Thanks
good,good work enivornment. great people to work with. gain knowledge and learn new things. non stressful place to work which is always a good thing
good,"The management/training staff is very knowledgeable and encourages their employees to advance within the company. Good health benefits, employee stock plan, 401k match."
good,"I enjoy doing planograms, at the end just looking at it and seeing how nice it came out makes me happy. Working with my team is always fun. We work together and help each other out. Meeting new people is great. Engaging with customers is fun as well. Helping them find what they need and seeing them smiling when they got it."
good,Working at staples and making sure each customer gets what they are looking for its the fun part. however management is a disadvantage to this company.
good,"Head office staff, technicians, management and staff are always so helpful and friendly. Good benefits, matching RSP's."
good,"Great fun loving environment."
good,Not a bad place to get started out and gain some sales/customer service/managerial experience. YMMV depending on how good your in-store managers are.
good,"very organized and managed company."
good,"There was no typical day in my last job.  Every day was a joy.  The most enjoyable part of job was deciding whether to make a product obsolete, restock or hold off ordering the stock by judging trends.  I enjoyed the excel, SAP and ordering parts and dealing with vendors both sourcing new pricing and following up after placing orders, this part of the job made if feel real and not just numbers on a spreadsheet."
good,I am thankful for getting the opportunity to be employed at staples. it was alot of fun and interesting. i loved the other employees they definatly made this work place enjoyable.
good,I enjoyed working with all the employees at Staples. That are all hard working with a great work ethic. Everyone works together for the goal of making the company great.
good,"Es herrscht unter Kollegen, bei allen auftauchenden Problemen ein sehr gutes Miteinander. Man schätzt sich."
good,The most enjoyable part of this job is to work with different types of customers on a daily basis. The hardest part of the job is to say no to a customer. (Meaning that we would not be able to produce their job or copy order right then).
good,"A typical day at work for me at Staples was completing and taking any orders and projects for customers. We did banners, scanning, enlargements, business cards, invitations, stamps, and almost anything you could think of. My managers were pretty well at making sure things were being completed on time.  As far as my coworkers, most of them were pleasant to work with. The hardest part about my job was dealing with customers when they were not pleased with something, so that led me to have even more patience than I already had.  Also, problem solving was something I gained more knowledge on during my months at Staples.  I enjoyed seeing all the different designs and ideas for projects customers brought it, and then seeing the looks on their faces when it turned out even better than they imagined."
good,Solid training.  Fun co-workers.  High turnover.  Hardest part of the job was consistently finding new leads.  Most enjoyable is the freedom and compensation.
good,"Most days are pretty good there, but it mainly depends on the mood of the General Manager, if she's there. Aside from that, it can be fun and educational, especially given my job title as an EasyTech. I learned a lot about diagnosing a computer, and how to fix most things, not to mention the aspect of selling."
good,Staples is a very good company to work with. The pay at staples is  not much appreciative. The management is the best management team you can find.
good,"typical day at work,picking and packing boxes onto pallets,"
good,The work environment is fast paced but fun. The staff is friendly and fun to work with. They have a very organized store and maintain the cleanliness of the store throughout the day.
good,I helped to minimize days of sales outstanding with account balances over 90 days by contacting customers via fax or email. I also worked with the customer to help resolve any billing issues that resulted in non payment of the account.
good,Used to pick wegman shipments process them then load and unload trucks using a sit down forklift.. It was through temp agency manpower
good,"busy, nice people, well management, team work., keep learning new products. Mufti tasking. Handle tough situation. Communication, Support."
good,It is a great place to work but the pay is horrible. Much better than other retail establishments in this pay bracket.
good,"On a typical work day I would work the cash register and aid customers as they came to me. During the down time I helped with merchandise that needed to go out onto the floor. "
good,"Interacting with my clients on phone, email and face to face."
good,A store to learn auditing and management skills. How to receive load and prioritize what needs to go out. How the customer is the number one priority. Learn to get along with a wide variety of personalities at work.
good,"•	Cashier Duties.  "
good,At Staples I was the Copy & Print manager. I loved working with my customers to provide them with the total solution.
good,Start at 7 p.m. and ends at 7A.M.  I run a reach truck. The truck has a rf on it that directs me where to pick up a product and take   it  to a location to be stocked so the selector then ship it to the customer. The hardest part is you are on a number . You have to perform at 100%. I give  100% percent all the time even if the time keeper doesn't think so. The most enjoyable part is the friendship  that I made over the years there.
good,"I have learned the quality of a great work culture from working their, the management is understanding and easy to talk to, my co-workers are amazing and are equally understanding. I would say the hardest part of my job is right after 5:30 when my body tells me i need to sleep. The most enjoyable part of the job is the work ethics and culture."
good,"I learned a lot about sales and suggestive selling. My co-workers were great, I never had a problem with any of them. The hardest job may be that it was too slow paced for me, and I need a faster paced environment. The best part of the job is being around people and communicating to them the latest deals and promotions."
good,"Great group of co-workers"
good,Moving on in life staples is behind me. The experience was good but I'm looking forward.
good,"Working for Staples warehouse was challenging and also very rewarding. I learned how to work effectively, independently and also part of a team. Also recieved my certification to operate a forklift and rider jack as well. I enjoyed my job 100 percent & highly appreciate the working expierience & coping skills."
good,"Managing associates during the day was a constant, there were times when the task load out weighted the associates in the building. Customer service was the main goal, and this was first priority for all, taking care of the customer and reorganizing the task was second."
good,"Staples is a great retailer to work for. The advancement opportunities are the best that I have seen. You learn plenty about technology and use it on a daily basis. The training that they provide is great. Upper management is very professional and hands off. One down fall to Staples is the constant change, in retail change should always be expected so it is not for everyone."
good,a typical day at work was simply upselling. of course we had down time where we stocked shelves and put out new merchendise but it was always about the same. management was ok they were kind of a little to friendly with the coworkers rather then being someone they can take orders from and look up to them. my coworkers were just like every where else some you like some you dont but i pretty much got along with everyone. i would have to say the hardest part of the job was trying to explain how something works to someone who has no clue if they even need it or what its for. i loved the work enviornment i never went home in a bad mood.
good,Good company but compensation is low even for entry level. Management is good but low pay equals low quality of employee.
good,My job as a Sales Associate is to run the front counter and answer customer questions. For the most part the job is simple and can be interesting.
good,"It is a great part time job, not for someone who needs more than 15 hours a week."
good,"Making copey, making poster and assisting customers with their small or large orders. I learned how to use machine and provide productive customer service. management were pleasant to work with. co-workers were like family. the most enjoyable part of the job was pleasing customers and my supervisor."
good,"Very interesting easy work place, team oriented, fast paced environment. Learned great computer skills , telephony skills, the hardest part was meeting sales quota's, the most enjoyable part was the downtime in the call center."
good,"Staples, Inc. is a remarkably well-run company with many advantages but with frequent pay cuts and little job security, and the Maitland Sales office is dysfunctional"
good,It was a seasonal job I enjoyed the experience with I could had stayed more time their. Was great with team members wish I had more time their to show my skills
good,"I liked my job, pretty simple and easy. I liked everyone there but there wasn’t enough hours not enough to pay. Other than that, management and coworkers were cool!"
good,It's a great work place to start off and build your warehouse knowledge. Management is okay. Everyone that works there are very hard workers. Great schedule and weekends off.
good,Entreprise basée sur le service à la clientèle. J'ai eu du plaisir avec mes collègues. Tout est basé sur la communication. Il faut aimer former et coaché les associés. L'aspect le plus agréable est de rencontrer de nouvelles personnes et entre en contact direct avec les gens. L'aspect le plus difficile se résume à la recherche constante de personnel et donc un investissement de temps qui doit être planifié à tous les jours.
good,Nice there alot to say about it it keeps u busy if u like retail u would like it if not then don't do retail. U can help schools with supply's they need
good,"The workplace is easy at retail if you learn to take care of your customers needs. Most customers needed their jobs printed and finished with quality, sometimes jobs on a rush. I used to repeat to every associate in my department: ""people can wait, be patient""."
good,"Amazing company to work for, they will work with your class schedule and will work around your times. You can grow with the company move up the ladder through out the years."
good,I applied for a position I was approved for a by HR. The store manager my supervisor position to an employee who was already working for them. The manager asked me did I mind taking another position that pays less money and is part time. He also told me it will be temporary and he take time to teach me to manage. He never found the time nor did get the supervisors position
good,This is an excellent company to work for I would recommend to anyone. I have been with this company for over eight years. If you all a people person and multi-tasker this place would be the place to work.
good,Staples was my first job. I worked in the copy center which was a bit more difficult. The management was amazing and so helpful. I was able to pick up on things super quickly with the help of the supervisor at the time. Hours were great! Everyone got along so well!
good,"It’s a great place to work if you’re looking to help supplement your finances. Over in the copy and print department, it sometimes gets really really busy. "
good,"Everything is great except salary is a limited one with steps. If you reached step 5 which is 18:50$,there is no chance that salary will be raised after this. No promotions etc. After all its great place with good management and nice people"
good,"Had I been paid more, I would've stayed in a heartbeat. The mangers care about their people and worked with any situations that came up. Even when it would be busy mangers would step up to help and make sure people took breaks as needed."
good,"It was my first job in Canada. As a full-time student I had not much time left to work, so they gave me mostly the weekends. I was very helpful during my college, but now I am seeking something that pays better."
good,I worked there for 14 years .Business Closed. Wish I could have relocated with this job .I am looking for a job that is similar to this job. Also hope to find good co workers
good,Working here gives employees a good sense of responsibilities. It has very good incentives for those who sell enough products to consumers and also bonuses for product sells.
good,"I loved the managers and employees. Your day was never boring. A typical day would involve stocking shelves, cleaning the store, and helping customers. The managers gave you the days off you needed and did not penalize you for if emergencies popped up."
good,Plenty of opportunity to learn additional customer service skills.  Projects offered to learn merchandising.  Re-stocking and price changes always open for improvement.
good,"It was the usual, come in the store and greet my co-worker and just get to work. I learned a lot of new things such as the tools we were using to get what we needed. The hardest part of the job was when there was nothing to do except assisting the customer, it was kind of slowing time. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking with my co-workers while working, and lunch break."
good,"my time at staples was great. I learned a lot about stocking, closing/opening the store, the print center, and more. my coworkers were great, they treated me well. both my managers were incredible and handled everything within the store amazingly well."
good,"Typical day of work consisted of speaking to customers, stocking merchandise, analyzing computers for problems. Things were great and the managers really did their jobs perfectly."
good,"The atmosphere within Staples is very good. Energetic co-workers, great in-store management. Pay is below living wage however, so a good starting job unless you are promoted quickly. Staples does not have many full-time position jobs within their stores as they try to maintain high profit and low overhead."
good,Ambiente excelente e colaborativa para se trabalhar
good,"I enjoyed working for this company. The environment was fast paced,  but the people we were helping was the best part! I believe that it's definitely a career in this company."
good,"I enjoy working at Staples in Charleston, SC but the pay is not enough to be able to live in Charleston, SC by yourself I had another job where I made more money in order to pay my monthly bills.  It is a good part time job to get a little extra money on the side or if you are a young person starting out in the work world.  I would suggest to start out as a cashier or stock person because the copy center and easy tech department are much more stressful positions."
good,"Personally, my day at work consists of interacting with easily 20 people, given that I am only a part-time worker as of right now. Working for a minimum of 4.5 hours earns you a 15-minute break, and working for at least 6 hours gets you a half-hour break."
good,The copy center at staples is pretty high pace but great place to learn . Patience is the key . Management is very understanding . U become like family after a while .
good,The Staples i worked at actually went out of business a couple months after I left the area because it just did not get enough customers. I would sometimes just sweep cause there was nothing else to do. We did not get many customers but my co-workers were friendly and it was an easy job. I learned a lot and helped a lot of people with their electronics issues
good,"The job itself was pretty simple and enjoyable, management for the most part were easy to work with and made it a point to be accomidating, however, the training could have been better. It was a little frustrating that as a new person barely anything gets explained fully so you do everything wrong until someone yells at you because you didn't know better. This was very apparent in many of the new hires."
good,a typical day at staples would be busy. it depends in what department you are in. I am in the print and marketing department and yeah it gets busy but i love it
good,High paced closed door facility with multiple daily challenges. My team always made our plant run effectively and efficiently. My Manager was very compassionate about the well being of our Team as well.
good,"A empresa é otima , não fiquei mas tempo . não por causa de mal diciplina ou não desenvolver minhas atividades ... mas tive que sair por motivos pessoais que me obrigou praticamente pedir dispensa ."
good,"Every department stick to their work load, not much cross training took place. Team-work was not part of their culture.  I did learn a lot of new skill that remain with me today."
good,"it was fast paced most of the time. Customers can get impatient so being detail oriented and fast paced is a plus, Acknowledgment of the customers is highly recommended. Customer service skills is key. You need to know how to work on computers, answer phones, & work/maintain assistance on all printers and copiers. You have several projects with deadlines. I really liked the job, it lwas perfect for me and my customers loved me so did my employees & management."
good,"Great job, one of my very first jobs back in high school. I worked as a Sales Associate, the pay back then was minimum wage, staff was friendly and management was amazing, The people I worked with were friendly, always had hours available and were flexible. The staff was always willing to help out."
good,"It wasn't my first job and retail doesn't always pay that great. It was ok for what I did as far as pay goes. When I first started there and for the first 2 years it was great people I worked with were awesome and mangers were as well, we always had fun but we did work hard. Of course you always have people who come and go and aren't the best of employees but for the ones that stayed the longest they were great. It was only when the managers were let go (for some mysterious reasons and if the rumors were true then they were let go for stupid reasons) that it wasn't such a great place to work for. The store in Bradenton on 41 off of 57th was closing and we had a couple managers come through then we were transferred to other stores and it just wasn't the same. But I found a better job and left. So it all worked out for me."
good,"I enjoy working at Staples, it is a great place to work for part time employment.  I enjoy my job and my coworkers.  It can be fast-paced at times but everyone works as a team and the managers are supportive."
good,Retail is a great place to work if you are currently a student or trying to transition to a different career. I worked at Staples throughout college and it was awesome for a part-time position to make some money. I never saw it as a long term career because of the lack of pay and career advancement.
good,"I was unfortunately part of an outside sales division that was ultimately not profitable. Perform at or above company standards and receive great praise and reward for it. If you can apply the work smarter not harder theorem to this job, it is one of the best jobs I’ve had."
good,"retail, good for high school students or entry level positions. Good for a first time job. Minimum wages and need discipline and a fast past environment"
good,Very numbers driving the particular store I am in is often top 5 in the nation. Can be very stressful and demanding to meet those numbers for the pay we receive
good,When I worked at staples I worked with the most awesome staff. They were very knowledgable and taught me most of everything that I know. They were always ready to work and knew how to make work fun. The job was never hard if you had the right people tracing you.
good,I started in the warehouse did that for 4 years then move up to plate mounting did that for 4 years them move up again to run a printing press did that for 5 years was enjoying that got to be employee of the month..
good,Amazing place to work.  Definitely offer amazing work/life balance culture.  Management is easy to work with and value your ideas.  Company believes in retaining talent.
good,"I have a place in this job, my customers make me happy. I get to help with every part of the store, I'm a part of a team, and customer service makes me happy. The hardest part of the job is balancing chaos that ensues when you don't have enough employees for such a large store, but it is manageable. My managers have been very accommodating, I really appreciate all that they do."
good,"Working at staples isn't that bad, the corporate office is really out of touch though and pushes lots of dumb things on the employees. The management in the store is good though"
good,"like it here good work life balance, nice people, learn a lot good collaborative enviornment, good communication with employees, good work life balance."
good,I started out working in the furniture department assembling and selling furniture.  Later I moved on to be on the freight crew and then to being the copy center lead and finally the inventory specialist.
good,"The managers can be pretty cool but also hard on you at the same time just to make you better. It can be super busy sometimes, but everyone works together to get the job done."
good,"Staples is a fair and good company to work for.  Management is exceptional in understanding employee personal needs and supports their employees needs with an opened mind which is very important to me.  Staples only offers employees, (unless granted management status) 25.7-28.5 hours per week at $9.30 per hour averaging approx. $220. per week give or take taxes with held NET income monthly of approx. $880.00."
good,"My experience at Staples has been more than a pleasure. Unfortunately, they do not offer full-time hours to associates which is what I need."
good,Very solid company from the beginning. Great group of strong management and staff. Opportunity for advancement and relocation if desired.
good,"Staples was a place were i looked forward to coming every morning, setting work goals and keeping up with the top sales leader was what i enjoyed most about my job. I learned how to deal with customers in a way that i was not previously taught. My managers were excellent leaders and knew how to get there point across."
good,"If given the opportunity to work for Celeste South, you are going to love your job.  If you work hard for this company, you will be rewarded as such.  Work schedules are worked around school schedules.  Great environment."
good,"Sold Products and Ordered at request"
good,I loved working at Staples and I loved my coworkers. Management was good and I was taught new things on a weekly basis. Management also recognized my work. The hardest part of the job is dealing with disrespectful customers and long shifts with no breaks. Most enjoyable was the fun times I had with my coworkers.
good,The reason I stopped working there is because I went back home in Bangladesh for a family matter and when I came back I had to focus in my classes.
good,"Staples understands it. The Call Center in Rochester is open M-F 11:30am-8pm. You are off and paid on holidays (XMas,Thanksgiving etc) You do not work weekends. If you're productive and you're interested, you can work from home. Staples supplies the equipment and you take care of the Internet and phone. You are working with business customers, so they are a lot more friendly than the general retail user. I've only been here a year and I'm still learning so I haven't applied for a promotion as of yet but they are available when time permits. Starting rate is $13.10/hour. Most of the managers were reps before so they are a great learning source. You won't find this at any other call center. The only thing that bothers me is they will train you on multiple accounts and still pay you the same. You are expected to help on those accounts when needed. I believe if you're giving a person more work they should be paid accordingly."
good,"My job was inventory. Not the most exciting work, but my co workers and management staff were exceedingly easy to work with, so it made it all right."
good,It's not bad for a paycheck but the lack of advancement leaves a lot to be desired.  Corporate will often leave a store understaffed and all are underappreciated.
good,"I have enjoyed working at Staples .  There is some independent opportunities to make decisions, but feel there is very limited chance for advancement as the core staff number is small.  Things I could do at other cashier jobs is restricted there, and I think that is a system wide policy..  .  The hardest part of the job is the lifting of computers from a basket into a recycling box and the lack of communication regarding my functioning and progress at the job.The most enjoyable part of the job is helping people and the staff there."
good,Love the place would love to go back and work some time but won't off to new and better places.the office people are great and loving and always willing to work with you.
good,"learned alot from the place it defintely a place to test your knowledge with customers and to learn new things if any one is willing to learn, some nice benefits caring managements"
good,"I liked working in the position of a sales and computer technician, and need tweaking on how to work with people with a disability."
good,Great company with an emphasis on family values.  Respects others ideas and differences.  Wonderful co-workers and really taught me a lot throughout my career.
good,"Best Place to work, All things with the work environment was good,"
good,"Great company, took good care of their employees. "
good,I did enjoy working at this job. Seemed like easy work except for working in Copy & Print Center. That area can be hard because of the amount of customers coming in at once and not having the extra help you need. Sometimes the managers will help back me up if they weren't already busy and sometimes there are two people that work there for a short time period. I like the stuff they sell there. Most of the customers are really nice. Clean environment. Sometimes it was slow and other times busy.
good,Staples once was a great place for me to work at as I learned the ropes on how to become the worker I am today due to prior managers and the associates that thought me what I know today. I feel like I would stay their but there is so many ongoing issues that myself and other associates have with a current managers attitude problem. I currently feel its time for a change for me to find something different.
good,"Like the store hours, the work wasn't hard, enjoyed my co workers and managers.  Sad the store closed in my area. I enjoyed seeing my customers come back to the store and ask for me by name."
good,Fun work place management was solid work was steady and fast paced enjoyed providing customers total solutions. The bad however is they had part time only and became highly sales oriented once they implemented the stars program of which provides incentives for selling staples services and specific products.
good,A place where your task can differ from day to day but each job is different but interesting in its own way. As you grow and ask question you learn more and more.
good,"Staples have great people working for them, customer focus is key and nothing is too small to help our customers."
good,"Business side of Staples, work life balance is helped by flexible start times. Supportive management listens to employee input on programs, what works best, employee functions."
good,I worked there for three years and it was a good job. I had to leave because of some personal things but overall a great work environment and they treat the employees well.
good,I enjoyed working here and learned a lot working here. The company is great to work for because of the professional staff that's hired.
good,It's a good job if you are going to school. Hours are flexible and decently consistent for students. Coworkers are mostly willing to help when you need it.
good,"Loved my co-workers. Wished they allowed more hours to work beyond 20 hours a week for part time. Fast paced which keeps you busy, but only certain times of the day."
good,"I enjoy work here, cause I get to meet people from all walks of life. I also gain knowledge of the retail industry and how the demands are meet in a high volume store. The employees there are wonderful to work with and be around. We believe we are a family oriented company that provide no.#1 customer service to our customers."
good,"The fulfillment centers are responsible for all contract related orders, online sales as well as supporting the distribution centers with any kind of rush deliveries. E-commerce is a much different environment when compared to the Retail side of the business and offers additional yet exciting challenges."
good,"i love workin at astaples the staff is friendly, but most of all i love my customers , they remember me and most usually come in for my help specifically , the co workers love me because when ever they needed someone to cover a shift or a lunch break i was happy to help, if they didnt understand  the task handed to them i would step in and help. i am always willing to help, i helped the mangers come up with ideas for what should be stocked on the shelves i was mostly incharge of pull lits and the clearance area,i could find all the best products that would be sold right away."
good,A typical day at work normally goes smooth. In Staples we provide customers with excellent customer service and always make an effort to exceed expectations.
good,I enjoyed my job.  Worked well with others.  I learned that working at the air port was always going to be an interesting job.  I enjoyed meeting new people and famous people.
good,very fast paced work environtment but management and your workers help you. Dont do the job unless you are a fast learner.
good,"A typical day in the Staples workplace consisted of an early commute of about 20 minutes to the professional and friendly establishment. Often greeted with rushing customers and the smiles of coworkers and the frequent notice of a job well done by the management. The most difficult portion of the day would be the mornings due to impatient customers, but it was all worth it once recommending and finding the exact item that the customer needed which was my favorite part of the job."
good,"This is a great pace to work for if you are in high school."
good,"I quit my job, because of the lack of communication..I was new and required training, which the store manager was to provide.  Everyday I came in she wouldn't speak to me  When I tried to engage her she walked off  I was really frustrated and extremely dissatisfied with that location that is under the current management    My training Manager in Conifer, Colorado was absolutely amazing!"
good,Pull ach/wire details from bank and apply to correct accounts. Process credit cards and apply. Download store reports and apply to accounts. Answer phones and assist customers with questions on past due bills or what a payment was for.
good,"Everyone was friendly, there were meetings every morning where everyone got to know each other."
good,"Working at Staples was a great time for me. I'm sad that I left how I did. "
good,"I worked there for 4 years and had a great experience, The management was wonderful and all of my coworkers were great honestly not one bad thing to say about the people in that building"
good,"Staples offered me a very active day working hand in hand with my store manager and in being the store manager 80% of my time. I was also responsible for opening/closing the store as well as being responsible for all money operations of the store."
good,"Busy days, learned to stay focused and work your hardest, management is great, my coworkers are amazing an are great to work with. hardest part of my job is the work/life balance isn't even spend a lot of time at work. The most enjoyable part of my job is my coworkers"

good,"The hardest part of the Job is the most enjoyable part of it, which is customer services and helping them to have a great shopping experience."
good,"management was horrible, I would never go back, I wasn't properly trained"
good,It is temporary Part Time. Regular Retail operation. busy Location.
good,"I spent 3 months as co-op in credit department, they treat me as one of them, every one was nice and helpful and wiling to give advices "
good,"I'm part of the Business to Business team where we are responsible for bringing in new business.  Days vary. You have to like cold calling and also making appointment calls over the phone."
good,"Great Company, unfortunately during the Restructuring the past two years I was laid off Twice. Rehired, only to be laid off again a year later."
good,"A typical work day usually consists of doing returns for customers, assisting customers at the time of check out , help customers find what they need by directing them to the item. I've learned how to multitask working in an fast paced environment. Management can be better, but for the most past i love my manager. I enjoy being around my co-workers everyday, i am a very friendly and outgoing person so i get along with everyone. We all work together to achieve our store goals for the day. The hardest part of the job is returning an order that were bought online. I enjoy my coworkers on the job and also i enjoy seeing my everyday customers come into the store. I love to see people happy when i find what they needed."
good,"Great Managment Staff."
good,"very busy"
good,"Great people, great management but the big shots don't care about you."
good,Good company culture. Staff and peers helpful. The thing they need to improove is the reimbursement for jobs
good,"Very good company to work for,  management was extremely good at there jobs. I made some mistakes which ended out relationship."
good,"I was very busy most of the time, with helping customers,and bringing stock to the front of the store. I even help the customers with bringing their purchases to their cars.  My co wokers were good bunch,and everyone just did their job,"
good,"From day one, I thoroughly enjoyed this job. I got paid great, the staff was very friendly, and the management was spectacular. I've never worked a job where I've felt so comfortable to be myself and have fun while working. This never meant that work wasn't priority though. We always weaved in the fun while we were on the clock. It was great while it lasted."
good,"I loved being busy and having a lot to do during my work day.  I love the interaction with customers and the associates.  I'm a people person and enjoy it each day that I worked. I like to have a lot on my plate, being busy is what I do prefer.  I had a lot of reporting and dealing with everyday operations of the store, including customer and associate situations.  I trained my co-workers to the best of my ability to be able to perform their daily duties with out a lot of supervision.  I was responsible for also opening and closing the store."
good,"Great company as a operations manager all daily operations of the store. Helping every customer and giving great customer service daily. Daily payroll,casjh office ,schedules,training."
good,"Fast paced retail environment."
good,learned a lot at staples and I enjoyed working there. only wish the pay was good.
good,"Staples was a large store which was fine, it was a fast paced working environment most of the time which i enjoyed as I like to stay busy, but on occassion was quiet hence the closure."
good,Toujours aimer ma job et mes clients et très bonne entende avec mes supérieurs
good,My work day begins with meet and greet to all customers that walk in into the store.
good,"Producing business cards, posters, and stamps. Making excessive amount of copies."
good,Staples has always treated me well and been very flexible through my schooling
good,"Great place to work,Management was great,If I was going to give it a negative it would be the time schedule only goes week to week which is really hard considering your hours were never the same.So it was extremely hard planning anything."
good,"A typical day consists of helping customers find the products they need and answering any questions they may have. I count different categories of the store daily as well as keeping track of the in-stock. I also process the store damages and product that needs to be returned to the vendors. I have learned how to over come customer issues and how be a leader to other associates being a key holder. The managers I work with are always willing to help us grow. My co-workers and I work as a team, helping each other out with customers and other tasks around the store."
good,Learned how to sell and help customers. Taught by knowledgeable managers. Great work environment. Very flexable work hours.
good,I work hard and make several sales everyday. This company is a good start to my career in the IT field.
good,"Staples was a great place to work. Very fast pace environment which was great. The management was great, always helping in reaching your goals and providing guidance. I enjoyed working with the public and having the opportunity to learn anything that was available in the store!"
good,A typical day at work for me is processing 40 - 50 emails from Account Managers. We have an excellent management team and my co-workers are wonderful team players. There's no hard part when working for Staples. The most enjoyable part of my job is when we meet for our team meetings.
good,Advancement within the company if you want to relocate. Recoginize employees' on performance.
good,Realy enjoyed working at Staples. Was not complicated and easy to understand what Staples expected from store team.
good,"no problem, issues are scarce ."
good,Excellent Sales Coaching
good,Managers rush you because the shifts are short so you are hurried to complete as much as you can in very little time
good,"Slow-paced, fast and easy sales. Fun co-workers, amazing management."
good,"The team at staples makes me smile every time I walk in the door. They are friendly, compassionate, loving, and funny. I couldn't ask for a better team"
good,"As a tech salesman at Staples it is my job to sell. What made me an over the top quality salesman was my customer interaction. Knowing how to adjust a sales pitch based on the customers personality and learning what’s going to appeal to them and how to get them to buy products you want them to buy. Confident, informative, creative, and the right amount of humor is essential in a   good salesman. When not in a sale it is my duty to help customers with various questions around the store, keep my department clean and presentable, and being the technician on customer computers and other electronics"
good,good job. Good place to work. Copy and print was a great department to work in. Everyone was really great to work with. Everyone was always there to help you as much as possible.
good,"Staples cares for their employers and appreciates us regularly. Great environment, great people and great vision. I feel very confident that Staples is going in the right direction."
good,I was there for 10 years and was very successful and made good advancement unfortunately I had to move for family. I would highly recommend this place to work.
good,"Very good business to work for. Like any other retail, sales goal must be met, but very pleasant staff to work with. They have flexible hours, and realistic leaders."
good,"The pay is low, hours are always under 40, and there are no benefits as an hourly employee.  All that aside, the hours are flexible, the work is varied and generally low-impact, there's always ways to move up and shine without promoting a negatively-competitive environment, and everyone is always treated with respect.  Its one of the most fair and reasonable environments to be a part of.  You're always moving, and you never know what's next.  Keeps things interesting."
good,Overall a pretty good place to work at. I enjoy the 2nd shift environment. Less upper management and a little more laid back. High hourly turnover but a quality team can be built by the right Supervisor.
good,Staples is an amazing place to work. It is a teaching environment with lots of new and innovating ideas.Retail locations have lots to offer associate.
good,working at staples was nice there was just a lot of responsibility but overall the job wasnt bad. It was a nice place to meet new people. you had opportunities to move up in posistion.
good,The experience I had at Staples was truly a great one. I was fortunate enough to work for some excellent managers who respected their employees as adults and worked to help their employees grow.
good,"Staples while for some people may have been a bad experience, I believe that it all depends on how your specific store operates. Mine for example is very very helpful and a GREAT working environment. Management is very helpful and understanding and treats everyone equally. We're all a family. Everyone gets along and there's never any drama between any employees. I never thought id ever look forward to closing duties with my supervisors but those somehow are always the best shifts at my store. Its fun and we sometimes even close up shop and will sit in the back and eat pizza (off the clock of course) I have learned so much about computers, printers, office furniture, computer monitors, hard drives, etc but the most important thing I have learned is selling. Selling and interacting with customers is something I never thought I would be good at but its a hidden talent of some sort. The job is easy, fun, motivating and very relaxing in my opinion. Staples is my second home and I will one day run my own store."
good,"Pretty good environment "
good,"Skilled in retention: uutilize tools to identify save / upgrade opportunities and position the benefits of Staples"
good,"The time I spent at Staples was very rewarding.  My co-workers and managers were very laid-back and friendly.  I didn't have to worry about making sales all the time because there was no commission.  It's sad that I have to leave Staples for a full-time job at another store, but as a part-time associate, I was finding it hard to support myself on such erratic hours and schedules."
good,Very good work environment. Staff is very helpful and the management is also very supportive. I was able to learn a lot of new things here. Job duties include working with stock and helping out customers.
good,Working for staples wasn't bad at all had a nice environment was able to build alot of relationships would definitely recommend for a place to work and build
good,Wondering if Sycamore taking over is going to lead to huge changes. Been a good place to work. I would recommend it to people looking for a decent balance of work and home.
good,"great place to work, customers can be a little demanding at times, but other wise very nice. the machines can be a little bit of a pain in the print department, they tend to go down frequently, and the system they use is most certainly not the best out there."
good,"Staples for me was a great place to work. Yes there was the occasional person that took offense to certain things, and Staples at times could be frugal, but it was all around nice. There was always a chance to move up in the company, and training was available."
good,Day goes by fast because you're usually swamped. Retail environment with the perks of running a print center. The environment varies by store and depends completely on your management.
good,I worked as a Senior Credit Analyst for 7+ years and found a great group of collaborative and driven employees. We were focused on results yet there were many opportunities to build better rapport within the dept and with our customers.
good,"Staples provided the opportunity to enhance my customer service skills while training me in the area of printing.  I have received training on how to complete multiple jobs at a time, while performing with an exceedingly excellent attitude.  I appreciate Staples for allowing me to grow in the Print and Marketing Department."
good,"My day starts off at the Staples gym. 1 hour of instructor led fitness!"
good,"Perform tasks to process customer orders accurately and timely"
good,A typical day consists of greeting customers at the door who do not say hello back and helping the same customers find what they could have found if they replied when I said hello in the first place. Workplace culture is centered solely around Liquid Armour and the hardest part of the job would be sales of this item and retail customers as a whole. The most enjoyable part of this job is the feeling after a good sale or satisfying a customer.
good,Working in an office supplies setting is interesting. I learn about how things are organized and how each application is used. It was a great way to earn about stocking and how to communicate with others.
good,Most people in my area worked a 40 hour week and typically took lunch break at their desks so as to complete projects on time. Most management is well trained in their leadership role. The culture has been one of owning your responsibilities to make the company succeed.
good,Fast pace dealt with a lot of commercial accounts and DSM regarding their customer account balances as well managed my staff to ensure timely bills to customers
good,It was a job that helped me survive living in Boston. Everyone was great to work with. Management listened when I wanted to train for Copy Center and not be front end cashier anymore.
good,"I work in the Copy & Print department. My area and be high paced or very steady. you just keep come . Keep your are nice and neat. "
good,"great company with a competitive stand in its market. Lots of room for advancement, and so many resources. Large company culture can lead to feeling like just a number sometimes."
good,worked 2 seasons during summer  .company loved my performance . Worked in shipping and receiving . management personally thanked me at the end of the season regarding my work ethic. I was asked to come back but was interested in getting back to customer service /sales .
good,"Working the graveyard shift at a Staples FC was the most intense work I have done. The managers, while unhelpful, did not hinder my job. The pay was excellent and the benefits were even better. Just a very ""nose-to-the-grindstone"" type of job."
good,good work environment with nice people the pay was not good enough had great advancement opportunities but still not enough money to stay for a long period of time
good,"I learned to be patient with costumers, help them get what they want and need. I always kept my workplace clean, organized the shelves and assisted costumers in the store."
good,"Great opportunity to work full time and have a flexible schedule, benefits and good people. Love my manager. I would recommend working here to anyone who wants more knowledge on the b2b side of sales"
good,"Staples has been and continues to be a great place to work. Management is very fair and rewards good performance. I like it so much that I continue to work there even though I have another job with Radial. The only reason I would leave is that there is no room for career advancement. "
good,The Place is a very good place to work.  Everyone is great to work with from the Associate level to the Management level.   Little or no advancement because moving jobs.   The jobs  are not stressful but face pace.
good,This is a great place to work if you are in school or just need a part-time job. They only bad think about this place is some rude customers you encounter but hey that's customer service for you.
good,I really enjoyed the team I worked with we all worked together to get the job done. The managers were great and very helpful when you didn't know about a situation.
good,"Management takes responsibility and care of their employees and takes time to listen to suggestions. On a regular basis, the management and other workers create an environment that is productive, fresh, and encouraging."
good,"A typical day is going in counting registers, setting the daily plan making daily pull lists, completing pull lists, pushing truck, setting planograms."
good,Staples was my first job and I had a wonderful experience working for them. I loved the people I worked with and found fulfillment in my job. I really felt like the management was looking out for me.
good,"So long as you were alright working a lot of hours, Staples was a positive place to work.There was a lot of anonymity and independence at Staples and you really felt as though you were running your own business within your customers.  Their internal partners were outstanding and usually available to get involved if needed during sales/solutions that required subject matter experts."
good,In a professional retail environment you do your best to help customers and make sales for a major company. Hard workers get recognized and rewarded all the time.
good,"The job was fair, it was fast paced and relaxed. Its s good company to work for specially with good benifits. "
good,This is a great place to work but due to jobs moving across seas job security was hard. So with jobs going across seas I am currently seeking new employment before job ends
good,This was a great company to work for you can build and excel as a employee. This company strives in the best strategies that shares customer satisfaction.
good,"Great place for early job, management was great. Very thoughtful and supporting. Store closed but relocation was offered if desired. Great coworkers and environment"
good,was a very good job . good hours and good pay . upper management team  was very good. lots of perks and bonus when a job done well . had very good employees to work with
good,"very busy, I learned a lot from the employees and managers. no hard part about the job only thing that was bad was that I couldn't be full time. the work place was great."
good,"Excellent place to work as a student, flexible hours and fun coworkers , good customer service  all the time and a well organized store friendly place ."
good,"There were lots of areas in my job that kept me busy every day. I enjoyed all of them except for the meetings that took too much time and wasted too much of a day. "
good,Copy Center is a very busy and fast past environment. You have to be a people person as well as a hard worker. Need to be a be able to adapt well in all situations.
good,"Really great company to work for, great management, always supportive of future goals, whether it's with the company or elsewhere. Able to work in all departments"
good,Great place to work. I wish I could have had more hours. They normally pay above minimum wage. There is some room for advancement but I would have liked more. Great managers. Good job culture
good,I loved working there. I got to learn a lot about the products I was handling and selling. Such a chill work place. Everyone was so friendly. I miss that job.
good,"Staples is a great place to work if your in a need of a job and it's your first job. But if you take it serious you can learn, experience and grow your career."
good,"Great job, good management. Overall my staples experience was positive. The hardest aspect is meeting company sales expectations. Most enjoyable is interacting with customers and co workers."
good,"At staples they work around your schedule if you are still in school or if you need a day off and you put it in, in time you will most likely have that day off. At staples they really are like a family and they try to all work together and give the best time at work."
good,"a regular day at work is productive i try to do my best with learning more so i can assist more customers."
good,Helped people with their needs in technology and other office supply items. Also did in home setup when needed. Virus removals with software was a big part of the job.
good,Great place to work you meet a lot of different people. A typical day is very busy and once lunch time comes the day goes by without you even knowing it.
good,"all was good except low pay, managers  were nice, employees were nice.. a good place to start working with low hourly wage. they pay every 2 weeks. it has a good nonviolent environment."
good,"nice company to work for ability to learn a lot management was always looking to further the employees"
good,"Good place to work- come in at 830 and work on payroll for the sales team.  work on coverage for other admins.  work on reporting, generating and creating reports. etc."
good,"Good people, call outs are very easy.  Hours are low at points. 4 or 8 hour shifts available.  Management is very fair. And I have no other things to say"
good,"O dia de trabalho iniciava-se as 19 horas e acabava as 23h, sendo que fazíamos, por vezes, horas extras não pagas. O horário fazia'se bem, sendo que havia uma pausa de 10 minutos, para fumar, o que hoje em dia não iria necessitar, pois deixei de fumar."
good,"Positive and friendly working environment dedicated to providing customers the quality service in accordance to their needs. Certain seasons of the year such as Back to School can be stressful at times, but with the collaboration of Sales Associates and managers, Staples works nonstop to achieve successful business objectives."
good,Overall I think it's a great place to work. The supervisors really do they're best to work with any and all schedules. They really have a pretty good plan to helping people keep their job due to schedules.  The plant manager walks around on a daily basis talking to employees making sure they are all doing good. And and you really work two weekends out of the year and its only one day.
good,It's an okay place to work. You learn a lot and get to know the  returning customers.  The managers are super nice and they work with you and around your school schedule.
good,over all a good job to have ! great hours also have great pay the only thing I could say needs work would be management . they are unprofessional and do not know how to treat employees !
good,Very fun job working with others. Great family oriented environment. Very nice and friendly customers. Boss/Managers very kind and helpful.
good,"The people who work here are wonderful including the District Managers and Regional Manager.  The job is challenging but I get the opportunity to do what I do best everyday, taking care of the employee and customer."
good,"All of the employees at Staples get along well and help each other tremendously.  Our number one goal is to help customers find and get what they need, and we all do our part to make sure that happens."
good,"I really loved working at Staples call center, they were understanding and accommodating when the time was needed. I enjoyed working for Staples, and getting to talk to the customers from different places in the United States. 99% of the time the customers were friendly, but you do come across the odd grouchy,or racist or just nasty people. But I didn't mind dealing with them, all they want is for someone to listen to what they have to say! The only thing I would complain about the company is that they don't pay enough an hour, Where as other call centers pay almost $20 an hour, Staples would offer minimum or unless you had experience then they would offer a bit more. They have awesome benefit coverage, and paid holiday, so you would think they would pay more to their employees. Price for lunches in the cafeteria was acceptable, Management was great and understanding and there for you if you needed to talk to someone! I just wish they didn't close their doors and moved it to the Philippines because I would still be working there if they didn't move."
good,"Working in the corporate office, isn't much different from any other office. The company does a good job of taking care of their employees and they aren't afraid to show their appreciation; with quarterly meetings where people earn prizes or are recognized for contributions to the company. Management is very approachable and understanding. Employees are friendly and dedicated to their positions. The hardest part of the job is the learning curve after training. The most enjoyable part of the job is that every day is different."
good,"The location I worked at was a great environment. To upper management everything was last minute and an emergency, even though it still got done in a timely manner."
good,"very, laid back place, worked at the same place for 17yrs, ending up shutting the warehouse down, thought I would be their for ever, had a lot of good times their."
good,Typical retail culture. Relaxed. Programmers are considered an asset and respected. The Canadian executive team shows strong leadership.
good,"Great work environment. "
good,"Opening and closing  the building daily deposits setting registers back. Training the associates, assisting with the hiring process scheduling associates."
good,They are an extremely fun company to work with. Our customer base is full of amazing people who value every employee at their local Staples store. However there is really no room to advance within this company unless you have a direct line into our HR department that is located in an entirely different state. The Store manager doesn't get to choose their management team. It is all chosen by a team in another state based on a one paragraph essay rather than by someone who can see your potential and drive daily.
good,"Excellent atmosphere and welcoming environment."
good,Planning account reviews to visit current customers to increase different lines of business within the account. Trying to get all business from a customer is hardest part of job. Every customer is different and depending on their budget needs vary for supplies.
good,"Typical day is you begin your shift with login into different systems, get on the phone and handle all calls that pertain to orders that were placed on line."
good,I had a great time while I worked there years ago. Excellent benefits and bonuses. More of a small business culture.I was given opportunity to make decisions.
good,"I loved this job! Not only was I able to meet new people I was always super excited to learn new things, my crew was fun and great to be around"
good,"I started off at Staples as a co-op student so the employees were familiar with me. The service at Staples is wonderful, and they make you feel like you're part of the team. I was in charge of the Ink and Toner section, so a typical day for me would be to get the products from the receiving room and stock all the products into their specific shelves. I assisted in customer service, by helping clients find out what they were looking for, and I also helped customers bring heavy products to their vehicle. The Staples staff and management love to see you do well by helping the company achieve their goals, and they give you positive feedback on how you can do better."
good,"Staples is an extraordinary place to work when you are just starting out in the professional world or if you need help to jump start your resume during a down period. The management is excellent and always willing to work with you the best they can, and working in the Copy Center is probably the best position you could ask for. I am disappointed that they are so limited on the hours they can give each week, and if this was not such a prominent problem I would have stayed longer."
good,"loved working here, just wasn't able up absences with my morning sickness! cashiering was fun and and i was in charge of ink (huge responsiblity!)"
good,"Moderate paced work environment with steady customer service. Provide print jobs, ship UPS packages, greet customers, and process orders. Job duties were fair."
good,Lots of room for promotions and flexible scheduling. Customer service oriented career field but will help you in other jobs throughout your career.
good,I love my position at Staples. The company cares about their employees and is constantly evolving. Staples is making the right moves to compete in the future. Future looks very bright with this company.

good,Staples is a dynamic organization with excellent career opportunities. I have met many tenured executives in my 2 years with Staples.
good,"My typical day at work is to open the store and follow up with customers on their orders then complete the orders with efficiency "
good,Upon arriving and punching in customers are already at the store awaiting assistance.  During the day I am producing work and various projects for customers.  While dealing with customers and troubleshooting problems that may occur I am also manning the UPS and USPS department.  The UPS and USPS department consists of shipping packages and selling USPS products.  During this time there is a line forming that I must assist customers to keep everything moving.  There is only one person working per shift.  Management steps in when available.  I enjoy interacting with my customers and helping them with achieving the best quality work possible.
good,"I thoroughly enjoy working at Staples.  However, full time hours are not available.  If I was offered full time hours I would be more than happy to continue to work here."
good,"I've been employed with Staples Canada since December 2012, and I have to say- it's probably one of the best retail jobs out there! The managers take time to ensure not only the success of the store, but the success of the team, and most importantly me. Thanks for an awesome two and a half years, here's to many more to come!"
good,"Phone, Research. Depends on the day. Always something new and different. Management open door. Co-workers are always there and supportive. Moving up. Dealing with the customers."
good,I thoroughly enjoyed working at Staples. My daily interactions with my associates was imperative so that I could monitor their performance to ensure they were meeting the companies expectations.
good,"As a part of the marketing department in the Framingham office, each month there were events such as raffles and lunches. Despite the marketing department being so big, these events ensured that everyone knew each other and stayed in communication. I think that the entire marketing department was amazing; everyone was so kind and always willing to help and explain."
good,"I counted, stored and racked admission tickets according to event, performance dates, and Venue being utilized. I would also sell admission tickets to the general public over the counter, by mail order, and telephone reservation. "
good,"I have been in managment for 6 yrs at the Staples Call Center. I started out as a customer service representative then advanced to superviosr. I also performed the role of team manger for a 1yr term. This last year I did a managment swap from one division, Quill to Staples.com where I had to learn all new proceses and systems. I enjoy going to work every day and the people I work with. Unfortunately the call center is closing November 2015."
good,"With 350 Stores across Canada and approximately 8,000 Corporate Customers purchasing from each of their Retail Stores across Canada, Staples Canada decided to create a Pilot Project of 3 Stores, that were retrofitted with Sales and Technical offices to proactively sell to IT Hardware/Software and IT Services to Corporate Customers in the geographical of the Retail Stores."
good,"STAPLES  IS  A  GOOD  COMPANY  AND  HAS  BEEN   VERY GOOD  TO  ME  THROUGH  OUT  THE  16 PLUS   YEARS I HAVE   BEEN THERE,       THE  BENEFITS  ARE  VERY GOOD   AND  ESPECIALLY   THE  INSURANCE  PROGRAMS  HAVE  HELPED  OUT   WHEN  NEEDED.."

good,came into work gather my orders at my desk picked and process them and load them on to the truck.Count inventory and take in receiving items.
good,"Staples was a great place to work.  Sadly, they are laying off several SDOs/FC.  Management and co-workers were great.  I learned a lot of the SE WI area roads and customers that we serviced."
good,"A typical work day for me as a floor associate was to go to my department and make sure it was in neat, clean, and organized. After, and during, my job was to focus on the customer and provide any answers that they may have."
good,"A typical day at Staples always started with fun and jokes. I learned that even when you think no other job will come, someone out there is always willing to give you a chance. Management was great at first but I got used to the change. My co-workers were the best, funny, enjoyable and supportive. The hardest part was when I had to let the job go when I became pregnant. Most enjoyable was my customers, who once again always compliment me on my work."
good,I performed the duties required by my corporate direction to insure excellent customer service and maintain a healthy and productive environment for my associates as well as insure that the appearance of the store is maintained in a manor to control loss prevention and keep sales a level that's required by SOP.
good,great place to work. manager was very friendly and understanding
good,This will enhance your selling skills in dealing with great customers who wishes to buy technology products. Promote service and I was able to meet the company's weekly goal and other task.
good,"A typical day at work is I come into the night shift and it usually starts off with me on the cash register while the morning shift cleans up. During the night it is usually slow so most of my time is spent cleaning and organizing the front end of the store, while at customer service. Most of the time I am the only sales associate at the front so making sure that everything is organized and running smoothly are my job. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I am out on the Sales Floor assisting the customers. There is not a hard part of my job. One thing that I have learned from my job is time management and my organizational have improved so much."
good,"great company to start your career with and grow with, great chance for advancement"
good,"Staples was a great start. However, they do not allow you to grow as an individual. Instead, they cut your hours down implying you need to leave."
good,it was fast pace environment all employees were nice and wiling to help everyone.
good,Staples is a good company to work for and thus far I have enjoyed it. It's a company that not just cares about it's service to the public but also the employees that work for them. My typical day at work is very busy because there are days we are under staffed and when that happens it's very difficult to make the customers happy by meeting their needs or wants. The most difficult part of my job is customer satisfaction especially when the store is not staffed properly. While customer satisfaction is the most difficult aspect of my job it's enjoyable as well. I really enjoy helping customers meet their needs or wants as well as solving problems for them and coming up with solutions in order for them to accomplish their goals.
good,"Love staples , great culture, love management."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Staples, it was a very fun a job, and I learned a lot. I was a technology consultant, so I would just work with computer, printers, projectors, monitors, and software. I really enjoy technology and working with it and that is why I enjoyed this job. I was good friends with all my co-workers, and management was very nice and supportive and made me feel needed and appreciated."
good,Great place to work but the associates were even better! Always willing to work with the associates in work problems and in the associates life problems.
good,"Help customers operate cash register."
good,very good work place to be. good volunteer opportunity. Nice employees working there/ nice manager. great working conditions.
good,"Staples is a good place to work at, but unfortunately they dont offer full time positions. Most of the employess are fun and get along well with customer."
good,"Good company to work for but, compensation does not match work responsibilities."
good,Corporate really sucked but my direct managers were great.
good,The opportunity to make visual displays.  Making visual displays when each department.
good,"When I first started working at Staples my typical day at work would to clock in and then go straight to a cash register. I would greet customers as they walked into the door and answer questions if they had any. I would sometimes handle returns. When the cash register would need to be balanced I would call a manager to help me with it. What my job would be to do is count the money  and sign a paper saying I counted it all correctly. Then at the end of my shift because I worked the afternoon until close, I would clean the bathrooms and all the counters. Also I would help with other departments if they needed it. When I got promoted to be a sales associate, I would greet the customers as they came in. I would answer any questions they may have and direct them into the right direction for their items. I then would go into the back room and grab a dolly with merchandise on it and unload it on the shelves. While I unload the boxes I would also make sure every shelf was neat. I also put away returns. As a sales associate I was able to sell furniture to customers."
good,"A typical day at Staples includes organizing, cleaning, customer service, and explanation of the products that are sold in the store. I have learned a lot about working in a competitive sales environment, and a lot about working well with coworkers. The management is good for the most part, although sometimes when there is a problem between two coworkers they don't always address the problem until you bring it up several times. The people that work at Staples, other than myself, are usually good and fun people, although on occasion someone gets hired that does not get along with anyone else in the building. The hardest part of the job is the occasion when we are understaffed and it gets really busy. When this happens, the customers are mad, the staff is stressed, and no one is happy.The most enjoyable part of working at Staples is the atmosphere there. We feel more like a family than we do coworkers."
good,Great work life balance for management and amazing benefits.
good,"Great learning experience.   You were made to feel like you were a welcome addition to their store set-up.  It felt like a team and a 'Family'.   Met incredible senior staff and other employees from other Staples retail outlets whom were so helpful, complimentary and able to give constructive meaningful suggestions and criticism when necessary."
good,"Everyday at work is different, challenging and demanding in a fast paced and competitive environment."

good,always set goals for the day .and the satisfaction in accomplishing them.
good,"No stress!"
good,I like working there everyone is nice and helpful. I like being able to help the public
good,I started working with Staples as part time.. I learnt many things here. Benefits are also good but I am looking for a full time position.
good,"There are two office days and three days out in the field. One day is soley dedicated to calling prospects to set appointments. Heavily metrics based with wiggle room. Great management and training. Hardest part of the job is call day, retaining customers and landing larger deals. Most enjoyable part of the job, tremendous flexibility, ability to work remotely and building relationships with customers."
good,Assist customers with purchases & returns etc. Also did inventory/stocked new mercentdise.I enjoy making sure the customer always leaves satisfied.
good,"Come in, check in with MOD and receive instructions and go about daily work. Most undesirable part is the pay but the people make it worth working there sometimes."

good,it was a nice temp job where we worked along side construction staff to remodel the local staples store.
good,"Fun, good, educational helped me develop important sales, customer service and managerial skills"
good,"A typical day at work would include customer service, employee relations, store maintenance, and daily bookkeeping. I learned very valuable people skills, time management, and technical skills. Management was always available to answer questions and helpful whenever possible. Co-workers were easy to get along with because everyone knew and did their jobs. The most difficult part of the job was the constantly changing schedule. That made it difficult to have a life away from work. The most enjoyable part of the job was the consistent growth and change of the company, which made the job challenging at times and provided room for growth."
good,"Met great people, gained great experience in the work field and very enjoyable. Worked around my school hours."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of receiving regular deliveries and logging the stock on the system, then sorting high valued items from office supplies ready for associates to replenish stock on the shop floor. I also done a lot of till work so I knew how to process a sale and given extended warranties and care plans. I was given various roles while I worked there, ensuring fire exits are cleared, locking up all exits when the shop was closed, processing returns, dealing with customers over the phone, suiting a product to the correct person and much more in customer satisfaction. I would say the hardest part of the job would be when prices of products were incorrectly priced up in comparison to what the system said, as I would have to go to the product myself to override the price so that the customers receives the advertised price. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the team I worked with, they would be very friendly but yet professional in their current job roles. Each member would help one another whether it would be covering there position on the checkout or lending a hand managing furniture to customers vehicles."
good,"I love my job. I look forward to going into work because my managers and co workers are so nice and fun to be around. Each day presents new challenges and I love working with my team to create solutions for them. The hardest part of my job is having to say no to my customers if we are out of stock or just don't carry what they are looking for, but I always try to find a solution such as ordering the item from our company website or finding a different item that would suit their needs. The most enjoyable part of my job is building new displays and putting out new products. It's fun to be one of the first people to see all the new products coming out!"
good,"Overall Staples is a wonderful place to work. The management is caring and reasonable. There is opportunity for advancement. The only downfall is it being a retail the pay is very limited. They are very flexible with the times they let you work, and are very reasonable about requesting time off. They truly care about thier customers and cultivating good sales people with great customer service."
good,the first job I ever had good for young students in school and have a great scholarship program

good,"Excellent place to work...steady hours...constent training refreshment...advancement oppourtunities...Active, present and knowladgble management"
good,the most enjoyable part of the job is working with fellow team members.
good,While working with this company I have developed my leadership and managerial skills to suceed while accomplishing all company goals. This company is very family oriented and feels like home. Everyone including management is very inspirational. This company has an open door policy and is always willing to take ideas and implement them into new procedures. I love everyone that works for Staples across the board even in other states. Staples is a company that cares not only about their customers but about their employees as well. Staples always advise of what we can do instead of what we can not do.
good,"good job, always busy. management was good. coworkers were ok.."
good,hard work - blood pumping - very satisfying when results come together
good,A great place to make friends and form bonds with co-workers. They also provide benefits even if you're only part-time.
good,"I worked at Staples many years ago, for approximately 2 years. Overall it was good. If you work hard and meet target quotas, there are some decent pay bonuses. They do regional contests regularly. It's a great job if you like people, and know your product. My only complaint is that our store went through 3 store managers in a little over a year. This created some instability as systems and procedures were regularly being changed"
good,"Not sure if it was just the staples I worked at or the company i  general but it was a great working experience, management was fun to work with but we still got things done"

good,"Essentislly the best place I have ever worked. The managrment is great. They understand that life happens and that if you need a break that you do. You are expected to do your job, as all do. If you don't do your job the management is always there to help and give options on how to improve your ability to do so. If you ever have a question or need a second opinion on anything from a sale to opinion on a devloping issue."

Management might seem like they are pushing you for more sales but they are doing what is best for the company. It might seem hard in the beginning but after awhile and with the help of co-workers, the job is very easy,"
good,Great company to work for and the management is very attentive to staff needs.  Workplace culture is positive and fun.

good,I enjoyed working there. It was a good start to see what retail is like. I worked as an intern. I worked my butt off so that I can get hired after the internship was over but no. They decided to choose the participants that wasn't doing much work. When working there I cleared off 3 whole capacity u-boats with several totes on it by myself and the other four people stayed on the one capacity u-boat the whole time. When I finished my part I finished off their capacity u-boat. After I kept working hard. I didn't get hired but the other four people did. I don't think every staple is like that. that was just one of the down days. Other than that staples is a great place to get office supplies from.
good,my selling was used for teaching on a level that helps new employees learn would get rave reviews of the quality in which i earn customers trust.and continue to keep them. I was able to understand customers needs.. had my customer base call me specifically for information and additional help.Was able to have staplesbrand in every area of the office including coffee toliet paper snakes in break room.etc..Staples enviroment in the sales room is rewarding for all staples employees.we would have lunch together and give ideals among each other.
good,"I loved working here. Management was very supportive, and willing to train. Always felt like I should have stayed. A little bit of everything here, sales, customer service and administrative duty. Only moved on because I was offered higher pay."
good,"I had a lot of fun working there as a cashier. The job was simple and easy however, the pay was low and the distance I had to drive to get to work wasn't really worth it. It's great if you live close to a location but other than that, I suggest something else."
good,"Working at Staples gave me lots of great skills for a first job, I was suppose to go through the management training program, unfortunately GM's were changed and the new GM was very much in her own head and did not see this process through as previous management had told. I did not see myself moving any further in the company with her as our new GM as we did not see eye to eye on this subject. ."
good,"Good company to work for, I have worked for 16 years here, I have learned plenty as a manager. I am looking to become a store manager and unfortunately there are no positions available. It is sad that I have to leave this great company, but I have to continue with my career goal which is to become a store manager and continue to grow from there."
good,"I have enjoyed my experience at Staples Corporate.  A typical day includes engaging work, involved, caring and focused management and plenty of ongoing training. It's a very fair and fun place to work."
good,"It was an enjoyable job. Being a sales associate job, the work was simple and easy to manage. Fellow employees were friendly and very helpful to newer employees."
good,"One of the best jobs I've ever had, amazing work environment and i made a bunch of friends doing simple work. Paid training which was fairly simple, all of the systems were very simple to learn and had an amazing team of managers to make things as smooth as possible."
good,"Adorei trabalhar nesta empresa, adorava o que fazia, fiz a abertura da loja, formei muitos colaboradores, trabalhei lá durante quase 9 anos, foi esta empresa que me permitiu estabilidade financeira e laboral para ter os meus dois filhos, ma com a reestruturação da empresa e à descida do volume de negócios, houve a necessidade de rescindir com alguns colaboradores e eu fui uma delas. Mas contudo foi uma boa experiência e ainda hoje tenho uma boa relação com gestores e colaboradores desta Multinacional, que tem 35 lojas em todo o pais, com sede nos Estados Unidos."
good,"Staples was a great company to work for,I just had an issue with management not being as ethical as they should have been.I was forced out but ended up quitting voluntarily."
good,Staples provides their workers with plenty of hours but the management is poor. Depending on the management you could be getting 10 hours a week or 20+ hours a week. Good for students who are still in high school or people looking for a good part time position.
good,Nice management and encouraging environment. Gained valuable experience dealing with the customers. Have been provided adequate technological training to address customer questions about various  tech devices.
good,I have loved working for Staples over the years. I would like to find a job that allows me to grow in my profession and to be compensated. I would like to see what is out there in my field.
good,"Besides always in the news, great place to work.  The management was always changing, but they cared about advancement and training.  Great amenities for employees too."
good,Working at staples is a pleasure you will be challenged non stop and always expected for your best. If you don't bring your best you will be called out and expected to perform differently.
good,had a great supervisor and co-workers in my department. I really enjoyed working there. The work was semi hard but never anything you couldn't handle.
good,Great company to work for. But footprint is too large and pressure to increase sales and profit can be a little overbearing at times. Alot of pressure to convert more customers and add on sales. More people ordering at home on line.
good,A great place to start out if you're not wanting to do fast food. Teaches you lots of techniques from sales to customer services as well as management.
good,"Hard work is appreciated and noticed. Like any sales jobs the more you work the more you can make. Hard goals but great company to work for. Direct management amazing, higher management not as much."
good,I loved working in the team environment that was Corporate Express.  Very Employee and customer focused.  Struggled when Staples took over and was moved to inside sales position.
good,I love work at Staples in general. I know how to do just about everything in the store. I work with a wonderful staff. Never had a problem with anyone. The only thing about working for Staples is that everyone except management is part-time so you do not get the health care benefits and the pay is not very much. This job is basically for those that are in school or just need a job for the fun of it.
good,"Overall a really great job that didn't have the best management, and I always constantly felt like my job was on the line which didn't make it feel like a very secure work place."
good,"Staples is a good place to work. Terrible pay, but awesome to work at.  Very family oriented company.  Dont really know what else to say besides that.  Pretty much your run of the mill entry level job."
good,"I loved my job at Staples. Although my advancements in the company were set back due to a restructure, I would still recommend their business to business division."
good,I worked for Staples for 16 years and I gained a lifetime of knowledge from them. I will forever be thankful for the support they gave me to help me achieve my goals. The management I had was always supportive and helped me along my journey with them. The culture was always changing and new challenges were faced every day.
good,Good community and hard workers people enjoyed working with you hope to continue to work with as teamwith one go to make sure that our customers have a satisfying visit to our store.
good,I have faced different types of customers. Every customer is a different challenge. Management is really supportive in nature. I have learned about different marketing strategies implied in sales floor.
good,"Employee discount isn't too good. however its a good environment to work and offers a good experience of work. Overall okay place to work, wouldn't recommend it."
good,"I love working at Staples! The environment is so uplifting. Everyone is encouraged to do their best, and everyone does. We purposefully work together to make Staples an enjoyable atmosphere for our customers!"
good,Customers come first. End of. If they are happy management are happy which makes the shop floor staff happy. Pressure to achieve but celebrations when you do
good,"Former employee at Staples. Great management, great co-workers, great with working with your hours. Great opportunities for advancement within the company."
good,The people I worked with at Staples Promotional Products are amazing.  It is a very open and accepting environment.  I was very happy with my time spent there.
good,We had a really great team at Staples from the cashiers to the management to the computer Consultants to the aisle staff we were just great I think we felt like we were really accomplishing something as a team and me working there for those 5 years I made the best friends that I've ever met in any of my jobs.
good,I enjoy my job at Staples. The management and the staff are very friendly and help make my job a lot easier. I love what I do. At Staples I can still be involved in my children's afterschool activities without it interfering with my job.
good,"It was an amazing place to work at, good people good money. Great manager training program. Amazing manager always wanting to help you get better with your skills."
good,"I would have to say the most enjoyable moments at work are: everyone is friendly, helpful and courteous with others. Especially the customers."
good,"Tolle Mitarbeiter und Guter Chef in Hildesheim. "
good,"I started this job as a work placement when I was in a special adult living program at SIAST. Immediately upon entering the manager's office I could tell the energy of the atmosphere was a very positive one and the manager was very friendly."
good,"Very Kind management"
good,"Hours of operation were better than most retailers."
good,Good company to work for and it's really the associates who make it so great. I've met multiple managers and helped out at a few different locations and have to say that 90% of the people I've met who work within the company are a pleasure to work with.
good,Strong work life balance is encouraged by management.  A positive and relaxed work environment.  Collaboration and partnership is seen throughout the many teams and departments.
good,Sales roles are a lot of work and you need to hustle but the compensation when you win is great. They offer great benefits and the corporate office amenities are amazing.
good,I enjoy working for Staples. My management team is extremely supportive and encourages employees to grow every day. I strived to to take on a leadership role and the management team coached me into the role of Technology Consultant. I am pleased to say that with their help I learned to be a stronger leader than ever before. I enjoy communicating with customers and ensuring they leave the store with a total solution. The hardest part of the job is handling unhappy and impatient customers who can sometimes direct their anger towards you as the associate. I have learned to avoid taking it as a personal attack and try to provide the best service possible.
good,"I love all my fellow employees, loved working there but the stress build up of school and work environment got to me. Wish that life did not ruin a great job for me."
good,"A typical day at staples would be very energetic and always positive."
good,A typical day at the workplace was fine being that this was my first job i learned how to deal with customers as well as my coworkers. My manager was compromising when it came to dealing with your schedule or if you need to make adjustments with dealing with others. The hardest job was organizing all the items back onto the shelves.
good,HCA was always a wonderful work environment. Surrounded by Professionals was extremely inspiring to me. Everyone there was extremely respectful and had no problem helping each other.
good,"As soon as I walk into the building its work time, customers asking questions, giving them the appropriate guide to finding merchandise."
good,"very good environment work work in, most of the staff is friendly. I've earned so much experience by working at staples such as to analyze customers needs, expectations and solutions."
good,"This job is very exciting. I am always working and I am asked to push myself everyday. my co-workers are nice and always joking around. The hardest part of the job is knowing it does not really help give me experience in what I want to do, which is accounting. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing there is always more hours available if I want some."
good,"A typical day at staples means being customer orientated, Greet customers as they walk in the door, approach them and ask if they need assistance. Be able to provide solutions and options for there enquiries. To locate stock from other sources such as online, or other stores and get it delivered at the earliest convenience for the customer"
good,Staples is a great job. It is well organized and supplies great recognition when you have done a good job. The managers and the whole team are very welcoming and supportive as well.
good,I love working at Staples and the teams are fantastic!  We all challenge each other and we look out for one another.  There have been a lot of lay offs and I want to be sure I am actively searching for my next move!
good,Paid weekly great company to work for. relaxed dress environment. however small room for advancement. learned a lot and can grow personally but not career wise.
good,Good Work Culture. Excellent work life balance. Scope  for learning new technology. and ventures awesome environment a a a a a
good,"Excellent management, very fair work conditions, and absolutely positive working environment. The CEO has amazing morals and truly treats all his employees, both part-time and full-time, with utmost respect. My only wish is if advancement was easier to do, however, I will not give up."
good,The typical day is answer customers questions and find them what they need. At the end of the day clean the store and prepare for the next day. The hardest part typically is dealing with angered customers and the most enjoyable is learning on the job.
good,"I learned alot at Bureau en Gros, how to interact with the customers, How to open and close a ticket (depends on the program). I would start the day at 8 am and finish at 5 pm going into the shop and repairing computers."
good,"I think the autonomy this position is great. As a BDA everything is on your own shoulders in terms of hitting your numbers month after month. Staples Advantage gives all of the tools to be successful at this job, it is simply on you to chase the purchasing managers down and get them to make the switch."
good,If it wasn't for me wanting a career in nursing and relocating I believe I would still be working there. I love the employees we had. We all worked together to get the job done
good,"Staples was a fantastic opportunity for me to see what good management is like. As far as job requirements and day to day work is concerned it is the same as any other retail store. However, the management at my particular store was fantastic. Scheduling, moral, training, and support jun worked. Its interesting to be so amazed to have something work the way it was designed."
good,"If your fresh out of high school this is a great job, the pay is good plus you get to meet new people every day, not to mention the concerts and games."
good,A multifaceted working environment that caters to the needs of businesses and consumers alike by offering services ranging from furniture and technology to office supplies.
good,"Greet customers, help them out on the floor or find someone who can help them. Check out customers at the register. They worked with my schedule while I was at school, very flexible."
good,"The most enjoyable part of this job was helping the customers. A typical day at work would include such that. The hardest part of the job would be to build chairs, but it was fun nonetheless."
good,"It was very busy all the time,but I always could ask for help and get it from my co-workers. They were so nice and always care for the others and the customers"
good,"i enjoyed working mornings, i was able to get things ready for the day and help other areas get ready for opening and organize the work area so it looked presentable and pleaseable to customers. WHile working there i learned about the products that we offer and the services we provide for and all the products we have for many different occasions. The Management was pretty good they were alkways around and easy to find when they weren't around. The co-workers were very friendly and helpful and never complained about helping others even when we had our rushes. The hardest part of the job was to sell certain items that our managers wanted us  to sell. The most enjoyable part of the job was that i was able to connect with every customer and help them to the best of my ability."
good,"I would assist the mangers to carry out tasks so I became familiar with them and could carry them out by myself without assistance. I would answer the phone, make phones to customers and assist the on the tills and finding stock for customers."
good,This was a great place to work always exciting and new changes with the company while I was there. Like being there during the launch of their online shopping internet site.
good,"I really loved Staples, Inc! They gave very little hours, but they provided such an awesome work culture. I loved the managers, and i loved the associates they would hire."
good,Great place to work. People are a lot of fun to be around. Not always busy so you do have time to breathe. Hours are great and flexible if you have important things to attend to.
good,"the days start always with a lot of copies "
good,"Checking emails was a priority. "
good,"Staples is a great place to work. A typical day can be described as fun and challenging. While most check outs go smoothly and with out a problem some can have a couple hitches, such as the cash register malfunctioning, or a certain coupon not wanting to work. Typical stuff. A typical day you'll see a various and copious amount of people. From business owners to your average Joe. Things can get slow sometimes especially after dinner and just before close. I learned how to deal with people that don't think that people who work retail deserve respect and to be treated as equals. I learned how to ignore the behaviors and serve the person. "
good,"Loved working for Staples and my managers,  I loved being around different types of people and created a strong bond with each and every person."
good,"Friendly staff, goal oriented management, limited hours available. Enjoyable customers who are in need of help selecting items for their office or home. High knowledge of products is a major plus."
good,"-Typical day was register,sales then home."
good,IMS was a good experience i was able to learn how to talk to people and to sell to them something they would not otherwise consider. the people i worked with were amazing and they would help with anything you need. I enjoyed the whole job there was not a part of it that i did not like doing.
good,"A typical day at work is greeting every customer entering the door with a smile, operating a cash register, directing customers and/or walking the customer to the merchandise and replenishing the shelves. My co-workers and I work as a team in helping each other to provide excellent customer service. Management is very understanding and cooperative in working with their employees' schedule. The most enjoyable part of my job is making sure the customer is having a good shopping experience in our store. Seeing them leave with a smile is rewarding. We do out best in providing the merchandise they are looking for. If we don't have the merchandise in stock, we always give the opinion of ordering it on-line for them. And having it shipped to their desired destination."
good,"As a Sales Associate, I was responsible for offering promotional offers, items, and services, ensuring efficiency within each transaction, and ensuring each customer leave satisfied. This company offered incentives to show its employees that their hard work is truly valued."
good,A typical day consists of selling desk and chair warranties . Helping costumers find what they need in store and online. What i learned in this job is that everyone works as a team and you have to lean how to do that in order to move on. Management is good not great . The hardest part of the job is getting more hours and keeping up with certain selling requirements & dealing with rude costumers all day. The most enjoyable part of the job is doing office supply work and getting to work with fun coworkers .
good,Staples its a good place to work and learn technology .And in the past  I had good manager that work with your schedule and help grow in the company.
good,"Love working at Staples because of the people I get to work with, and also the management is very easy going."
good,"I love staples. It's a great place to work. Flexible schedule. They are willing to work with your schedule. Managers care about you if you care about your job."
