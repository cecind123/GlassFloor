bad,"You have to play the game here to get ahead. Know the right people, go to happy hours and get drunk. This work place is so inappropriate that it literally gave me a headache. Inappropriate behavior that you have to accept to be part of in crowd. My Vice President knew and did nothing. Don't work here unless you want your soul to be drained on the daily. The good thing is Disney bought them so maybe there will be a shake up in the culture."
bad,"Run, don't walk.  Management should be ashamed.  Long days, short pay, ugly personalities.  If you want to be undervalued and overworked this is the break you've been looking for."
bad,It was boring. I learned nothing. The management was bad. Workplace culture i have no idea about. Everything was hard. Nothing was enjoyable. I did not put anything as good for these people and 21st century fox
bad,"Llegamos y comezamos ordenar las mesas , aprendí sobre como organizar un  evento ,la dirección del lugar es Donovan 245, la idea es ayudarnos en equipo y ser servicial con la gente, la parte difícil para mi era estar de pie ,me gusta de este trabajo que conoces gente nueva y la gente se siente contenta por el servicio que damos."
bad,"Fox is one of those places that starts off great, pumps you up, and the moment get excited about the possibilities, they are yanked away. The constant change has not been for the best, and there have been massive errors in judgments. Not healthy and not conducive to positive growth."
bad,"Fox is the place where everyone can enjoy working here as the culture of the company, support and Management is great."
bad,This place is a death trap. Once you start working here you are stuck. No advancement and the benefits are terrible. STAY AWAY!!
bad,Publicized movies and worked on marketing programs for major motion picture company. Handled East Coast marketing and PR.
bad,"High turnover rate (for a reason). They have just changed all the schedules here and made them all flex and unreasonable. Your schedule will be a ten hour off shift, meaning the shift day to day will be different with only ten hours in between, anytime. For example, you could get out at 1 am and have to come back at 10 am. Then get out at 7 pm and come back at 5 am. Good luck on safety and your health with that not to mention a sleep pattern. Don't even think about having a family or social life for you will never be able to plan anything because of the short notice of your hours. They have gotten rid of most people having even one weekend day off, even if you have been there for several years. No advancement opportunities. Management does not care in the least. Do yourself a favor and work at another Fox facility. The company is good, the division in The Woodlands is horribly mismanaged."
bad,"There are a lot of really dedicated and talented employees in my area.  There is a no overtime policy, which in itself is understandable in today's marketplace.  However, management takes advantage of this by giving workers considerably more work than could ever be completed without overtime.  As a result, employees clock out at what should be the end of their shift, then work several more hours to complete tasks on their own time.  No one says anything, because, as you are reminded often, there is a line of people waiting to take our job if you don't complete the work.  There is no upward mobility.  Management hires outside the company for their openings, and often train new hires in a job they have never done instead of promoting an current employee who has already been doing the job."
bad,"Each experience is different depending on the department and the direct supervisor within the department.  While some may offer a collaborative, flexible environment, others are hostile."
bad,Poor Management and communication. Poor culture and Job Security. Not a place you can see yourself in the future. Typical corporate environment with no room to grow.
bad,I really enjoy helping people so when I can make any arrangements that benefits both them and my company that is a very satisfying day.  In my line of work you have to be able to read a persons situation to have an idea what their intentions are about paying or not.  The hardest part of my job is when I have to take back the collateral because I know that means our company will probably end up losing money and the member will not be happy either.  I love it when I can work things out with our members so that we do not have to repossess their collateral.  It is a win win outcome.
bad,"Have enjoyed working here 15 years.  We work closely together and have each others back."
bad,We were paid a salary that brought us close to minimum wage to perform fairly mundane tasks underneath people who did not want to be at work.  Management was strict with hours (5 minutes late was a big deal and lunch was STRICTLY 1 hour with no exceptions) & dress code - no jeans on Fridays even... Office is 99.5% cubicles with zero privacy.
bad,"Rotina"
bad,Terrible management in home entertainment division. Zero training zero expectations. Once that is set they complain about you behind your back when ask for help
bad,"My dept with the division - cheap, poor management, don't appreciate employees, execs egos running amok."
bad,"It was a master control operator part time position. It was minimal hours, but the pay was really low. I would not recommend the position to others because it was overnights as well."
bad,Management listen and worked with staff to improve overall operations. Company invested in the employees - new systems and new hardware. Bonus system was great.
bad,"Dispatching help desk calls to IT Technicians. Receiving and delivering end users orders, which included new PC/Laptops, monitors, keyboards, memory, etc. "
bad,"I was either working all the time or not working at all which made it difficult. If there was more work, I could have sustained."
bad,"If you want to work in an environment akin to Mad Men, Fox Home Entertainment is for you. Run by dinosaurs who have no understanding of the digital business and don't appreciate the contribution of their employees."
bad,"I can't honestly believe I lasted as long as I did at this company.  The workload was utterly impossible, the working environment was not friendly and it was always very cold - yes temperature wise, always had a sweater or jacket on."
bad,The people were a great team. The environment was very laid back and was easy to work for. The company does a lot of they call restructure. Approximately every ten years they do a restructure
bad,a place to work with people in the city in a big building that is not as big as some other buildings but still pretty big by regular building standards
good,"During my 4 years at FOX, the company continuously added more hours of news programs without hiring the staff needed for those programs. Management did not value its employees and what they brought to the table."
good,"Fox, like many of the studios, has it's shares of pro's and con's."
good,"fazia oque gostava,tava focada em fazer meu trabalho com qualidade e fazer clientes satisfeitos!"
good,"Typically, before the company split there were many positives. On the off quarters, a 9-5pm job that required not so many deadlines, with a balance of work/life.On the quarter it was fast paced and highly stressful. Since the company was going through a split, many cons came from this. Poor management of people, 15+ hour days and weekends, as well as constant changes and miscommunication/misunderstandings. "
good,"Lots of travel. Lots of license agreement negotiations. Customer/account care fell dramatically. Relentless pursuit of the last nickel from client accounts. Could have been a truly wonderful place to work had certain executives been truthful, open and honest."
good,"Not very family friendly schedules. Better suited for bachelors, or professionals with adult children. Daily Hire Contracts which means not everyone is guaranteed a 40 hour workweek."
good,"Pros:"
good,"For the most part, it was one of the better film studios to work at. Unfortunately, it no longer exists, as it was taken over by the Walt Disney Company."
good,"20th Century Fox enabled me to learn the film industry in all aspects.  I was able to travel extensively and meet all levels of people in the film industry.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the wide range of influence employees had.  Unfortunately, the company culture was not very professional and very confrontational due to specific leadership styles.  A typical day did not exist but ranged from securing advertising, developing multifaceted marketing events and strategies, ensuring payment of all marketing spends.  Ensuring that KPI's were monitored and  achieved, meeting with clients and resolving problems and finding solutions."
good,After the company was purchased  by Disney it no longer was a fun place to work. We all thought that management would the first to go but instead they headed for the life boats first and hung the rest of us out to dry
good,"Organised and well structured. great people, with real talent and expertise. everyone has real passion and knowledge. directors appreciate your work and if you show a willingness will give you more interesting stuff to do."
good,"Every day you're usually involved in the live coverage of a sporting event.  It can be cool, especially if you're into baseball.  But you will work weekends.  There is a system in place where you can get weekend days off through vacation days but spaces are very limited, especially around holidays and fall/spring.  Still, getting paid to watch sports is still a decent way to make a living.  If you're lucky enough to have one of your teams play on a fox network I'm sure it would be an extra bonus.  Benefits are good.  If you are on a shift that has you work nights and weekends you get a bonus payment (for master control at least)."
good,"The hours were few and far between. No prospects for a full time position. However, I was exposed to various aspects of television production and assistant duties."
good,Long hours with not very competitive pay. Slow career growth. HR isn't very good. One cool per is working on the lot. Days are either very slow or very busy.
good,"Limited media company at the time, limited potential.  Main office in Bloomington at the time.  Worked at Peoria office exclusively."
good,"Dia de trabalho tipico meta batida."
good,"Stressful company with antiquated equipment. No on site it. Management should have more respect for their staff."
good,Company is getting ready to sell most of its assets to Disney.  Many people - some are estimating half the employees in our department - will be getting laid off.  Management has tries to keep people informed - but still alot up in the air.
good,"Freedom and nice non-monetary benefits, but salaries are low, culture is negative/retaliatory and getting worse.  No room for growth or advancement.  Experience/hard work is not valued."
good,"Good job overall if you are interested in the entertainment industry. Very image oriented, it's who you know, not what you know and very limited to promotions internally."
good,"On a positive note, the business users of the department were very nice and would make time to have discusssions related to work. This was only the case if they weren't being pounced on by management on meeting a deadline. The company is quite antiquated in there technologies which results in alot of manual processes. And staff work extremely long hours. What I found interesting is this company doesn't want to compensate you for the work that you do."
good,Good employer. There are some managers not very popular with employees. Pays average salary and average bonus and average to good benefits. Good & friendly environment amongst front line employees
good,"It is good to have on your resume, however it is really hard to move up in the company because rarely do people leave or get promoted. It is good as a first job or if you are doing something specific in entertainment."
good,The company culture is very friendly and open in most of the departments. I would say FOX sports is where you will find the nicest people on the lot. However in my position the most difficult part is dealing with my supervisors.
good,"Typical day at work started at 8am. Meetings once or twice a week to discuss online sales, new release strategies, customer issues/solutions."
good,"My co-workers were great. Sr management was very political and didn't understand the digital space to its fullest. My day was managing a team of 5 to ensure all our campaigns were running smoothy and delivering optimal results. I was constantly seeking new digital opportunities in the space and how to promote awareness of our films through the digital space. Best part of the is seeing results and how my efforts were translating into sales, conversions, and heightened awareness. Hardest part was getting sr management excited about the digital space and our accomplishments and putting more budget and resources to it."
good,15 hr days for first 8 months then 8-5p after that.
good,"It's a place to learn about how a business works.  Lots is expected of each employee and hands are not held - it's a sink or swim kind of place.  Don't expect fairness, expect favoritism and diversity hiring to rule the day."
good,"I started as a payroll clerk and continued to move up in the Payroll department. Even though, I had very little  experience in accounting, I was given a chance. I have learned a lot in the time that I have been employed with Fox."
good,worked on several film projects for various production companies all under the umbrella of 20th century fox the opportunities were very gratifying and I enjoyed the projects
good,"Design show format and conceptualize on-air commercials"
good,"great career start, but better opportunities.  the people here are friendly and welcoming. the management is great.  the downfall is when a new training program starts and possibility of moving without knowing until 2 weeks prior to your move"
good,"Transparent culture, great people, clear functions, responsible colleagues, manager are great and a lot to learn from. Would definitely recommend for a young professional."
good,"It was cool to work on a movie. I lost my job to someone that I helped hire, so that was bad. I guess that's the movie business. Everyone is in it for themselves."
good,Nice place to work.  Always something new.   Worked Part Time with not much to keep me busy.   I was offered an opportunity to go back to work with Wolverine World Wide as a Full Time employee and decided to take that.
good,Working as a Sales Assistant at Fox Station Sales has given me a solid foundation for building a career in Sales.  I've gained the confidence and knowledge to further my career as an Account Manager or Sales Representative.
good,"People are either incredibly happy or really unhappy depending on the division and their management. Work life balance varies according to your department. "
good,A empresa oferece um período de treinamento para a realização dos serviços técnicos em celulares e os colegas de trabalho também são dispostos a ajudar uns aos outros. A parte mais difícil é a jornada de trabalho (cerca de 9h:30min por dia durante a semana e 6 horas aos sábados). A parte mais agradável do trabalho é a convivência com os colegas e o atendimento ao cliente.
good,"Collaborateurs  et  hiérarchie amicaux et professionnels ."
good,great company for independent performers who are ambitious to advance their own careers.
good,This place will keep you busy with work. Your typical day will be you working in a quiet environment because there is always meetings going on. Friendly coworkers and staff. Hardest part of the job was communication. Most enjoyable part was the fact they make you feel welcomed and give you some pretty cool stock images to work with.
good,Worked with several different departments each day. Multitasking and prioritizing the workload was a must.
good,The pay was very low.  I liked having a large variety of interesting job duties to do.  I liked being the primary assistant to a Branch Manager.
good,A typical work day involves lots of standing and some customer service. my co workers were very enjoable. Everything was good.
good,It was pretty awesome getting to work for a radio station for that little bit.
good,"•	Arranged and coordinated complex schedules for 2 senior executives"
good,"Good benefits with Medical & 401 K, big brand name, movie screenings, good exposure, not many growth opportunities, not much interaction with other divisions."
good,Hours were good. Pay was low. Crew was awesome. Management was inconsistent with scheduling. Rotated crew members regularly without reason. Job was fun.
good,I worked at 20th Century Fox as a temporary Senior Coordinator in the public relations department. Everyone was warm and friendly and it was a cool atmosphere. I got to attend a photo shoot and a screening which was also very nice. I was through an agency so I can't really speak to the salary as I was paid through the agency.
good,"It's hard to get comfortable when the workplace has a reputation for being a revolving door for employees.  Too many clicks within management which makes it difficult to advance within the company. "
good,"O breve período de trabalho, com rotinas bancárias e com resultados superiores."
good,It depends on the group you are in within the company each one is different. I personally think it is a great stepping stone but worth getting out to other companies to be compensated for your hard work and then come back.
good,As expected on any LIVE daily TV show the work hours are long and the stress level is high. Would have hoped that upper management did a better job of listening to its team members especially on creative decisions. .
good,"A productive and fast pace environment with careful thinking and developed teams, whilst developing ideas, partnerships and strategies for International markets"
good,Was contract work and I was lead to believe it would result into a permanent position.
good,"Great benefits but the company lacks heart.  Senior Managers, manage up and do not promote their hard working team members. Get in young, learn and leave as soon as possible. As the saying goes, keep your friends close and your enemies closer!"
good,"12 hour shifts, but the pay was good. Its a production company and there were a lot of egos at play. They only cared about one thing and that was to make money. Company doesnt view you as an asset. No social life if you work in movie production."
good,Uninspired and self-absorbed leadership. Management expects you to fight with - as opposed to - working with other departments.
good,"I worked with dozens of amazing team members every week at FOX.  The work there was fast paced and often stressful, but was generally satisfying.  The group that I worked in no longer exists at FOX and was sold as part of the Disney transaction."
good,"The days were busy design work, emails, and meetings planning for the future. The workload was all properly managed and felt needed by all the departments who had made requests. The people really made the job feel more fun and that we were building something many others would enjoy."
good,"No promotions during my six years there, very friend closed colleagues, management not qualified for the position and always complaining."
good,"Great place to work with"
good,Demanding work load depending on the season/time of year but as a union employee well paid and benefits a plus.  Recent changes in management making it a place for younger workers preferred with not much chance of advancement.
good,"stress free work environment, marketing techniques for film"
good,Une très bonne entreprise ou toute l'équipe est considérée à sa juste valeur. Une très bonne ambience tout  en restant professionnel et efficace
good,"it was stressful at times but we had a good group.  that's important.  there are a lot of layers of management but expected there."
good,"when shooting television shows, the sets for 20th Century FOX shows tend to run 14 to 15 hours when shooting more often then other sets I have been on."
good,Great company to work for. Friendly work environment with a lot of great people. The only issue I see is a lack of room for advancement unless you know the right people.
good,"I have always had a passion for this industry and working at Fox has been a joy, due to the team and the clients I have worked with. The negotiations although sometimes difficult and challenging were always in good faith and respectful."
good,"Selling television advertising space is very competitive and when the company you work for was nit considered one of the big three networks, since changed, we sold space very cheap in our shows. Tough to make money that way."
good,at the fox excel I was a supervisor for the bar I all so ues to take delivery check the stock and do the moneys count to check all the money is there open and close
good,"Confident and forward thinking team not afraid to take chances. Leadership understands the market and has invested heavily in the company's infrastructure to help employees get through their day-to-day."
good,"This internship consisted of basic clerical duties as well as creative tasks including script reading, reviewing and coverage. Although there wasn't a chance to make personal connections with the office, it was a huge lesson on the inner workings of a film studio."
good,"For me, it was a wonderful place to work. Not very much room for growth within certain departments, nonetheless, I learned a tremendous amount and will always treasure the people and my experiences with FOX."
good,"Great benefits (medical, dental, 401k, bla bla bla..). Beautiful lot with 4 restaurants and the best food truck ever. The people on the lot are nice and you always see actors and actresses all over the place because folks are always filming."
good,"Great place to learn, being a college student. Enjoyed the time and FOX 7"
good,Great environment. The people and the location were ideal.
good,Great way to start a career in media is to work for one of the giants.
good,Tensions are high right now with the Disney acquisition but they are wonderful people to work with.  Home Team Sports was a great division to work in.
good,"21st Century Fox is in a big transition, so hard to review given the buyout from The Walt Disney Company.  Was a great place to work primarily because of the creative people I worked with who were top notch."
good,"I loved working for 20th Century Fox, however it became very corporate after the News Corp takeover and I feel it suffered.  So many great memories there, however."
good,"Do not compensate well, you need to work long hours not only to carry the workload for other employees that are careless/lazy/unqualified, but also you need the overtime because you get paid so little. They way they go about things makes no sense, they work their employees to the bone. Positive is that they are always open to new and fresh ideas regardless of your position."
good,Very hard work but really rewarding. Great industry to work in and Twentieth Century Fox consistently deliver the best results in the business.
good,"Delivered increased sales for both local and regional accounts in a demanding work environment, under deadline and pressure conditions. Professionally committed to my clients to meet or exceed their expectations while proactively meeting senior management sales objectives and company goals. Prepared contracts and reports for clients and potential customers to drive sales and increase revenue for both the client and the station."
good,Les heures sont infernales mais l’ ambiance de travail est bien.
good,"Woirking at FOX was like working on a Studio tour, everyday you walked in knowing this is where the magic happens.  The community was strong and always had something going on!"
good,Great place to work. Benefits are great and lots of extras. The work culture is diverse and there are many people from all different walks of life. The location is similar to campus life.
good,"It has been many years since I worked at FOX 61, but at the time I was there it was, as with most television stations, stressful, fast-paced, and ever changing."
good,"Fox has been pretty good to me overall. "
good,"21st Century Fox is a very challenging place to work.  If you can work hard in a fast paced environment and deal with the politics, you can make a very good salary."
good,"My overall experience in the department I worked in was good.  I loved the President and he adapted well to the changing media environment."
good,"Good people and very friendly work environment. Work varies depending on your division. "
good,"A typical day consist of working along side the head Accountant to create budgets for the Editorial team and make sure all expenses are on track.  Matching invoices to purchase orders and entering them into our accounting software is a large part as well.  Once all is enter I proceed to print checks and send off for appropriate signatures before mailing out.  On a weekly basis I will run reports for each film I am working on, which is typically 2-4 shows at one time.  After running reports I will reconcile to make sure everything adds up correctly and then close that period.  I work in a department of roughly 12 people but only my boss and I are on a team.  The hardest part of the job is that I am working in Post Production so I am dealing with all the aftermath of filming, which means there are a lot of open ended problems that need addressed but I was not there during production to know exactly what happened.  This takes time to research and figure out exactly what needs to be done to resolve the problem correctly.  The most enjoyable part about the job is the atmosphere.  Fortunately I get to work with some very friendly people.  Throughout my time here I have learned quite a bit.  Majority is about accounting and budgeting multimillion dollar films.  I've also improved on organizational skills and taking notes to make sure every last bit of work is taken care of and nothing slips through the cracks.  There's also quite a bit of calling vendors to make sure all costs are taken care of or when there is a problem with there account that needs to be resolved.  All and all Fox"
good,"- Access to upper management"
good,Prepare monthly overhead and distribution forecast and expense reports for Twentieth Century Fox Television and Fox 21.
good,A good balance of work and play. Executives are nice and easy to work for. Can get stuck in a position for longer than you expect. Good opportunity to perfect assistant skills.
good,"A great place with challenging work to make changes and impacts. Supportive executives and management team."
good,"Good company, good colleagues. Ended up having my position outsourced and off-shored. Enjoyed the atmosphere and personnel. Provided level 3-4  support for servers around the world within the WAN."
good,I enjoyed the environmanet and I really grew to love the management team.  Proud to be a part of the company however I need to seek higher paying positions.
good,A great place to work if you have a passion for sports marketing and advertising. Great to work with so many professionals that were free lancers but had great pride in their work!
good,currently alot of in house finger pointing as to who and what is responsible for loss films and how to shore up costs in the midst of the shrinking home entertainment window
good,FOX as a company is comprised of various sub sections. As a journalist for one of the O&Os I can say co-workers are ambitious and understanding. It's a work environment that excels from intelligent discussion as well as a strong work ethic.
good,"This was my first 'big' job out of college and was my absolute favorite. The exposure to so many different business opportunities, ideas that came to reality was incredible."
good,Good company to work for stable and offers many opportunities towards advancement.  The sad part is upper management will and can stop your grown with the company to advance to another department/job.  Also management is not fair with their staff that's been faithful and loyal to promote within.  Lots of favoritism and unnecessary micro managing.  Many people have resigned their position to work elsewhere.
good,Hollywood at it's finest - the real Studio Experience. Collaborative teams working developing licensing strategies. Identify and monetize studio assets. Great talent!
good,"Very much a team feel throughout"
good,"Film, wat een fantastisch product. Dit verkopen is fantastisch om te doen aangezien mensen blij worden van je product. Daar boven op heb ik veel vrijheid in mijn werkzaamheden aangezien mijn baas in Munchen zit. Prijs punten, release data, communicatie daar zijn wij allemaal voor in de 'lead'. Hierdoor geniet ik erg van mijn huidige werk."
good,"The parent company of 20th Century Fox, Fox Television, Fox News and Fox International is a multi-platform company that makes an effort to create a cohesive unit with open communication across businesses."

good,Work on all those movies and TV shows gave very informative knowledge about the entertainment business. Anything is possible and everything you see is not always what it seems
good,"Intensive personal interaction with other departments, external vendors and internal management. Very rewarding and positive experience. Internal management turnover and departmental structures were not ideal for growth but overall company was fun and successful while also teaching a great deal about how a large corporation functions."
good,"Fast paced, challenging and time demanding.  Fox is proudly the leanest operating studio.  We are able to more with less. Everything was a positive team effort which made it rewarding to all as Fox successfully became and remained the number one supply chain in the industry to all retailers. Repeated honors from high profile customers for service excellence.  Fox challenges you to best that you can be and rewards you accordingly. I am grateful for having had the opportunity to be a integral member of the Fox Team."
good,"Currently work out of a remote home office, Managing 2 of the fastest growing accounts in the world (Amazon and Costco).

Strengths include personnel management, delivering quantifiable results, consistently exceeding industry and company growth rates,"
good,"A typical day at work is interesting. I have learned a great deal fom this job, mostly how the real world works. Manangement is firm but fair, any request is taken into consideration. My co-workers were all fun, responsible young adults. The hardest part of the job was went it was slow and we had to wait for work to come in. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with all those interesting people."
good,"Family friendly "
good,"they have good lunch, good breakfast, good dinner and fun work culture, enjoyed the studio filming of the different film and tv shows."
good,"I was a contract employee at 20th Century Fox.  Although I was actually employed through an agency and not directly with 20th Century Fox I was received and made to feel like I was part of the family unit.  It was a close family environment, the duties were exciting, fun and fulfilling.  Had it not been for a family emergency which required that I relocated back home to Ohio I would have accepted my position permanently."
good,"Great place to work! Fun and fast paced work environment, lots of hours but also lots of opportunities to learn and build your career. Great management"
good,Wonderful working environment in a chaotic atmosphere involving marketing and publicity for the film industry. Learned much about the importance of branding and confidentiality in regards to regards to marketing of films.
good,Overall good company to work for. Hard work is appreciated. Great group of people. Trying to provide work/life balance but it depends on department you work at
good,"I was a consultant for three months.  Manager was very professional."
good,I was the prime anchor with FOX 51. It was an amazing challenge where we built a great team. It ended when company got out of the news business leaving all of us out of work.
good,Productive work place with great upper management to learn from. Work was different on a weekly basis and allowed for further hands on experience within different aspects of the business.
good,"Good team spirit; Supportive Management; Strong SDLC and PMLC. Teams work well together in a friendly environment. Facility is centrally located in Los Angeles, Calif."

good,"The Australian office has a brilliant director who really fosters independent handsfree management."
good,Good working place with friendly environment. high pay salary and flexible hours. Learn to manage time effectively as the deadlines is very tight. Able to do multitasking job when required.
good,Its decent. Nothing creative. Great benefits and located close to the lot so lot is open for all employees. Wouldn't suggest for anyone who wants a creative role. Very administrative.
good,Cant say enough about how much this company taught me still use it n my everyday life until this day. Fox/obel was a great company they actually worked around there employees school schedule and made sure your check came on time every week it was located down town in Chicago by Michigan in a beautiful spot .
good,A typical day was attending medical appointments and scheduling treatments and follow up visits. Communicating with the employer was required.
good,"Typical day, presentations - working with Walmart management and our teams back in LA. "
good,"I worked on the set of Homeland, Sleepy Hollow and I have also worked on a pilot The Novice. I really like working here but it's not steady work. We get laid off in between shoots so I have been laid off three times in the last year. It's really a good job and I have met a few stars working here. I like the people I work with and I like my supervisors. We work a lot of very long hours when we work 16-18 sometimes but it's worth it good pay working that many hours. We haul a lot of different types of trailers some are like mini moble homes, huge generators that would power a city block easy. We also pull 48 and 53 foot trailers."
good,Good job just finished the job. We worked in the paint area hanging steel and welding being a construction worker we finished it on time and had a good time doing so great guys to work with
good,"High paced environment. More work then there is people to do it. I have learned quiet a bit about how international business, systems and how to work with people from many different countries. Management is typically supporting. Hardest part of the job is various level of complexity involved with doing business overseas (e.g., regulations, statutory reporting vs. US GAAP reporting, etc). The most enjoyable aspect of the job is working with a lot of smart people from a lot of different countries."
good,Baixa burocracia
good,"Count all the money from the drawers,print out reports and check e-mails . Open up accounts for new members, answer members questions. Count all the money in the safe at the end of the day . Make sure everything is balanced ."
good,"20th Century Fox is a very entrepreneurial company, which welcomes initiatives and experiments."
good,The position I held was not very promising although I did learn loss of great skills. There's improve opportunities for others and a really great environment.  My only issue was the compensation for work that is. Employees should be paid more but that all depends on the industry and the market.
good,"I worked for Fox for 25 years, and grew tremendously as a technician and manager as well as a human being.  It is a challenging culture, some issues, but everywhere you work has such issues. I would recommend Fox if the culture is suitable to your temperament."
