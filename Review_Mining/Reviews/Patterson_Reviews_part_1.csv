bad,Terrible working environment had to argue to get my own paycheck. Management is a joke. Owner is a very shady shiesty individual has had several problems with the Department of Labor.
bad,"poor managment, very low pay, long hours and alot of favortism. No kind of bonuses or rewards for anything . always told how bad you do but never told how good you do. management has picks and lets them by with doing nothing while your working your tail off so your having to take their slack to get the job done."
bad,"They are not very willing to accommodate their employees, whether it be transfer or a job change. Managements roll in getting to know and assessing the personnel underneath is non existent."
bad,My job is extremely easy and all I do is clamp headbands together so that later I can put them on a display box
good,"*long"
good,"Working with Patterson Kia was Great i loved the environment and i really enjoyed for filling the needs of the customer, But like in all sales its a numbers game sometimes you don""t get the sale and sometimes you don't.  The thrill of the sale is what has me wanting to do better and for filling the needs of the customer."
good,"It was a great experience being 17 years old and working a paid internship through genesys works. However the job had its many cons, the management treated me like I had no idea what I was doing when I could accomplish more than management could. Also the management didn't think it was necessary for me to keep my job, I played a crucial role in helping them from falling behind. They decided they wanted to balance doing a huge company wide project to transfer employees from windows xp and lotus notes to windows 7 and outlook, all of this was to be split up among 3 people, this isn't possible."

good,Litigation of multiple issues. The law firm had problems with the health of their partner attorneys. There was no potential for advancement within the firm.
good,"I worked for six years never go an increase in wages, salary you start with is the salary you remain with. Feel like their should be some type of yearly evaluation of wage increases."
good,"The work environment was changing based on the completion of the project. I learned how to operate a ST 80,  a forklift and how to change a rotor in a mud pump. Nice co workers. The hardest part of the job was pulling out and breaking up the pipes."
good,Good place to work. Lots of exposure to new technologies. Enjoy my work in Patterson. Being a senior ABAPer I am responsible for all complex developments.
good,sometimes days are long. 40 plus hours because they dont hire enough people and keep firing current ones. people suck. it can be fun and a nice place till they give you the boot for ridiculous reasons
good,Great benefits and competitive wages after being in the industry for over 10 years they do take care of there employees and look out for your well being
good,you work days on and days off. the pay is awesome and theres no limit to how much you can work. the benefits are awesome as well. as long as the gas prices dont drop the job is there but the lower they go the more jobs are lost in the oil field.

good,"Communicated with medical, dental and manufacturing companies around the world"
good,this was my frist job and set my charcter for my future jobs being dependable on time and a hard worker
good,As a Oilfield production worker I learned a great deal about teamwork and work ethics. I received a hands on real world education that has carried on with me my entire life. Working in one of the worlds most dangerous professions we strived for a workplace rhythm of communication and safety that is engrained into your everyday work and life both on and off the jobsite. We were more like a family than co-workers knowing every part of each others personal lives and supporting each others personal and professional problems. It was more than just a job with comprehensive pay and benefits it was a brotherhood.
good,a typical day at Save Mart was always interesting because I always encountered new people and different personalities everyday. I learned how to build lasting relationships with customers and also help them find things that they needed. management was very supportive and helpful when needed and so were my co-workers. the hardest part of this job would have to have been when I couldn't meet a customers needs and the enjoyable part was when a customer left with a smile on their face.
good,By far the most balanced company in new  home construction to work with. Management is quick to answer questions and readily available. Houses are very well built. Customers are happy . Sense of pride in selling their product .
good,Just too much family working with me. Was always used as an example to other hands and mistreated because I was family.
good,"learned inventory control, operated heavy machinery. Always full- time work, it was great"
