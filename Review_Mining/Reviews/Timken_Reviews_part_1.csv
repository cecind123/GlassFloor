bad,Horrible place to work because of management..they have no structure in chain of command everyone with s clip board wants to be a boss... Have people on management that has no clue of what is being ran.. They worry more on the quantity of parts instead of the quality of the parts.
bad,"I worked there from July til November and I only had 2-40 hr checks to come in. Most of the time you aren't working a full week. You either left early on Thursday and be off Friday or leave early on Friday. Unorganized management. Random drug test. They will do anything to get rid of you, if you aren't a favorite. You will come in working 1 position, but eventually they want you to be flexible and work multiple jobs only get paid for one."
bad,I really enjoyed working for them I wish the pay was a little bit more. I would have still been there if it was not for the high risk pregnancy. I loved all the people I worked with there.
bad,"Timken started out as an awesome place to work but became a horrible company. They have began layoffs over the last 4 months. They started out with 33 people, then went to 66, and now they have 2 more scheduled layoffs throughout the next 6 months which will be another 66 people. They lie to their employees about things like this. The week leading up to layoffs they will force in the layoff employees to work overtime to get to a point that will not put employees too far behind once the layoff begins."
bad,"They cut your hours back so they can outsource product so they can get a fat bonus. Besides management people you work with on the floor are awesome, and some even made go good for you."
bad,"Harassment covered by management.  Don't work here if you are female, have all teeth, and under 150 lbs.  Boys will be boys was the response I got.  Supervisors lie and.dont file your complaints. HR magically change facts on your complaints."
bad,"Entreprise inhumaine, hiérarchie incompétente, salaire et prime démotivants"
bad,"I was a good worker but I felt uncomfortable"
bad,"If you plan on applying here, I’ll give you one word don’t. Run away as fast as you can. Worst management ever! Don’t care about employees. All they want is numbers and parts out the door. Absolutely the worst HR department in the entire universe."
bad,"Not a very rewarding place to work, not great management.  Seem to try to trip people up and then hammer them for tripping up.  Mandatory weekends on the floor for a couple years even when no work is available has burned out the people on the floor."
bad,"This place is no longer open...."
bad,I am tried of being there to fix nobody has a back broke to draw a line in the and  say this is how we do it we are all waiting for corporate to close the doors
bad,"They over work you and don’t care! I was sick, passing blood when I worked there. I told supervisors and they didn’t care. Terrible place to work at. I wouldn’t tell my enemy to work there."
bad,"extremely bad people , and management and supervisors, Management and supervisors have  family working at Timken and is putting them first above everyone"
bad,"If you are one of the bosses favorites you have it made. They have rules that apply to some but not others. Managers lie to you on a daily basis.  They give you raises every year but increase your health insurance so much that it negates your raise and you end up making less.  They post job openings and tell you that you have a fair shot at getting the job when you have no shot at all.  It's usually a bosses friend or relative that ends up getting the job. Pay is low except if you are one of bosses favorites, if you are you have it made."
bad,"Nothing good t say about Timken. The management is poor, racist, show no appreciation for their employees. Favoritism is shown on every level. Does not recommend this company to anyone."
bad,"Work 7 days per week ,plus more than 8 hours per day."
bad,do not apply at timken you will work every day of the week except sunday (somethimes). Bad management and low pay
bad,Not able to use my education that they paid for.  Did not like that they paid for me to get a MBA and did not attempt to promote me.  Promoted others instead
bad,"No advancement opportunities, only one 30 min break for 12 hour shift, favoritism throughout plant, management very poor, company cares nothing about the employees. Pay could be better."
bad,"A little over two years ago when I was first employed with Timken in Gaffney it was not an ideal position but the company did try to give added incentives to compensate for the extended hours and days that we worked.  Then management changed and all went down from that point, I was laid off and accepted a position at the Shiloh facility in NC..  Words can't describe the nightmare that facility is, the management team consists of members that do not listen or even take any interest in the employees within the company.  I would not recommend this company at this time to anyone due to poor management and how isolated this company makes you feel."
bad,I sustained  severe rash and swellng in my hands and arms due to a chemical we used. Many guys had similar effects. No medical attetion was provided and complaints were dismissed daily. They fired me for seeking medical attention on my own after several months of asking for help
bad,Management sucks....they lie about everything. No room to grow if you don't suck up to management. Work a lot of hours and only get one break. Not a good company to work for...... point blank.
bad,I was working with machinery that was old and falling apart. Maintenance was uneducated and often did not know how to fix the problems. Due to this the machine was difficult to run properly and often needed to be shut down and restarted. Eventually the company bought a new machine but the only employee who was trained to run it left the company. I was positioned to run the new machine so i had to use a lot of guess work which ended up taking an entire shift just to turn it on. When management was informed of the problem. i was told to keep at it until i figured it out.
bad,"I have Cert's in Machining from College and 20+ year's exp. Instead of hiring exp people from the steel trade they hire cashiers and bar tenders. Need I say more, of course I am referring to the St Clair plant in Eaton Ohio, which is where this job offer is from"
bad,"My career at Timken was very enjoyable until the last round of managers got parts of the business as we were short handed, some roles combined and others were separated.In my opinion this was a ""good ole boys"" company. The culture under the Operations Manager was almost scary."
bad,Beznadziejna atmosfera na każdym kroku mobing za duże wymagania od pracownika za takie pieniadze
bad,"mostly worked at machines, got to learn a couple different jobs. best part about working their was the people you get to work with. the management was a joke, way to uptight"
bad,Timken Drives in Fulton IL. is nothing more than a good old boys club filled with bully's backed by a condescending HR department!  There is no discipline for certain employees who are allowed to threaten and harass on a daily base
bad,"Do not work as a team "
bad,Not good to be an hourly employee here. They make you work swing shift even though they could get by with straight shifts. Research shows working swing shift will take about 7yrs off a persons life so less pension they have to pay. You will work all holidays except Christmas day. You will work most weekends. They claim to be diverse but in 4 departments I was in all the bosses  were white males. No females. No minorities. Only look into this place if you want to have no life and be treated like a prisoner.
bad,Sucks!!!! The company sucks the people suck just sucks all around. Management dont care about their employees. People don't know their a** from they elbows
bad,"Friends and family plan great if you are a hard worker you go no we're if you are friends with bosses you go up lader "
bad,"They treat people like machinery instead of human being,they train you but seems to set you up for a fall.almost like they want you to fail,very stressfal environment. They expect you to make unrealistic standards.Expext you to set up job in record time,excessive paperwork that has to be done in little time,but cant make mistakes.too stressful, would not recommend job,standard assembly is way too stressful."
bad,"do NOT recommend AT ALL. Bad management, poor work/life balance, very competitive. You are constantly in the corporate rat race and promotions rarely happen no matter how hard you work."
bad,poor management worse place I’ve ever worked by far. Still working here till I find something else definitely would not recommend this job to anyone. Please stay away trust me.
bad,"They hire mostly temps and pay them nothing.  Temps don't stay long, many didn't even last a day. Full-time staff aren't paid much either.   No air conditioning.  Very hot and hard work.  Management does not have their act together.  Was told that I could have time off, the was let go because of attendance.  Gave me a warning one day and was gone the next."
bad,Management does not communicate with employees.  It's a very us and them environment.  Favoritism is shown to certain employees.  Handling of issues is inconsistent.  Some people get disciplined for issues while others do not.  Timken used to be a good place to work.  Not anymore.
bad,Worked there for 11 years when Timken decided to close their distribution center and relocate it in South Carlina. 400 of us lost our jobs.
bad,"Poor management. HR was very rude. Pay is good, but not worth what you have to put up with. Job security is junk now. Would definitely not recommend coming here anymore."
bad,"The company used to be good to its employees, very productive, good work environment, that has changed in the past couple years. Now they cut our hours, no overtime, sometimes not even a full check, benefits go down every year, production is at an all time low. It is obvious that the management has no clue how to run a plant, all promotions and raises are approved through the buddy system and not based on skill or work ethic. Human resources is supposed to be for the employees, but the company uses them as a battering ram against its people. All around terrible place to work for anyone looking to advance or make their company better. Plant is also ran by a guy who was walked out 5 years ago and they brought him back."
bad,"Very poor management, only care about how many parts you can produce a shift. They talk a big game about safety and quality, but all they care about is getting the parts done. My supervisor was the most unprofessional and showed favoritism all the time. It was sickening to watch. The money is not bad but you have to put up with so much junk it is not worth it.I would not recommend this place to any one."
bad,"Poor management as well as a complete disconnect between upper management and lower management have ruined this company. They have a hard time keeping employees therefore take advantage of the ones who do stick around, overloading them and demanding more than is reasonable for the level of compensation. Timken purchased Purdy corp. and managed to drive the company into the ground in less than a decade."
bad,Old machines to hold tight tolerances. Friends of the boss get held to different standards the others. No respect from upper mangers. Any up grades are for speed and not quality
bad,"I worked here for many years in may roles. I made it through many LAYOFFS that happen regularly every 3-5 years without fail. It used to be a family oriented company and was fun to work alongside my peers. However, over the years it has become a constant competition and battle to keep your job. Worry everyday if today will be the day you get hit. Years of service do not matter. NEPOTISM is rampant. Women are rarely promoted unless they are wives, girlfriends or sisters of the Male management. HR is skewed toward Salaried employees and the hourlys are treated poorly. I have been on both sides of that and know very well the disparagement between the two. There is no room for advancement, top roles are pulled in from CANTON HQ or jobs are outsourced to INDIA and MEXICO. The only way to maintain a professional life in the company is to work 70+ hrs/wk and on holidays/vacations while being willing to  move to another plant around the country anytime. I have done that and will not do it any longer as soon as I find another job."
bad,I have never worked for a company in which management treated the employees so bad. Even the best employees are talked down to and disrespected. For the most part advancement goes to those who are friends with the powers that be and not to those that are qualified.
bad,For a fully competant individual person it is an incredibly difficult work environment with a boss that does not trust any of his group. To have to copy them on every email and involve them in every decision it is impossible to accomplish anything
bad,When you have to watch you back ever minute you at work then it is hard to get your job done honestly I think they are racist also just speaking my mind and in the department I was in the boss was not nothing but a person that told you what first shift wanted him to tell you but he is a good guy. And they have lay-off about every two years over all just not a good place to work in my opinion
bad,"The company changed hands 4 times over the thirty-three years that I worked there. Some companies were better to work for than others. I enjoyed the people I worked with on a day-to-day basis and miss some of them dearly. "
bad,"Worst job experience in my 35 years of management within manufacturing corporations. Disconnected and ineffective corporate management. Ironically, although Timken touts itself as an ethical company, I felt compelled to leave the company because the environment constantly challenged and penalized me for my ethics."
bad,"I've spoken with other former employees before they fired all of IT and shipped the jobs to India, and it was bad before then as well. If you are in IT, this is not a place you want to be if you can avoid it. They are decades behind in their technologies and are perfectly content with staying there. Top level of IT management are always looking for ways to short change everything and you never feel any job security since they've shipped all of their jobs overseas multiple times, only to find out it was a bad idea, then rinse repeat."
bad,"the Timken Company has a great work environment and is well managed. However, they have been downsizing over the past several years and there is not much left. I need a place of security."
bad,basically losing a lot of automotive business in past few years going to more high end bearings which is driving work load way down to 4 8 hr days. no advancement any more (apprenticeship taken away) and for any salary job anymore you have to have atleast a 4year degree. management just flat sucks. supervisors have favorites and supervisors play on internet 4 hours out of 8 hr shift.4 year degree doesn't mean you have common sense to manage daily task. no sick days
bad,"I worked in very strategic and diverse positions during my career of 32 years in which I saved Timken millions of dollars. I invented machines that improved production, decreased cycle times, improved part quality, improved safety, and reduced repetitive motion injuries. I came up with innovative ideas that improved the overall quality of the workplace and created a pleasant work environment and improved moral."
bad,"Management is a joke, they all got there by kissing the old rear end and they dont care about the hard workers just who can kiss the most butt. Its a real wonder they havent closed the doors on the place, thats what all the good employees say! Lies and back stabbing and the rumor mill. Management should quit talking about making bearings and just make bearings! Who wants the ball? WE DOOOOO!!!!!!! Dumb"
bad,"Fun place to work"
bad,"Great place to work some of the best employees that I have worked with,I think they need to judge people by there performance."
bad,This place is a joke. Revolving door new people weekly.  The new people go through 3-4 hours orientation then shoved out to us. Human Resources is a bigger joke a team of Monkeys could do a better job I'm not for sure Monkey's are not running Human Resources here. It is hot as can be in here the water fountains barely work.The fans are so covered in dust they will barely blow. They say they are concerned about the safety but there is no hoist training trip hazards every where. The place is a accident waiting to happen. There are racks everywhere at eye and head level.
bad,I did a lot of walking doing the same stuff I learned and I did my best and I got throw it but I liked it though it wasn't  bad job  and I still learned to how to keep thing clean and how thing a post to be in place
bad,Very Depressing and low Morale Atmosphere. People are pushed to their limits and replaced when they fall apart. Treated with Zero respect and Dignity. Hard Work and Long hours.
bad,Great place to work for if you enjoy making money. Also great people to for and with. If i could i would work full time only there again
bad,ok place to work. then we lost our jobs. Employees were great to work with.
bad,HR dept. there is terrible. Company treats you as a number even though most have been working there 20+ years.
bad,Speaking as a temporary who was trying to get full time the place lies to you. They told me they give you up to 6 months to learn different jobs because you get tested on different things. I only got to work there 2 days and their excuse for letting me go is that I was struggling to learn so that's why I say they lie.
bad,Its a good paying job and its easy depending on where you work. The supervisors are the main cause as to why there have been 3 lay offs within a year. The supervisors will tell the employees to send bad products and then the customer gets mad about it so then the supervisors will come out and yell at the employees for making/sending bad product. No sense of job security.
bad,"Management is bad. Schedule is bad. Business is slow. Smells like metal, oil, and grease all the time.They need better management and more on site training."
bad,They made you work like a dog and made you work every weekend and would only have a day off the management would never help you and if they did they made it seem like it was your fault
bad,Pays decent for being quality. Management is whack. Training is not the best. Long days. A lot of favoritism goes on here and you can really tell. Everyone says it’s a great job but i don’t see how.
bad,"First job I ever had out of high school. It was a hard job. A lot of lifting, pulling, and standing. Not for me. I learned how to assemble and inspect roller bearings and then went to machine operator. Here I learned to operate grinding machines."
bad,How do you work for a company for a year and never get hired after apllying for different possitions then be expected to train people that have been brought in as FULL TIME employees and they have NO experience what so ever.
bad,"Hard workers not recognized or appreciated. Yet at the same time slackers walk and talk in circles all day everyday.and get credit for just showing up ???"
bad,"Hard work, competence, production and quality matter less than being liked by management. Moral is nearing rock bottom as even the most oblivious employees realize how bad things are. There is an almost criminal lack of accountability at any level. Managers cannot discipline lazy employees, etc..."
bad,unrealistic expectation of daily/weekly goals. with out dated machinery . Staff still learning new system thats been in place for the past 3 years and still using manual entry for prediction of order completion.
bad,Had poor management over the last 10 years or more. Care more about $ than anything regardless of what the put their slaves through. Called associates as long as you now down to all their demands and requirements.
bad,"Timken has had several changes in owners over the last several years; however, the management hasn't changed.  Bullying and favoritism are the norm and as there is no accountability for their actions, managers continue to treat employees poorly."
bad,They rush you and expect you to put out high quanity of parts with no regards to quality. Management looks the other way at some peoples mistakes and punishes other people
bad,"The job itself is great. The management turnover is crazy.  With every new manager comes a different way of doing things.  Once that manager leaves, all procedures change again.  Within 3.5 years the shipping / Receiving dept had 5 managers."
bad,It is a high stress environment. The quality protocol depends on promise dates. It wasn't well managed during my employment. Management had an Us vs Them attitude..not coherent with Team work.
bad,Worked on different things everyday. Overall I had great support from my team. Friendly work environment. Great Management.
bad,"I was hired on to work the T-53 side of the shop. Timken lead me to believe that I would be part of a team. When I finally started work, I found myself doing all aspect of the ovehaul process by myself or sometimes with individuals that should not be allow to work on lawnmovers not much less a Lycoming T-53 series turbine engine. Receiving inspections, teardown, cleaning, inspection, overhaul, assembly, and final out. Total work overload. No dedicated QC team. Mechanics inspect there own work."
bad,This was a contract job with witbeing put on new project while the one I was working on was finishing then suddenly let go. h a two year project. Was told I was
bad,"Timken strived for years to make acceptable profit in Automotive business. After a dismal acquisition and several initiatives, changes in leadership, Timken largely exited the automotive business. Wise decision. Has benefitted performance and share price."
bad,Timken doesn’t understand how to treat employees fairly. A lot of stuff gets overlooked and the supervisors have their favorites. Expect to be told that your working the weekend on the Friday before and they’ll tell you that you have to stay over 30 mins to an hour before it’s time to go.
bad,It did provide for my family for the last 20 years. I really enjoyed working with the associates in my department. It was a physically challenging job for me to do daily.
bad,"Expect to be poorly trained by jaded and burned out long term employees who will spend their days badmouthing management and blaming their mistakes on you."
bad,"Management is horrible.  Supervisors are the worst.  Most shouldn't be supervisors at all.  No gratitude for work accomplished... Lots of turn over in management,  hard place to work at or work for."
bad,"Timken is not a stable workplace, not being able to know if you are going to be working 24 or 48 hours until Wednesday of the same week.  Management does not follow up with issues that employees bring to their attention."
bad,Required overtime and an uncaring managerial environment. No thought in to morale or in maintaining equipment. No preventative maintenance. Machines will only be repaired if they can no longer run.
bad,"There are a lot of great people working at Timken Drives LLC. Unfortunately none of this people are in leadership positions. It's been my experience that those who are really good at their jobs are kept there, not advanced while those who fail repeatedly are moved up. They pay you just enough to keep you around but not what you're worth."
bad,"no job security, the company has ha many layoffs over the last decade. when a full crew it was enjoyable. third shift was better then second. better lead and supervisor. culture needs to improve to better fit the needs of the business. they pull jobs off machines for other jobs and then are in a yank for the job they pulled, and complain the scrap rate is too high."
bad,"My first month or two was really good - friendly people, worked with a lot of people who were there 25-30+ years, most the lead seemed nice. "
bad,"A day at Timken is focused on producing a quality product within on time delivery. My work experience focuses on training, quality, inventory management, and working in a team environment. The team environment is aimed at offering an open exchangable working experience. The hardest part of the job would be having an educated background with no chance of career advancement within the organization. The work experience within Timken has given an opportunity to advance my leadership skills, computer skills, and inventory management knowledge."
bad,"I enjoyed the people and the work,once management got it together. There was a lot of long days and no time off,but we pulled together as a team and made it happen. A full 12 hour day was the work day. I learned that family is more important then any amount of money."
bad,"I initially took this job because the pay was pretty good for the type of work you did on a daily basis. Seemed like a very good company to work for initially when I started, but as time progressed I realized how horribly it’s ran. There is 0 accountability for the things management does and it seems as if most Supervisors are incompetent at their job. Supervision seems to be nonexistent on 1st shift, as their the shift with the most senior production employees with the union. Management acts like 1st shift does no wrong, while holding all the other shifts to a double standard on day to day production. A typical day in the plant consists of shift wars between co-workers. Everyday on the off shifts you can expect to be left bad from the previous shift and will spend a good portion of your time cleaning up after their disaster of a mess. Lines and machines seem to go down a lot and maintenance just puts a bandaid on everything. This company seems to have a quick fix mentality, without resolving problems with outdated machinery. The union is big on promoting job security, but that’s only if you’re the more senior employees because they seem to get favored with special treatment. Since May of ‘19 up until the time I was laid off here in January, they’ve been laying people off every 4 months. When you think job security with a union, all that goes out the window once you’re jobless from a layoff. The union and management seems like a two party system in this place with constant clashes and nothing seems to get done, much like our own political system. At times this has also created"
bad,Timken was centered around a certain group of people and if you were not included in that group you did not survive. Managment  catered to certain individuals.
bad,"Poor Management and lack of communication between employer to employees. No set standards, dress code violations overlooked. No sick"
bad,"Recently laid-off due to downturn in the agriculture industry.  HR claimed to use a formula to determine who was laid-off, however, favoritism won over seniority easily. Extremely old style management that was not family style and certainly not what I expected from a company Timken owns.  Slowly becoming corporatized, which can be a good or bad thing and not sure which in this case.  Extremely cliquey with people overly cold and stand-offish at first.  It took awhile for people to open up; there is still the feeling of otherness here.  HR is ultra careful of how they say things so their help is not really help at all.  Still willing to work here, if possible, hoping good things come down the pike."
bad,Typical day at work was same thing day in day out and 0% chances of moving up the corporate ladder. The company could have been better had it have better management. The hardest part of the job was that management never invested in developing its employees and whenever problems where encountered they would take long to be resolved.
bad,"I ran CNC lathes in 2007. I found it interesting and a challenge. I was laid off after six months. The company was much more excited about their new Chinese factory than their Lebanon one. They have no commitment to their American workers, and probably only keep some manufacturing here for government contracts."
bad,"Let me start by saying that I am biased since I was hired by Timken and laid off within three months. Timken relocated me to Lebanon,NH. Everything was great until three months into the job when they decided to lay off the entire front end. 50+ people. The justification was that Aerospace was not making enough money so they wanted corporate to take over all the front end responsibilities in Canton, OH. My first thought was ""Where was the foresight to not hire me when I was first interviewing"". However, it was a decision from the top and they did compensate well with a severance package and gave us six months to find employment elsewhere. My takeaways were that the people where great hardworking individuals; with most having 20+ years of service at Timken. The compensation was fair, relocation was great, severance was great, and culture was fast paced like most manufacturing companies."
bad,"never feeling secure about having a job"
bad,dont work here unless you have prior experience with whatever position you apply for.. they will not properly train you in the area that you are assigned and when they decide you have had enough training they will put you all over the factory on whatever machine they need worked on. And if you haven’t gotten enough training which you most likely won’t well too bad.. I don’t recommend working here unless u have experience and if you do have experience you probably wouldn’t work here cause they pay terrible
bad,Management at Timken is very poorly managed. Makes shifts go against each other and is very hard to work with. They do not take into consideration as to the problems that go in the plant. It is more like a cut throat high school.
bad,"Old school management team focus on people not on problems lose the opportunity to learn every time that we found a problem or qualtiy concern, lack of team work management team promotes dicussions and division among different departments one department want to lead without considering opinions from some others departments"
bad,"Typical day is going into work and doing the same repetitive thing for  hours. The pay is low, but there s a lot of job security"
bad,"200+ degree heat, flying molten metal, management was never around, co-workers paid no attention to other and would cut them off and almost hit them with fork lifts and bobcats"
bad,This place is okay but not idle I hate the favor of that there is over 15 hours of mandatory overtime and you don’t really have a life. Timkin is very aggressive and not so understanding
bad,"Pay is poor to fair. No pay difference according to job held. Logistics and planning is poor at best. Some shift leads are decent, mine was not. If you do an above average job, they will take full advantage and pile on top of you until you break. My particular job was set up to handle 2 1/2 processors. By the time I had had enough, I was trying to keep up with 4. Asked for help for 3 months before realizing it would never come."
bad,"Not a bad place to work, not the greatest either.  Co workers were friendly for the most part.  Management had their favorites.  Company offered decent benefits and activities for the family."
bad,Work hard from the time you come in till the time you leave. Learn how to work a scanner. Management was ok the work  culture was ok. The hardest part was lifting them heavy parts
bad,"Timken in general is a great place to work- corporate really tries its hardest to take care of its employees with good pay, benefits, parties, etc. However, your experience really depends on what division and location you work for."
bad,set up and program big bore and bosch machine maintain house keeping for safe work place
bad,Great organization. I was greeted and integrated adequately. The associates are hardworking and caring individuals. Plenty of room for advancing their HRIS initiatives.
good,Don’t be allergic to products used there or you’re just screwed. Once your placed that’s where you stay. One of the best things here is injury matters most.
good,"I worked at the Lebanon, nh facility for 4 years.  I was an NDT inspector when I left.  I started as a tumble operator and advanced.  Everything was going fine until I started my NDT job.  It was posted as a 2nd shift position but training was on days and it could take a couple of years to put in the required hours to receive your certification, which it did.  I then ended up on 2nd shift, but there was a few retirements coming up on days so I wasn't worried about staying there long because I was the only one on 2nd that wanted days. Then they decided to outsource the retainer department, and with the first retirement they decided to not fill the position.  They then decided that all the people in retainers got first dibs on any job listing in the shop, which meant people that had put their time in on 2nd waiting for days got screwed and people in retainers who were on 2nd got all the dayshift spots. They lost alot of great people who quit after getting screwed by this companies stupid decision. Instead of inconviencing one area they screwed over the rest of the shop.  I realize it was a bad situation for them that their job was being terminated but even if they offered them a 2nd shift job is better than no job.  I would have made the change to provide for my family.  That is why I quit because the nearest opportunity for me to get back on days wasn't for 15 years or more.  Which meant I was going to miss most of my sons life.  I only saw him on weekends!!!!! I even explained this to them when I took the position and they said with the retirements I probably wouldn't even see"
good,Love my co-workers and team leader on 2nd shift. Worked 3 years as a temp before hired. Was hired with benefits and no more pay. No jobs being posted so not looking to advance
good,"worked 6 days a week for 7 months then was told production was going to slow down due to to many parts in inventory,then was told they where doing layoffs and heard they was building a new plant in mexico,,so everyone who put all those years in are out of jobs because Timken decides to move out of the country"
good,"Priductive work place, but clique-ish very similar to high school. If you are in the right group, have a freind or family member in the front office or in management on the floor you can do no wrong. If not, slow limited advancement and pay raises. Clear favoritism, hard work and ability mean less than being liked. No clear path to advancement, or standard."
good,I'm as far as I can go where I'm at and I'm not going to make my 30 years there.  I need a challenge and I'm not getting it where I'm not.  I went through an apprenticeship and graduated from Stark State College in Industrial Engineering. I also served 20 years in the Navy Reserve (retired)
good,As far as their overall benefits package goes it is very attractive.Spent too much time focusing and adjusting employee rules and scheduling.I felt that management was at times to worried that it's employee's might be discussing issues/concerns leading to serious questions about the direction things were going.
good,Starting out It was a good job and there was plenty of work . Now there is no promise of a future at our plant due to laying off and the movement of machines to other plants. Writing on the wall is to find something else before its too late
good,Incompetent management coupled with the good old boy system makes advancement impossible. It's all about who you know and who they are. Company is also suffering huge down swing in the auto market
good,"I was forced out of my second shift which i understand is a regular THING there NOW, my husband was also. Things are so wishy washy there I find it to be VERY unfortunate. I DID plan on making this a long standing place for my work environment, it clearly was not the case with the shift, management and rule changes."
good,"a typical day at work for me consists of nothing but chaos. due to the face that i have to always have to clean up after on employee that management does nothing about, because if they try she reports them that they are pushing her too hard.  in all actuality she is just lazy and doesn't do anything.  so my day is ruined as soon as i walk in the door because i get stuck out in her area and get no additional training to advance in my own department."
good,"The timken that used to offer nice pensions, adequate benefits, and support from a competent management team is no longer the beauty she once was.  Now you get isolating cliques, a bipolar work schedule, and managers who don't even know how to cut on a machine, let alone run/repair one.  However;The pay is good, and some of the best people around work with you. Its a"
good,fun place to work with great people. they pay decent for what is around this town. the hardest part of the job is the constant walking back and forth between machines all day. i love to work overtime but no break for 12 hours is tough
good,"Timken fort scott is a plant that manufactures belts for mowers and such.  There is a lack of accountability and integrity within the management here."
good,"Though Timken is a well respected company, it wasn't the right fit for me.  There is no compassion for workers family life and unexpected issues that come with having a family.  Being the lowest person on the organizational chart, I was given many duties that helped others, it taught me better organizational skills and prioritizing time.  My co-workers were very helpful on the hourly side, but I didn't receive much respect from the salary side since I was an hourly person with salary responsibilities. The most enjoyable part of my job was learning the process of a steel mill and earning respect for the associates that worked on shifts.  It's a very dangerous job, and can be very intense at times."
good,They have a lot of old systems that have yet to be moved over. The culture is a little tough when they are making major cutbacks. I’m not sure what the future holds since there wasn’t much back full happening.
good,"If you golf with the such and such depts manager's sister, you can have a job here. Don't have to be qualified necessarily. The best person for the position is not always given the position. Lots of favoritism and sexism."
good,Une entreprise qui a fermé. Un contexte formateur avant d'aller voir ailleurs
good,"Do Not Work Here If You Want A Life Outside Work, Or Have Little Children You Wish To Spend Time With. This Job is not for the faint of heart, be ready to work every weekend, Staring in January."
good,"The typical  day  at work included  developing the  ETL jobs  to  load the  data  into the  target tables."
good,Timken was a good place to work at.  Had some peaks in work which were related to the agriculture industry.  Was able to pick up and refine some skills in working here.
good,"general official junior responsibilities. faxing, filing, distributing and responding to emails. answering the phone and attending meetings relating to the bearings industry."
good,You weren't rushed to complete assignments. I learned how to drive a standing forklift and was certified. I learned chemicals safety and the etching process of barrons. Management was understanding and easy to talk to and willing to work with you if needed. My co-workers were friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job was working 12 hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was having 4 nights off one week and 3 the next.
good,Plant where I am currently employed is downsizing and I got caught up in the right sizing.
good,"Most but not all old time employees think they are entitled to do whatever they want. Alot of employees have been there for 15 plus years"
good,"I started this job with no experience in grinding or manufacturing and was able to advance to top pay in just a couple of years.  Training is rather minimal however and they tend to rush one onto the job quickly.  "
good,It was a nice environment. A great cafeteria with variety of food stations. They had fun employee events (corn hole championship). However the likely hood of a contractor being hired in is next to nil due to nepotism and inside hiring first.
good,Timken is a good place to work and the people there are very helpful. There is very little supervision and nobody looking over your back while you are working!
good,"can be a great place to work, work life balance dint exist. they want to push you until you are worn out, and then keep pushing. the job us fun. snd exciting the workers seem disgruntled to all people new who comes in new"
good,"The job is fine, long as you pay attention to detail for every order and move at decent pace. Fairly easy.I liked this job but no room for advancement but you will be shuffled a lot."
good,"Valuable learning experience, learned a lot about the industry and the inner workings of the company as well as what is needed to make a plant of this size run"
good,"Work consists of support work and in rotational shifts, mostly night shifts. Very conservative company and do not want to invest in IT up gradation  till it works fine. Learned new work approaches in new platforms. Work place is nice but management will sit on head for any work. hardest part of the job is always travel for 3 hours to come to office and there is no work from home flexibility. Enjoyable part of the job is to have subsidized food and transport."
good,"The company was great and then the teacher's union from California came in and due to greed ruined the company in my opinion.  Also, some members of the OA and Total Rewards teams were unethical and should have been reprimanded not promoted.  Policies and procedures were not consistently enforced.  If you weren't friends with certain people performance evaluations were not based on fact and subjective rankings given."
good,Timken believes in work/family balance and this comes across in the way the employees are treated.  I feel there are many opportunities to make an impact in the company and hard work is recognized.
good,"My work experience with Timken has been a very positive one. The work culture has been one of collaboration and team members doing what it takes to bring forth positive change.  Going to work was enjoyable as you knew you were making a difference and were recognized for your hard work.  However, despite the best work team one could ask for, IT leadership has decided to go a different path and move our jobs to a low cost country. Not due to our performance, but due to budget cuts."
good,Management suck. They run all the good managers out and the ones that are left aren't worth a dime. They show favoritism and are unfair and inconsistent.
good,Very long days with no work. I didnt learn much at all. Machines were to old and outdated . Management was very good . I had good relations with my co-workers.The hardest part of my job was running old cnc lathes .
good,"management was good, the work varied sometimes. it was good to know multible departments."
good,"Sporadic work loads, with very inconsistent days. A lot of required overtime. Very to the books and policies, the company is publicly traded and bottom dollar is the man focus of management."
good,Pretty easy work unfortunately the work environment was very toxic. Not only was the he said she said distracting but also very counter productive. The work itself was pretty easy.
good,Working at timken was a nice experience. Some great people to work with and some great supervisors as well. The down side was not much room to move up the ladder and the feeling of not being able to trust hr with out the fear of personal information being leaked out.
good,Overall Timken was a good company to work for provided you are willing to sacrifice your work life balance.  Alot is expected of you for the better pay but found myself working additional hours in order to keep up.  Ultimately left to find a similar role without the stresses that the company artificially creates.
good,"a typical day at work starts with a meeting for me to know what issues they had on the prior shift and what jobs i will need to accomplish on my shift."
good,"Packing in TS Grind means that one is responsible for the final inspection, as well as the correct packing of bearings. Each assembly line contains different orders each day. Inspection and packaging are to be done in a timely manner. Each shift has its own set of rules. For example; third shift is mainly used to close out orders, therefore, many are expected to be completed on a daily basis."
good,"It was a nice place to work, close to my place. My boss was a very nice person to talk to, didnt feel that i could learn more things in the company, got stucked."
good,"The currently culture is only about the bottom dollar.  If you cannot save them money, they don't want to hear it.  No new innovation currently underway.  Recently moved all of IT over to India and have cut back in almost every department at HQ trying to lower SNA costs.  Raises are low, promotions are far between, and bonuses are sparse.  Suggest getting more up front.  Promotions come easier to those who are well liked by management."
good,"Long hours, fun co-workers, quick paced environment. Hardest part of my job was working all the overtime on top of our original overtime we were scheduled."
good,"Productive and work great with others. Good Team player, help teammate  if they need help. Only missed days if really sick.  I like the work that I were doing. Worked where I were needed."
good,"It has been a mixed experience working here, as the growth prospects are minimum to nil."
good,I have learned many great things while working at Timken. I have been able to experience and learn many different roles.
good,"Experiencia nas tarefas de movimentação de cargas, habilidade com maquinas e equipamentos para a movimentação"
good,"The people are friendly. A typical work day would be to assemble large pitch chains for eight hours. Management is okay, but communication could be better. The hardest part of the job is the wear and tear it puts on your body everyday."
good,This job was a nice job but layoffs are an issue. I was laid off twice within s 2 year stretch. The management does not keep enough work to maintain the workers.
good,"Your pretty much do the same thing day in, day out. Except of course for the setups but even then it got repetitive after about 2 months but overall its an alright place to work. The pay is great. Some of the coworkers are alright. But upper management doesn't know the toes for their fingers"
good,Advancement opportunities available for some positions; mostly for those who have a college education. There is some flexibility with work schedule available.
good,Overall I liked the job a lot and would work for them again but the first shift supervisor that looks over large raw edge is completely unsuited for his job doesn’t keep his guys in line so they run free and do anything they want which results in the screwing over 2nd shift...
good,"Pay/benefits are above average. Work schedule is good when the plant isn't scheduled down due to lack of business. No training opportunities, figure things out on the fly and on your own. Replacement parts are hit and miss, can't maintain any inventory due to costs. Morale is awful."
good,"good people to work with. pay is good. good benefits. good vacation time. work was rewarding, got to work the shift you wanted. good place to start a career."
good,Timken is a good place to work if you are wanting a dead end job.  The pay is good but the beneifits have gone down a lot over the years. Hard to advance with this company.
good,The company does provide many opportunities professional growth. Just don't expect to become more than just another body. After 30 years of service my reward was forced retirement.
good,"Timken did by Purdy, and cut benefits of the company drastically. Cut no insurance and Christmas shutdown. We where laid  off. 30 % of people. But I did learn something from them."
good,I had a great working exsperience at timkin.. Leard how too assemble barrings for trains.. Met and greeted friendlie brothers and sisters.. Also learned how too place rollers in barring cups.. Moved my way up too placing barrings on pallets.. Made one of the award presentation...
good,"Rather uniform work environment with limited background diversity and limited exchange of skills and experiences with the outside world. Conformity may be rewarded above results. Expectations are strongly conditioned by internal culture. On the other hand, sound and widely shared management principles, and an emphasis on internal relationships and individual attention represent opportunities for personal growth and advancement in the organization."
good,"There is too much dust in the air, was expected to work 7 days a week.  No work/life balance.  Unable to advance. Not compensated financially for work that is expected."
good,"People where friendly and helpful. Mostly easy work. Paid well for entry level. You got a lot of hours, but 50 hours are mandatory and you had to work most saturdays for 5+ hours. Only 20 min lunch."
good,It was an good place too work at. There was nothing bad about the job at all. The workers were friendly and very helpful if you had any type of questions.
good,"Good pay, good benefits package, overtime is mandatory Saturday and Sundays a lot. Physically wearing. Management can be immature. If you are a family person it might not get you very much time at home."
good,"Timken has changes over the years and continues to lay off good associates, cut the IT staff. Many of my friends were laid off by Timken. Timken is sending many of their positions to India to reduce their costs."
good,Company was in transition from privately owned to public. Parent company was not a good fit with the business they purchased.New management from Ohio imposed their business philosophy in clumsy manner.
good,"Pay and benefits are great.  There are many opportunities to learn and advance.  Some departments are family friendly while others are not. Some departments support each other while others do not. Despite the benefits, I was overwhelmingly shocked by the cut-throat culture I experienced in one department, which was unsurpassed by any other I have experienced.  In another department I worked in, the associates worked as a team and supported each other 100%.  It is a lottery and if you are lucky enough to enter into a winning team, you will love working here.  If you hire into a cut-throat team, odds are, you will be as unhappy and culture shocked as I was."
good,"When it comes to nurturing of young talents Timken has way far to go. But it is a stable company at making good business decision proftitable for company."
good,"Use it as a stepping stone, nothing more. Descent pay, good people, horrible schedule, poor benefits (and getting worse), out-of-touch management, and they take over half of your vacation for holidays."
good,I was a temporary employee but I was treated like I was a regular employee. I was valued and the work that I performed was appreciated.
good,Good company to work for..Retirement good after so many its at timken..Money to be made with working here...Like the job not so much the travel away from home life...Getting certified a plus in training programs available..
good,A typical day begins at 5:00am and ends at 3:00pm.  We pack bearings all day.  Co-workers are wonderful. The hardest part of the job is lifting heavy bearings.  The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing all the places we send the bearings to - all over the world.
good,Contingent employee with limited experience who did not wish to rate this company at this time.  This should be an optional exercise
good,"very long ago that I worked here, right before the recession hit in 2009. I really cant comment on this business. My short time there all the co-workers and mgmt. were great to work with."
good,"Small town family atmosphere factory competing in a worldwide market that is trying to expand, update, and please corporate."
good,"travail facile à gérer, peu y avoir des problèmes d'entente entres les salariés"
good,The work is challenging. The people I work with are willing to share their knowledge of the parts and processes used to produce high quality parts.
good,Busy all day and I like that.Co-workers complained quite a bit and I didn't like that very much. It is a very complex working environment for employees.
good,"This is an decent place to work, however expect to be a temp for a super long time and business did not look good when I left, 8 hour shifts are a plus though"
good,"Go in and be on job before shift starts, Record everything you do for every minute  of the day. Make sure charts are filled out, Run your job and produce good quality parts. My 18 years and 8 months at Timken has by far been the best job I have had.  I look forward to making a new experience with what I hope is a better place to work. With better benefits. I enjoyed working with my coworkers. And some of the managers have been the best."
good,world class manufacturing and culture is so nice that always empowers you to innovate & challenge the best to set the new benchmark
good,A good company to work for as evidence by a lengthy tenure with the organization.  Colleagues generally very good to work with.
good,very relaxed place to work that had a family feel to it. 3rd shift was the hardest part. interaction with coworkers was the most fun.
good,"•	Pick orders using a hand held RF"
good,"A typical day was busy, my co-workers/management were friendly and very helpful, At first it was particularly hard working with teenagers whom most had learning or bahavioural problems but soon became the most rewarding part of the job."
good,"professional environment"
good,Everyone was nice and work was steady.
good,very productive everybody was easy to get along with. there were times that i didn't have anything to do but most of the there was work
good,Workers are hard working people. Good pay and benefits. Overtime was welcomed and wanted. Good training for lean operating system. Business was good and fell off.
good,"I have learned many things at Timken but I learned most of all things myself. Timken is slow paced place and sometimes a fast paced place to work, but it can be aggravating trying to find someone who can keep up with your output. Many people have been there for years and have become lazy; I do not like working with lazy people."
good,I worked in the back on an assembly line. We priced and packed all inventory for the store. We were paid on production. Not everybody could keep up so that was were the senior assemblyman came in to factor. We had to step in and catch their work up for them.
good,La mondialisation pèse sur l' avenir de certain sites situés en Europe  ce qui affecte l' ambiance quotidienne.
good,The pay is great! Insurance is high! But since they pay u so much they think they own you so they tell you when your going to work. They constantly change shifts around. The 401k is great! Pay is every 2 weeks! Best paying job in this town unless u have a degree.
good,"Typical day starts at 7:30, usually with a few meetings with teams in Asia. Mid morning catching up on emails, followed by more more meeting most of the day solving supply chain issues and executing on the product strategies to drive desired results to the top and bottom lines. Learned from valuable experiences being at world headquarters, and have excellent relationship with most of the executive management team, including group presidents, VPs,a and the CEO. The people are great and supportive, which keeps the joy up in the job."
good,Ok place to work. Nice life-work balance. 45 hours/week expected. Ears for innovation. Good exposure to important customers and government. Overall ok experience.
good,Nice place to work as far as being challenging. Swing shift takes some getting used to. Plant manager is a gem; an awesome personable man.
good,Good place to work. Pay is good and benefits are decent. Management could be better but they do treat you respectfully. Would never leave if they hadn’t cut back on hours.
good,Clock in. Afternoon meeting. Start your shift. Two 20min breaks. Do your work no stress no one on your back. 11 pm clock out. Nice place to work good money. It stinks smell li ke oil.
good,Quick paced line but it’s a experience. Benefits are good and so is pay but not enough for a living. Offers pack training classes to hel you learn you job .
good,Timken isnt a bad place to work but I would try to come in with a Bachelors degree to be able to go places and make a good salary. The worklife balance here is great if you're able to leave your work where it should be.
good,"8 hour days working at the inventory/shipping and receiving department. Standing, lifting, operating heavy lifting machinery.  Very fluid and changing environment adjusting to company production needs and desires. Workplace culture was evolving to a more new age and youth driven community. The hardest part of the job is adjusting to some of the more older soon retiree employees attitudes in the workplace.  The most enjoyable part of the job is comfortability of workplace safety and ethics."
good,"Lots of knowledgeable associates.  "
good,This is the sane as the process control review. I did work at Timken for 9.5 years. However I got credit for 10 years. It was an excellent place to work until they decided to close the plant.
good,"Timken is a good place to start a career. over the past 19 years ive seen many changes, mostly good changes.management as a whole is willing to take your needs to their best interest."
good,Pretty good company to work for. The employees I had working for me makes the experience worth it. The only complaint I might have is that they tend to compensate employees less than what their skills and experience deserve.
good,"The hardest part of the job is working the 12 hours shifts every Thursday, Friday, Saturday and every other Sunday. Missing out on family functions that are held on weekends.  But, the most enjoyable part is having 3 to 4 days off per week."
good,Good place to retire from.good benefits and insurance.  And competitive pay. Management was kinda wishy washy at times but for the part were good about keeping you informed.
good,The work is repetitive and can easily get boring. No over time so there was not much room to make money. Co workers are nice enough but the shifts do not work together to create the best process for the work
good,"It was very productive, ive always finished my work before I went home after I finished. I had a great time working there plus someone always helped me If I had troubble."
good,公司整体还不错，典型的美资企业，有一定压力，薪酬水平在欧美外企中中上水平，培训挺多的，但是几乎没有任何福利。
good,a day my machine broke down n i had nothing to do i joined another operator at his machine n helped while maintainance were working on my machine
good,"I like the work even though it can be dirty. The job is not that hard as long as you pay attention to the training. However there was some misleading information about the job when I started. They had informed me that I was going to be hired on permanent after 3 months. I have been there for 7 months and they are still just looking at my application for permanent hire. I also was informed that moving up was an easy and common thing, but I have been left in the same placement for all 7 months and have on multiple times asked to move to other jobs in the company."
good,"Overal its a good place to work, could be better"
good,"great unemployment pkg with layoff, I would have retired from this employer however suffered a mass lay off during recession. Great hours good training program and good culture"
good,This company operates like it 1950. Plant manager and operations manager is racist and sexist. HR manager will gossip behind your back after you come to him with issues. The supervisors have zero compassion.  I was hired on through a temp agency.....I wish I would have stayed with the agency because timken only treats you like a number... .horrible place
good,"Excelente ambiente laboral, poco personal, sin embargo bajo sueldo"
good,The higher up the ladder you get the more stressful work becomes. Management expects you to do there job. If your in the friends and family program everything will be ok.
good,"Overall Timken is a descent place to work for those who are willing to work consistent overtime (45-55 Hours a week) .  They have decent benefits based on my own experiences from other jobs, including a 401k."
good,building is very clean. same temp year round. 72 degrees no matter what.. Lead people are great other employees willing to help upper mangemant kind of lacking in skills
good,This was a good company to work for. They pay really well but lay off a good bit that is the down side. The people are very friendly. Management is ok.
good,Fast paced with daily challenges. A learning experience from beginning to in. Highly knowledgeable people with years of experience for one who seeks to advance their knowledge.
good,Timken is a good loyal company except for several mid management positions at their Shiloh facility that have been over promoted. These few individuals make working with them very wearing over time.
good,"High ticket volume with low SLA's "
good,"i was a temp, i had to make boxes for the pack department so the orders can be sent out overall the job wasn't bad for a day worth of work i got short breaks"
good,Be ready to work a tough job...I worked the hardest job in the building so that's my experience ...there's many great opportunities within the company
good,good place to work - management has supported me well in my personal growth. Every month will be the hardest time for us as we receive more volume from the bank and huge payments form the customers.
good,I would take boxes off of conveyor line and load onto pallet according to order or carrier... Then follow packing guidelines to verify if it was going overseas or in country then wrap or banned boxes to pallet and put pallets in prestage for loader to pick up and load onto assigned truck
good,"-It was basically a giant machine shop. You stayed busy."
good,"Most employees are very social and helpful. Very laid back but very productive. Mangers openly show favoritism to certain employees. Management approach employees for ideas on safety and quality. Have daily meetings to keep employees informed of upcoming events and quality issues. Starting to eliminate open door policy, must go through 5 people before the person who can fix something hears it."
good,"Machine Operator for gardner machine."
good,I worked in the CHem lab. Quality and quick response was the norm.
good,I enjoy most of the people I work with at Timken.  Its a fast paced work environment but is also a rewarding job.  It is close to my house so that is a plus.
good,They let us work overtime. I had opportunities for advancement. Measuring the product is very tedious because of very small increments. We are on a shift with little supervision.
good,The hours are long but there is lots of downtime depending. The technology should be updated such as getting new machines. Having a work life balance is the most important.
good,It allowed me to raise my daughters and take care of my family. i enjoyed working with my fellow associates. i truly miss the comradely that was part of the daily enviroment.
good,was a hot place to work but it was good pay.learned alot of different jobs over the years.had a couple of good managers over the years.hardest part of the job was the heat in the summer.
good,The worst part about working at timken is the insane amount of mandatory overtime one week followed by the possibility of a temporary layoff due to another department being to slow.
good,"Timken was a great company with a very strong history of producing high quality products.  I was able to refine my sales forecasting skills at Timken and moved through the ranks fairly quick. My role at Timken was not as interesting as the roles at Goodyear, however, the company is a great company to gain valuable industry experience."
good,Was a great place to work but started hiring people with no experience and managers with no knowledge of job. Educated in something besides manufactoring
good,Productive and fum workplace. Someday it's fun to work for timken and some days it's not so fun to work for timken. But you not suppose to be having fun at work you.
good,work and get it done before trucks pull up everybody stress but people ok got to get parts out. but when truck aready there everyone panic management gone home
good,"Great group of team members. Excellent working hours. Was one of the best industries in Pulaski, TN. Unfortunate the company is no longer operational."
good,"The company is great, but management can be considered strict at times. No one wants to be accountable for when things go wrong. Working on the weekends are sometimes required, which makes it hard for workers to spend time with their families."
good,"Great place to cut your teeth as a young engineer."
good,"Good to learn just very long cycle times, which means it can be a bit tedious. Good opportunity to learn new machines. People are very friendly and nice."
good,"There were good & bad people to work with.  Management was easy to work with.  The working conditions were good.  Machinery was in pretty good condition, but wasn't kept up to date very well."
good,Great manufacturing facility.  Great culture and a good group of employees to work with.  Team effort goes a long way at this organization and there is a great degree of tenure.
good,Great work place with good employees. Management needs help with managing and having the needed work available to meet schedule requirements. Workflow is heavy for all in production but can not have the parts available to make schedule in an efficient turn around time. Therefore making the jobs very stressful. The pay is great but not on the same level with other companies of the same product.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of account management of 100 + customers for order entry, maintaining their order book to be in good standing and monitor on-time delivery.  I learned much about Supply Chain Management and how to actively monitor a customer's order book."
good,I enjoyed working at Timken. I feel they treated all employees fair to the best of their ability. My coworkers were friendly and always willing to assist me whenever necessary as well as my supervisors and management.
good,I was in charge of Quality Control and checking parts for discrepancies to make sure the customer was getting the best parts.
good,"Learned much about manufacturing, operations of production, as well as measurement techniques.  Access to restricted computerized blueprints and procedures. Great finesse required to navigate interdepartmental information sharing. Solid friendships formed."
good,Good solid company to work for.  Strong commitment to quality and there's  a strategic push to reach the globe with their products and be competitive.
good,"I was only summer help for two seasons, but the pay and benefits were great.  The work load was the same as any other factory"
good,"Great company, awesome management team. Great co workers awesome environment."
good,Wear your comfy shoes cause theres a lot of walking involved with this company.
good,"Management sucks. Pay is good. Benefits and hours aren't that bad. Lack of fairness from employee to employee. What is Ok for one person isn't OK for another. Micromanaged all day long. Nepotism in full effect- people got jobs bc of who they knew and not educational background and experience. Felt bad for those who were qualified. Manager played favorites, but I guess you can have these instances at any place of employment."
good,"Timken is a good place to work,"
good,Learned The Timken business and products and front ends. Very focus goal oriented on an individual basis. Great incentive is merit pay and raise at the end of year.
good,"Typical day at work would have been keeping track of job order movements and delivery of tooling and jobs to each machine in order of the work order. I learned some CNC and how to read work orders for a machine shop. My co-workers were the best part of working there, they were like one giant family! The hardest part of my job was keeping up with tag placements on the work order board. The most enjoyable part of my job was my interaction with my co-workers."
good,"Build source packets for gov. parts (Certification from vendors)"
good,This job has been fantastic.Everyday is a bit different and there are new challenges. Training is a bit sparse learn as you go. Folks are friendly and helpful.
good,Overall I enjoyed working at Timken. They have high ethical standards and value your contribution.
good,Work shifts are odd from usual work schedules. Very comfortable work environment. Clean and climate controlled work environment.
good,good company to work for. they just have some employees in leadership positions that are prejudice and show favoritism to dishonest employees. they really need to emphasize on the importance of safety. alot of unsafe work being done there.
good,"Timken was a good, good place for work the management team was great, they had lunch for the employees on a regular basics, no matter what was going on they took out time to listen to your concern"
good,"Timken provided me with my first opportunity in the IT world.   I was able to learn a lot of things about the IT world, however my growth stalled in an area that I was reorganized to not of my choosing.  I tried to move to other jobs within Timken however I was blocked each time.   So I left to find other opportunities."
good,"Great place to work, management is flexible with work hours if you have appointments. At least one free lunch a month, they generally are concerned how you are doing."
good,Tinker is a good company to work for only thing they need to pay more in order to keep employees. They have a high turn over bc of salary.  Some supervisors are fair to their employees
good,"Timken is a good, stable company.  It's a great company to work for.  The facility in North Canton is beautiful, and has a great working environment.  Management is sometimes a little rigid, and needs to be more flexible."
good,A good place to work at . You just do your job make sure everything is done and clean properly . Management is very good . You get into the routine of cleaning that everything becomes like 2nd nature.
good,"Everyone is very supportive and willing to help with any questions that arise.  "
good,"This company is a steel company.  They made all types of steel in all sizes.  I enjoyed learning all about the manufacturing process while working along side of the production departments, production control, customer service and purchasing departments."
good,"Was a great place to work back around 2005. Then there wasnt any job security. Coworkers are great people and all are helpful and kind. Made it through 4 company wide layoffs, luckily due to my position and skill set my job was secure at the time. Left on good terms to seek employment that has long term job security. No longer wanted to worry about how much longer the company would survive for."
good,I enjoy working at Timken and have learned a lot but they are closing plant and moving jobs to North Carolina. The co-workers I have are very knowledgeable and good at what they do.
good,"a typical day at work can go by rather easy or can be stressful depending on the work load expected for the day. I learned how to set up machines and to be patient when things don't go the way i planned for them to. The management are good guys, but the way they handled certain things, did not make sense to me along with a lot of my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was trying to get the parts within the desired specifications they needed to be. The most enjoyable part was knowing that I could complete my job no matter what problems I faced."
good,"Steady work with a big local company. Was able to have a great work/home balance. I learStaned a lot on working in a fortune 500 enterprise, and dealing with other departments on a day to day basis."
good,Many changes for this plant while transitioning through tough ecconomic times.  Still the beszt company in our area for compensation and stability.
good,Fast paced work environment with safety as a primary focus followed by producing quality product.
good,A great old-style manufacturing company with good opportunities and reasonably relaxed atmosphere.
good,Shipping and recieving. packaged inventory and transported inventor from plant to plant.
good,I am a team player who works well with all aspects of job. I suggest areas of improvement for my area as well as the plant but usually get unnoticed. Some bosses have noticed but they are now retired. Was recommended by former supervisor for a lead tech job that i didn't even apply for. Strive to get better at my job everyday and open to suggestions from everyone. I designed a How To manual for running all machines in my cell that they use to train new employees. I have learned how a bearing is made from start to finish and realize how the whole operation is run not just my area alone. My biggest thrill is doing the impossible and making it look easy.
good,"Working at a supplier location , so it will be a tough job . So with support it is very easy ..timely happening a different kind of audits and also very well aware for quality"
good,Timken has been around for well over 100 years.  What they do they do great.  What keeps getting added is a steep learning curve.  The people have become less important in the business.
good,"Very Good company to work for but the pay is not up to living increase, "
good,"Timken is a great place to work if you are looking for a long term company. They take care of their own, and promote from within whenever possible. Timken develops its associates to create the best company it can."
good,"I learned Industrial Mathematics and enjoyed the fast paced, team- accountable structure.I also enjoyed their safety-first; quality next, view of production. I didn't get much interaction with management as I was 3rd shift but the encounters I did have, were pleasant and everyone was helpful. I would still be there if they hadn't moved."
good,"Flexibility a plus,some days may be asked to work in various areas based on knowledge,skill set.Always a Supervisor or Lead on the floor in case have questions or need help with work orders,operating equipment,etc."
good,I liked Timken.We did Bearings and packaging. it was a easy job slow paced sometimes and fast paced others.We had 12 hour shifts which was good.......
good,The work is very fast paced and depends on accuracy but my supervisor took plenty of time to teach me. Multitasking is a must and spreadsheets are extremely helpful.
good,I have worked the Timken Company foe 37 years. I've had my ups and downs with them.I have lost seniority that I should not loss because I was overlooked for transfer from bearing to steel. I want to retire. But I need another job to compensate for salary difference.
good,I worked here for several years.  I was able to transition to different areas during my time here.  I hated that this facility was closed after being bought out .
good,"fell other people got more respect and or otherwise was given jobs they did not know or fully understand "
good,Most of the time it is a nice place to work. The people are well trained and very helpful. Managment is professional and work to help you succeed in your job.
good,I will go in and find out what we are running and order what I think we will need that day. And will get our setups for they day and will help my operators run their machines and fix what machines are broken. The best part of the job is when the machines are running good and I have time to talk to my operators and get to know them.
good,"At the Timken Company it all depends on your manager. If your manager is open minded and works with you, your life can be very good. You do your job and mind your own business is the best way to get through a hard working day. Not all people do that however and that goes for everywhere. Not just at the Timken Company. Somehow, though, if a person is a threat to sue the company, they seem to be the people who are safe, because this company is afraid of law suits."
good,"Great run at this location, they say all things must come to a end. Good place to work while it lasted, the associates are off the hook productive with manufacturing and maintenance skills that any employer will be delighted to get. A resume from an associate that was / is employed with TIMKEN is worth a triple take, you can't go wrong."
good,"A typical day at Timken consist of making regular check, entering data into the computer and maintenance of machinery. I learned how to brainstorm and work in a team environment. My co-workers were like family. The hardest part of the job was working third shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with."
good,"Timken is an excellent company in a stage of enhancement and growth. "
good,"I have worked here for 4 and a half years and have been laid off 4 times, two were extended periods of time. I enjoy working outside and most of my fellow employees."
good,In working for Timken I was able to gain knowledge by working closely with production and supporting them daily.  I was able a different industry and the manufacturing behind making bearings.  The manager I reported to was tremendously talented and knew her job and mine in a way that allowed both teaching and mentoring to come into play.  One of the best parts of the job was learning the process of setting standards for the organization.
good,I have no comment.  It paid my bills.  I have no further comment.
good,"Learned how to meet short and long-term goals while overseeing a number of employees. Was able to preform work duties will 'serving a number of masters', working to find which is best suitable for the time allotted."

good,Overall a good place to work. Management philosophies have changed over the years. More focused on non US growth rather than domestic.Tend to want to be middle of the road in benefits and pay. Value a college degree over work experience.
good,bonne équipe meme si le travail à effectuer est difficile (port de charges lourdes)
good,It’s a hard working place. Pays good but I. Was on 12 hour shifts and it hurt my feet bad. Only one 30 minute break throughout my whole shift and U work around oil all day.
good,"Some of the Management changes are a problem, do not want to go into detail but there are conflicts of interest and some ethics problems  Micro manager and loss of trust in some of the team due to lack of communication and HR"
good,Timken is also a good job. The position I held was very taxing on your body. as far as lifting boxes full of bearings and pallets. Its not a bad job its pretty laid back. If you are not in shape I wouldn't recommend going to the banding area.
good,"Working as a security/fire technician there was a predictability to your shift to a degree, but was a fast-paced environment that required quick thinking and teamwork."
good,Timken is an excellent employer and I am proud to have spent close to 13 years in this company. Best place to learn and explore new career paths. Pioneer and one of the best in the bearing and power transmission industry.
good,Great place to work if you like challenges and making the best of car bearing. Great people and staff. Everybody is real friendly and caring. Willing to help out with any problems
good,Timken is professional with great growth potential. Training and mentor programs in place allowed me to learn and ask questions for 6+  months. Continued learning is available if I chose to learn more than I am required. This helps me grow in my job and knowledge.
good,"Things have changed tremendously since 2009, very micro managed by current management.  The average day is extremely busy because most people are doing the work of three people.  There is a huge lack of loyalty to people who have worked there for twenty plus years."
good,very long process of training to learn jobs.. no supervision no maintenance with employees running production with high attention to detail of running equipment with safety first and quality at high alertness.  noone over your back but alot of decision making on production floor being team based environment sharing jobs with co-workers.
good,"Trabajo serio donde se requiere mucha responsabilidad y atencion,ambiente de mucho respeto y compañerismo,aprendi a utilizar sistemas operativos globales y politicas de trabajo extranjeras,la gerencia tenia trato normal y nos informaban y hacian parte de los cambios en la empresa."
good,"I am responsible for ensuring the quality of work produced by the operators meets print requirements. My job is subject but not limited to green machine, grind, heat treat and roll inspection. This job has taught me how to multi-task and prioritize different aspects of my job. The hardest part of my job is helping control the quality that leaves the plant by closely monitoring the operators components they run. The most enjoyable aspect of my job is I have the chance to interact with a variety of people in the plant."
good,My day consist of being a setup/operator on a CNC lathe. I work with tight tolerances and love the challenge of trouble shooting and problem solving. I work very well with others. The most enjoyable part of my job is the pride I have on seeing a finished product.

I have gained knowledge to read blue-prints of steel parts, how to operate grinding machinary and the importance of details. The co-workers were very fun to work with, very helpful and understanding.

good,"Cared about the associates.   Had great benefits, and offered tuition reimbursement.  Very diverse workforce."
good,Timken's was the best place of employment i have experienced.The training process was extensive. Able to transfer to various departments and learn new skills. Great emphasis was placed on interpersonal relations. The difficult part of working at Timken's was the constant need to adjust to weekly swing shifts. Most often we worked as part of a small unit of people that were able to learn each others strengths and thought processes as they related to how to be the most efficient and safe in completing our tasks. The comradery was the most enjoyable part of my experience there. The money is what made the swing shifts endurable.
good,Very good place to work excellent benefits outstanding safety incentives hard work bit worth it I would recommend working here I loved it merry christmas

good,"I worked at Timken as a temp, which is why it didn't last as long as some. But I had the best boss I have ever had there! My team was amazing. We knew how to have fun but we also worked really hard to get things done. It was a lot of learning to work with a team and work with other teams as well. Building is gorgeous. It wasn't as easy decision to leave."
good,Excellent company to work for. Good friendly culture. Very good benefits. Allows for growth. I left the company only because of its location. I live in Metro west Massachusetts.
good,"I thought it was good experience over all, if you have a Timken in your area it could be beneficial to work there, on the other side of that as with any work place there is flaws"
good,"Watching your machines ,checking parts to make sure within standards ,how one department links to another. Management was very helpful people were helpful, when you could not get parts within specs no matter how hard you tried, was when you could help figure out a problem."
good,Start fo the day walk floor with manager know what jobs to be completed on your shift.
good,Timken is a great place to work with great people. I worked third shift for the past two years and the culture and relationship between the people is indescribable. I loved the people more than any place I have ever worked.
good,"Place was fun to work at, great benefits and a good place to advance in the company. Management was over the top safety where they made it harder for the operators to do their job. Supervisor are friendly and experienced."
good,"I enjoyed working at Timken Drives LLC, travel was limited to maybe every 3-6 months. My responsibilities were more involved with the Sales Reps directly, and customers directly as my job was specific to their contracts, I also worked directly with Timken Canada as they started to sell chain. Enjoyed talking to the customers and Sales Reps daily, it broke up the day and made it fly by."
good,"Associates work hard to provide a quality product, but management needs to work with associates instead of dictatorship over them.  Some decisions were poorly made, and not learned from but re-executed again and again."
good,"learned to be part of a team ,problem solver, ,have a positive attitude,eager to learn ,respect others,and their ideas.what I liked most about working at Timken was the distance from my residence."

good,"I was able to experience some great projects while at The Timken Company; from bearings to steel, to HR and payroll. The management was both exacting and supportive. They expected a lot, but they also supported your needs. Their training for their IT associates was excellent and was very individualized. The training period typically lasted 6 month to 9 months. While I finished in 3 months, I was ready for my selection of departments. After training I was provided choices of which department to support. Kudos to them for the great training and experience of awesome projects! The most difficult part of my career there was supporting IT systems requiring on-call after hours and long weekends."

I was responsible for overseeing the general operation of assembly lines to ensure that deadlines and daily quotas were met. Management was great to work with and I enjoyed working with my co-workers. The hardest part of my job was meeting deadlines when product was back-ordered.

We empower, motivate, and inspire our teams and leaders to excel in every aspect of their role."
good,"Management is great. Any problems you may have most of the time can be handled quickly. The work environment is relatively non-stressful, the machines are about the only things that will probably cause any stress if you get a job that can be difficult at times. Average about 15 hours of overtime weekly depending on the department."
good,Many processes are defined and must be followed.  There is little to no new processes.  Job security is high when DoD is healthy and markets are not in recession.
good,Timken is a good company to work for. The pay is good and the work culture is awesome. They do hire felons or people with a background which is by far unheard of but a blessing to those people who are looking for a second chance and the pay is $20/hr +.
good,I worked with all employees and customers to ensure on time delivery. Informed managment of any quality or production issues. On the job continuous education.
good,Company is know for its quality. Haven't worked their in over 30 years but at the time an excellent company. I left because they sent me to Timken Research which I didn't enjoy and was recruited away from them'

good,"Good company to work , lots of clients. This company works a lot of overtime. There have several different shifts to meet your schedule if needed. The over all pays good."
good,I learned a lot from my colleagues at Timken Research. I there was technology there that was cutting edge and there are a lot of smart people at Timken Research.
good,Can be stressful at times but only due to mismanagement. Communication is always a key to success and can be unheard from at times even when at roundtable meeting. Would like them to take our ideas we give them better consideration
good,dock clerk includes cutting bill of lading for truckers and calling to confirm truckers time of pick up. identifying and labeling packages for truckers.
good,Great place to learn about external customer needs and how to solve those demands through Timken products. Excellent training programs for new hires.
good,It has been a few years since I was employed there however at the time I found the work challenging and rewarding. I thoroughly enjoyed my co-workers and supervisory management.
good,"very good job, easy to get a long with people, go in there with no knowledge of what they do and come out with a lot in very little time. the benefits are very good and management is there to help"
good,"To hard,to be promoted due to the hiring of so many family members of other employees overseeing the departments which only benefits certain ones in each department"
good,"Company is financially stable, and a market share leader with a strong brand."
good,"During this time, I was responsible for delivery of a variety of different oil grades to departments within the factory, by forklift truck. Having worked in this area for 22 years, I was required to have specialist knowledge of oil grades within the Engineering Industry. I was also responsible for the planning, checking and calculating of oil quantities, to ensure that stock levels remain at a constant level.

good,I worked in a team environment with little supervision. you were expected to be a multitask employee and you were the maintenance employee. Good insurance policies and 401k benefits. The company had incorporated the 5S program also.
good,I enjoy the pace and the challenge my position offers. The hardest part of my job is there aren't enough hours to do all that needs to be done.
good,"A down economy has everyone focused on controlling cost and generating revenue. A typical day at the plant would begin by reviewing specific process issues that may have popped up overnight which may have slowed or hindering production flow through the plant.  After putting together a plan to address the fires, I would precede working on my assigned engineering projects.  There are only four of us in the engineering group and we try to support all areas of the plant.  Seems there is always a problem with a process or a person needing help and never enough time in the day.  The hardest part of my job is finding enough time to help everyone.  My personality is to never leave someone in need of help when they have truly exhausted all avenues.  Management has generally been supportive, we all are seeing the effects of over burdening.  The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing a project complete working as planned."
good,"My typical day consists of setting up and operating a 5 axis machine tool, with minimal supervision, I communicate details and other necessary information with other associates and management either verbally and through notes that pertain to that particular operation"

good,"Timken offers an individual the opportunity to start a career in machine manufacturing. I liked Timken a lot because of its solid consistent hours, benefits, and pay. Having proved myself at Timken, they sent me to River Vally Community College to be certified in Manual Machining  in hopes that it would help me further advance in my career. Unfortunately some time after that management told me I had to work 3rd shift, being a single father at the time, 3rd shift hours could not work for me. Management was unwilling to work with me on different hours so unfortunately, I had to resign."
good,"good place to work, good co workers, hardest part of the job is not being able to work, not"
good,"Great place to work, good bosses, good co-workers, great benefits and pay. If you had the desire there was always opportunity for advancement."
good,To be able to reach out and help people is a rewarding experience. Sometimes it may be a thank-ful job but in the end it is what is inside of you shows through.
good,Fair pay for a job that’s not very demanding in a friendly environment. Benefits are average and you have to start out on an off shift but overall it’s a good place to work.
good,"Great place to work, lots of intelligent people, will definitely grow in your career. Hard to move up unless you have the right boss who is into developing you."
good,"Good pay, not to stressful,easy but still stay busy job,think was treated fairly.Stay fairly clean except for getting a little grease on hands or cloths."
good,"Timken is a great company to work for. I learned the process of which a tapered cone bearing is made, and it is actually quite interesting. I won't bore you with the long boring details, but here is the process in a nutshell. Raw material is ground and super-heated so it can be molded into the desire size and shape. It then goes to assembly to be completed and inspected before being shipped to the customer."
good,would  show up and get on the line and start work would get a 30 minute brake and than a lunch and than go back to work for the end of the shift
good,Challenging global manufacturing company that is dedicated to making local for local.  Lots of opportunities to explore new products and locations around the world.
good,When employed at Timken Aerospace I worked in the mill department on 4 and 5 axis cnc milling machines. I was directly involved with engineering when a prototype part was out of the normal product we made. I had input as to how to machine and inspect the part. We were able to manufacture parts that a lot of other companies failed at. This was the most enjoyable part of my job.
good,Learned valuable experience in the marketing field working with talented co-workers.
good,"I found working for Timken to be a thoroughly enjoyable experience. Not only because I had significant responsibility to help improve some of their important processes, but because this activity gave me a chance to collaborate with some of the most professional, dedicated, and ethical people I have ever had the privilege to work with throughout my career. The work was exciting, fast paced, and involved processes and products of exceptional quality and value. For me you can't really expect much more."

good,"Swing shift is a downfall, but the money is good as well as the benefits. I did learn many new jobs. Mgt is mgt."
good,"There is a reason they have problems with Unions. They value their suck ups and tattle tales. Timken bearings are usually spot on when it comes to race angles, but really sloppy on their outside diameters. So many made in Romania and China and are out of print standards. They say Timken on them but not made in the USA."
good,Timken is a ok place to work.  But the benefits could  be better.  The company needs better supervisors. An office help. Once it took the workers 3 years to get a raise but they raised our insurance every year.

good,"People are good, "
good,"A global leader in top quality bearing manufacturing."
good,"A typical day at Timken included meeting daily production goals in a manufacturing facility through various departments using precision measuring equipment, CNC machinery, heat treatment, and grinding equipment.  I learned to set up, operate, and troubleshoot grinding machines for the manufacture of bearing components.  Management and production associates ensured that the departments were safe, and orderly through lean practices.  The hardest part of the job could be troubleshooting a machine or trying to meet an expedite deadline, but the most enjoyable part of the job is the pride in knowing that the parts you have produced has been installed in a bridge, airplane, construction equipment or other manufacturing equipment."
good,"I learned that when you treat people with respect, they are much more productive people. The hardest part of job, was the stress that comes from being a front line supervisor."

good,"I started out being an inspector for defected parts and later i moved to receiving specialist where I drove different types of forklifts to preform different job tasks! My management had great confidence in me because I could unload several trucks from the dock, locate the stock and deliver what was needed to the start department! I enjoyed working in the warehouse and meeting different truck drivers and answering any questions they had problems with!"
good,I would go into work and set up my computer with the screen that I would use throughout the day.
good,Timken was the best job ever. Supervisor knew how to talk to ppl and it was. Very good company. Everyone treated everyone with Respect. Also very clean and good food.
good,"Worked there for 12 years really enjoyed the people and management, also great pay and wonderful work environment."

good,"Timken is a great company, BUT, they outsourced their IT to India, laid off most of their team at HQ, and are still learning to cope with the consequences.  To their credit the team in India does a good job, but language and time zones are often a problem - with the effect that IT Customer Service and end-user productivity suffers."
good,"Although only hired as contractor for the duration of three months, I was pleased with the quality of experience. I worked on First Article completions for government builds of helicopter parts/assemblies. I was glad for the experience, and I thank Timken for the opportunity!"
good,I did this job as an Externship for my university while studying Cyber Security. My colleagues were very friendly and easy to get along with. There was always plenty of work to do and I learned a lot of valuable things there.

good,Get to work ahead of time be prepared with all tools and equiment before entering work .Be respectable as reasonable speak and greet to everyone I would think the hardest part is always the beginning.The best part is when you learn your job and become the best at it just suceed.
good,"it's all in your attitude, right? Timken production is not easy. It can be fast paced. The maintenance department can be a hard area to train a new person because of the diverse equipment, but the challenge is what makes it great. It's different everyday. It is never boring in skilled craft and there's always opportunity to build, create and modify."
good,okay place to work. Management needs to be looked at or new management needs to be hired. Do not plan to have any social life if you plan on working here. Made you work over almost every week.

good,"love my coworkers great place to grow benefits are mostly good pay is tolerant "
good,"I enjoyed working at Timken.  I entered with no office experience or skills.  The amount of knowledge I obtained throughout the years is unsurmountable in value. This was hands on learning every day, real life, that I will say was more valuable than a four year degree college program.  I learned office etiquette and working with co-workers, along with direct contact with suppliers.  Working with our Accounting Department, based in India, was a challenge, but also rewarding, assisting them in Invoice Corrections, Supplier Source Records and directing them in correcting improper payments that were improperly received on a purchase order.   I also learned to be a direct contact for suppliers in US and Abroad/Overseas in assisting them on payment issues, and product delivery times. Knowledge learned were computer systems, six legacy systems while learning a companywide SAP system that united this company, ultimately replacing older legacy systems. A typical day started at the gate, and continued throughout the day. Hundreds of emails and phone calls throughout the day.  Saying that, I held many positions and hats with responsibilities: briefly explained in my resume. Juggling many tasks, I learned to rely on my knowledge on which task took precedence over another.  Organizational and communicational skills were extremely important. I learned that this not only helped myself in making my job easier, but it was a must.  Without this skill, productivity is compromised. Management was wonderful. I had the pleasure of working with and getting to know at least six Supervisors while there."

This company is very driven about controls and we are very much supported by the top management  It is much easier to go out in the field and do a great job for the company when you have the support by management.  I enjoy working with my co-workers.  We have a great group of individuals in the Audit Department.  That is important since we could travel together for long time periods of time together.  The hardest part of my job is being away from my family so often but it is also a blessing to come home.  The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting so many different people all over the world.  I'm always learning and my job is always different. The tests may be the same but how I get the results may not be the same.

good,"Some 20+ years ago, I received a job through a temp agency working at Timken in order entry.  I thoroughly enjoyed this position not only because of the people I worked with but also the Management.  They were so understanding and professional.  I then got promoted to Cust Serv Rep.  So in addition to order entry, I got to assist customers in quoting prices, problem resolution, billing issues, etc.  I enjoyed this as well because of the relationships I developed with my customer base but also because I got to work with so many other employees in other departments.  The pay and benefits were terrific!  Honestly I wish I was still employed at Timken.  The only negative about employment at Timken is you have to pass a series of tests before you can be hired.  Since I did not have any typing skills I could not pass that portion of the test."
