rating,review
bad,Poor management and leadership. Low salary compared to other companies in DFW area. No career advancement opportunities which results in high turnovers. BNY Mellon is a job not a career.
bad,"Recruiting will remove you systematically from jobs you apply for (happened to me twice on promotions that I ended up getting). Layoffs are a constant threat, and will happen to almost everyone at some point. If you want job security look elsewhere"
bad,"This is just a stepping stone hopefully for anyone who applies. They have a good training department, but the floor is separated affluent employees in one side, and what they would call “hood” on the other side!"
bad,It was ok but i wouldn't want too work by there at all .The parking is very bad for the people that is not perm .The pay is not really good for all of the work that has too be done .
bad,"the managers gave me no direction or support.  if I did not understand the assignment, the explanation was, ' we all learned by practice'. I asked what is the difference between a fund and a Fund. the managing partners response was, ' well, a find is a fund and a Fund is a Fund.' oh now it's clear!"
bad,Weak management hierarchy. No direction  with only concerns focused on bottomline and their own careers. Management has never understood the meaning of team effort & team building. Most depts. work in silo’s.
bad,"Aggressive atmosphere with very little in the way of encouragement and reward."
bad,"doesn't matter how many years you have been working for the company they have no respect for anyone and the managers only care about themselves, they won't help you to succeed."
bad,"Constant layoffs, ineffective management, high school environment.  No job security.  Seems that someone who accomplishes goals and meets deadlines is just as likely to be let go."
bad,"Ending bureaucracy, too many managers with the clueless job title, too much work stress on client happiness, the company should focus on employee happiness instead. My philosophy is this, if the employee is happy, the company will do well."
bad,There is micro magement there and a ton of layoffs. All perks and events were taken away. There is nothing to work torwards there. Management always rates you unfairly at the end year review so it will be easy to let go of people when its layoff time.
bad,"This company and management is terrible. I would not recommend working here. If you like to be overworked and treated with NO respect, then this is your place."
bad,Not paid fairly. Very little chance of advancement without playing politics game. The people at the top don't care about the people at the bottom. Regret taking the job.
bad,Horrible over worked not enough money. Unprofessional management. They don’t care about their employees especially contractors! Takes 2+ years to become perm
bad,"bad place to work  management is a joke pay is miserable."
bad,"The endorse employee favoritism, corporate bullying and there is a huge conflict of interest when it comes to their work-place ethics counseling for employees with personal ties. I'm not saying the job is racist, but there's not a lot of growth for black men in general."
bad,"Greedy and ruthless. Terrible infrastructure and incredibly behind the times in both technological advances and social/moral realities. I would never do business with BNYM, let alone work there."
bad,"It started out ok but then huge computer problems. They were largely ignored for weeks despite repeated emails to management about them."
bad,don't like the company and will never work for them ever in life. i don't want to talk about this company or give them power that they don't have. they are unprofessional
bad,"if you are looking for  place to grow this not the place for you. .. there is no Work life balance, no compensation Benefits. Job Culture and compensation benefits are not available"
bad,They have laid off over two thirds of the company and shipped overseas. If you enjoy poor training. Micromanaging and impossible work loads apply here.
bad,"I cannot go into details on my time with BNY Mellon, reasons for dismissal was exaggerated. titl is not just my option but what I had heard from others even before I started working there."
bad,Terrible place to work. You are a number and no one cares about you.  You will be thrown under the bus to save someone else.  I don't recommend applying.
bad,The company as a whole is very dysfunctional as upper management has no idea what anyone does or who anyone is. They are more concerned with laying off US based employees and shipping the positions over seas to cut costs. I went from a team of 20 down to 6 with my Manager getting let go. The threat of you being cut next is always there which affects the daily routines.
bad,"From training to daily work. Management said it seemed like I did little to no work while I was here. He told me ""XYZ"" I fulfilled it and 6 months into the job he calls me into a meeting and tells me he can't work with me. Stay away from BNY Mellon Everett Client Service, you wonder why they are hiring."
bad,"HR unresponsive, Computer software sucks, they do not care if you have a Dr appt. They had clubs but they are just a bunch of people trying to look good for the company as your job can be gone at any minute. Mine went to India."
bad,Always under a lot of stress.  Fear of being laid-off all the time. Upper management sees you as a number not a person. Flexible to work from home is always up in the air. Jobs are often relocated. Work 7.5 hours a day but need to work overtime to get job done but overtime is not allowed.
bad,"Poor management. Very political environment with little to no room for advancement.  "
bad,BNY Mellon is an extremely stressful company to work for. The salary is too low for the amount of responsibilities that's required. The company has a high turnover rate.
bad,Temp assignment very stressful no room for advancement or full time employment. Treated temps like second class citizens. Very quick paced. Worked employees through lunch.
bad,"The training?  What a joke!  The four weeks of training that they promised you in the job advertisement? Forget it. It's one week of classroom training and the rest of it is you basically sitting and watching a phone rep take calls for the next week.  Then they throw you to the wolves and make you take calls on your own before you are ready or even have a strong grasp of the material. The training is horrible and sets you up to fail. The managers are nasty. When you go to the managers with questions you get a snarky look or attitude. The guy who who is my manager would always try to belittle me whenever I walked into his office to ask a question. He was always my last resort for asking questions because he would flip it around on me and make me feel about 2 inches tall. I wouldn't have to ask him as many questions if their training program was actually sufficient for the job they hire for.  There are constantly way more calls waiting in queue than there are reps to handle them. The place has very high turnover constantly. People immediately Run for the hills. They never have enough reps in any of their sections to handle the call volume. The only time the managers initiate contact with you is if your using sometime after the call to wrap up a task. If you use any after call the immediately berate you in school do you. If you go away from your desk to go to the restroom, forget it. You'll come back to your desk with five messages asking you where you were and demanding to know why you were away from your desk. I'm an adult, not a child, I'll be damned if someone is going to tell"
bad,"awful, avoid."
bad,"NOTHING TO SAYI wake up every morning pumped to walk into work... sounds cliché, but so true! The culture is unlike any company I've come to work for or interviewed for. Everyone in the Glassdoor community is truly genuine and extremely helpful in all aspects. Upper management will help you focus on your next career steps, in setting up mentorships and having one-on-ones to meet your goals."
bad,"Going into my 7th year with this company. I've watched people that I trained and have been with the company for less time than I have,  advance. Wages are not competitive compared to competitors, The few perks we have are currently being taken away,  such as our one day working from home."
bad,They keep hire people through staffing agency and keep paying the employee max $15 as if I can survive off that!!!! I do not recommend working there unless you are hired directly through BNY Mellon
bad,"Blatant elimination of individuals who are 50+ years old."
bad,Very toxic environment.  CEO trying to get people to quit.  Cutting bonus and work from home.  layoffs non stop. constant stress ..morale at all time low
bad,"technology is from 1999. I utilize a dos based computer system daily. Focus on improving the technology, and focus on keeping the employees that are there happy. there is way too much turnover."
bad,"Was a contractor there to work a long term projected, was blind sided and laid off without any warning. Manager called me into office and told me that due to lack of work, they had to let me go. Even though, i was not the newest contractor there at the time."
bad,"The traning was limited to none. Management team mircro manage. No flexibility and the benefits were average. The staff were spoken to as children, while management back each other up of their wrong doings."
bad,"seriously can't pass up this section. Literally asks me to fill this out every single time i am on here. I don't have nothing to say this company at this time,"
bad,"Worked as a project manager, aligning multiple global work streams and trying to determine what was actually being done. Development management was too hands-off, so developers basically worked on whatever they wanted to, Business Analysts dropped tasks in the middle to work on things requested by the trading desk, no structure, no communication, no team work..."
bad,horrible company to work for. no upward mobility. extremely political environment. pay is below industry standards. no credit or employee appreciation.
bad,I learned a lot about workplace bullying. The company will try to intimidate you to protect its own. I now have PTSD and repetitive stress injuries from this place.
bad,"Zero training given"
bad,"You are extremely busy, but interruptions constantly to train, meetings, classes, and then questioned why something is not done.  Then called in more mtgs about productivity and errors."
bad,"No organized training. No clear job description or responsibilites stated. If you asked questions, management considered it a bad thing and told you so at review time."
bad,Salary is an issue as well as it is almost impossible to move up AND be compensated for your work. If the company would treat employees like family; employees would stay
bad,"H R hides your transfer requests if your current manager doesn't want you to transfer. They take more benefits away each year. No more profit sharing, no more stock gifts, insurance options are a joke, they took holiday pay and weekend pay away, differential for off shifts."
bad,"Low wages, long hours, bad working environment, terrible office"
bad,"My manager collected information on others to blackmail-which is how this person stayed in power.  It was a ruthless organization that often recruited part-time workers and threatened to outsource full time work to India.  BNYM's motto was ""Do More Or Bangalore!""  Of course ""doing more"" never included higher pay.  They did me a favor when they didn't renew my contract."
bad,"There are no checks and balances for management, very few have degrees or management experience and are very unprofessional. They take away more benefits each year than are ever replaced. When I started working for Irving Trust, we had profit sharing, working holidays was voluntary and you were paid overtime for holidays and weekends and shift differential. All of these benefits have been taken away. They do not give employees proper raises or cost of living wages, an employee that has worked 10 years with the company will make less hourly than someone hired a month ago."
bad,"Bad Pay - No room for advancement"
bad,I received no direction from my immediate management. Half the time they didn't know what they wanted at all.  Managers kept changing their minds about what the wanted from one minute to another.
bad,"BNY Mellon allows its managers to gaslight its employees and blame their own deficiencies on the contractors on their team."
bad,"If you value yourself, only use this place as a stepping stone to the next position. They hired from their direct competitors and promote them even if they have less experience than you."
bad,"The first year as an analyst at BNY was great.  I had a fixed schedule and a good work/life balance.  But, as soon as I was promoted to lead that all changed.  There is no fixed schedule and my management was atrocious.  They did not train any of us and only chimed in when an error was made.  They were very hands off in the daily processes and my manager still does not know even the most basic functions of our team.  The worst part is Mellon continues to move jobs from the US to India.  The department is collapsing and senior management is ok with it."
bad,"Very plain working environment.  Upper management sucks, political favoritism. Never consider what the implications are when moving positions to Florida"
bad,"•	Resolved simple to complex out of balance conditions; assisted specialist I and II with escalated, out of balance conditions."
bad,I do not want to work here anymore. I do not recommend working here. It's a mess here. No career opportunity. Slow career growth. Unfriendly coworker.
bad,"BNY Mellon is outsourcing all of their jobs overseas, so seeing all of my colleagues worry about whether they are going to lose their jobs next or have to move to another department because the current one they are in is leaving the States is upsetting. Management does play favorites and every employee knows it. I was not properly trained on certain aspects of my job so whenever I am faced with a problem and I solve it based on how I was trained, I either get in trouble or I am taught a completely different method. There are supervisors in the departments but they don't seem to know the answers to any questions you have. To my understanding, that supervisor should go and find out the answer right? Instead, you have to go and bother the manager to find it out because the supervisor does not know how to do their jobs.  I do not recommend working here unless you want to worry about losing your job."
bad,"Very unprofessional place to work, harassment, favoritism, just a very bad place to work. Also the leadership there is rude, threatening, I will never work there again or recommend it to anyone."
bad,"Mellon was a wonderful company to work for.  Their goal was to be the employer of choice and they succeeded.  Unfortunately, the merger with Bank of New York was not positive for most Mellon employees."
bad,"Highly biased to Indians. Wont hire outsiders in Tech division."
bad,typical day was not knowing how many hours we would work. management was not fair to some employees. Not a enjoyable place to work. I did cross train in customer service
bad,People from north India will be here. Very dominating. No fun at work. Fully job oriented. Don't take care of employees. Over pressure. No hike given at the time of joining
bad,"wouldn't recommend bny mellon to my worst enemy.....NO opportunity for advancement.....POOR pay and raises (if u can actually call them that).....upper management has zero sense of fairness / distributing work load equitably.....solely concerned with hiring former law enforcement friends than hiring those who are willing to work hard for the betterment of the entire group...."
bad,"After 10 years, I would have to re-apply for my part-time job in Pittsburgh, PA. Relocation costs would not have been covered for what was essentially a part time job."
bad,"a typical day at work comprised of taking direction from idiots. they fired me and replaced me with a younger, cheaper incompetent.  management at the bank was clueless"
bad,"With the majority of the work being shipped to India, mass layoffs, horrible demeaning culture, and bold faced lying to their employees, and lack of management, and their largest client leaving, please avoid BNY Mellon.  No FUTURE."
bad,Bad place to work.  Everything is about the bottom line and they'd rather move your job to India then actually train you and back you up.  It's cheaper in India after all.
bad,Our systems are outdated and not user friendly. Management is absent. Compliance is inconsistent. Benefits are a joke and no one is held accountable for doing a poor job and those that excel are never recognized.
bad,Do not waste time working       no advancement     favoritism          if you kiss up to the manager you get promotion   literally             bad parking     some employees have to park off site and be bused in        workload is stressful and draining
bad,Beingit is a great place to work. My supervisor were great and very understanding. There was always something new to learn. I highly recommend working for BNY Mellon.
bad,"At BNYMellon your entire Career is under the control of one person. Sadly it is NOT you. Your direct Manager is solely responsible for your Performance rating, Educational opportunities, and all other aspects of your employment. Even if you have a good manager who you get along with, they are forced to rate even their best employees lower than actual performance. Lots of turnover due to the prevailing culture there. Low uncompetitive wages and lack of advancement are also present. NO HR help for employees. HR exist only to help the corporation and protect against employees. Horrible place to work!!!"
bad,Module Processor - I oversaw handling sensitive checks and cash. I deposited that amount into the correct accounts. Processing the correct check and documentation for that check to the correct account.
bad,"this company is horrible!! only thing good is the parties and when its bad weather they put you in hotels free of charge. The work/home balance is completely terrible. its 70/30 because youre off on weekends but work 8am-8pm and have to deal with customers and managers that are irritating. MAKE FRIENDS!! thats my advice, it makes the day go bye quicker."
bad,The most poorly run company I have ever seen.  Cut throat environment promoted by management.  The only path to advancement is apple polishing.  Worst employer in the city.
bad,would never work there again. nice people working there but the management culture was horrible. treating the employees like expendable assets. never again
bad,"I've worked here for a very long time and while it was once a great place to work, the job culture has changed drastically. They don't care about their employees at all."
bad,"Creative and dedicated I gain a lot of experience at the bank, I also learn new skills and applied my skills to my job and was able to train several co-workers"
bad,The management is not forthright with employees especially as acquisitons occur.  Employee compensation and benefits are lowest level of 'beneficial.'  Very high payroll deduction cost health plans are offered that require extreely high out of pocket expenses before a insurance kicks in.  No employee perks except for spring time ice cream day.  Working for a bank does not provide mch incentive to want to remain with the organization other than the fact that it is better than not being employed at all.
bad,"the people here were very petty and very childish,, they dislike anybody who wants to better themselves and hated the next person that was prettier than them"
bad,"No real training, hostile work environment, low salary, poor benefits.  Positions were being outsourced to India while the company was still hiring."
bad,"The management at Bank of New York Mellon is promoted based upon who they know, not what they can do to actually improve the company.  This creates an environment in which the managers are promoted to ineptitude and knowledgeable employees are demoralized and quit eventually."
bad,"It is not a place for career long-term investment. "
bad,Never had a permanent job as I was only in training for six months and still never got a permanent job after that. Training was hard but very knowledgeable
bad,The environment I worked in was not great. People often made crude comments about female customers. The salary was not sufficient for the amount of hours worked.
bad,This company is very political.  If the managers like you then you have a shot.  I worked there for almost fifteen years and as let go because I made a mistake.  They are in a lay off status and will get rid of you any way they can.  They do not look out for the employees but only for the company.  The pay is low for the work being done.  The benefits suck.
bad,Sit at computer terminal all day.  No communication with people. They herd you in like cattle and then they herd you out at the end of the day.
bad,"I was at BNY Mellon on contractual basis. They have a job portal, and I don't know their process of selection, because I have been using their portal for quite a few years, and just received 2 interviews. Their work culture is also radically different from JP or DB or BoA. Pretty relaxed, though there does not seem to be an urgency to get work done."
bad,"A typical day at BNY Mellon would be described as working in a very high paced environment, high expectations and very long  hours.  It's a very stressful environment with a poor work life balance.  If you have a family or children, plan on never being home in the evenings.  I have seen numerous layoffs over the years, with no replacements which creates unrealistic expectations on employees.  Employees are not valued.  I have happily left this place behind."
bad,"This company has a  horrible work life balance and you are expected to work 12 hours or more a day.  The pay is not great or competitive.  They continue to outsource positions and continue to lay people off with no regard for their livelihood.  There is no job security here.  If you have other options or better offers, don't give this company a second thought."
bad,"little training, expected to know all, unfriendly people, low pay very stressful.  This job caused me a heart attack these people do NOT listen to you or give you a chance to learn the job.  Very critical cannot make one mistake in a typical day."
bad,"typical day lots of unnecessary non sense and gossip. no concept for personal or medical problems. nothing else to say, trying not to be negative."
bad,very little pay with no rewards.  micro managers and no overtime.  suggestions are never taken and there is definitely a big divide where  managers are on a different level then employees.
bad,Run away from this company. Resources are viewed as commodities to be discarded like last weeks newspaper so management can get their exorbitant perks!
bad,"BNY Mellon purchased our group in 2009.  We were all very excited to join BNY Mellon as it was a more suitable company for what we did.  That sentiment changed very quickly when we realized that BNY Mellon was not a good place to work.  The company cares very little for it's employees. It has one of the worst employee ratings and was voted one of the worst places to work.   Management cares for only one thing - themselves.  The employees of the division that I worked for were some of the best people.  All of these great employees are now gone.  BNY Mellon, at the time, did layoffs almost every 6 months.  These layoffs were based upon one thing - money.  Since most of the best employees were well paid that meant all of the good employees were gone within 3 years.   What is left at BNY Mellon are low paid, no imagination, and some of the nasty people you will work with."
bad,"Its totally Desi type company. very bad experience and no one is caring for employees. No training, first day only they expect result from you"
bad,Co-workers aren't an issue but management is. They treat employees like the don't matter and yell at them as if they are children. They give friends and family raises an promotion and those who earned and deserve it get nothing. Literally the worst job i have ever had
bad,Smith Barney at the time I worked as a Consultant they did not have a structured plan for US.  They rely on Outsourcing direction to do the job.  Very poor design from India
bad,"I work for 3 years , I open mails for retail some times I helped for wholesale when they are busy I like my job its nice a place to work I have to awards gifts , I left this job by personal problem."
bad,laid back job make sure you dont want for anything when  i was pregnate they let me take five months off mangement is ok i guess
bad,"If you are not an officer, you get treated like trash.  I had a manager who was a nightmare.  I hope that he gets it all back one day."
bad,There is no room for GROWTH. Plenty of talk but no regard for work life balance (in the technology sector). Indian Culture.
bad,"Pay rate should be much higher considering the amount of work done on a daily bases. Great employees, however,management makes the environment unpleasant to work in."
bad,"Avoid working here unless you really need the money badly.. someone should investigate this place. It's a sweat shop. The manager was over looking on a lot of peoples mistake that were in her circle, everyone else had to suffer."
bad,I was in the 529 Processing division.  I worked wayyyy too many hours for not enough pay.  I would strongly recommend you ask a current employee how many hours a week they put in.
bad,"Currently working in the daily operations group. been here for two years and looking to move on and see what else is out there. the hardest part of my job is i work with an inconsistent team that dont give there 110 percent always calling out, huge turn over with about 15 people leaving the company last year. the only thing i have enjoyed about working here is the schedule it has been good so far and the commute is not bad at all. but i need to eventually move on and do something more challenging job wise."
bad,"I work with pleasent people,  My job I come in complete cash avails/cash recs, calculate expenses, and all pricing activities"
bad,"If you take pride in your work, like to work hard to be better, or tackle  challenges head on and solve problems then this is NOT the place for you.  Management does not like to fix problems or strive to be great.  Compensation/benefits are poor as well."
bad,"Hi,"
bad,The Job was ok. Things just didn't work out so I found a better opportunity.
bad,"-Senior employees were required to know all processes and worked    various processes daily"
bad,"13 years of poor upper management and expect to be stabbed in the back on a daily basis.  Upper management took credit for all improvements recommended to improve systems operations.  Bonuses were a laugh, and merit increases were worth refusing."
bad,Its a nice place to start a good career and work your way up in life.
bad,BNY is the worst company to work for in PGh.  All mgmt. is out of town and never has time to help on anything.
bad,"-Niether HR or management will work with you to create a career growth plan"
bad,"learned many things, was able to use my skills and experience as necessary"
bad,"This was probably the worst job I have ever had. Wasn't trained properly, no regular desk, first come first serve, no drinks at your desk, no talking, managers don't want to help."
bad,"No one at this company knows what's going on.  Best review I've seen on BNYM was, ""This is where careers go to die"", this is 100% correct."
bad,"Do not work here, extremely uncompetitive pay, no opportunity for advancement. Nearly 75% of staff are currently looking for new employment. Management is ineffective and do not care about employees. No work life balance at all. Would rather work at wawa. Very similar pay and bonus structure anyway. "
bad,"This is a place to come, get whats needed; i,e new title, education and then go."
bad,"Ever since the merger with Mellon Bank, it's been going down hill."
bad,Which was total BS. There was NO training in my dept. Granted the work was so dry and easy that a chimp could do it. No orientation.
bad,"Unprofessional management, the inmates run the shop"
bad,"Worst place ever. Pay sucks, but if you suck up and smoke with your managers and buy them ice coffees you will be promoted even though you don't know anything. Seen it happen twice now"
bad,I did not enjoy the work enviroment at BNY Mellon. The Management were very disorginized and they did not thoughly explain the tasks I had to complete.
bad,"I've never worked at a place where I felt like a slave, undervalued, underpayed and treated not as a person but only in terms of numbers. This job was not for me, I'm used to working indepently and not having to have someone watch me like a hawk! Terrible job, and working envionment!"
bad,You are under paid and overworked. Lowest paying job I ever had working in an office!!!
bad,"BNY is probably the most unorganized company I have ever worked for. They do not give you the proper tools or training to help you succeed. If anything, I think this place sets you up for failure. They lay off hundreds and thousands of people every few months, just to hire new people and lay them off as well. I heard a lot of negativity about this company before I started working here but I decided to find out for myself. Unfortunately everything I heard was true... and then some! I would not recommend anyone I know to work here"
bad,"Your only 15 minute break is taken away on business needs. "
bad,"Pay and benefits not up to current market standards, the supervisors and above are not qualified for the position they hold.  It's worse than working in retail, and that's bad...   Avoid working there if you can, way to much drama and unwanted stress.   Alot of jobs leaving the US and going to other countries go avoid paying a living wage, gets worse year after year."
bad,"So, I was hired by my recruiter to work here as a Data Entry Clerk. I had never worked in the field of Finance before, and so I thought I'd receive comprehensive training. I had pretty much seen the writing on the wall on my first day. The woman who was supposed to train me, was out sick. The woman with whom I was assigned to work, was less-than-thrilled. She even IM'ed this nasty assistant manager that she ""didn't feel like dealing with me today."" My manager dumped this responsibility on her, and she had a family crisis that day. I actually had to say to her, ""It's pretty clear you don't want to train me today, so I'll go sit with someone else."" And that was pretty much my experience for six weeks."
bad,Instead of promoting the employees who know their craft cold and put in the time they rather hire outside the company because they fit a certain image even if they are incompetent and couldn't lead their way out of a wet paper bag. You can count the people who are not white in management positions on your hand. If you are looking for career growth and opportunity to advance don't come here. If you are looking to paint roses red for 10 years then get promoted to painting them yellow for another 10 then BNY Mellon is for you.
bad,Do not work for this company if you plan on staying long-term. Your job would 100% no doubt be moved overseas. This company does not reward loyalty.  The company that hired me (PNC Bank) was the complete OPPOSITE. They valued American workers and were a good company and good atmosphere to work in.
bad,"Upon being hired, I was laid off after 8 weeks of work. My manager worked at another location. I was treated like a child and micromanaged. Zero training methods. Total lack of respect. Total inflexibility in work schedule. Do not work here if you are young and experienced. You will be treated like you are a child."
bad,"I caution anyone from joining this company. I was lied to about job role. I am a senior person in my discipline and they had me performing administrative tasks. When I asked about it I was told once you complete to my satisfaction, then maybe I will allow you more professional work. Unprofessional and unorganized project delivery. People will clock watch and count how many times you go to the bathroom. No introduction into project or tasks, I was told on my 10 day that I haven't mastered the position. "
bad,"You will not be given much autonomy in your job, there are frequent layoffs, you will be required to work holidays to cover as a skeleton staff.  You will have promotions rescinded, there is not much room for merit based increases.  It is best used as a stepping stone or to utilize as a way to pay for grad school."
bad,"Lacks career advancement opportunities, lacks career training, lacks family/work/life balance, lacks management focus, poor management, unrealistic expectations."
bad,"BNYM has to be one of the worst places I’ve ever worked .  Bullying is rife and allowed to happen regardless if you have a disability, which I have.  I’ve met some amazing lovely ppl there, but sadly most of them have left."
bad,"Horrible place to work, senior management have poor people management skill, many will simply not survive in the real world.Everyone is either Manging Director, Director or Vice President, a case of too many chiefs."
bad,"I have interviewed for multiple positions within Bny. Just to get no offers, no feedback on how I did, just constant interviews. I feel as although I should quit soon."
bad,"If you want to be just a number in a big company and constantly worried about your job being outsourced to Pune or made redundant to cut costs because they cannot generate new revenue, then BoNY is the company for you.  New CEO seriously damaging morale.  He is driving the forced raking for performance (10% Below Expectations), sending the message to the solid performers getting the work completed each day completely and accurately that you either need to get promoted or you are out the door.  Managers struggling to come up with rationale to get 10% BEs for people who have achieved their goals, should lead to some good legal challenges from the employees getting the shaft.  In my 25 years of professional experience, working for many great companies, I have never seen a company purposefully drive away the best of the best employees as they are disgusted with how their co-workers are treated.  With the shortage of Talent, these folks can go anywhere and it does not seem like BNY even cares... Shame"
bad,"Over ten years I've watched top-notch workers, colleagues and friends, deviously laid off just short of retirement, and many other similar examples. Human resources are treated like cattle, environment of paranoia and encouraged backstabbing. Performance measurement grossly slanted because performance has actually nothing to do with ratings as low ratings have mandated quotas. "
bad,Middle management is the problem. You are not listened to or backed up. If you want to learn how not to manage go there and see for yourself. You will see for yourself
bad,Management does not care about it's employees.  Totally unfair and if you're not a part of the elite cliques you don't stand a chance.  They don't care if you have a medical issue that might hinder your performance you will be dealt with harshly.
bad,Most of the people were great.  I never had any problems with management but the overall direction of the company was not great.  Not much room for growth or advancement and the pay is terrible.  The workload is very uneven and they will continue overload you if you continue to pump out the work
bad,If you are a go getter...give and do everything plus more you are not recognized in appreciation nor compensation.  There are many idiots in management positions.
bad,Very streeful and lack of recognition.  Work a lot of hours but management not recognize how much hard work their employees are.  Rather promote from outside then within
bad,The Tech department is basically an Indian sweat shop. The people who work there only speak Indian languages and shut door on non Indians and treat like dirt.
bad,Have to work holidays which is not great for people with families. Management is very disorganized. They don't know who is capable of doing their job duties. Usually find one good person and dump work on them.
bad,"Don't work here if you need to advance your professional life, you better of work in  Mc Donald  or Burlington..stay away...Don't work here,,managers are very disrespectful and you don't get any support from the human resources office..Don't do it.."
bad,Underpaid for role as is the case for most jobs.  There was a huge disparity once the higher levels were reached.  Some managers were only making a few thousand more than their reports.   No room for advancement.  Management is resistant to change.
bad,"Once in a position, not much mobility.  Was moved 4 times in department to learn whole area over a 3 year period.  Too many chiefs and not enough Indians working."
bad,Poor management supervisors talk to you crazy doesn't respect you the training is horrible they rush it you only get one day of the training Then they will throw you out on the floor  expecting you to know it all then they get mad when You're asking questions or asking  for help  they won't let you park on the premises the security will get your car towed if you park there all of is bs they don't know how to treat people what so ever....
bad,Unprofessional environment. They hire and fire anybody. Not a safe environment. You cant even park on the parking lot unless you are a permanent. And if you are temp to park around the building. You have to have at least 4-5 ppl to car pool.
bad,"Reward system worst ever experienced, inhouse referral system just a route to recruit buddies, no advancement unless you a member of the ""club"""
bad,"This is a very difficult company to work for. There is quite a bit of red tape in trying to accomplish anything. There are so many departments within the company that you can never get a straight answer on questions. It's always ""that other departments"" responsibility. The helpdesk is based overseas and trying to get assistance with anything technical is a nightmare. They are only concerned with closing tickets and making sure their queue is cleared. Pay increases are horrible. Extra work is thrown onto employees with no thought and everything is ""it needs to be done now"" because everyone is so unorganized. Employee morale is very low so of course turnover is extremely high."
bad,There are really no words.  It is just a very sad place to work.
bad,"The Bank of NY Mellon is an okay place to begin one's career, however you have to be employed there for 20 years before you can advance to the next position. The pay is semi-monthly and is not enough for all the work that is required of you to do. Sometimes you are not paid for the work you do there and you have to do work on your own ""free time"" without compensation. Not a great place to work at all, would not recommend it."
bad,As a contract worker. They were not very accomodating you always were made to feel like an outsider. The Relationship Manager was not accessible if you had questions on the actual task given. Everything was pretty much left up to the individual no actual training you had to learn the systems basically on your own.
bad,"They repeatedly treat their employees like dirt! These idiots want me to say more????? I'll say more! They must work for BNY! The way a company treats its employees is all that needs to be said! Next to that, everything else about them is trivial!"
bad,Workers were pressured and mistreated in my opinion. Not a lot of support for complex financial structured products and have to be patient dealing with folks in India quite often.
bad,There were a lot of layoffs which typically happened every quarter since most of the processes were moved offshore. Might be good for one year to gain some office experience but not a long term gig.
bad,This company is undergoing constant change.  There are frequent layoffs and no job stability.  Jobs are pushed to Pittsburgh and other offshore locations (India)
bad,"Hubris, Survivalism, Silos, ""It is what it is"": That's what I remember from working there. It was a tale of two banks where people made great money doing important work in NYC, and everyone else was a cog with zero value as professionals. The biggest mistake I made in my career was giving them another year when I realized it. Longterm career liability. Enjoy the 1-3% increases each year ONLY, because that's what most junior and midlevel employees received when I worked there. I left and immediately received accolades from my new managers, was constantly promoted. This is a quick review, but ultimately I yielded no benefit from recruiters for having worked there and gained so much when I left. Dodged a bullet frankly."
bad,"This place has undergone so many changes, it's difficult to pick a starting point."
bad,"This is a dead end job on all levels -- even at the CEO level.  They have the market cornered on H1B visas and therefore, can pay US based employees the bargain basement wages.  Nepotism is alive and well in this company as well.  They do not offer perks most companies give as standard.  They yanked work from home until they made it into the news.  This company is a joke."
bad,"Very bad work / Life balance 17 hr work days and calling you in on Holidays."
bad,"During my two years at BNY Mellon, I’ve witnessed how favoritism takes more place than your performance. Especially our VP of BTS department promoted people who are close with him and increase their wages. I also realized that managers were doing the same favoritism. My bachelors degree worth nothing!! Stay away from bts department!!"
bad,"The environment is horrible. The Managers talk to you crazy with no respect. You have to call HR to get something done. Feels like you are working in a prison. Terrible. They don't formally train you and expect you to know your position. BNY does not care about their employees well being, as long as the  numbers are being met."
bad,Bnymellon needs an entire leadership staff makeover many of the older leaders close their eyes to issues when it involves people they favor. There's the lack of understanding common management and leadership principles. Barriers are in place to prevent you from advancement regardless or you experience and education level at least for some. Many like me accept competitive outside offers.
bad,"the saying ""you quit your manager before you quit your job"" is personified at BNY. management are a joke. the culture is who can we blame, they don't want a cure for the toxic management but rather see who they can blame."
bad,"I was initially promised that I would have a team of 10 in order to support the business but that never happened. Essentially I was set up for failure from the start. My first manager recognized achievements but when there were problems, he wouldn’t care anymore about work-life balance; if you worked all night, he still expected you to be there in the early morning, instead of giving you a little more time to recover. My second boss, I was asking for help constantly, he was never answering nor acknowledging my requests; I kept on telling him I needed more people to help but didn’t get anything from him. The line of business manager treated information technology employees very rudely. It was the worst decision I’ve ever made to work for the Bank of New York Mellon."
bad,"If you are a hard worker and heavily depended on, you are rewarded with more work, no financial compensation and no chance for advancement. You are stuck. Also, family and friends of mgmt have better chances to move up despite experience or work ethic than someone who works harder and is more qualified."
bad,Management is trying to hire expendable contract workers to barely cover the workload without proper guidance on training. Lack of transparency and the desire to shift operations overseas has been trending so each year there are expense cuts and massive layoffs.
bad,"A lot of layoffs happening. "
bad,"Morale is at an all-time low with constant fear of layoffs. Chat boards tell the real story, especially at thelayoff. Read closely on glassdoor and you can easily spot the planted reviews. Avoid at all costs."
bad,The management was horrible it was favoritism at the job so you have to kiss behind to get help. So by that being said you take it how you want it and make the best out of it
bad,"The prevailing sentiment among BNYM employees currently is that the management team, starting at the top of the  food chain, has no empathy for employees. Many top execs have been brought on over the past couple of years (and at  much higher compensation than the previous regime). At the same time, extensive layoffs have been underway that include mostly long term and productive employees. Morale is at an all time low and employees feel that they are viewed only as financial assets that can be cut at a whim without considering the value that those people bring to the firm.  Instead of leadership pulling the employees together towards a common goal, there is almost an ""us vs them"" vibe between management and employees."
bad,"One of the worst companies for which I have ever worked. Not only did BNY-Mellon outsource my department, the made the outgoing employees train their foreign replacements."
bad,It's a ok company it's all about likes .....u have to watch everybody u are there to work they need better supervisors because the ones they have is aweful....
bad,"My experience with this company was absolutely awful as a contract temp working here. My two women supervisors we're always down my throat and had so much attitude. Very unprofessional there most are probably uneducated and try to exile scholars using it as a stepping stone. There was an elephant in the room of the company which is very low morale between managers and workers, treating the assistants like nobodies. I happened to get fired for no reason whatsoever, and I never even found out why. Terrible feminism going on there with power trips. I would recommend for anyone not to ever waste they're time with a bad company like this that are too stupid to realize that they control they're own turnover rate and clearly don't think it's a problem. If there was better management it would be a much better environment."
bad,Worked in the Brentwood office for  7+ years - absolutely dreadful place to work! Management dire & overall culture less than desireable. Could not wait to be made redundant.
bad,"work ethic needs to improve . and overall it is not a place anyone wants to work at, this includes the management or other employees, i mean that it looks like that they hate their job and are forces to work there as they do not have any other option"
bad,Poor management in Pittsburgh office. A typical day at work is 10-12 hours with heavy overtime with no advance notice. Team leaders mistreat teammates for personal gain. No accountability for toxic language/behaviors by team leaders and some VPs.
bad,Lack of decision-making will or ability across the organisation. A lot of senior managers with very long tenures who just want to hold on to their little empires.
bad,"Workplace is horrible not professional, poor management structure, treated temps like we were not worthy to be working there.   Working environment was like working at a factory. Noisy people visiting like it's a  high school  need  allot of improvement overall ."
bad,I worked for this company for 6 months. I over achieved all the company's daily goals. It was told to me that they were on a hiring freeze and never spoke to us since about fulltime positions. It was several employees that was under contract for over a year. It is an unstable and poorly managed business.
bad,"Rude people, rude culture, unrealistic expectations of employees.  Managers tend to rest on work of employees to meet their goals and do not credit the employees, but rather - take the credit.  No action taken when there is a conflict between employees - no resolution is offered.  Upper management do not speak to lower employees and it is very high-school in the building.  One of the worst job experiences I've ever had."
bad,"This company has a broken culture that is not professional or team oriented.   Micro-management and bullying are rampant and there are cliques everywhere.   I would never recommend this place to work for anyone.   It used to be an honorable, well run company but since the merger with Bank of New York it has become a cut-throat, hostile place.   The management talks the talk but does not walk the talk."
bad,"A typical day at work involves client service. I learned a lot about the industry. Management is poor, with little or no direction from the top. Workplace culture involves micromanagement and poor direction. The hardest part of the job is finding helpful contacts. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting an issue resolved."
bad,"I worked here about two years ago, the work was fine. It was simple enough however the night management was terrible. Made for a hostile work environment. Also, the rules were too demanding of workers. Forced overtime."
bad,"I enjoyed my co workers, meet a lot of good, hardworking team members, that just don't have a chance with Management HOUSTON location.  MGMT are TERRIBLE"
bad,It is a very good place if you are just looking to gain a little experience for your future.   The Senior Manager should be honest with the employees and not lie to them about their future with the organization.  The company should offer more growth potential to its employees.
bad,was een leuk bedrijf maar vanwege veel redenen is het niet een plek waar men wil werken om gezond en gelukkig te blijven
bad,"Not much room for advancement. Pay is not competitive."
bad,"My reason for leaving was the lack of enforcement when it came to people who were related working together. They allowed it for several months while I was there. At BNY Mellon, there is a married couple that is and has been working there since I had started. As far as I know they are still there, but other relatives have been fired simply for being related. This company is hypocritical and contradictory."
bad,the people come to work and they work like on the assembly. Some departments are more professional than others. As with everything in life there should be research and weigh other offers.
bad,"The Asset Management Operations team of executives does not value or attempt to retain existing workers.  Payroll kept low by hiring new workers directly from college.  Once they are trained and working well, they face limited chances of advancement or salary increases.  Morale remains low, as workers realize their productivity will not be matched by recognition or compensation.  The teams do support each other, for they wish to retain their job until they can move on.  Established professionals hired from outside are given take it or leave it offers."
bad,Chicago site management and supervision is the worst very unprofessional and care nothing about the employees. Everything is based on company need regardless of the employees situation they may be having with other life responsibilities other then the job. The rules are very unfair also. Chicago site also is very diverse but the management isn't specially with the African Americans.
bad,"It is not a pleasant place to work, they say they care about there employees, but I do not believe they really do. The work I did was fairly easy I did originally like management some of my coworkers are okay there was no real hard part of my job."
bad,Only work here for a short time if you are desperate. Stay no longer thank two years. There is very little room for advancement it is really a dead end job.
bad,"The Bank of New York Mellon Alternative Investment Services is a highly undesirable place to work.  The Wilmington, DE location is characterized by unqualified staff, highly incompetent and unsupportive management, archaic technology / platforms, a culture of negativity, uncompetitive compensation and impossible workloads."
bad,"The best thing about this place is the hours because there's very few A-type personalities here (so if you are one of these, you will hate it, trust me) so people are more concerned about face time than anything- reflective of the antiquated culture that dominates.  The pay is among the worst  in banking, and there is little job security as they make regular cuts like a bulge bracket.  The bonus is also one of the worst unless you are senior management (EVP and up - although there is no job security here, either). The culture is super conservative and you will work with/for mostly white men in their 40s and up if you are in any type of front office role. There is also a very ingrained hierarchy here, so I've seen really talented people overlooked just because of age or lack of experience- and then they leave and become superstars at real banks with real managers. I don't know very many people at mid-level careers who succeed here, but I know all too many who have left and become extremely successful elsewhere, which just goes to show what you're dealing with at BNY, and lack of leadership overall. that said, I would definitely retire here; workload is so light for a senior manager, you can easily coast into retirement just by being likable."
bad,I miss working at Mellon Bank that was the best job that I ever had. I wish that my department was still there. I would recommend this job to anyone. But it's no longer there the people were nice all the departments were fun to work with.
bad,"This place has a huge offshore component. The atmosphere is not conducive of growth or learning. They are more concerned about assigning blame than working to solve the problem. Asking questions is frowned upon. "
bad,No room for upward mobility. Compensation for this role is low compared to competitors.
bad,"I have moved from a couple of different positions, including Business Analysis and Software Development.  People in the pittsburgh area are nice to work with, but currently the push to globalize has made the environment much more stressful"
bad,There is a lot of micro management and favortism. I would not recommend this company to anyone. Co-workers work hard but only favorites get rewarded.
bad,"Uncompetitive pay, impossible to get promoted, horrible management."
bad,"The company has lost track what really matters, its employees. Compensation is very meager, management doesn't recognize good work. They seem to favor ""yes men"" and those who fall in line but overall have no clue about the job itself. Doing a good job gets one nowhere except more work. There is no chance of recognition, managements way of rewarding workers is through jeans days and allowing to work from home. No bonuses, no extra incentives for a job well done, yearly raises are 1.5% or less. They let go quality individuals and keep the poor performers. I've been there long enough to see it go from a place where I want to go to just being a pay check. Very bad atmosphere to work in, everyone is miserable."
bad,worst wok environment that i have ever been in! drones leading drones...desperately poor management
bad,My daily routines include setting up and opening new accounts.
bad,"I had an excellent team to work with. We got all of our work done well and on time. However, there wasn't a day that went by that there was fear of a layoff."
bad,"After being a solid place to work for more than a decade things have taken a bleak turn.  BNY Mellon today is all about outsourcing - primarily to India in favor of vastly less productive, less knowledgable employees.  Management is consistently telling us our future with the company is bright, only to see more and more employees fleeing the sinking ship.  Those who don't get out, including many very solid employees, are laid off.  They have the nerve to call the lower staffing levels ""automation,"" but in reality it is merely fewer employees in the U.S. doing more work for no wage increase.  Now we work 10+ hour days with no overtime pay and benefits are continually cut.  Employees never know if they're going to get off work at 6 or 10 pm, so work/life balance does not exist.  I suspect a lot of these cuts in staff are to pay for the endless stream of lawsuits and fines BNY Mellon has to pay out for their unethical, often illegal activities.  Do your career a favor and do not bother joining this company."
bad,Organization doesn’t care about their people. They do not care about burning people out. There is a ton of nepotism within the organization. People are promoted within frequently that have no idea how to manage. A ton of corporate politics and a very hostile work environment.
bad,"Stay away. It just keeps getting worse. It's a shame, too. From poor, top-heavy management, politics, to antiquated technology. Forced ranking discriminates against anyone with a life outside of BNY Mellon. "
bad,Not a good company. Micro management to the max. Managers lack professionalism. Salary and increases are a joke! They expect you to have no personal life.
bad,"I can only speak to the culture and leadership within the HR/Recruiting org, which was a “girls club” protect each other at all cost culture. The head of asset and wealth management recruiting at the time, was a bully and led by intimidation. Making matters worse was there was no way for employees to ring the bell - employee relations were sheep and the head of HR for this group was just as much a part of the problem. Those who weren’t bullied out and fired for no real cause eventually ended up quitting on their own."
bad,"Awful place to work, Morale is terrible. CEO only cares about stock price and nothing else. Displacements and outsourcing will continue until nobody is left. If you are a client or somebody looking to join the company, STAY AWAY. You will thank me later."
bad,"1. Those that interview you here will tell you lies and exaggerate on benefits and the working culture just to make it seem like a great place for growing your career. They are all lies! There is very little room for advancement because they only promote based off seniority. 2. Everyone is only for themselves. There are secrets everywhere, why? Knowledge is the key to employment stability here. The more you share and teach, the more you are at loss so people here will not teach or train you in any aspect. YOU are on your own. 3. Unfriendly, aggressive colleagues that will throw you under the bus just to save themselves from any trouble or getting written up. 4. They will promise you that you are permitted to work from home. Again, something they will tell you during the interview, but it will not actually happen. Even if it does, they are very stingy and micromanagement about it. 5. Favoritism among team members so you better learn how to stroke their egos and suck up to your manager/team lead or whatever the company calls it now because if you don't play by company politics, good luck getting a nice year end performance review. 6. Lots of toxic masculinity problems, big egos that need to be stroked and juvenile frat bros among the older male coworkers. 7. Not much to learn for the job and work can get monotonous with lots of down time. 8. Technology is stuck in the 1980s. If you have any issues with technology or logins, you are on your own, unless you want to jump from person to person, department to department just to get a simple thing fixed that would only take five seconds."
bad,"I liked my team immensely, but the firm itself was run very poorly.  I learned how to be a project manager and was able to do work that both allowed me to learn the skill and try new experiences."
bad,"No Job security"
bad,"If you weren't one of their ""chosen people"" you sat stagnant in the same position, despite job knowledge, If you have children, you're granted benefits that others don't get (showing up late, flex scheduling, etc) to allow for appointments and schooling ""issues."""
bad,I am embarrassed that I even wasted my time and energy working here. As a female they degrade you and you have to listen to vulgar comments about yourself. Management does not know how to do their job and so they will punish you for their work getting poor remarks from higher up.
bad,Unable to meet daily deadlines due to lack of organization in all departments. Each department depends on another for data to do their work.  Management fails to resolve production issues so no group is able to work effectively. Staff must work long hours with no breaks and management makes no effort to correct these conditions
bad,"unless you're desperate for a pay check do not work here...possibly the worst company to work for....pay is horrible, management is clueless, all jobs going to india"
bad,BNY Mellon  will suck you dry. BNY markets itself as a diverse institution with a focus on people and neither of those statements are true. Not worth it.
bad,"The Day to day work at BNYM for my position was productive.  Over the last 3 years I have not been mentored or developed by my leadership.  I have little guidance and support from my management team in the Pittsburgh, PA Office.  Because of the poor upper management, work culture is very negative and morale is quite low.  The hardest part of my job is the lack up management support.  The most enjoyable part of my job is the reporting aspect of my job and some of my co-workers are very enjoyable to work with."
bad,"The management is bad and attitude is bad. No one is interested in approaching problems right way."
bad,"poor salary and staff starving. no incentive and racially biased company. i do not recommend it for non american job seeker."
bad,"BNY Mellon provides a solid work life balance. It is a decent place to start your career. Get them to pay for your Masters (they pay $10,000 a year) and move along."
bad,"Bullying and harassment, very difficult management. The culture is secretive, political, and corrupt. There are good points about the company, but the trick is to become friends with the right people."
bad,BNYM is a company that doesn't value employee innovation. It is stagnant and pays much worse then competitors. It specializes in low margin work.
bad,"One year as a Trade Capture Analyst at BNY Mellon has shown me how bad an office job can be. The wages were less than 16k with an umbrella scheme that actively diminished my wage instead of raising it. The workload is constant and staff are not treated with respect, nor are they paid nearly close to what they should be. At 36 yrs old I felt was treated like a teenager in an environment that was nigh on call centre standards. "
bad,"The company stinks.  The officers treat anyone who is not at an officer level like garbage.  I had an extremely bad 4-1/2 year experience with my MD,who spoke to me like I was garbage beneath his feet, and his wife was not much better when she called in 5 times a day. "
bad,The job is repetitive. You have to sit at a computer for eight hours and key in numbers.  The manager was very stern and did not allow any talking. The only thing good about the job was its benefits.
bad,"If you do not work in New York this company does care about its remote employees at all.  The salaries are completly different from working at corporate than working remotly."
bad,"N\A not at this time - Possible layoff this year - being last hired, Position Oncall schedule is being enforced more."
bad,"Learned that don't trust your co workers, they will have lunch with you and act like you are an integral part of the team then stab you in the back to cover their mistakes.  Turnover is due to management and lack of growth.  Hardest part of the job waking up to go to it.   Most enjoyable part .... parting ways."
bad,Printed reports for daily and monthly reconciliation and placed in a box for storage.
bad,Management lacks leadership skills. Feels like your being babysat all day...
bad,"The company does not value scholastic achievements. As a matter of fact,the company lowered the qualification requirement for most sensitive positions just so they can offer as little pay as possible."
bad,"This company lacks the ""human element"" of operations. The managers have absolutely no interest in grooming employees or offering any kind of mentoring. The majorifty of the Lake Mary office is comprised of transfers from up north (corporate headquarters). The employees that transferred to FL are very full of themselves. There are a great deal of seniority within the firm, but the ""old timers"" are not welcoming or helpful. Definitelty a ""dog eat dog"", ""every man for himself"" environment - no real feel of teamwork. Not a good place to work. The managers are incompetent and are placed in these roles due to tenure and ""who they know"" rather than truly having leadership abilities. If you want to be happy - look elsewhere."
bad,I was working in Pittsburgh and in 2016 my wife’s job got transferred to Tampa Fl and I asked my manager if I could work remote and retain my job if I moved. He got the proper management to sign off on my departure. I worked remote for three years when management changed and then swept my job from underneath me leaving me stranded. I would not recommend working for this company.
bad,"Typical work day for me is fast-paced. I love that. However, BNYM is cheap. They want you to take on more work, but are completely taken aback when you ask to be compensated fairly for it. Management has incredibly poor leadership & shockingly low standards for their friends (who they bring onto their teams)."
bad,Company HR do not feel any need for investigating the root cause of any incident and rather rely on their Managers findings even when they know it's all a lie.
bad,"The pressure is excruciating. My typical workday started when I arrived at 7:40am, left at 5pm, but signed in from home for 2+ hours in the evening. Weekend hours were also required. After killing myself for 6 months, I still could not satisfy my bosses who gave me a poor appraisal and then laid me off a few months later - and I was a VP, not an entry level person."
bad,Pay was great. Morale is horrible. Some really nice humans to work with although the rotten employees can and will knock you down.  It’s just not the place it was 15 years ago. That was a nice place.
bad,"I was let go after a new senior leader ""redrew the boxes"" and many were let go, throwing my life into chaos.  I saw the whole thing coming, but both my supervisor and HR lied to us right up to the day I was let go.  Bottom line, few are truly valued or respected.  My suggestion:  Don't take a job here.  It won't be worth the risk."
bad,Employees are constantly worried about losing their jobs. Employees are overworked and underpaid while CEOs receive the majority of the benefits. Benefits are getting worse year by year.
bad,"Cost cutting was an obsession at this organization, spilled over into everything and affected the tools to do my job properly.  Management too detatched and obsessed with saving money."
bad,"Do not accept a job in this call center. There are many local temp agencies that hire for this job. You will be a contractor making $16 an hour with no benefits and no promise of becoming a permanent employee with benefits.  There are multiple groups within the call center. 529 College savings plans, IRA retirement plans, and a few others as well. If they say you're hired for one area, two weeks after training they will move you to another area depending on need.  You will have no choice or say in any of it. If you are hired for the 529 group, and they decide to move you to the IRA group, you are at their Mercy or they show you the door.  There is extremely high turnover in this call center. Not only with phone reps,  but also with managers.  My manager is an extremely nice woman who does her best to help us, but she is under a lot of stress and I can tell the place its toll on her.  She has to manage a group of about 30 phones reps. It's really easy to get lost in the shuffle If your manager is in charge of a big group.  The job itself is very stressful. They expect you to take back-to-back calls with no break in between. You are talking to nasty mean financial advisors and also very mean shareholders who have no clue how their accounts or taxes work. You get hardly any training that prepares you for the actual job. Our training was horrible and the guy who trained us just made us do online courses and he didn't train us on anything himself.  he just made us train ourselves on the computer. It's very stressful they throw a lot of information at you and there are times when"
bad,"If you're hired for a position at a low salary and are fine with working hard and having no desire to move up within the company, then this is the place for you. Otherwise if you do too well and your salary becomes high for your position, you will be a top candidate to be laid off. The company's technology is so far behind that they need to get rid of top performing high salary individuals so they can appropriate those funds towards tech upgrades.  So don't have any career aspirations, keep your salary low and your production up, that way you will stick around."
bad,"This used to be a great place to work. The salary and benefits are great. Coworkers are great! However, the  mentality of senior leadership and the company culture have significantly declined in the past year. The new CEO does not care about his employees."
bad,"Management has extremely poor communication skills, not to mention shady practices. They expect their employees to work harder and accurately with less people and as fast as possible. Even if you do show yourself to be a loyal and competent employee there is very little opportunity for advancement. Management would rather hire outside for management positions than promote anyone, regardless if they've been there for many years."
bad,The company has been in constant lay off mode for at least 5 years and that has taken a toll on morale.  There are limited to no advancement or growth opportunities.
bad,"No comment, overall wouldn't recommend to the average worker. The salary is not worth the trouble and duties that they have you perform.  They play alot of favoritism and do not have good people skills."
bad,Good if you need a paycheck. Very little chance for advancement. Met many people with advanced degrees and certifications that have been in the same positions for 5 years.
bad,"Unprofessional, managers worked off emotions and not actual business. I say when going in focus on your job and that’s all, if they throw rocks, use it to build a wall."
bad,"The pay was just over minimum wage yet you are often expected to stay until 9pm. I asked for training on the company's computer system which my manager said 'we look for self starter's in this company' and didn't give any training. Management will talk down to you in front of other colleagues. Awful company and I left without having another job. Very big cliques and bullying. HR didn't care when told."
bad,"While there is no perfect I job or position I generally enjoyed the work and especially the extensive client interaction. However, it is unfortunate that senior management is so far out of touch with the lack of  competence and quality of many of its line managers. The last manager that I worked for was very insecure and abusive. The most common words used to describe him by fellow team members and other co-workers were demeaning and dismissive."
bad,I have worked at BNYM for many years and have done well. I have built a respectable career and I am continuing to do so but I do intend to leave at the first opportunity. I have seen far too many good people worked hard for little pay and insulting yearly increases only to be laid off and replaced with new employees who work less efficiently for cheaper. There are good people who work for this company but those at the top do not care about their employees.
bad,"outdated technologies, no appreciation for new idea, poor management. If you like a laid back and very low tech environment this is a place for you. If you want to learn more and stay up to date  look somewhere else. They are also very cheap."
bad,There is no growth in my department at all. I have been here for almost 4 years and was only promoted once. I continue to work extremely hard and there is no compensation for it. My pay is very low compared to other jobs. It's hard to move around the bank as well.
bad,"The company was always changing but not always for the good. Employees are always overlooked and underpaid. On top of being mistreated, the work is never organized."
bad,"The management for TSG is ran as ""IT as Business"".  This means that the Sr. TSG management lacks knowledge in technology.  Sr. Management is also ego driven, leading to lack of respect for employees."
bad,Very poor environment wth lack of leadership and communication.  Old clique of people in Boston that live in an ivory tower.  It was a poor choice on my part to join the firm.
bad,"College students should use the experience to gain knowledge and move on!!!! Pay is too low and the extra headaches are not worth it."
bad,"I have had a love/hate relationship with the company. I have left several times and returned in hopes that each time it would be different. It’s not. The salaries in the pittsburgh market are pathetic, the cost of living goes up 7-10% each year and the avg raise is 3%. Not everyone is bonus eligible which is disheartening. The technology is outdated and there is no room"
bad,Good company to work for. Enjoyed the work. Wanted to be permanent member. But have to be popular with management. Being a good worker doesn't matter.
bad,they try to train you into a machine and force you to do whatever they want you to do no matter you want or not. The job is super boring and you cannot learn anything from it...
bad,"It is just a sad place.  Its business model is dying, and it is laying off masses of people.  Many jobs are relocating to Pittsburgh."
bad,"•	Working as acting leader, handling team issues. Conducting daily team huddles to discuss daily work status and how to work on that."
bad,"If you want to work 60 hours a week, get no raise in almost 3 years and be treated like dirt to only wind up with a stomach ulcer this is the place for you.  Then get told the week before your laid off that this group will not have layoffs only to go in the next Monday and be told by your manager's manager that you are laid off and have 30 minutes to clean out your desk and be escorted out the door.  "
bad,"If you enjoy working 65 plus hours a week, then BNY Mellon is the place for you.  Morale is poor, people are looking to leave (many already have) and Executive Management is very reactive and rarely proactive."
bad,True corporate where everyone is just a number. They dont care about their employees at all.
bad,"But I wouldn't stay longer than 2 years, no advancement opportunity and the pay is horrible"
bad,"Poor senior leadership, internal politics and lack of cross-company collaboration contribute to a poor work culture and a stagnant business. Middle management and staff have become disengaged and disenchanted."
bad,"Work environment of uncertainty, fear, of job loss, and extreme pressure. Cutthroat and backstabbing.  You'll learn evening about the Financial Banking industry if that's what you're looking for."
bad,You are not allowed to do your job without micromanagement from insecure senior executives who play politics all day long in the detriment of the company's success. Bullying is highly condoned especially in Investment Management is morale is at rock bottom. Expect to see a major change in management in the near future from the board.
bad,"This is a good place to start a career in the finance, taxation, reconciliation, or settlements arena straight out of college. The company gives an employee a good sense of job expectations."
bad,Overall the people are nice but some of the staff have been at the organization for over 20 years and are too resistant to change. Too much talk from management about the brand heritage not enough discussion about the present/future.
bad,Felt the work place was very click-ish like high school. I felt like a number. I was 2 classes away from getting an advanced degree and still having trouble with career advancement.
bad,"Very boring nine to five type job that pays you very little. You receive a 2% raise each each which comes out to about $600 a yea before taxes. Goodluck with that. Benefits are awful. Advancement is a joke. Plus if you would like to be a manager, u do double the work for a $3000 raise. And the only reason there are management spots open are because people leave left and right. The turnover here is almost as high as a full commission insurance sales job."
bad,Too many average people in the Sr. Management. Mindset is very narrow. Lack of equal opportunity culture; discrimination and racism are present in certain areas of the bank. HR is not influential or not effective.
bad,"Stay away if you can."
bad,"Typical Bank Job. Standard hours, old stuffy atmosphere. They do not know how to keep their young talent"
bad,The focus of this division of BNY is the transition of operations to India not the development of current employees.
bad,"I was employed by BNY Mellon just short of 7 years. Like a lot of the other reviews, management is so bad from the bottom on up. Pay scale is very poor and some people have part time jobs to help ends meet. There is no appreciation for good work and in the section I was in we could get a whopping $10 gift card if we did not call in sick for 3 months (each quarter). The employee of the month program is a joke. Only people that are pets or close to the people one should know get that award. I am retired and worked just long enough so I could retire after spending 30 years with a previous employer. No team work and a lot of back stabbers. Unfriendly atmosphere."
bad,"low salary, good culture, good balance between work and family. "
bad,"I came on board at the wrong time.  Management was in downsizing mode and had to let many employees go due to restructuring.  It effected the culture and morale of most employees.  They have a lot of good talented people in IT Security.  Too bad, the timing for me was not right."
bad,Worst job ever! Got hired right out of college and expected to be trained and helped with my career but wasn’t. Management is horrible. Way to many supervisor who aren’t trained to be supervisor. I would not advise any young person to work there. No opportunity to grow!
bad,"Poor management,it was all about money for them not having employees you can work all the hours you want but its never enough for them you get paid enough but not enough to survive"
bad,Incompetent managers who hide in their offices all day doing nothing and refuse to speak with angry clients. Very few female or minority executives. Most jobs here can be completed in 3 hours each day. No career advancement or training opportunities unless you are located in India.
bad,"DO NOT apply for Inter. Rep. Client Processing. Management is Bi-Polar, no training, what they call training is a mess no structure and they want you to know something yesterday. Very stressful specially when management is lacking empathy, manners and tact"
bad,"Good benefits however upper management was difficult to work for. I learned the rules and regulations of International Trade and how to design, and troubleshoot computer issues."
bad,"The manager was extremely difficult to work with and it was a wonder how BNY allowed such people to continue."
bad,"Neg. Stressful environment. Workplace culture needs improvement. Lack of collaboration. On the pros, good benefits and great vacations. "
bad,"BNY Mellon is way behind the technology curve for critical systems. Their disaster recovery design and testing is inadequate.  They cannot handle spikes in volume."
bad,This place was terrible. If you want a desk job where they  penalize you for walking into work at 3:01 when your shift started at 3:00 then go ahead and apply here.
bad,"The Bank of New York could use a few courses in employee appreciation.  The Document Custody line of business specifically does not pay well, and the employee turnover is extremely high."
bad,"terrible place to work for, management isn't trustworthy or timely"
bad,"Mellon, may have improved but back in the 90's I observed it to have the most INefficient trade clearing department I had ever witnessed.  Prior to working there I had worked in Trade Clearing and Floor operations for some ten years.  Management was unbelievably bad and for the first time in all the years I worked in the securities industry I heard really harsh opinions about Mellon from their clients on my first day.  Warnings about their inadequacies if you will.  Some of the management has been replaced so I can only assume its improved but I have no idea."
bad,It used to be a fun place to work but it has quickly become one of the worst places to work at. The pay is below what the market is paying. It's pretty bad. We are overworked and way underpaid. There is no motivation anymore. Management doesn't do much to keep their experienced employees. There has been so much turnover because there are other jobs that pay well. Not a good place to work unfortunately and it breaks my heart saying it.
bad,Forced Ranking may work for the first round or even two but creates an toxic environment where you constantly fear for your job.  Layoffs have been ongoing almost since the start for me in what I was assured was a stable work environment.
bad,"The company was not a place I would recommend to anyone. Horrible pay, no advancement. No room for growth, and they'd constantly take advantage of your work."
bad,"This environment here is soured by poor, ineffective (bordering on incompetence) management. A good pay check was all I gained from them."
bad,"Poor Management. Policies there, but not in use!"
bad,"Never seen so many rude and very jealous women in one place, even some of them were pregnant. If you are attractive and intelligent women,try to avoid Dublin office at Guildhose st. you would not be welcomed at all."
bad,"Upon being hired, I learned the position was shortly being outsourced and there was no set manager. No actual training took place and I have to teach myself the position."
bad,"The management here is horrible, the company gives you very minimal training and expects you know the entire process mistake free. They bring you in as a temp paying you one thing but ""IF"" you get offered a job they expect you to take a lower pay but expect you to do the same if not more work. I was told that we are not allowed to give you a job number when my contract was up even though they gave job numbers to other employees that contracts were up. They are NOT a company to work for."
bad,work is sporadic and crunch time at the end of the month and quarterly reporting
bad,"Richardson location is not a great place to work. But it is a paycheck. Third shift management is a joke. They have taken away our music and they lie and say it is broken (it comes in over a satellite) they don't want us to talk, or stand (to keep ourselves awake). The body is naturally tuned to sleep at night, they think we aren't supposed to get sleepy at 3 or 4 am! Overtime is there when mail is plentiful but after working 8 hours it's sometimes hard to stay the additional, and sometimes required 2 hours (daily) overtime. Most of management is unprofessional. I have been there since May 2011 and am currently looking for something else. Good luck if you do gain employment with this company."
bad,"I have an entry level position at BNY, and it's just a prototypical office job. Keep your head down and find somewhere else more suited to your interests and skills."
bad,"Declining fast, cut throat environment, employees abused and not paid accordingly. Loved working for this company before the quarterly layoffs. It's too bad."
bad,"Some of the Managers are bullies, especially the new ones that come in. There is no job security.  Layoffs happen monthly and it doesn't matter how great of an employee is or how long you've been there., you will find yourself unemployed.  All they care about is the bottom line. "
bad,Not a great company to work for culturally.  Mean bosses.  High Stress.  Poorly treated.  Work life balance questionable at times.  Unhappy most of the 4 years there.
bad,"BNYM culture is not conducive to employee work/life balance and often decisions were made without fully understanding the impact on morale. For example, work from home changes."
bad,"They would prefer robots over people.  The work load was never ending, and I mean you are kept busy and tightly supervised all day every day.  If you take 2 minutes to yourself, someone might come looking for you.  Employees were made well aware that we are all replaceable.  Benefits were decent."
bad,"Company is exceedingly top heavy, struggling to support stock price.  technology abysmal and shockingly behind the times.  widespread, ongoing lay-offs continue.  internal communication is exceedingly poor so morale is in the tank across the company, if people are honest.  talent leaving in droves and not being replaced.  hiring managers actively lying to potential new hires days before they plan to leave themselves.  ""senior"" management focused on preserving its stock incentives at the expense of client-facing, knowledgeable workers. regrettably, nothing about the job is enjoyable - what was once a great organization is no longer..."
bad,"Extremely busy call center, one rep can take up to 90 calls a day. Tons of overtime available for someone who is able to work it. You are treated better the more you work."
bad,it was a fun job. great atmosphere and people. plenty opportunity for growth. you learn something new everyday and there is always someone around to help if y need it
bad,"Did not like it there.  It was all about the bottom line, employees were treated like numbers instead of people.  I had 2 bosses in 2 diff cities with different expectations."
bad,I worked here for 3 years and knew every position within my department. From the time I started working until the day I left I only had a .12 difference in my pay.This job taught me a lot about what to look for in an employer durning the interview process in regards to the type of work enviroment that I am looking for. I was not able to move to other positions within the bank and felt like I was cheated out of opportunity to better myself.
bad,"Company went into administration in London.  People not nice only talked to me when they had to, did not like the atmosphere"
bad,Too many changes and layoffs occurring in Asset Management.  Not a clear strategy and direction from the leadership team. The best people left.  Very difficult place to attract talent.
bad,Job stability but no room for growth or salary increases. A good place for college students or some one just graduating from high school.
bad,"The summary is not describing the work itself, but the people I worked with where sometimes very challenging. Working at BNY Mellon helped me learn how to deal with people from all different walks of life both good and bad. I enjoyed the friendships that developed working there."
bad,"You will always feel to work at BNYMellon, as the work culture is very disciplined and would always been supportive by the hireachy heads,"
bad,"Transaction processing, income and expense related processing, research and clearing, daily NAV generation related processes, Review, investigate and correct errors in financial entries, documents and reports."
bad,More of our work is being sent overseas.  The software we currently have is written in FORTRAN on an ITANIUM system. Currently the core software is being migrated to a Linux system.  This is a challenging project due to the new technology but it is a wonderful opportunity to be part of.
bad,"I would never work here again. The level of micromanagement was unbelievable. They kept tabs on when you came, when you left, who you went to lunch with. They treated their consultants like second class citizens."
bad,"So far the best position I ever had in my career."
bad,"Terrible hours, terrible enviroment, cut throat and not rewarding at all."
bad,I have worked at many banks before but this place is the worst. There is no kind of training and you are expected to know all the ins and outs right away. I have never hated a place so much.
bad,"•	Scanning of documentation including books, newspapers and photographs"
bad,"Great Place to Work, Good Culture, Proficient Management. "
bad,The company gets more and more unreliable. The corporation takes in new clients without the resources. The administrators of this company think only of their own profits at the expense of the employees.
bad,"Myself, as well as several other employees, sat with absolutely nothing to do all day everyday but sit on our phones. When we complained management did nothing about it but complained that our work load as a department was too heavy.  I did several daily reports as well as my every day tasks without complaining even though I never received proper training and was still randomly let go."
bad,Boring work with absolutely no outlook for advancement with Mellon Capital Management. This is for the environment on the 21st floor. Not sure what it's like with the portfolio managers on the 42nd floor.
bad,"- Data entry"
bad,Management is not good. Less Salary the y Paid. There is no Job Security is there.  no work from home facility . free Pick n drop serivce. Free Meal coupon they proivde.
bad,"Job calls for long work hours, no opportunity for advancement and technology is terrible. Departments don't work together and like to blame others."
bad,"responsible for 2 teams , Account opening team , Business testng team"
bad,Input data into systems
bad,Senior leadership community is ever changing.  Very bureaucratic.  There is a tremendous number of highly motivated and intelligent staff.  A constant struggle for Technology to get support to deliver effective solutions to help service personnel deliver world class service.
bad,"Would not recommend.  High turnover and employees not treated well in this large complex entity.  Always a challenge to invest enhancements, will throw people instead of technology at increasing volume."
bad,"they say quality over quantity but this is not the case, want employees to rush through wire transfers, then get mad when they are done too quickly and there are mistakes.  lots of yelling by supervisors"
bad,"Due to constant turn over and a internal shuffle towards a ""centers of excellence"" production model, there is always something to do. The difference between those who excel and those who don't is the willingness and pro-activeness of the individual to jump into new projects processes and procedures."
bad,"Chaotic culture with management that has proven it can't be trusted.  There is a ton of red tape and politics with layer upon layer of management that each has it's own fiefdom.  My current team has been a pleasure to work with, but my management team would continue to give me their work and not compensate me for the rest of time.  It's a firefighting culture which doesn't foster a true change management culture.  You can tell which employees are the Managing Directors (yes..we have hundreds) favorites and they are the only ones who get promoted or receive bonuses.  There is a reason JP Morgan Chase is beating this company."
bad,"Very busy, like my co workers.  Senior Management needs to have a better relationship with workers."
bad,"Low pay, weak management and very scare job advancement opportunities"
bad,"I was awful. if you enjoy browning nosing than, this company is for you."
bad,"Bank of New York Mellon"
bad,"Not a good company they layoff people, without prior notice..... don't spoil your career joining this company..........................................."
bad,A lot of politics and pay is very very basic for the skills that you have. You need to leave and come back if you want to pretend you are on any sort of decent wage to get what you need
bad,BNY Mellon has had several lay offs. It does not appear that the lay off issue will end any time soon. Several emoloyees are working more than their job duties. There is no room for growth.
bad,"Good 1st job. "
bad,Too much expected for the salaray offered. Made a lot of noise about opportunities for advancement but were all couched within years long 'training schemes'.
bad,Management is non-existence. Good pay with high stress and no room for advancement. Problems keeping people on board due constant changes with no leadership to convey how changes should be affected.
bad,"Don't promote on merit."
bad,"Senior management is in total cost savings mode. Experienced employees are hit with the brunt of this and laid off in favor of cheaper new hires."
bad,"This is the poorest run company I've ever worked at. No advancement opportunities, minimal pay raises if any, no bonuses, avg benefits at best, poor communication and management has no strategy to invest in the business or it's people. It's Orlando business is a churn'em and burn'em operation."
bad,"The current culture at BNY Mellon is to let go long time employees in favor of hiring cheaper OffShore talent.  The current management culture is as bad as I have ever seen it.  It seems that stacking the employee with bad reviews and HR who does nothing to help the employee.  They recently created an open workspace  packing them with people from unlike group creating a noisy work area.  Management enforced a policy that did not want employee to work from home, which they had to backed off due to an on]utcry from staff.  It makes no sense.  if you complain, management will single you out as 'not a team player'.  it has never been like this. BNY Mellon traditionally values their older worker but the drive to cut costs make older workers an easy target."
bad,"Poor salary, very little opportunity for promotion, poor work/life balance and inept management. Since the new CEO has come to the company, the staff are being asked for more and more commitment with fewer rewards. Attrition levels are bad and vacant roles are not filled with any urgency, putting a phenomenal amount of pressure on often already overworked and undertrained staff."
bad,constantly downsizing. pass on more work to the the ones left. always a new project and rarely acknowledge their employees. client satisfaction no longer a requirement.  company is not what it used to be.
bad,"The typical work day was varied and haried."
bad,You will work hard at BNY and learn a lot because they will have you doing many different things. Pay was just ok. The people where nice. Not many opportunities for advancement.
bad,Don’t do it at all it’s no room to advance and they will quickly fire you it’s stressful on your feet as well and the management don’t care for their employees
bad,"I've been employed by BNY Mellon for the past 12 years. I've worked my way up the ranks within USD Funds Transfer as an Account Administrator, Production Coordinator, Section Manager."
bad,"It's an ok job but they do show favor to some employees, thy promote by who you know and who likes you, not by what you know."
bad,"The worst turnover rate of any company. Full of false promises. Threating behavior if you attempt to leave certain departments. Some of the departmental managers have absolutely no idea what needs to be done, but they're in charge of everyone in the group."
bad,"A typical day at work various on daily basis.  Managing heavy calendar and updating it every minutes. Reformatting documents on Excel and PowerPoint for the manager's meetings daily. scheduling meetings, conference calls, Webex Meetings, Answering phone calls, Process T&E, filing documents, read all the manager's e-mail and print the documents. Open up the mail, etc.  I learned a lot during the Offsite Meeting I coordinate which very challenge and I enjoy doing it.  The management is ok, the workplace culture is ok.  The hardest part of the job is when I need to chase someone for information and they don't deliver the it on time.  The most enjoyable part of the job is when I need to put a trip together."
bad,"BNY Mellon is much too focused on the clients and how to always save the bottom line.  No focus on improving employees, training, or advancement."
bad,"Be careful, the company is always downsizing.  Very low to no merit increases.  Management by intimidation.  Closing locations."
bad,"Demeaning, treated less than human, stressful, overburdoned, underpaid, unreasonably high expectations, majority of employees barely make above unsatisfactory rate of processing, yet standards aren't adjusted to accomodate the standard level of work being given by employees."
bad,"hard time to work here"
bad,"Engage and build relationships with the business, project planning, create estimates, dependency management, budget control,  project lifecycle and tracking, scope definition and change, supplier management, issue and risk management, negotiation and governance"
bad,"The environment is very not conducive to having a balance of job, work and life balance. Trying to get time off for even a dr appointment is near to impossible."
bad,a typical day busy and very fast paced. easy going staff and management but production hard to maintain.
bad,I rate this place a 3 out of 10. Keep your expectations very low.
bad,"Awful pay, stuffy and boring atmosphere. Couldnt wait to leave."
bad,"a typical day consisted of keeping your head down and doing your work, then wait for all the things you did wrong and how much it's going to cost you when your paycheck came."
bad,"It really depends on the department. Some departments have a great work-life balance which can balance out the low pay and declining benefits packages. For example, right now I work a compressed week, so I work longer days but only have to come in 4 days a week. Other groups really don't care and will ignore you and think that you should just be happy to have a job. The atmospher is not the best."
bad,temporary work and no notice of end. Not the idea place for employment.
bad,Work is hard team is great to work with though management is less likely to spend time helping groom you to the position. Training is sub par. And when you work on special projects you will not get the gratitude you deserve.
bad,Management doesn't give much feedback and doesn't even bother talking to employees most days unless something goes wrong.  I never had any idea of how to advance in the company.
bad,"Constant layoffs, managers actively talking about how to get rid of work, great for morale. Way to much bureaucracy and middle management. Many units are management heavy."
bad,"Sadly current CEO has ruined any reason for working for this firm.  While it was a pleasure working there during the Mellon and early BNY Mellon years, that ended as soon as this CEO arrived.  Now it's a place full of stress over the need to evaluate employees as ""below average,"" even if they are not."
bad,"Having worked there fore over a decade, I can say we had better times, however over the past 3 years BNYM sunk into a cesspit. New managers with no management skills, egotistical senior managers, HR which is corrupt, and vastly unrealistic expectations from teams, turned this place into a hellhole. Favouritism, backstabbing, blame games, bullying, and discrimination is rife. Don't bother with HR, as they whitewash, lie and cover up any complaints."
bad,"Everything has been and is being outsourced. No advancement. Very hierarchical. Stay away. Salary increases are setup as an allotted pool per team, then 2nd level managers, who have no direct contact to employees' daily actions, change and lower the numbers allotted to make their case for ""saving money"" better to ""earn"" a higher salary increase in turn."
bad,The Accounting and Reporting business line in Everett used to be a decent place to work but the office culture gets worse every year and the client service has deteriorated over the years as the company attempt to save money. There are layoffs all time and no one feels safe or comfortable. Long tenured employees as well as new hires have been laid off in order to cut costs.
bad,"Over-reliance on offshore IT resources who lack basic development lifecycle skills. Onshore managers invest time in bringing these people up to standard at which point they leave the company for better paid work elsewhere. Management in London in particular increasingly aggressive and demanding. Poor work/life balance, expectation is staff are there to work extremely long hours and are contactable 24/7. Opportunities for advancement limited. Pay is fairly good although not quite on a par with some competitors."
bad,"No room for growth, hotel unassigned seating, high turnover and low employee moral. I would not recommend working at BNY. Too much tribalism and job insecurity. Outsource heavy!"
bad,"Good risk culture. New management. HQ located in nyc. Great at first. Needed more flexibility with remote working and with new CEO - he wanted no remote working , more collaboration in the office environment. Not very good for working parents."
bad,"-procedure changes made by higher-ups who don't understand how it will impact day to day tasks"
bad,BNY Mellon is out of touch with the rest of the industry. Making changes that other companies have not had luck with. Removing work from home access as other companies are embracing it and touting it as a benefit. Creating open work spaces even though study after study indicates that they inhibit collaboration and spread illnesses. Minimal raises and worst-in-industry healthcare.
bad,"The pay is low for the work assigned.  There are some professional managers, if you are lucky you will have a decent Team Lead but I find that they are unprofessional and power hungry, so they think they can treat you with such disrespect.  There is no parking you have to take a shuttle 10 to 15 mins past the work place.  The traffic is usually heavy so you have to allow time in the mornings.  It's a warehouse environment so it is quiet dusty.  There are no fast foods in walking distance so you have to call for deliveries.  There is a food truck that comes daily, great for those that leave their cars at the shuttle. If you are in need for employment by all means work there to survive but I wouldn't recommend it. On a high note some of the work is very easy, but  the volume can be high."
bad,Management doesn't care what employees need. Removing all flexibility from the workplace - working from home is now nearly impossible to get. Do not promote from within - hiring all new managers from outside.
bad,"No Job Security.  Company is discontinuing ""remote access"", disrupting person lives of employees.  Technology is waning.  Too expensive working in NYC."
bad,"Don’t let them fool you that BNY is a great place to work. They try very hard to sell the job and are not honest with the endless numbers of temps they hire. "
bad,"3 Corporation CEO changes, 4 divisional management changes in last 10 years, with divisional restructuring averaging every 2.  New management wiping out previous in favor of all outside managers who are unfamiliar with mass of systems and teams that are not interconnected.  No advancement opportunities, and even in times of expansion under constant threat of being laid off.  With frequent layoffs, demands on individuals increases (most are doing the work of 2-3 people) while average salary raise is 1.5 to 2.0%.  Medical benefits went from robust BCBS HMO or PPO to United 80% plan with very high deductibles and minimal company contributions (appx $1000 for the year if you complete various requirements - ex. health coaching) For past 9 years company has encouraged staff to work from home part or full time.  New CEO has stated that will be discontinued - all staff are to work 100% in office, ""If you are looking for any kind of work life balance, this company is not for you."""
bad,Significant change at top of house has led to a lack of clarity of mission/direction at lower levels. Disjointed business model that focuses on larger business lines at expense of smaller
bad,"The typical workday was fast-paste and varied."
bad,"Love the company. Great Benefits, but unless you're part of management or not on the phones all day, You're micromanaged with unobtainable expectations. No one speaks up for fear of losing their jobs and no one wants to look like they're complaining."
bad,Management is just terrible at training the employees. The culture is that if you know more your more of an asset so there is no incentive for people to teach you how to do your job.
bad,"In mid-2017 BNY Mellon replaced both the CIO and the CEO within 2 months of each other.  That should be enough to tell you that this company is a mess.  The CEO has been fairly quiet so far.  The CIO however is completely unqualified, lacks the capacity to understand the technology, and is incapable of identifying those who add value.  She surrounded herself with the people who talk but produce no results.  And she refuses to acknowledge anyone who worked here before her.  There are no promotions to senior roles -- those are only filled by external hires."
bad,"not a great place to work. downsizing really means do more with much less. poor management of resources, and expanding job descriptions to cover gaps when teams are downsized."
bad,"I have to believe the overall company is better than I experienced."
bad,"Its a bank and therefore the work is very repetitive. BNY Mellon is a large company there their are a number of opportunities, however to obtain these opportunities the work life balance is often sacrificed, requiring excessive hours of overtime."
bad,not focusing on retaining staff. Salary below market. Management stay in the same position several years with no moment. No direct promotion. Merit not recognised
bad,"Typical day - Time would usually fly by and you're grasping at the time for it to slow down due to constant high work volumes. Learning - I have learnt to improve my Excel skills (Vlookup). It became very important that at the end of the day you need to take care of your mental health before anything else."
bad,"BNYM is an OK place to work although they do not value the talent that works there. Sr management is aware that they have a problem retaining their top talent but refuse to promote or if they do promote they do it with little to no compensation increases. We are consistently being told we pay for performance but the budget does not reflect this. At the time of review process are told we are not allowed to force rank people into categories, but then we are told we cant deviate from a certain percentage for each category. Go figure."
bad,My manager was frequently asking me to help her to perform her role and I felt she was in over her head most of the time.  She also kept hiring her friends from outside of the bank who were inexperienced or unsuitable for the roles which caused bad feeling within the wider team.
bad,"A typical day at work would constitute a variety of challenges.  Each morning would require database updates, information input, and report processing.  New information would be uploaded and updated as appropriate.  When completed, the rest of the day would be spent putting out fires as problems constantly arose due to workload overload.  This would include audit preparations, problem solving, training, covering other positions, etc.  Morale was exceptionally low as the usual day required 11 hours of work, in which you were constantly held accountable for items outside of your control.  The only rational choice was to look for a career change."
bad,Employees are left to manage themselves and there is no training of new employees. Employees are hired but have no accesses to required sites to complete work. It takes over a month to get minimal access.
bad,I would not recommend this company. Management can be better at communications to employees. I worked there for 8 years and was only happy for 3 of them.
bad,"not recommended for good pay, staff are nice but management are clueless , in my team were 4 managers, 6 supervisors and only 4 processing staff? one good manager would suffice"
bad,"My job takes a lot of patience to work with customers who have different types of fraud and declines on their cards. They are often irritated and rude, but i have obtained the skills to deal with the customers in a professional manner. My co-workers are very nice and helpful. Whenever i need help or have a question they are always there to assist me. Management is okay. I sometimes feel like there is favoritism here, but i dont usually let it bother me. i just come into work and do my job."
bad,High pressure without any guidance from supervisors made this job not a preferred vocation. Would not recommend job to anyone with young children at home
bad,"BNY Mellon has a horrible culture, management does not care about the development of their employees. Bullying and negativity are key to every aspect of the company."
bad,"While I was in BNY there was huge staff turn-over, the hours worked were very demanding, while using very old out of date systems and all of this working under a sub standard management."
bad,It's always mandatory overtime. The managers and supervisors are not polite. This is overall not a professional environment.
bad,A waste of time. company does not respect work/life balance. Compensation is below street level. One of my biggest regrets!!!
bad,"Multiple challenges with staff implementing new processes and procedures.  No written policy presented challenges, with managing the new procedures."
bad,"I enjoy the responsibilities of my job very much.  The only cons to it are the people, the hours, the resources, the support from executive levels of management, the impossible demands, the fact that I'd need to be an octopus to have my hands in everywhere that they are needed."
bad,Not many if any opportunities to advance within the department
bad,BNY Mellon was lacking a good management team. Many of the employees were very careless about the quality of work they put forth. The pay was at a minimum for this field of work and we lacked any chance of bonus or raises in this certain position. Overall i was very displeased with the employment here.
bad,Day at work at Inautix is all same . Very mechanical . Less lively.Co-workers don't mingle much. Have to sit 8 to 9 hours at a stretch in a single place and don't get a time to breathe or relax or even have lunch . Surrounded by so many managers who do micro management and truth is they don't have much technical expertise.
bad,"The best thing about the company are people. They are hardworking and fun. The bank is outsourcing heavily, therefore there is no job security. Unless, you're willing to move to Florida (Lake Mary), or Delaware. In past few years, I have not learned much. The work itself had been disected so much, that each of us is performing only one task , which at the end makes us greatly unmarketable.Thank you"
bad,Must leave. Everything will be outsourced out of NY. It was a great place to work for. There will be plenty of temp jobs for those who get laid off. There is no management. The managers will be laid off as well.
bad,Avoid this company at all costs.
bad,"Long work hours, heavy work load and no advancement. The working environment was much better before the merger with Mellon. After the merger everything has changed."
bad,BNY Mellon Investor Services provides no training & there is no work/personal life balance. Management is unprofessional and very unappreciative. This particular area of the business is very disorganized and truly lacks a professional management staff.
bad,lack of communication among management and employees made it a but difficult at times.
bad,"You would think working for this company would be the highlight of your career, think again. I been here since this building opened in 2003 and I finally got my transfer approved to the Pittsburgh office. Now, that office is were you want to go. My advice, stay away from ISS / Investor Services.The entire department is constant disarray, poor management from team leaders to the department head.They need to totally clear management and rehire or even better, relocate the entire department to the Pittsburgh location. Other departments in the bank are defiantly better, have more team work and just happier in general. The one good thing is that most co-workers are willing to help and teach you and guide you."
bad,"The mandatory overtime is not set up in an organized way. Their expectations are too high, without the proper tools to get the work completed."
bad,"benefits are ok, raise on the lower end, risk of layoff few times per year. "
bad,Management retaliates when you bring an issue to their boss. They are not concerned about their employees safety and sweeps everything under the rug..
bad,"Low salaries and high dependence of outsourcing force high turnover"
bad,"Read others reviews, BNY cleans house often!  No job security, to speak of. Culture, each department is like its own country.  Do not walk away from the main area. The easiest part of this job, was leaving and not looking back."
bad,"Fun team, direct managers willing to train the staff, and are available for any questions or concerns. Work from home available which is a great benefit. Upper management does not recognize, reward their valuable employees."
bad,"Pros : paid training, decent benefits and pay once hired on permanently."
bad,The company is struggling to keep good employees.  There are some really good people in management who unfortunately get overshadowed by some very provincial thinking managers.
bad,"This is a typical US Banking Corporation. Jobs are leaving the US and going overseas. There is no loyalty whatsoever. Also, people approaching retirement are the among the first to be let go. As for promotions, it's not what you know but who likes you."
bad,"I worked for BNYM in the past over 10 years ago and again just recently. I realize that some things have not changed - like management. Management are not skilled to perform basic leadership duties. Also, they are allowed to retaliate when disagreements occur with you and them."
bad,"If you apply, stay for 3-5 years maximum. It's ok for a first job for a college graduate with no experience, but not for anyone in the prime of their career. There is no defined culture and less than 3% of the employees do anything outside of the business together. No work-life balance."
bad,Career advancement is limited and micromanagement is high little autonomy to add value or willingness  to accept new ways of doing organizational change is slow and pay low compared to other companies in the same industry
bad,"Not a great place to grow. More focused on cost cuttting, not employees. Over the years there I applied to multiple roles within the firm and didn't get an interview for one. Human resources never contacted me for any updates on the process. I'm glad in no longer there."
bad,The company is currently downsizing and there is no job growth. Apply here only if you need a job and currently out of work. You will work late hours and this is no family friendly.
bad,Bad.  terrible place terribel place terrible place.  I did not  enjoy the experience.  there was no ability to learn or advance.  they routinely fire older people.  does not seem legal. i would never advise someone to work for this company.
bad,Salary is an issue as well as it is almost impossible to move up AND be compensated for your work. If the company would treat employees like family; employees would stay
bad,"Lack of Opportunity, Senior Management think its is great that people work for low pay but like their co-workers.  Very old school bank with no regard for forward thinking people."
bad,"Most departments provide little work-life balance with non-flexible hours. New parents (especially fathers) given very little benefits, company continues to expand offshore operations so always a threat your position could be outsourced."
bad,Hires outside before inside of company. Needs better manager training. Benefits are good and it's good job security. Can be hired in different departments.
bad,"It is rightly said, People leave the company because of their manager and it has been true in my case, i had spent more then decade with BNYmellon India, however due my SDL and Manager ego and incompetency they both used they empowerment against me to made my way out, I was in love with my work there. "
bad,"Overall disatisfied, poor training, Poorly managed overall, lack of career investment in current employees I wouldn't suggest working here unless this is temporary or a transition in your career."
bad,"BNY Mellon is what an employee makes of it. there are a lot of employee volunteer opportunities and other employee sponsored engagements. However, BNYM does have a not so nice side. Meaning if you work hard you will get a mediocre raise (roughly 2%), little to no recognition, and no promotion (because there isn't one to give). BNY Mellon is a take it or leave it kind of place. BNY Mellon does not have a good track record with employee retention. Most people start working with BNY Mellon to get tuition reimbursement then leave after they have a better degree and the experience to back it up. "
bad,"No other way to put it, all around not an enjoyable experience. Little to no compensation. No growth in positions throughout the company. Ethnic diversity only consists below the managerial positions. Terrible salary with low bonus. fractional percentage increases in salary while the company grosses over 1 billion in revenue annually."
bad,"All the jobs are going overseas, because they are money hungry. I was hired along with 30 other temps and most of us were layed off within a month over petty reasons. One girl even told me 2 out of 16 temps are still here after 8 months and still after 8 months she isn't permanent yet! She is training me and very good at her job. And they didn't when train us properly and most of the training consisted of unessesary b.s. and this girl talking about herself all day. Do not work here because you're probably gonna lose your job Any way ."
bad,"who wants to stay in one career forever. It is extremely hard to find new job once you are in BNY. So if you are starting at BNY my advice is to move out within 3 years or you will not be hired by others. Management continues to face difficulty changing the culture. Biggest criticism I have is politics starts at very very low level (team lead level! now fancier title ""group manager"") so if you don't hang out with boss - you are out of luck. Some of the group managers I know have only 3 people reporting them or may be 5!!!!!!!! Pathetic. "
bad,"The work was easy enough to learn. However when numerous people quit they just pile the work onto whoever is left instead of hiring new talent. Management  is very poor. Managers don't know what happens on the day to day and are very rude to their staff. Basically, if you don't want to be treated like a human being this would be a good fit."
bad,I don't want to write anything about current employer.  Can say it is impossible for work lfie balancing at this place. Management expects more always and expect to work on multiple projects.
bad,The advancement in this company is non existing unless you are well liked by managment. If you are well liked by the manger then you get promotions and company policies do not apply. Therefore it is a stressful place to work for!
bad,"Company offers a great work life balance"
bad,"Management having difficulty generating revenue so engaged in extreme cost cutting, including staff layoffs and relocation of jobs outside NY.  Company lacks energy among workforce and provides limited opportunities to advance.."
bad,Decent  benefits but not a lot of direction from upper management.  They are also outsourcing several jobs to India and overseas.  There really seems to be no overall direction.
bad,"There is little to no training at BNY and most of what you learn is how to navigate their ancient systems.  Lower level managers are mostly cool people but there's no oversight on the supervisors beneath them.  Upper management tend to be creeps that won't look at you or say hello when you pass them in the hall.  Your co-workers are usually nice people and everyone is desperately looking for a new job.  The salary is bottom of the barrel and there is likely no end to that in sight.  It's a company that values maximum profit at the lowest cost and shows no concern for the worker bees that help achieve it.  If you need to get your foot in the door it's good for that, otherwise I don't recommend coming to BNY."
bad,"BNY Mellon is a good place to start a career in Finance, however there are a lot of unfair labor practices in terms of diversity, and compensation."
bad,No comment.  I have not worked there in 10 years.  They got out of the retail sector because they were not good at it.  They were not willing to make the necessary investment to be successful.  The CEO at that time has since passed away so I can't approve of the current CEO.
bad,BNYM India was one of the best organisation in recent past. But now a days it's downfall started due to excess head count at one location.
bad,"There is no such thing as a typical day in Middle Office. You can walk in to a host of problems for example, systems have crashed and you are working from disaster recovery plans! Or your client has migrated from an internal platform and all their holdings are being transferred. I have learnt to always be prepared. That might be mean a more presurred day, being more risk aware, working to tighter deadlines, liasing with brokers/counterparties and custodians to ensure critical and high value trades settle. Every task you approach requires a different skill, this includes, urgency, effeciency, diligence and accuracy to name a few. "
bad,A great company with a poor culture at this particular site. Turnover is through the roof due to poor treatment of staff and the culture includes no promotion of associate development.
bad,"A very active environment. Working for a payment hub allowed me to see the manual process behind wire movements. Management allowed for opportunities to grow as a professional and seek mentors to further my knowledge with data scripting, and analytical reporting, regardless of my assigned role."
bad,BNY Mellon is an ok company.  Once BNY and Mellon merge the culture and the environment change.   In their learning process of trying to learn the NY Private Banking/Wealth Management business they really missed what is important not only to the employees but to the client base they serve
bad,"Lots of mischief and teasing from management, not a place for growth.  Condescending remarks from management in weekly staff meetings, non-team environment. Company does not care about its employees; all employees are expendable. This message is displayed regularly from management team."
bad,"I worked here as a temp, in the year I was employed with this company, the turnover rate was above 37% in my department (17 people that I know of in a company wide department of 46, cut to 43 before I left) and you can make of that what you will.  Though I will also say, that for a department of 10 employees and temps, there were 7 managers...so good luck with those TPS reports. "
bad,"This department has turned into one of the worst jobs I have ever had.  First off, most of the work that I do, at least, is mundane and rote, so if you want a job that stimulates your mind, this is not the place to go.  Furthermore, there has been a steady downgrade in respect for workers in terms of expectations and their basic rights.  We have been chronically under-staffed for months; it started in the fall, got steadily worse, and has only in the past month begun bringing in new employees.  At the same time, work loads have increased.  Yet employees have been expected to get it done in the same time frame, despite there being fewer people managing higher volume.  Plus there has been a steady stream of endless side projects which have taken people away from their work and cut into time further, and they were told to just neglect said work and do the side projects... then people would talk about why the work wasn't getting done.  As well as showing a deplorable tendency to not start those projects until the last minute.  In January, when things really took a turn for the worse, we were told we had to find and release a load of multiple thousand files in a couple weeks... and the message said the deadline had been established a good couple months ago.  Why wait so long to start working on it, then?"
bad,"the whole group's not play a team, some managers need to take some MGT classes to increase the awareness of proper conduct and effective communication with the whole team, not a select few."
bad,"Excellent manager, was an expert in his field and highly regarded.  His leadership style was unique and he motivated his employees. Was am excellent place to work at."
bad,"little to no advancement opportunities, managers typically have no clue how to motivate OR discipline people. You will not be financially compensated via paycheck OR other benefits.  I hate this company. If i think about it too hard i get sick to my stomach."
bad,A typical day is a lot of printing and receiving a ridiculous amount of emails that have nothing to do with you. You will only advance if they like you regardless of how hard you have worked. Have seen experienced people passed over for better positions because someone else was good friends with someone or related. Management says they listen but they don't. System goes down with no eta of when it will be fixed so there goes your work life balance because they expect you to stay until it comes back up. At times people have left the office close to 10 pm only to turn around and come back in for regular working hours. The reward two slices of pizza and get home safely.  The get home safely is an email from the managers that left and logged in from home.
bad,recognition and top down engagement is lacking. Departments can use more engagement to induce better teamwork
bad,"It all depends on the team you're joining. Management picks favorites and ignores the rest. If you want to advance your career and move ahead, get ready to suck up and be the teachers pet."
bad,"Training is a long process and once you learn it all, it becomes very repetative. Late nights."
bad,"If this were the last place to work on the planet, I would opt out. This company talks a good game about establishing work/life balance, having a culture of values and providing opportunities for advancement. But it's all smoke and mirrors. This company is consistently rated one of the worst places to work for -- and with good reason.  I only wish I had known that before accepting a position here."
bad,"BNY Mellon is a large bank with tentacles in a wide variety of businesses. The front line workers are underpaid, undervalued and completely detached from decision makers. There are so many levels of management, that it is difficult for anyone to know what is going on two levels from where one sits. There is a lack of accountability among the workers and the managers."
bad,"BNY Mellon is not the place for those seeking internal career advancement, a positive work-life balance and adequate compensation. It is a company that will run you into the ground and then demand more."
bad,"Run daily reports and process investment decisions and trades made by Investment Managers. If they are still working, you're still working. Systems were slow and unreliable. "
bad,"Tense, no sense of team work, Haven't met a happy co-worker yet."
bad,Great Place to work until the outsourcing started. No Job security
bad,"Working in the call center at this company was brutal. The managers were never willing to take escalated calls at the time they occurred, it was always, take the # and I will call them back. That does not sit well with a client who needs something fixed immediately and often led to heated callers. That is demoralizing and makes an employee feel worthless."
bad,"Fellow co-workers mainly from northeast coast of U.S. Lots of outsourcing done. Day consisted of answering phone, and email requests from programmers, clients, and system programmers. Ran scripts, and provided feedback. Monitored daily processing programs for problems, and resolved problems immediately. Maintained Remedy trackig system."
bad,"Not enough room for growth. No work life balance, compensation not comparable"
bad,"Some management that are still around from PNC days, are old school & not forward thinking. Would rather live in the past. Want to move forward, but get in thier own way. "
bad,You don't know when your position will be outsourced to another location.  The pay scale is very low compared to other companies in the same industry.
bad,Day to day processes processing and servicing various OTC Derivatives for various Clients and Investment managers. Learned a great deal. They offer a huge range of classes and courses you can take online through the company internal website which helps with you employee growth and skill set. Team culture. Biggest challenge is working providing higher level client service for all clients and challenging clients. I enjoy the team that i work with.
bad,"I had the privilege of working with highly intelligent people, however, the large corporation and old boys club mentality got in the way of actually applying new ideas and practices."
bad,"Too many deadlines, too much work with no recognition of any kind or additional pay. Very difficult to move throughout the company due to Human Resources staff and location. There is no mentor ship provided, Managers do not care about their employees. Seems like you only get ahead if you are buddies with the management. Dedicated, hard working employees that take initiative or regular basis do not get recognized, instead they receive more work load."
bad,BNY Mellon is a very challenging place to work. It is very mismanaged and layoffs are happening very regularly with no notice. There is no culture and no career advancement.
bad,This company is lack of employees' training with no respect internal and external customers.  Need to open well-trained employees programs for future.
bad,"I have never worked for a worse company. The management is abusive, unorganized and barely understand their employees daily functions. Procedures are outdated and training is nonexistent. The HR department is incompetent and barely qualify as a human resource department. Had a co-worker make racist comments about the validity of killing a person, and it was shrugged off."
bad,I wasn't happy at BNY MELLON. I do not think that they are good for a person's mental health. They have the wrong people in management roles. The turnover rate is very high. I would never return to work there.
bad,"Not organized place to work for, it depend on who you know to get you anywhere, and they play lots of favors between each others.Hardest part is dealing with politics at work"
bad,"i run operations. normally in morning deal with meetings on upcoming projects, issues, etc. end of day more around closing operations for NAV processing, end of day sign off, etc."
bad,Culture within specific team is isolated and prevents career growth. Management created a culture of intimidation where employees are afraid of stating their views out feR of retaliation.
bad,"In my 37 years, BNYM is the worst place I have ever worked at with he worst management and treatment of employees I have ever seen!"
bad,"I was told that my position - that I'd worked in for years - would become a more senior role once we had departmental leadership in place. Despite doing tasks outside the scope of my position, and multiple conversations asking to regrade and reassess my role, it was never done. I continued like this for over a year until I finally decided to look elsewhere. It was clear they had no plans of advancing me despite my success rate on project implementations, customer use satisfaction, proficiency, relationship building and willingness to go above and beyond in order to fulfill the needs of whatever project I was working on. My raises were terrible (less than 2%), didn't match the quality of work or job advancements I'd made without any formal recognition except good scores on my performance reviews and a ""job well done"" from my boss. I needed more, BNYM wouldn't give it to me, so I left."
bad,Worked with a group of people who were not happy at all. Nobody talked. It was awkward. 9 months in to the job and I think this one guy had said 3 words to me and I sat next to him for the whole 9 months. Everyone has their own clique and it felt like I was in High-school again.
bad,This is not a company committed to work life balance. The race is to find the cheapest candidate possible. Committment to diversity at executive management levels does not extend to persons of color.
bad,Stuck in the old ways that have bogged down the financial and banking industry for decades.  New leadership not working.  Compensation for in house promotions is horrid.  Core Employee base is sound and diverse/robust
bad,"In my position at BNY, the employees were treated more like robots than humans.  The culture needs to be less procedural to allow for growth and allowing workers to create solutions to problems."
bad,"This is your typical call center. You take lots of call, you sit with a manager once or twice a week to review your performance. It was just a normal call center."
bad,"Work on reports in the morning then process trades all day, work on corrections, research, adjustments. Answer clients questions. Train coworkers. Write up estimates, ongoing training."
bad,"Experience and Knowledge is not rewarded and upward movement is non existent. They will be having their largest layoff in history 1-14-19, and also have new people starting in newly created position which were not offered tot hose being let go"
bad,I went on and interview and it went fairly well. I was offered the position and when contacted by the recruiter I was informed they shortlined someone else. What bother me most if I did not communicate with the company I would have still be waiting.
bad,Lack of everything there -  temp position that wasn't enough to pay my bills.  Very slow paced and late hours that I didn't like.  Would not recommend .
bad,"I left because of the disarray and confusion and having six managers in three years."
bad,Leadership focus was purely on Expense management and employees were viewed as an annoyance.  Many leaders seemed to be checked out and waited for their leaders to tell them what to do.  The lack of decision makers made it very difficult to accomplish anything in a timely fashion.
bad,Long hours and responsibilities way beyond pay grade.  Despite that always made to feel like you 're not good enough.  Great culture and great talent but under appreciated and under paid by the business.
bad,"Their actions do not speak or line up any bit about what they portray themselves to be"
bad,"A typical day in the office is quite routine; however ther can be many challenges that come throughout the day. While the workplace atmosphere is friendly and the benefits are good, the amount of time invested in the employees is horrible. Even after expressed concerns to learn something new and seek advancement, it seems there is a halt and always an excuse as to why they can't increase the salary even though the sector is exceeding expectations, goals and profits."
bad,"Pros;"
bad,"Overall for the pay you could do much better somewhere else, micro managed and overall not a pleasant work environment.  My experience was not pleasant but I'm just one person."
bad,"very bad experience, systems were very old and didnt had any kind of automation."
bad,"Salary is not competitive. However, work time is flexible depending on manager. Horrible leadership and too much corporate politics. Simple daily tasks take too long to complete due to lack of teamwork."
bad,Stressful deadline driven environment where management often pass the buck. Poor compensation and career advancement option. Poorly run organisation - In Manchester anyway.
bad,"Job gets stagnant, boring "
bad,the above speaks for itself.  very stressful.  lack of leadership.  management is reactive and not proactive. it is crisis management.  no career advancement.
bad,"Poor management and antiquated technology, resources and tools are not available to do an adequate job. Going through significant cost cutting restructure"
bad,I worked for BNY as a bond broker. I had a  group bond dealers who would  place their inventories and inquires out to the street. I worked with other brokers who did the same and we would form markets for all the inventories and inquires we received .The culture was very collaborative because we all had the same goal to satisfy our customers
bad,They are over worked and under paid. I wish the environment wasn't so controversial. Great speed and accuracy. Must key at least 8000kph with 90% accuracy.
bad,"Typical day includes email correspondence , booking and modifying trades."
bad,"People are generally nice, lot of paid holidays, but getting recognition is difficult. Okay benefits, sub-standard pay, too many managers with fancy job titles."
bad,I was only a contract employee at this company but I was working on a project that required many hours and was badly managed.  We sat in an open cubicle environment which did not allow for any privacy and it was a very competitive job environment.
bad,Cost cutting and a focus on offshore employees has made BNY a less desirable company as an employee. This is a great company for a first job and opportunity to learn.
bad,Extremely deficient in process work. Constant reworking of work that was already reworked. There are days when you would need to fix and be graded on from management issues that come from other areas of the organization.
bad,"Located in downtown Pittsburgh, BNY Mellon is one of the areas largest employers.  Some good areas and some toxic areas, depends on your manager style."
bad,Plenty of hard working individuals. Very Casual dress code. Enjoyed my time working there. Benefits are very good. Pay and incentives could be better.
bad,"No two department collaborate. As a manager I was fighting with my department to get others to do their jobs to make ours easier--to no avail."
bad,In my experience I received little support from management  and did not feel there was much opportunity for advancement.  Technology was behind business standards.  No formal training programs - mostly self starting hand s on required.
bad,"After initial morning duties, not enough work to stay busy. Management struggles to find work to look busy. All work is moving to India soon. Not a good invironment or culture there."
bad,"Terrible management, no experience in leadership, very uneducated. Sharp millennials are very threatening to them."
bad,"The job pays just enough to make you think twice about leaving, but does little in terms of career advancement and potential.  This might be different in different parts of the company, but this is also symptomatic of a bigger problem - lack of internal mobility (on your own terms)."
bad,Assist shareholders and financial advisors with transactions and account maintenances. Relay information about our investment products and options to current shareholders and prospective buyers
bad,"BNYMellon is a mediocre place to work but it does not foster talent or enable a work life balance.  While a solid company, it's conservative approach has negatively impacted innovation and efficiency."
bad,Provided an opportunity to develop skills that hopefully will lead to future growth and advancement.  Culture changes are coming...
bad,Don't know how to treated their employee and its like being in a bad relationship with someone they need a whole new management team.
bad,"Don't pay enough, infrequent and very low raises, no room for advancement, seems senior management are all yes people. The work itself is not too strenuous."
bad,"I have been at BNY Mellon for 10 yrs. The company is Ok overall."
bad,"It clearly depends on the department you are in, however there are clear differences.  One of the most important is the lack of training provided in many areas which makes for a difficult work environment.  It's not at all a bad place to start off your working career, however there is little room for advancement in the Southern offices."
bad,Long hours.. No bonuses no work life balance...Manual everything..They will not spend on technology.. Everyone there is unhappy... The most miserable place I have ever worked.
bad,BNY offers little to nothing in compensation. Don't even pretend you'll ever get a raise or a chance to move up in the company.
bad,Company needs much improvement.  The current transition is not going smoothly.  The stock is in play with several Hedge Funds that are squeezing management.
bad,increasingly poor morale and declining employee engagement
bad,Work life balance in BNY is good but salary is low and raises are rare and small. Hard to make a career with this company. My advice is to get your entry level experience and look for another job as soon as you can.
bad,"there was no opportunity for advance, stay one place."
bad,"- Poor compensation"
bad,There is a lot of information that needs to be learned at the company. They put you through a long training session but it doesn't actually cover much of the real information that you need to go through. There is always a lot of confusion and the management will tell you different things depending on who you ask. There is a lot of overtime to be had during tax time. Mostly management says one thing but when you try to complete it and ask questions they blatantly ignore you. The main focus is call scores and not actual quality. When they want things done they want it done on your breaks or lunches and you have to be there 10-15 minutes early everyday just to log into your computer and have it set up which you do not get paid for and if you log onto your phone after the 10-15 minutes that you were there you are considered late even though you were actually there on time.The people are very friendly.
bad,"Nice people. Check the box mentality. Not very creative. Work/life balance is good. People spend alot of time maintaining status quo. As long as things don't change, there's no overtime needed, no stress."
bad,This is not a place for a young and excited businessman. The type of management at BNYMellon want a person who will be a repeat of themselves. Not a progressive thinker and growing mind. They are many years behind the market trends and are risk adverse to the fullest extent. If you want a place to come to work and don't want to advance this is the place for you. If you want to try and do better do not waste your time here. They will take and take and then kick you out once they realize you've figured out the heirarchies.
bad,"co-workers are good but management is not. job is not hard at all, just have to pay attention to detail."
bad,This place doesn't care about employees. You will forever be a body in a seat and you will be micro managed with terrible hours. You have to start as a temp and be there at minimum 1 yr and a few months to become perm.
bad,My review of the least rewarding job of my life and the recognition i received was surmountable to that of receiving a spam email from your local council electorate
bad,Very high call center volume time never be late at all  managers don’t only crictize of the work very unappreciated if the employees and lot of miscommunication
bad,"I'm hopeful that not all departments are run the same way. I'm inclined to believe they are not, as most other people seem genuinely happy within their departments. I can only speak for what I experienced in my department and can therefore only give a review based on that not on the company as a whole. Task procedures are written in elementary school format with pictures and illustrations. Management is not engaged with the people in the department. Employees are not permitted to display frustration or discuss issues that may arise with each other. Issues discussed with management are not resolved."
bad,"A big, ancient, bureaucratic company struggling to keep up with modernization and struggling against a prolonged period of suboptimal conditions in the business sectors that make them the most profit."
bad,"The pay is extremely low. Your chances of advancing to a higher salary are also extremely low. The company is so cheap that even if you are a super worker who goes way above and beyond regular duties (even beyond the scope of current managements knowledge and ambition), they only allow you to increase one salary grade and you have to stay in the position for an entire year. Benefits are basically useless and they are insanely expensive."
bad,"Significant culture change happening. Management has staff walking on eggshells. Pay is subpar, and benefits are getting worse. Place for average employees; if you don’t rock the boat and do as you’re told, no matter what, they’ll leave you alone."
bad,"This job was very simple and straightforward, so expectations were understandably pretty tame. With that said, "
bad,"The work is challenging enough to keep you there and interested.  The pay in pretty rough.  I would stay away if you have a better option.  However, I have to say the people I work with are down to earth and nice."
bad,The environment has changed significantly over the last few years.  There have been a number of initiatives to reduce headcount which has lead to a lot of overworked people.  There is a lot of tension and the work environment has become less than desirable.
bad,Work was great.  I enjoyed it.  Got along with everyone.  Then one day my boss called me almost in tears to tell me they had to let me go.  I later found out Mellon laid off so many people it was news worthy.
bad,Have trouble managing employees not in New York.  They believe employees not in New York cannot be trusted.  Most of the work is assigned to employees in NY.  Remote sites get work NY does not want to do.
bad,I was employed through a recruiter for a three month contract to possible employment at Bank of New York Mellon. This was my first job in an office setting and I was very excited for the change. My manager was a really nice guy and the new recruits in my class were all very nice as well. The training was two weeks witch was a relief for me because it would give me a little time to adapt to the new environment. The support specials job was not competitive because it wasn't sales based and the all the transactions are based on market time so that is when the majority of our work load was taking place. the computer system yo file and store transactions was a model from the early 90s so it was also very easy to adapt to. I think the reason I didn't fall in love with this line of work is because I do find finance can be a little dry and the lack of competition or excitement of a victory wasn't really there.
bad,"My manager was great, just his manager was awful did a lot of sneaky things behind other managers backs. He also had alot of favoritism but I learned a lot because my manager made sure we learned new things."
bad,"They were not understanding of the need for family life. They compensated well, however, frequent layoffs cause a lot of stress because you are always fearing you will lose your job."
bad,"If you're looking to work here, plz if you can find another opportunity. One if the worst managed, and the most pathetic treatment to the employees in the industry. Ask anyone who works here to tell you how they feel about the org, honestly. Yes, you getting free meal card, but you want to eat the food that's served. Yes, you get free transport, but you'll never get a cab in time. And by not in time, I mean 1 to 2 hrs late. If you are fine waiting and cribbing with the transport to get you a cab after working your off through the day, you can do fine here. Neither they'll pay you handsomely. So considered everything, you are going to have the worst job exp of your life."
bad,"Good company albeit positions change often due to branches outside of NY, example positions could relocate to Pittsburgh of Florida.  Technology is not up to date."
bad,"- Peu opportunité de carrière (mauvais management + très politisé)"
bad,"BNY Mellon is a very fast paced and career progressing establishment. There are so many workers that they under pay their employees. The setting is quiet, yet can be dull at times."
bad,"Benefits good 401k good . Management is out of touch no communication, no meetings.  Poor work environment, poor moral. Salaries are low and annual increases are low."
bad,On the conversion team there is work to be done or no work at all. The management team is not clear on what they expect and the requirements change from time to time with no new instructions. The management team also does not respect one another causing the environment and culture of the team to be aggressively competitive.
bad,"At the time I was at BNY Mellon the median age in the office was about 25. A lot of young professionals starting a new career and in most cases families. Management was based on seniority and the office culture was high stress do to turnover and deadlines. There was also comfort in knowing that if you learn your work type and worked with minimal errors there was job security and work autonomy.  The hardest part of the job was multiple deadlines, and the period when part of the work was over seas. The most enjoyable part was work-mates and safe working atmosphere."
bad,"Not the best company to work at, but depends on the department and managers of that particular department. No respect for employees. Promotions are because of the connections not achievements."
bad,"Depends heavily on department and manager, but progress can be stymied by upper managers trying to protect themselves. May be different under the new CEO and leadership."
bad,"I would not recommend this company as there was only lateral moves with no additional compensation available. Management was poor and similar positions at other banks had salaries of $10,000 more than BNY Mellon.  A common joke in the company was that if you wanted a raise, you would have to go to PNC and come back to get it.  BNY did not prioritize keeping talent in-house and instead hire consistently advanced or upper level positions for outside of the company."
bad,Enjoy my current position however there is no room for advancement with in the department or location I am currently employed at. Better communication with upper management would be helpful.
bad,"Interned in Securities Lending."
bad,"The company spent 3 years deciding how to merge BoNY and Mellon Bank.  Lots of people were laid off."
bad,"This is a good company to get experience, but it does not have value for the long term employee.  It has also lost the value and focus of the Pittsburgh campus as it continues to migrate managerial roles to New York city."
bad,There are so many companies and so many things to remember it's impossible to know it all.  Very stressful one call after the other.  Breaks and lunches have to be rescheduled because you are on the phone and you could have lunch and two breaks the last 3 hours of your work day.
bad,The company is currently outsourcing 60 percent of it's transfer agent work force. That along with quarterly layoffs and the occasional off cycle job action make it a very uncomfortable place to work.
bad,"Although the benefits are good, overall I would not recommend. There is no room for advancement. You may train upper management on how to do their job. There is a lack of work ethic from co-workers who spend all day on the internet and running out of the office for no reason. The management is very poor and does not hold people accountable for their actions."
bad,"Not a terrible place, but very low compensation and pennies pinched wherever they can.  Benefits seem to get worse every year.  Workplace culture is decent,  most people are friendly."
bad,"A typical day: come to work, do the work, go home. Most of the managers have no idea what their teams does or where their place is in the department; therefore, cannot manage the team in an efficient way. For me the hardest part was trying to develop further in the company as the management will only let you move on internally if it suits them."
bad,"Once the merger happened, The Bank of New York took over. The only reason people stay here are for the benefits (vacation and tuition reimbursement).  Pay is decent at the higher levels but once you get there, you are a target for the layoffs that seem to be never-ending."
bad,Not worth the headache.  The job was nice to begin with but then management decisions derailed that.  It is a job nothing more.  Not worth stating long term.
bad,The managers are pretty rigid. There are no advancement opportunities. I never received a raise after working there for over a year. I ended up leaving and I don't regret it.
bad,work was good. the co workers were very friendly and fun to be around. The management did not have  great grasp on the culture in the office however which was detrimental to morale
bad,"BNY is a very bland company from my experience. Though the people are all very nice and helpful, this place should really only be used as a stepping stone or somewhere to end your career. Benefits are decent, pay is very low, and there is essentially no recognition for employees doing a good job. They need more incentives to get people to look forward to coming to work everyday, otherwise it'll stay the way it is with the entire staff complaining day in and day out."
bad,"I had the advantage of having worked at The Bank of New York prior to the Mellon merger. Regrettably, the merger had a negative impact on career growth, compensation and job security. In the time I was employed at BNYM, I saw over one hundred jobs lost due to their outsourcing initiative."
bad,BNY Mellon does not know what to do with its Investment Management Unit. In the year and a half that I worked for BNY Mellon as a contractor I saw 7 members of the executive staff quit or be fired.
bad,Was taught the whole system wrong and didn't know what I was doing half of the time. Had a person who was a babysitter but never seemed to help us when really needed it.
bad,Time at the company was short so it's hard to provide a fair review of the company but wasn't impressed with the time spent there. The job was boring and there wasn't much to do.
bad,It was an ok place to learn new skills and apply what you have learned to the industry. Colleagues  assisted each other when needed.
bad,"THE BANK OF NEW YORK WAS A LAID BACK PLACE TO WORK THAT WAS UNTIL!!!! THEY MERGED WITH MELLON! THEY HAD A RESTING ROOM THAT WAS FILLED WITH OLD COUCHES AND BUGS! WHAT'S BETTER THAN THAT?"
bad,"At one time a great place to work, however due to increasing management changes, reorganization and lack of direction from senior management has created a significant moral problem within the company."
bad,There are plenty of opportunities and it is not the highest paying by any means available. In order to move up here you are basically required to job jump. So you can learn and excel but if you want promoted you need to switch departments and basically start over. This could be considered a good thing for those who don't mind it and want to learn the numerous fields they have to offer.
bad,BNY mellon provided me with a good opportunity to learn the way to do business in the financial services industry. Was able to develop my skills and work in a team environment.
bad,"Every employee was just a cog turning their own wheel. Not a great place for career advancement, only good for recent college grad looking for that first bit of experience for the resume."
bad,"Poor management, no room for progress within teams, low salary for amount of work, unfairness between management and employees underneath and favoritism, very stressful, long days"
bad,little or almost no room for advancement for growth due to budget constraints and inherent corporate culture/ set-up
bad,"Met some awesome people at this place!  Wonderful benefits.  Slow to promote, minimal merit increases."
bad,"Reconciling Unit, Cash, Market Value, Income Receivable variances, checking and correcting system errors in reporting and technology.  Delivering financial reporting packages to clients on a monthly, quarterly, and yearly basis to file with the NAIC.  Use of accounting system software, Word, Excel, Access, Outlook applications."
bad,I hated it their very stressful and to fast. Unable to make any human errors
bad,The place is closed to my house. It is very convenient
bad,My department works as a team and we all get along very well together.
bad,"It was a nice place to start, but there isn't much in terms of compensation, advancement, or other opportunities. The managers do not know how to manage. They emphaisize poor perforrmers will be dealt with, yet never do."
bad,"management was horrible,communicating skills are not good overall the benefits were great."
bad,Not the best place to work at least in my department. Some layoffs and hard to advance. I don't have anything else to say but I need to get to the character limit so here we are.
bad,"The compensation is not the best. I am going on 9 years with the company and was extremely lucky to get the promotions I have received. Unless you jump around departments, you really don't get promoted. I have to work OT all the time in order to make extra money, because this location's pay scale is not the best. I find the atmosphere very unprofessional, the staffing all over the place, and the management ok. Some departments are better than others. There is supposed to be a dress code yet people wear anything from jeans and a t-shirt or sweatshirt to shirt and tie atire. They are laying off constantly and most of the work is now going overseas. The company is cheap and truly does not care about its employees. I've never received a bonus either."
bad,A good company to attain entry level employment.  The company is large and there are many banking related positions.  A good place to start competing for better opportunities.
bad,I feel Like they do not train the staff for a lot of different things in the workplace. I for example is limited to what I do all night. And I don't think it is fair.
bad,"pay is low. it's a kinda safe place as your first job after school, but it's not a place i would get stuck in for a long time. pay is low and raises are rare and small."
bad,CEO is changing the lay out of the workspace and looking for employees to have more of a say by challenging the status quo when it comes to employee contribution.
bad,"BNY has the potential to be a great FinCo. They have good IT people but lack the proper structure and direction. If you are looking for work and not much concern about your personal, family life, this is the place for you."
bad,"The culture dramatically changed during my tenure.  Upon my hire Portfolio Managers were focused on client satisfaction, of which my client satisfaction scores were in excess of 92% satisfied.     At the end the focus was on sales and our office traditionally missed sales goals which created more focus on the process which was driven by the Sales Directors and less on client service."
bad,I believe BNY Mellon is average in every way possible. From the upper management to the compensation. There is absolutely nothing that makes this company stand out.
bad,Company has a rich history but no sense of mission or urgency to respond to client needs or marketplace developments.  Senior management is shuffled too often leaving the workers bewildered.
bad,Good starter job. Doesn’t pay well so learn what you can about corporate life and processes and get out.  Raises and bonuses are low if any are given. Good places to stay if your spouse makes bank because the time-off is decent and you won’t be over burdened with work.
bad,The salary is not comparable to other places.  Worklife balance is good depending on the department you may work in and who your reporting managers may be.
bad,"I do credit BNY Mellon for being ambitious and to pay visions that resonate with clients early on. The organization, however, falls so short of being able to execute and realize any parts of their vision. It is a NY / Wall Street culture characterized by more focus on competitive interactions. There are many talented people to work with and learn from. Unfortunately, the good ones don't last, frustrated or dis-intermediated. There is some bias to NY and NJ and employees working out of those facilities have a better change of remaining relevant."
bad,The medical plan is very expensive and the company recently discontinued contributions to the Pension Plan  
bad,"Senior management has got to go. Rude, conniving, sneaky, lying, sabotaging, manipulative, illiterate. No ownership when mistakes are made someone else has to and will take the fall."
bad,Coworkers will go behind you back to management. Very political kind of position where many individuals are underhanded and do ot care much about individuals.
bad,Management can be swing or miss. The constant turnover creates chances for advancement but the salary (like any non- sales institutional banking position) is poor.
bad,"As good as government company, with all politics, no ethics, No HR involvement, only buttering helps here. perks are good. bonus is best part. Should join at old age. However lost charm since 2010. not event in top 100 of best place place to work."
bad,"I would not recommend working in Income/Tax in Asset Servicing for a young, motivated, and educated professional. As an income/tax specialist you are pretty much a processor and there is no room for creativity."
bad,"good company to start your career, with very good life/work balance-stay no longer then 3 years.There is no room to grow-constant changes/relocations"
bad,"A typical day is review general ledger, cash and positon reconcilation and approving NAV. The hardest part of Jobs is meeting deadlines with limited staff. Limited help from manager when short of staff."
bad,GIS of PNCBank was sold to BNY Mellon.  I continued to convert data from GIS to BNY Mellon systems.  I was displaced by BNY Mellon after 13 months.
bad,"Working as an Operations Executive. Comprehensive problems solving abilities, excellent verbal and written Communication skills, ability to deal with people diplomatically willingness to learn, curiosity to know facilitator."
bad,"my work day would be filled with lots of corrections, i learned more about the business of banking. i have been in lockbox for years and working in the financial world it has enabled me to work great with numbers and be apart of a team"
bad,"I have enjoyed my managerial experience at BNY, but would like a career/company with better career growth opportunities and better raises/bonuses."
bad,"A typical day consists of sitting at the computer dealing with multi-million dollar wire transfers. That's about as much as I can sum it up, because no two people do the same thing each day. That also makes it difficult to ever get help if you are overloaded. Most of the co-workers I worked with hated the place, and that was not motivating at all. The managers (not all, but most) do not even bother to greet you or introduce themselves to you. I worked here for 3 months and neither of the two managers who worked in my office ever introduced themselves to me. I'm a very motivated and positive person, so it was difficult for me to be in such a negative environment."
bad,"The workplace is not very good. Management does not get involved in issues that arise. No room for advancement. Overall, I give the company as a whole a 5 out of 10."
bad,"You can come in and work 8 hours, like some in our office, or you can work for about 3 total and walk around the rest of the day and no one says a word. You can make mistakes and never get written up for them."
bad,"My typical day includes: going outside for a coffee and a bagel, printing out necessary documents, analyzing Excel spreadsheets (formulas, figures), using various internal systems to verify numbers, putting client presentations together, and manipulating data in Excel for specific projects."
bad,"Although I loved the work itself, I was harassed by co-workers from the moment I was hired to the day I left. I sought professional help from in-house and outside sources. I attended behavioral therapy to ensure I was not the problem. I took all of the proper steps with management and in the end they were ineffective at handling the abuse. Many unqualified personnel spent the majority of the day visiting in cubes and gossiping loudly while a handful of individuals handled the workload. HR was in a remote location and failed to solve the issues. Other departments took issue with mine and it became immediately clear, that our department was to blame. This was, without a doubt, the most unprofessional staff I have ever worked with in any capacity."
bad,"Good start to get into the financial services industry, but there is not much room to advance, poor merit increase that do not keep up with rate of inflation along with being postponed for 3 months."
bad,"There was never down time, if you spend too much time in ""after call"" you get talked to but if you don't finish after call notes you aren't in compliance. Extra training for more responsibilities will be voluntold to you, but there will be no extra compensation for the additional skills you offer. It's OK if you like answering the phone for 8 hours straight."
bad,"Not happy with job security. They need to improve the leadership quality of Lead and Managers.Too much of politics in company."
bad,"Took 2 hours to complete the full day's work with a work day consisting of 7 hours.  Other 5 hours were downtime.  Too many people in certain groups with not enough work to do.  Company over hires and heavily underpays.  In 10 years working there, my compensation went up $8000 total and that is with consistent above average performance reviews.  Anything learned here is useless outside of the company."
bad,"if you need a job in banking then this is a place I guess. if you have any other options on the table then please take it. I would like to call working here the dark ages of my professional career however, I did meet pretty nice people... and that's the only positive thing I will remember."
bad,"A very stressful fast paced environment, not a good place to work. Very rude people to work with, a lot of turnover, very picky about who they hire. Management was poor, no job advancement at all. "
bad,Its ok but very stressful seeing how you are working in the back office for mutual funds there is no room for error. If you happen to make a mistake it can cost a lot of money
bad,"Although many opportunities are placed in front of you to advance, once you are ready to move forward there are always “strings attached” to keep you in your current job. And if you happen to advance, if you are needed in you old position, they will lot hesitate to move you back to you old job at the company."
bad,Frequent layoffs - staff lives in constant fear of being laid off.  No learning opportunities offered to onshore employees.  No opportunity for advancement.
bad,"As a contractor, I saw and heard many stores about BNY Mellon, and much of it was vindicated.  However, it is clear that there is no sense of team, and everyone has a gripe with one another."
bad,"Had issues with management, they seem to be very unprofessional.  Low pay grade in this department of the bank.  Your work keeps getting piled on once you are comfortable with what they originally gave you.  Other employees in the department are very friendly."
bad,Good place to start out.  Great people to work with and good culture.  Benefits were solid but pay was terribly low and poor work life balance.  Few opportunities for advancement.
bad,"Low compensation, no job security and hard to advance.  You can work hard but little recognition only good thing is coworkers"
bad,This is an okay employer.  I really do not have any comments about this employer.  The operations center is located near O'Hare airport.  They have other locations in the downtown area.
bad,"Co Workers are great,  great place to learn, Culture is changing and so is financial industry. Not replacing employees, leaving current employees to do more with less."
bad,As like any company the person makes the place not the company makes you. The company has its up and down as any other. I enjoyed time at BNY Mellon and seen it through many mergers. It was time to move on.
bad,My 4 weeks of training consisted of listening to calls. I did not learn the systems or basic call handling scenarios until i was on the phone. It was frustrating and disappointing.
bad,"Great team mates and work life balance but horrible benefits and pay. I love my job, great relationship with my manager but company is very cheap."
bad,I started out there in mutual funds custody and it was my first job out of school.  After a month I was bored but stuck it out for a full year and was able to make connects with my future employer though it. There isn't much to move up to when there.
bad,Dealt with building book of business and acquiring new clients and building existing relationships.
bad,Productive daily work. Management frowns upon entry level employees. Coworkers are professional most of the time. Hardest part of the job is working through the disrespect by supervisors and management on a daily basis.
bad,"The work is the same for the most part day in and day out, and can become very monotonous."
bad,"Door reorganisaties staan veel banen op de tocht. "
bad,Good Company to get your feet wet at the start of your career.
bad,"There are many positives and negatives at BNY Mellon. The positives are in the benefits and ease of mind on a daily basis. With an hour break I can establish a routine to work out and get other errands done throughout the week."
bad,"Manage Leave of Absence cases for Lockheed Martin employees"
bad,"Daily cashflows and Monthly Investor Reports"
bad,"Over all friendly environment, but very serious. "
bad,"I have worked at Mellon/BNYMellon for close to 13 years now in different aspects. With each department I have been involved, there are caring, determined people who work for the common goal of making the company what it is. It has been easy to work with the people in each department, but it has become increasingly frustrating to maintain skills when management wants everyone to learn more than what they can handle."
bad,"Management was not effective at communication. Easy job, great benefits, great time off."
bad,"Poor pay, management style is very strict."
bad,"Richardson Location; Benefits are probably the only thing keeping me there. Employees dont stay long, management is rude and likes to pick favorites, hours aren't set at all, all shifts run differently."
bad,"Nice people, bad management, no promotions, reasonable work load, balanced work/life time, work from home, huge free parking, shuttle to train station."
bad,"A typical day at work start with team meetings to accommodate the Offshore teams. The team collaboration meetings takes half of the day. I enjoyed working on different technology and learned a lot. There is no job security, the company do layoffs quarterly regardless of the employee performance."
bad,"There is nothing remarkable to share regarding BNY Mellon. Salary and benefits are average. "
bad,The company does  train employee technique skills but every a few weeks  you need to spend more than a hour for some company policies. Using Old technologies. No team work.
bad,"BNYM is a very top heavy organization with limited opportunities for advancement. It is filled with an aging workforce running out the clock to retirement. The compensation is below average for the industry. However, the benefits are solid and the work/life balance is great."
bad,"BNYM is a good place to start career, gain experience but not a place to stay forever. Career advancement is non-existent, raises are very low (almost a joke) , no bonuses and management only looks out for themselves."
bad,Since purchasing PNC BNY has laid off so many employees. Job isecurity and employee mural has been very low since the purchase.  I was able to work form home and enjoyed that benefit until I was laid off.
bad,"I did like my workplace up to a certain point.  It was formerly PFPC, Inc which I loved and then was taken over by PNC Global Investments.  That was okay too.  But in 2013 Bank of NY Mellon bought out PNC and many changes took place.  While I embrace change to keep things fresh and helps you grow and develop skills along the way, the outsourcing was a very difficult concept to grasp.  I survived two corporate takeovers, one outsourcing and did not survive the last outsourcing round.  Both jobs (entire department) went to India."
bad,Company with good work life balance. If someone is interested in finance then this is the right company. Management is average where everything is handled by Manager and HR intervention is minimal.
bad,"this can be a great job if your lifestyle fits for this role. but vacation restriction, given the opportunity to learn new skill hinder for this being a good job for me so I left"
bad,"I interned for one summer on the trading floor and thought it was a great learning experience. However, they are one of the lower paying companies in the industry."
bad,They let people get away with being Rude to eachother. If you have information about anothe employee that could hurt the reputation of the company don't bother saying anything to HR. They will find reasons to let you go.
bad,Majority of the employees were friendly and helpful. Some of the supervisors would get upset if you could not stay if there was no notice given ahead of time. Some departments would send their work over to our department if it was close to time for them to go so that they would not have to stay.
bad,"The company is very Wall St., as to be expected when dealing with a mutual fund transfer agent. However, on the side of compassion for their workers, I give them a less then admirable rating. I worked for this company for 14 years, ( it changed hands from bank to bank a few times during my employment) They are NOT very family friendly with regard to my situations. I went through a VERY difficult time in my life (losing loved ones, and an injury that happened to me), and I was fired because my perfomance slipped, due to the personal reasons I was going through."
bad,"Busy, easy work.  Management wants to work you to death though. Always asked to stay late to finish for someone else's mess up. Pay is not worth it. Not appreciated"
bad,"No room or opportunities for growth if you start as an assistant. Once you're an assistant, that is all they see you as no matter how smart or skilled you are at other tasks."
bad,"Very tough to get promoted.  Growth is less about ones work and work ethic.  Learning, training etc. limited offerings available or approved if external. Lags in technology."
bad,"Overall experience of working at Bank of New York Mellon, Pune was good. The work culture is good with supportive team. However, some senior management members were biased."
bad,"Once you know what you're doing, all is good. People are helpful when you're in a jam and need extra help."
bad,"I would rate this as a good job to get your foot in the door, but not good for long term work. Healh insurance is horrible, and you don't get paid the right amount for the work load you do. The only good benefit they have is 4 months paid time off for maternity leave."
bad,"Would not recommend it to anyone looking for a happy, appreciative work place. Very high turn over. Nothing is confidential and getting promoted to another position is nearly impossible."
bad,"Manager of Corporate Trust client portfolios, overseeing services for the clients, monitoring of debt covenants, and various contractual obligations. Working daily with underwriters, rating agencies, auditors, investors, paying agencies and insurers to help clients drive business growth and maximize impact"
bad,"Took away our stock options that we used to get when we were still in NY"
bad,"for the most part working at BNY Mellon was very laid back, typical day was keying items interacting with coworkers eating and working as a team the supervisor made my life difficult with her intimidating attitude"
bad,"Making me do this review is dumb, I hate working there. I don't want to fill this out. It doesn't matter that it's anonymous. The star rating should be enough."
bad,"Very cut-throat environment with a ""you should know this"" atmosphere. There is a reluctance to educate others. Compensation is will below the median for any given position at BNY when compared to positions from competitors."
bad,"Opened incoming mail from post office, identify negotiable of checks, entered total amount of checks, set aside for QC.Also input correct payee into system."
bad,No job security. There are lots of layoff rumors. The managers lack management skills and there is no training offered. Little career development. The work/life balance is good.
bad,Good place for recent college grads. Tough to move up the ladder. Can be very monotonous. Ok if you like cube farms. basic 9-5 hours
bad,If your looking for a job that will take you back to cliques of high school BNYM is the place for you. Hours are sometimes flexible.
bad,Not a lot of room for advancement or the best pay. Friendly co- workers though an managers willing to help you exceed. Had to work a lot of unpaid overtime.
bad,This company was a typical corporate structure. My job was pretty low on the totem pole so I was just a worker bee. Nothing more. Not many incentive besides money.. if that
bad,The company has very bad office culture where the senior employees gang up on new employees. The hour was very bad and lunch is fixed on 3pm every day.
bad,"Hedge Fund Administrator.  Process subscriptions, redemptions, transfers. Money movement. Ensure anti-money laundering requirements are met and paperwork is in good order. Communicate with the client and selling agents verbally and written."
bad,If you want to be taking advantage of and feel unvalued then this is the place for you. Sales runs this place so you do what they want regardless.
bad,Multi- task work environment. Learned many computer programs. Management unconsistent. Co-workers were great to stab you in the back. Defending yourself when you were right and just. Going home every day.
bad,"Perform daily checking of foreign exchange rates, manual price input, price exception validation, market to market pricing and stale price review for a variety of clients. Understand the theoretical/technical nature of all security, expense and fund types on fund accounting platform. Prompt and accurate processing of security set-ups and daily update of management information system (MIS) information. Work collaboratively and on a timely basis with managers to review operational controls, conduct root-cause analysis and implement remediation activities emanating from operating incidents and near-miss events.Understand the key operational risks and the associated controls applicable to the Business Unit and follow all Business Unit operational procedures and other directive controls"
bad,"Same exact thing every month.  Management had absolutely no direction.  Do not promote their employees very often.  When you do get promoted, you salary adjustment delayed anywhere from 6 months to a year."
bad,Was responsible for coordinating the system implementation for the Foreign Exchange CLS system.  After Implementation rsponsiblultiy included updating static data and system secdurity.  Also coordinated with new customers to use the Banks system for FX currency settlement.
bad,"•Support small as well as the large business line departments, with management reports "
bad,"Being a large financial institution, the bank was under pressure due to low interest rates and new regulatory expenses, but management and the operating teams were highly focused on execution and delivering a high level of service.  Business are very much in flux as the bank tries to align itself to a difficult operating environment."
bad,Struggling bank with poor leadership. Clique type environment. A typical day entailed working with antiquated systems and a declining workforce and being expected to produce better and better results.
bad,"Could be managed better: More acknowledgement of good work done, improved training needs."
bad,"*Servicing paper back files-over 200 per day"
bad,"Management at BNY Mellon is lacking across many groups.  What makes that worse is that management at higher levels seems to turn a blind eye to lower level management's inefficiencies.  When working with groups other than my own, I find myself doing other peoples work for them so that I can maintain a high level quality to my own work and reporting.  I can see projects that will build revenue for the company falling apart daily because the management is not handling employees as it should.  I feel that this will result in lost clientele and ultimately a significant downturn of the Asset Servicing side of the business for which I currently work."
bad,The company is undergoing difficult financial situation and has layoffs every six months.
bad,A place where one has to be able to adapt to constant change. The best part about this company is the work/life balance.
bad,"Productive and fast past work environment with daily very timely deadlines. However with seniority, able to manage daily task consistently and accurately."
bad,"high stress, continuing changing environment with poor compensation"
bad,Stone age management. The company is overwhelmed with its mergers and acquisitions and does not focus on living up to its mission statement.
bad,There are barely any opportunities to get promoted. Projects that are given to us to perfect are later taken away and reassigned to a different department that is more cost efficient.
bad,My job consists of daily process. We receive a large amount of emails that need to be looked at on a daily basis. We process trades every day based on what the client provides.
bad,"A lot of micro-managing going on, NO RESPECT, they talk to you any kind of way. The RR's are DIRTY !!!! They maintenance man comes at the end of the night basically."
bad,"BNY Mellon was a great place to work, however, with the department being relatively new, there was no procedures, and everything was ad-hoc"
bad,The bank was a good learning experience but after 10 plus years I was laid off and was replaced by marginal workers being paid half of my base yearly salary.
bad,"A typical day at work includes multi tasking between running the day to day operations, overseeing the tasks performed by the offshore team, supporting the other departments with other daily reconciliation functions, problem solving any potential issues that may arise, testing of new systems and supervising the accountants. I have learned to work effectively and efficiently through automating any manual processes that we and the offshore team may have been performing. In turn, seeing the time savings.Team work has been crucial in completing the different projects that the team has been assigned. The hardest part of the job is making sure the projects assigned are given the correct priority, so as not to make any projects become urgent. The most enjoyable parts of the job is interacting with the Client, different departments internally, the custodian, building trust and lasting working relationships."
good,Management does not inform staff. people really just stay to themselves. being able to go in and just do your job. Management does not have a clue on your job duties.
good,Major company it is but room for growth or salary increases it isn't. This company is job security all the overtime you could ask for...
good,"Job Work/Life Balance, Compensation/Benefits Job, Security/Advancement ,Management, Job Culture"
good,Too political. I a contractor. I was never offered a job interview but people straight out of college with no work experience were hired over me. However; BNY Mellon kept extending my contract every 3 months.
good,"High standards"
good,There is a clear lack of work disbursement between groups within the company.  A group of 10 to 15 people perform all the work in a unit of 200+ meanwhile the senior management team understands very little of who performs what functions.
good,"Daily workload was consistent."
good,"There is a lot to be desired, some people may like the kind of culture where you progress on the basis of knowing people and how you come across and not on the basis of your skills and knowledge."
good,"When I started at BNY Mellon I was put into a department which just implemented a new manager with two new liaisons, which is the second in the chain of command.  Liaisons are supposed to help the processors, which is what I was brought in to do.  My liaison on a daily basis could not help me so I started working with my manager and he helped me greatly in my training process, however the manager has tons to do, that is why a liaison is so important.  So it was me and another young guy thrown onto a team that consisted of a new manager, two new liaisons, and the young guy and me.  We both started around the same time, and that was it, nobody with any experience at there respective position.  The first month I did very little and was mostly left by myself.  I would train with my liaison for an hour or two, not understand it and then have to bother my manager.  This went on until my temp contract was up 3 months later.  Then they must have figured that it was time I got some actual work and gave me more responsibilities.  This was fine, but when I did not know how to do something my liaison would ask my manager and I would have to wait until he was free.  I am not kidding when I say sometimes it took days before an issue was solved by my manager, all the while my liaison would be doing nothing.  Liaisons basically look at a problem and are supposed to help processors fix it because they have at least 5 years experience, my liaison would look at it for a couple minutes and say you better ask the manager.  I am tempted to use the word lazy.  Then the other liaison who worked with"
good,BNY is a grate place to start to career for fresher who have just completed their degree education.
good,"I was hired as a contract worker with the promise of full-time (of course, as long as things went well).  I was never given that chance.  The contract position was task-based, with no opportunity to manage personal work flow or set/meet goals.  Tasks were assigned and then withdrawn after just a few hours."
good,"short staffed, no flexible work arrangements, short on management to lead effectively, harder to advance within the company, once was a great place to work - today not so much"
good,"There is always room for improvement in every company. BNY Mellon is a great stepping stone into the world of finance.However, salary scales should be reconsidered."
good,"Positive, collaborative, incentive driven environment was completely dismantled after Bank of NY acquisition.  Because of drastic cuts in expenses and staffing, administrative/accounting functions out-sourced to Pune, India, client service is sub-standard, to say the least.  Corporate mandates are punitive, employees expected to do more with less."
good,"After completion of MBA and training from Bajaj Finance, joined BNY Mellon as an Operation executive. This company is based on immigration of the reconciliation process which is based on Suspense Account reconcilaion. It has two process one is Domestic another one is Global. In both the process my team reconcile deposite side and withdrawal side. I have promoted two times first time as an Analyst and second time as a Team Leader."
good,"There are more managers than there are hourly employees, they play favorites, hire their friends, make you work through lunches and breaks, make you work insane amounts of overtime and never acknowledge or reward you for it.  And the VP never comes out of her office."
good,I would not work here again. I did in 4 years what most never do in 20 years. I outperformed my peers. I was promised raises after raises that were never distributed to me.
good,"No Room for advancement. Company outsourcing every year."
good,I was a temp for the tax season only. At the time there were many layoffs although fortunately some of the permanent employees still were employed before any mergers took place in 2015.
good,"I was merely a consultant, but I was working to try to gain permanent employment. I was offered a position at my contract expiry, but I denied it. I didn't want to work at a place that doesn't seem to care at all about its employees."
good,The benefits and learning experience for starting your career is good. Advancement is not an option to further your career or get promoted to other positions. Environment is okay but alot of hard work for not enough money.
good,"Diretoria até 2013 era sensacional;"
good,"Easy job, not much advancement. The opposite of a fast paced environment. Super slow and monotonous. Takes forever to get started for them to get you access on everything"
good,Not much room for advancement. In all the years I worked there I only saw one person get promoted. Dozens of people got let go and more just quit due to frustration.
good,Promotions take time  and though you get promotion there were won't be a large increase in salary instead hardly 20000 will be added .and even the hike reflects after six months of review
good,"Career opportunities and slow growth. Too much internal politics and less focus on work and learning.. At present not recommendable to any of friends or colleague due to uncertainty and vision of the company."
good,Things are getting worse everyday.  Management no longer cares about employees.  Layoffs every Quarter.  Most people from BNY and Mellon are no longer with the company.
good,"Poor management, lack of advancement and opportunity for growth. Culture is toxic with high rate of turnover. Company is stuck in the 80s/90s and has lost its best people."
good,I would say work there if you don't mind the unlimited overtime hours and pay and overtime on weekends. There's not really any advancement opportunitys.
good,"good for fresher...if you want to fly high... leave this co after a couple of initial years of your career.........."
good,This is a good starter company. It's a good company to introduce an employee into a data entry position or a first-time job position. There are opportunities for growth as well.
good,On a typical day we are very busy reconciling the many clients that we service. At times there is more work to be done than there are people to complete it. This is due to some clients being out sourced to our India sub-contractor which then requires a restructuring of employees in the state. To later take one of the client back due to additional business being acquired that is not able to be supported properly by our India counter parts prior to the new restructuring of the on shore employees.
good,Great place to work at BNYMellon. I am very lucky to get selected in the interview and get a great platform to work . My team was very supportive and helpful.
good,Over worked. Under paid. Management is horrible. Expect you to bend over backwards and work more than the job description. Not a lot of opportunities to move up
good,There is no advancement here. They expect you to do every job and not give you a raise.  The managers belittle you. There is no growth here no matter what you do.
good,"Pros: Not the most stressful environment, tuition reimbursement "
good,Company has a good work life balance and decent benefits.  There is very little opportunity for advancement.  Salaries are among the lowest.  High turn-over.
good,"The people I work with are wonderful. They are very helpful and friendly co-workers.  Sadly, this company, however, does very little in way of work life balance.  The hours are strictly 8:30 to 5:00, with our contract stating that we work 37.5 hours weekly.  If you come in early, you are expected to stay until 5:00, and if you work late, there is no benefit except your time lost.  They do offer a very good vacation package, but actually getting to utilize that time is nearly impossible.  There is no adequate coverage while you are out, or you are denied the time you need."
good,I loved the environment of it and the lunch hours the customers were everything very fun place for a person who loves to cook the best place was the grill
good,There is always a daily goal to be met. Quality and production based environment. The hardest part of the job was coming in through a temporary agency and working a year contact plus just for the company to deny a permanent position. They should not allow employees to work that long if they do not plan on keeping us.
good,"Es waren viele Aufs und Abs, mit vielen  veränderungen in den letzten 3 Jahren."
good,"The company has very nice facilities and some managers are extremely flexible, but is a hit and miss, the increases are always limited to barely anything and the benefits are high cost."
good,This is a big company and a lot of it will depends on which group you are in. Some group have exactly management and knowledgeable co-worker which you can draw for resources. You learn to spot out exception on various data.
good,"Did you ever see ""Joe vs. the Volcano""?  That first scene reminded me of the 4 years I spent there."
good,Did not like to go to work at this company. Did not learn much at this company.
good,"As BNY Mellon stands right now, job security is low due to the economy, which is causing low compensation and extra work. Also, many positions have odd hours like 9:30-6, 10:30-7. Also, progression upward within the company is also not easily attainable."
good,"Advancement is quite difficult for those over 40; younger employees more easily get interviews and move among positions. In the years that I worked there I observed too much turnover and frequently insufficient staffing. Not having sufficient and experienced staff tends to result in confusion and a lot of extra work, as one frequently does not know who is responsible for what or where to find answers. Communication is not efficient and effective. The company is too big, therefore even if you have a great manager she doesn't have the authority, influence, and power to truly make things happen. Training may be excellent or horrendously inadequate, depending on the position for which you are hired."
good,BNY Mellon is a great company to work for. There is room for growth when you are supported by the management Team. We service debit cards and checking accounts for the brokers. We are a 24/7 call center and tend all debit card needs of the clients. We are also the clearing house for the checking accounts for the brokers.
good,"Too many layoffs, unstable situation, people leaving the company due to stress, fear of getting fired and low salary. Company management not at par compared to other companies in their genre."
good,Not a very professional work environment. very tough to move up in the company due to positions above being stagnant. It is a growth site with a lot of entry level hires.
good,There seems to be a lot of churn at the top of the house with corresponding direction changes. Leads to a lot of uncertainty as an employee regarding job stability. Also back of house staff don't seem to receive the same level career development as client facing staff. It's disappointing.
good,I enjoyed working in this company more than any other companies I've worked at simply because the people are friendly and approachable. This made up for the lack of good compensation and salary package.
good,"talent acquisition is a good place to work in, not much room for growth within the LOB, collaborative environment, casual dress code, strive for D&I for the firm"
good,BNY expects team players but everyone tends to watch their own backs. My immediate manager never lets you speak and constantly talks down to you. They work you very hard with little recognition.
good,"From  the begnining to the end, I felt like I had to prove myself over and over to be employed.  Raises were less than average when actually got a raise.  IT was foreign to everyone in the company.  No camaraderie whatsoever within IT. When you asked for a resolution in other departments there was absolutely no help unless you created a ticket so other employees in other departments within IT would have something to document they are working and are purposely engaged.  Management just looked out for themselves and focused on metrics not how the region or office was ran but how often they created tickets for IT. No tickets no money..."
good,Too big company with no clear vision to mid level management. I have worked with program manager who handles a major project with little or no experience. I think the company should hire out side consultant to handle major projects. Reviews are done twice a year but the target changes every few months.
good,the job is not like it use to be. there is no moral. There is no more open door concept to talk to management. Management shows too much favoritism to other employees while other employees are dismissed
good,"Depending on which team you are on. Some groups/departments are fun and friendly, others not so much. If you're lucky, you'd be working with a friendly team."
good,Management micromanages. Paid Little for all that you do in most positions. Also no sick leave. There is a relaxed dress code and events happen to boost morale.
good,"like any big bank they have been cutting back on benefits, and slowing down advancement opportunities."
good,"BNY Mellon is a very large US operation and operates as such.  The Toronto location changed their President in the last 2 years (public knowledge) and there was extensive turnover.  They demand perfection and work you hard and in return you will receive minimal increases in July each year with bonus payments in February.  In your first year you will receive a prorated bonus and told if you keep up the great work, more to come which is untrue.  Environment while positive is only geared toward those who are 100% committed wanting to work more than the required 8 hours per day.  There are limited employee team building events and most all are in for themselves and work only."
good,"Good thing is always busy so you don't have to find what to do today. Instead you decide priority based on urgency. Lot of stress as you do all development, testing, production support and documentation. You never know when you have to be online and work since you are 24*7 on-call if you in my team. Day ends with same pressure + yelling (w/o reason) and you never know when you will be done for the day. I have worked almost all Saturday and still I hear ""You are salaried"" employee and it's my job. No reward for work."
good,Some people skyrocket to the top.  I noticed a lot of cliques in the workplace.  People outside of that are unnoticed and left behind.  Management is always unclear on what is happening.... especially when it comes to the immediate future.
good,Good Company for fresher to start as company currently paying same for fresher and for people who are working for past two years and you are  left with two options either get promoted or leave Company.
good,BNY Mellon use to be the best company to work for in the nineties. it was best in minority hiring and women training compensations. Since the name change it has become a place you just want to work but not want to stay. the culture has changed. Its all about nepotism. The qualified applications are not hired its all about who knows who. The management is very inconsiderate and employees are treated like cattle on a feeding line.
good,"Management is a joke, lost to many experience team members do to lack of pay. To much favoritism,  great team members. Company don't want to pay for experience"
good,good environment to work. Salary is not good. Management is worst. Partiality is a concern. if you are managers favourite  then you can  get good position.
good,One of the longest-lasting financial institutions in the world is an interesting place to work.  The global teams make for a challenging yet rewarding work environment.
good,"The company is very disorganized.  It is also unprofessional.  There is not a lot of upward growth.  After a while, I kept my ideas to myself.  It is not a place to build a career."
good,"Nice place to work with, company doesn't provide many benefits as compare to other market players.No internal mobility, its on paper only. Doesn't offer good salary as compare to other companies."
good,"process check payment and a typical 9-5 job. they run 24 hours at their lockbox."
good,"They need better training practices and better pay. Training is a joke. coworkers are okay. the way vacation scheduling is set up should be reevaluated....."
good,"BNY lost a lot of major talent to other Trust shops, and as a result lost their long standing identity as a leader in the structured finance world. "
good,"Things are in a constant change. If you think you have a end state of execution in place, the next day it changes and you are back at the drawing board."
good,"you start at 9:00 AM and are out on most days by 6:30. However this is a daily deliverable so when you leave depends on the clients, which can make for some late nights. You are paid OT for extra hours worked."
good,A typical day at work consist of problem solving for clients that have issues. Along with the day-to-day processing of work. I have learned numerous aspects of the asset servicing industry. I value my time spent with the management personal/teams. They inspire my co-workers to reach our goals and pursue our dreams. The hardest part of my job is the lack of advancement in the company. At the end of the day the most enjoyable part of my job is the time spent learning and appreciating all that my co-workers do!
good,It was one of my first jobs as a young adult. I don't recall too much about working for the company. i was a security guard not much i can say but that.
good,"Great people with excellent skills, good team atmosphere and good trainings, opportunity to learn further with financial support."
good,"Working at BNYM has been a beneficial part of my career and has expanded my knowledge of asset servicing.  My job is to be the day to day point of contact for High Profile Hedge Fund Clients and meet high expectations. I work in a very high pace and time sensitive work environment, which is challenging and rewarding."
good,negative view from all levels of the organization and no faith in the management from above. Unfortunately people are very negative and it makes it difficult to work here.
good,"There are pros & cons to working at BNY Mellon as there are in any company. Working in Corporate Trust Department can be stressful and very busy. Some tasks are given to other departments to do who have no experience or knowledge how things are done and have to be monitored to ensure work is done correctly until they learn more."
good,"Been with the company over 6 years, and learnt a lot through every member of the team I was with."
good,"My day was productive, since I was considered the ""go-to"" person. Before I was displaced, I was learning cash disbursements. Management became challenging, since my manager was located out of state. He relied on his assistant to let him know what was happening in the office. To my disadvantage, she never got along with me, since we had similar responsibilities. Actually, from working in the company for close to 16 years, the only difficult thing was trying to be productive when the equipment (copiers) unable to handle the capacity of users assigned to it. I enjoyed working with a great bunch of people throughout the years, and an awesome work location."
good,"No advancement, no recognition of work well done. If you do your job really good they will keep giving your more and more work. And if you desagree with your compensation, you are free to go :("
good,Started as a Data Security Coordinater and progressed to a Sr. Data Security Coordinator facilitating meetings and teaching other data security coordinators new and revised processes and procedures and later progressing to a Project Admin III / PM 1.
good,During my employment I learned valuable account reconciliation practices for the bank.
good,Bny is a relaxed place to work with great employees but no bonuses or incentives
good,"Management in the company is incompetent and the recruitment of the Managerial staff is not up to the mark. "
good,Always threatening layoffs and moving jobs to india.  Teams there are worthless and teams in usa wind up doing more work with less staff.  I have almost 5 weeks of vacation after 15 years but usually cant take more than 1 week because of not having enough staff
good,"Low pay for the amount of work thrown at you, poor training, lack of management skills, no raise or promotions for working hard, time frames not always realistic"
good,"Just another place to work at and get paid. Most of the people are good to work with but with the culture of the company being like other big companies, job security is really nonexistent"
good,"The people are great and the work can be challenging, but you're wrung to your last drop!  Opportunities will arise, but they may not be worth the forced year-long wait for a new role... It also seems that everything is outdated yet constantly updated."
good,"Management does not support employees and diminishing work/life balance.  Low morale.  "
good,"If you have any major obligations other than WORK, this may not be the place for you. Management is more concerned with ""my way or the highway"" than they are doing what is best for the customer."
good,"The executive management seems to care more about the company culture or blogging rather than driving the company back to the powerhouse it formerly was prior to the merger. Mid-level management seems to care more about not getting fired and keeping their friends/ ""yes men"" close while the average worker is buried under the everyday work load because there is an over abundance of work and not enough employees due to hiring freezes. Also, the compensation in not that great."
good,"This place is tanking and cannot compete with the likes of household names like State Street, Fidelity, Goldman Sachs etc,"
good,All call centers suck. This was no where near the worst. The schedules were fixed so that was nice but the tax season resulted I'm crazy hold times that were impossible to handle in the time they required.
good,"Nice place to work, the department I worked no room for advancement. The work atmosphere not always good. Management was good at times..............................................."
good,"Lack of Instruction and on board training made it really hard to work. Be prepared to work over the weekend and get calls from your managers days and nights. "
good,"BNY is now trying to come into this era. They have some catching up to do with promoting and talent recognition. There are employees doing the same jobs for 20 years. It can be very stagnant."
good,"Okay company, but have too many layers of management. Managers are mediocre and play favorites unforetunately. "
good,"Nice enough place to work at but management imposes unreasonable schedules and expectations."
good,"This used to be a great place to work once upon a time - but of late, using collaboration as an excuse and to stop people from working from home, they are either laying off people or your manager drops subtle hints to find another job.  The company is trying hard to move to reinvent itself, but to get there, they are trying too many things too fast.  As a result, the managers/mgmt push the employees hard resulting in long hours and poor performance, less collaboration due to noisy floors and lack of dedicated desktop."
good,"The work is ample when there is the proper amount of staff, they frown on hiring, instead they make you do double work and you feel very stressed out and opens yourself to make errors.  There is no chance for advancement unless someone retires or leaves the company. the most difficult part of the job is getting management to back you up, the people who actually do the work are your best friends, because they all go through the same issues."
good,"Termination of Flexible Work Arrangements, has depleted the companies value to current and potential employees. There is no culture, lots of micromanagers and a lot of ""that's not my job"" type attitudes. Very sad."
good,"BNY Mellon lacks a forward-thinking work environment. The bank is still stuck in the old way of thinking and needs a jolt of young, forward-thinking leaders."
good,"Management is very bad in terms of growth, Promotions are purely based on how good you are with your manager."
good,"Good time spent working there, learned a lot from managers and coworkers. The commute to work was horrible and not be able to work from home was bummer for me."
good,Can work if u need only salary. Otherwise good benefits n perks and other bonus. As a shared service you cannot expect any high designations.moderate culture
good,While you're there you don't feel like part of a group. Just keep your head down and make sure you just get your work done. The lack of communication between departments and other workmates can sometimes make your job harder than it needs to be since you may be unknowingly be doing something redundant.
good,"Under staff in my call center which lead to it being impossible to move between departments because I was an asset. The high level managers didn’t trust the lower level management to do their jobs. Essentially, there were too many hands in the cookie jar fighting over the same cookie. Priorities didn’t seem to be in the correct place and the staff was under appreciated."
good,Wasn't what I signed on for.  Reported to New York lived in Pittsburgh.  Felt like I was on an island by myself.  Computer hadn't work if I travel between them
good,I had to work at the downtown location and the company did not pay for our parking in the parking lots/garage. The price was about half our weekly paycheck and the area was not a safe place to be.
good,A typical day is very stressful from finding what cubicle you will be working at when you arrive to completing large workload by deadlines.  My department had poor management and was always understaffed and overworked.  I enjoyed my role at the company and would still be there if my department had better management and was fully staffed.  BNY Mellon offers many volunteer opportunities in the community but I was never able to take advantage of these because of the fact that the department was understaffed.
good,The bank offered good training for the role. Management catered to the portfolio managers. Employees did not have much to input by way of job improvement. The system was set in stone by the very nature of trading. You literally could not get it wrong.
good,"Hiring another temp agency because that agency pays the employees less than I was paid, so the work is getting done by more employees at less cost.  They are hiring less skilled workers and those employees take longer to accomplish tasks."
good,"Upper management is not involved or knowledgeable enough to lead teams. They are figure heads who make high salaries and skate by until it is time for them to either retire or get fired for having too high a salary. Not much room for advancement as long as these dinosaurs remain in place. This is a shame since there are a lot of bright, talented people in the organization that will leave after a few years when they realize there is no advancement opportunity for them beyond a certain level. So the smart, talented people become disposable instead of being valued."
good,Be prepared to work and work hard. Day to day varied. You must be a fast learner. Management requires a lot from the position. Was very fast pace and required overtime.
good,"A lot of programs and support for mid level jobs and positions. Do mot cater for low level positions or staff. "
good,"t is a growing company so it was fun to be a part of it."
good,"Although this was a contract assignment, I very much enjoyed my time there. The manager was great as well as the team he had with him. I wished the assignment would have went on longer."
good,Really enjoyed my position as a loan processor with the BNY Mellon. Processing paperwork for loans for large corporations. My co-workers were amazing. The best part of the job was being able to complete billion dollar transactions in a timely manner with no errors.
good,"A very busy place to work.  No job  security."
good,"O mercado financeiro de modo geral demanda muitas horas de trabalho por dia, porem por ser uma administradora de fundos de investimento, a demanda dos gestores é maior, acumulando assim relacao com cliente, analise operacional e liquidacao; dificultando a relacao vida profissional/pessoal, mas pela qualificacao e relacoes interpessoais avalio como uma boa empresa a se trabalhar."
good,Nice job environment and good professionals who are eager to train and help. Given the global industry changes affecting the finance services industry the company continues to be good place to work.
good,we will learn a lot about the financial world and work with great people but there are not a lot of opportunities to growth within the company.best advice learn as much as you can
good,The company has a good reputation in market in india. but the the job culture is not good. there are no training plans. the designation hierarchy changes as per processes. Not so hot company to work with. HR is weak and no support is there. hopeless management
good,"Stressful but productive. workplace. Learned a lot, but dealing with the constant treat of job loss was low for moral in the department."
good,A typical day is result driven and careful attention to details. Financial information has to be analyzed for accuracy so attention to details is critical to a successful outcome.
good,"BNY Mellon Wealth Management has tradition and history at it's core, but when trying to move forward in the current, fast-paced, youthful business environment, the company is falling behind.  Product development was slow, marketing offerings were dated and not creative.  Co-workers were FABULOUS and brilliant.  Management is lacking."
good,"BNYMellon has a good Job work/Life Balance Co-workers are good, kind people to work with. I feel the hardest part of working at BNYMellon is getting an opportunity to advance."
good,Decent company filled with intelligent people being stifled by redtape.
good,A negative review.  Most of the employees did the bare minimum and the consultants were quitting every day because the job market was strong and people were constantly coming and goin
good,"Very independent work environment with a friendly staff. Made your own time schedule, help was always available."
good,I've been working at BNY Mellon for the past 2 years and I must say it is a great atmosphere but the opportunity for advancement from the lower floors to the higher ones is not possible. Even advancement into more responsible positions within the same area is difficult.
good,We would support clients in running and developing reports for their 401k's we monitored.  I learned a lot about 401k's and the reports that are created to analyze the performance of the investment manager.  I enjoyed the team effort that took place.
good,This is a production company where in you have to meet your quota.  Very serious and stressful environment.  
good,"Cases have to be done in tamely manner. Working with a lot of different customer and investigating daily problems for different PO. Boxes. There is always something to learn each day, however the load of the work can be very overwhelming. Management needs improving, instead of initiating rules daily and scarring workers, the management has to start to listen to people what they want. The hardest part of the job is to make everyone happy, there is sometimes great deal of pressure and if it were not of some workers that make the place more enjoyable, the job would not be exciting. Most enjoyable part of the job, is the feeling of helping out the customer and solving any issues or problems in question."
good,"I enjoy working for this company. We do alot of sorting through sensitve documents, filing, faxing, answer phone calls. The most enjoyable part is being able to work with a wide variety of people."
good,Overall good for freshers. Work for 2 years and then look up for somewhere else.
good,"A typical day at work can go from 8.5 hours to 15 hours. Lot of things to learn if you have an eye for it or you'll just go on copy and pasting stuff, that will get you an average rating anyway. Management will not support you untill you've been buttering them from long, you can get fat increments, bonus, quick promotions if you can do people pleasing."
good,"If youre looking for genuine connections/interaction this company is lacking in that department.  The culture was ""stuffy"" and did not help with employee success and morale. Opportunities are there if you work hard."
good,Imagine a work culture where management acts like chicken with their heads chopped off and bumping into each other. It's utter chaos. No one has a full vision and no one knows what the purpose of the immediate ask is except that it's immediately urgent despite being vague at the same time.
good,"The work at BNYM is not the issue, but rather the issue lies within the senior mgmt levels. With attrition low, displacement is now a reoccurring event that nobody can escape."
good,"The work life balance is good in that you are barely there late, however things move almost too slowly. Communication between departments and teams is not great making it difficult to get things done sometimes. I came from a more demanding work environment and often find myself bored. However, if you are looking to just put in your time and go home, without much opportunity for advancement this is a good fit."
good,"The company is clearly setting itself up to be taken over. Tons of layoffs occurring, as well as jettisoning less profitable clients and entire lines of business. If you can manage to get in and stay in until a buyer comes along, it may be worth it."
good,You will only advance if you are a suck-up.  They do not allow overtime pay even though more than once a week you will be there longer than you should be. They will not compensate you for it either. Its very cliquey and a toxic environment
good,"Great place to learn.  Flexible work schedule.  Team oriented environment  that will support you as team member. Good place to learn all aspects of IT, including networking,and all operating systems including UNIX, Windows, and Mainframe."
good,Good place to start a career.  Does offer training for initial advancement.  Recently dropped or highly limited WFH options.  Do not plan on finishing your career here.
good,"Good for freshers."
good,"I have an overall experience of 15+ years in the Investment Banking and IT domains . Possess a blend of IT, Investment Banking, Operations and Management skillsets."
good,a job one needs to be employed to make a living it was a contract job 9 to 5 like any other job. nothing special or not special about.  one has to work to live discretionary
good,I worked hard and even trained individuals only to be known that those I trained were getting promoted before me. When asked why I didn't get the positions I was told that they didn't think I wanted it.
good,"BNY Mellon doesn't treat staff particularly well. I was often forced into overtime to pick up the work of an underperforming member of the team. My Team Leader, however, was supportive."
good,"No job advancement opportunities at the lower levels; raises or promotions. [i was team lead for 10+ yrs]"
good,"The organization has a great deal of potential but it's hindered by poor senior management. More time should be spent by senior management challenging their managers in other words, ""trust but verify"". The CSD Middle Office organization is strong at the day to day management and boots on the ground level but they are constantly functioning in chaos, due to management fire drills and just bad direction. The new CEO needs to peel back the onion more so that the top heavy dead weight can be trimmed down. Constantly reorging and restacking the organizational structure will not produce efficiency alone. On the upside you will meet some of the nicest people and foster long lasting friendships."
good,"The welcoming committee at BNY Is awesome. When you join, you know you are joining and awesome company.  Once you are in, many managers are clueless how to manage and the good ones who actually know how to do stuff does not get rexlcognize."
good,"The largest issues with the trades processing department of BNY Mellon are the terribly out of date management styles, lack of meaningful advancement, and general feeling of insecurity. As a starting position after college this job works, as a long term, well, this is a short trip. Management runs the department from a disconnected position with now real grasp of what happens day to day/person to person. The gradual shift from individual to auto-computer trade processing presents a bleak future for this department and thus a sense of instability for newer hires like myself. Watching people that have spent the better half of a decade sitting in the post they got hired into, despite high level of competence and tremendous work ethics, accepting positions within other BNY departments or outside BNY entirely due no chance of promotion and aggravation over treatment is alarming. This is a starting post, and as I hit my year I will be looking to leave asap."
good,Current work culture is not that great which it use to be in past. No job security as of today. More client oriented company where in human effort and emotions are ignored.
good,"Though my manager is supportive, the wider management team does not command my respect. They decided to scrap any working from home or working from other BNY locations so there is no flexibility."
good,Bny is a fun place to work but avoid if you want to progress in your career. If not close with mamagement then you will not do well. Pay is minimum and increases are tiny. Work is repetitive with no training provided. Avoid!
good,"Provide all administrative support to head of department. Calendar management; travel; expenses,coordinate staff meetings logistics. work closely with other assistants in group."
good,"My tenure at BNY was marked by having 4 bosses in a short time span.  This was caused by turnover at the leadership level."
good,"At the time I worked there, I was excited due to all the supposed upward mobility - the chance to not only learn new skills and change jobs, but to post out to other countries in this global organization."
good,"With the latest changes in management, it's not about what you know, and it's not about all for one, and one for all, it's about where you can place the job at the least cost to the company. I've had several great managers who instilled in us that it's not about one person but the team effort to accomplish the goals. Long days were not an issue, but times have changed. The staff I worked with locally were terrific and always supportive of each other. Many of them have left the company, retired or been let go."
good,"At BNY Mellon the work environment is very high paced, but we are also provided the tools to complete the job in a timely manner. My only complaint will be my manager needed more training on how to manage his staff."
good,"A typical day at work would be : We start at 10 am would read what happened for our clients during trading hours in Europe and by 10.30 am would take over the European based teams and start servicing our clients. They are located in Europe and in the US."
good,"Management keeps a very tight hold on workers.  Your opinion is not considered. Workplace culture is very stressful, no one speaks, lunch is always eaten at your desk and god help you if you miss a call or meeting."
good,It's an old institution that's trying to transition. It's a cultural change that's badly planned. Just getting rid of people that have long tenures and replacing them with external talent is not all it takes. A reactive process like this creates paranoia and teams no longer work effectively as team. Everyone is suspicious of everyone else and feels they need to 'protect' themselves first.
good,"While I enjoyed my job and through my self in it for 12 years I was unceremoniously dismissed as some bean counter determined that my 85k position could be handled by a junior associate.  forget that on average I was working 60 to 60 hours a week for them."
good,High Risk work duties for little pay. Expectations exceeded salary increases. Our personal managers were very understanding but the pressure of a management position with such little pay would begin to take a tool on the employees.
good,"Chronic understaffing of front office makes for a stressful environment. Perks and good intentions do not change this reality. Your ""role"" is clearly delineated on paper in descriptions provided by HR, but you will find yourself wearing a lot of hats that have nothing to do with that description. And, you won't be promoted for all the work you're doing outside of that role description. Career aspirations very easily and inevitably become an endurance test.  New corporate CEO has pledged vast improvements to technology and has already thrown a lot of money in that direction. This is a welcome course of action, particularly in the wealth management space, since current systems don't communicate well, if at all, with each other. Lots of time is lost during the work day due to this frustrating arrangement. The awful truth may be that the entire industry is suffering from dysfunctions due to an avalanche of regulations, many of them incoherent, and the impossible task of upgrading and streamlining technology while simultaneously trying to service existing clients and win new business. There are truly great people working at this company, and their competence takes some of the edge off of the irrationality."
good,the schedules are picked based on need and seniority and sometimes honestly favortism. choose wisely when excepting the job offer as far as schedule is concerned because they say you can change it later but thats not really true. as far as  the job itself its very fast paced and demanding.
good,"However, company was more focused on cutting cost than retaining knowledgeable, talented employees.  How about cutting costs by saving on employees real estate space by allowing remote for employees that are working long hours and support your global clients?  Though its not the only company that is like this so to stand out align more into future."
good,"It was not a great experience with this company during my stay there.   We were acquired by Bank of New York and got consolidated. The severance package was generous due to a ""perk"" put in the in law of Mellon."
good,I learned a numerous amount of skills with the company. The management teams are tough and can be a bit discouraging. I appreciate the experience working with the company.
good,"This is a great company to gain work experience straight of college. However, be prepared to deal with Corporate Politics and uptight cheapskate department heads as well as management. I will add that not everyone in management are bad people, but the bad tend to outweigh the good. Also, the training is very subpar; you would have to take alot of notes and memorize alot of processes to succeed. If you are planning to be an invesment manager, broker, etc. This is not the place for you as they do not provide any career growth support and make things very difficult to switch between departments. Also, if you plan on spending majority of your career with one corporation and benefit from your choice; this is not one of them."
good,"A great place to work if you want experience, but the incentive to make a difference and receive proper accolade seems to fly over management's heads."
good,"If you enjoy answering phones at a very fast pace, this is the job for you. There is public transportation, that comes right in front of the building. Public transportation is nice when it's on time. The company does have a free parking lot that is large."
good,"You are only good as your last quarter.  While the company talks a good talk about talent management, it does not walk the same talk.  Its worth being "" a friend of..."".  It will certainly influence your career with the firm."
good,"Great work environment, plenty of chances to learn new processes. Poor direction from upper management and lack of positive enforcement for top achievers."
good,Enjoyed my job until a majority of functions were moved to operations in india. Once the operations were opened in india the ta business in th us got less and less attention and many people who had invested many years with the company were let go and those that were left had to support the india operations and keep up with workload as well.
good,It has been a good work experience with Bank of New York Mellon Technology
good,"Very big firm."
good,Workers never interacted with one another.  Managers would publicly play favoritism.  Never got credit for doing a good job.  You only hear when a mistake is made.
good,The company is treasure house of financial services offered to clients. I got to learn many things about financial instruments and services that company offers to clients worldwide.
good,"o Recruiter for occupational and management positions."
good,Deadline driven working environment. A lot of independent work can be done at your own pace. Very team oriented. Company does not really help you to advance and seems to be a lack of strong management.
good,The culture when I worked there was almost stifling.  Many people were concerned about losing their job.  Since then they merge with BNY so it may be different now.
good,"Very large global organization with world class clients where several business lines have great opportunities to thrive and grow...others not so much."
good,"BNY focuses on only critical processes and pay good for only for those process alone. if you have selected in non critical processes, please do not expect monetary benefits."
good,"The company offers a good work life balance for employees, a group of people whom, by and large, are amongst the most decent you would ever have the opportunity to work with. Unfortunately any incentive further to this is somewhat lacking. Opportunities for development are limited and structured in a way that proper recognition is not to be expected and there is a real detachment between management and those working on the floor."
good,"A typical day at work is regular all assign work with my accounts gets updated. "
good,Good place to learn different aspects of your expertise. The culture is very different than other corporations; it takes some time to get accustomed to. Senior management is making good strides on changing the bank as a whole.
good,Its a nice company to work for. But the work will be High and all facilities will be provided. And it gives you all type of career opretunities also.
good,Loved to work with people. Had a great team. My manager was very good. Overall environment not so great. A lot of politics
good,They need to train their new employees better for the jobs they were hired to perform. Without appropriate training new employees can not do the job they were hired to do.
good,"It's all about productivity, management doesn't really care. Not a fun place to work at all. The benefits are very good, but the pay is terrible. It's a good place to gain some experience and then move on."
good,"Measures taken to cut short term costs at the expense of long term success and investment in the future."
good,"Nice company but when it comes to advancement at times it is not all what it seems. Work force has become more of do with less associates, but have more work. Expectations take over a normal working day."
good,"BNY Mellon is best known for following company ethics and policies, and completing compliance programmes. learning period for any BO project would be 3 to 6 months max."
good,"I liked the actual work that I had to do for Bnymellon Doc Custody but there is way to much favoritism. It doesn't matter how well you do your job or how long you have been working there, if you're not being a brown nose to your manager or team leader they will find a way to get rid of you. Especially, when there are a bunch of temps ready and willing to brown nose and be hired with less pay"
good,Bank has high management turnover because of upper management not tending to the needs of the managers and supervisor. We are expected to work every weekend even on holidays even though upper management will not show up to work. Co workers get along and make the best of a increasingly hard situation.
good,"Working at this place for 10 years and have to say it has changed in so many negative ways."
good,Some areas understaffed resulting in overwork and regular turnover.  There seems to be a disconnect between management and the nature of the actual demands of the job
good,"Our division of BNY Mellon was formerly part of PNC Bank as PFPC, Inc.  Since being taken over by BNY Mellon, we have been faced with constant downsizing at the detriment to the service we provide.  The division suffers from an abundance of of long term senior management.  Our executive team has been in place largely unchanged for more than 20 years and while this an abundance of experience, this particular group is stuck in their ways and closed to new ideas or changes to workflow.  Their entrenchment blocks the advancement of other senior management and stagnates growth.  Compensation within the division tends to be 20% below the market leading to frequent turnover in all but the most senior of positions."
good,Good company to work. Opportunities to learn. Limited scope for promotion. Fun fridays conducted at work. Travel facility provided by the company.
good,We worked as call center representatives so there was little time to communicate with colleagues. Learned much about communicated with people via telephone and handling confidential information.
good,The staff works hard to maintain the culture of the Bank from years ago and thats a good thing.  The culture is changing towards the Mellon model.
good,"Managers are not always helpful in advancements."
good,"A typical day in my department would consist of fixing errors on customer accounts. I would view images of suspected checks that the bank targeted on the customer accounts. Once the items were fixed in our computer system, our customers would be able to exclude the checks that were fixed. I assisted customers over the phone with any questions that they might of had in regards to their accounts."
good,"A typical day includes daily Cash Reconciliations and Reviews, client interaction via phone and emial, New Account and Client Onboarding, Aged Asset and Cash Analysis, Team development by 1:1 and Team Meetings, Nightly Mutual and Comingled Account Valuation, Client Meetings, Security Setup, Audit and Control Reviews"
good,"International company, based out of New York has been in the related business field for many years and has seen its fair share of rises and falls."
good,"Could pay more attention to employees that work hard for the company. No family life, do not get out of work til after 7pm every night. Punished for taking a day off and having to do double the work when someone else is off."
good,Great company to work for but there is so much favortism on the job that manager need to work on.  Wonderful company with some really great managers
good,"Maintaining staffing levels and morale seems to be a constant struggle.  There are issues with the use of the word ""team"" when something needs to get done, but once an error occurs it is all about pointing fingers.  That being said, there are very supportive people there, it seems to be a matter of adapting to the stress and coping with it."
good,"No clear direction in departments as to what to accomplish in a current year. Priorities/Focus/Management keep chaning."
good,"Unloading mail deliveries, scanning checks and filing paperwork."
good,"I've spent my entire career with BNYM, so I only have one perspective.  There are advancement opportunities, but to a certain point, and then advancement opportunities flatten out substantially.  But given my ambitions, I'd like more options to advance.  I, personally, don't see them with BNYM."
good,"Interesting company.  I performed a variety of roles: QC system tester, Process Quality Assurance Analyst, mainframe developer, department security administrator and Business Analyst.  The people I worked with in the IT department are wonderful, smart and very willing to help others."
good,"Uber micro managing, working long days everyday is expected and not well compensated for it. Poor communication, sparse infrastructure/resources to help move processes along smoothly."
good,"Worked with clients as fast and efficiently as possible."
good,This is good place to acquire muck knowledge.  Consider your time here valuable and learn as much as possible because no one will teach you anything unless its for current role.
good,It is a good company to work but as future perspective want more growth
good,"I worked here for six half years. It was great the first two years but the new CEO only cares about fixing the stock price, and reduce expenses. Health insurance is the worst benefit offered by BNY Mellon."
good,BNY Mellon is a financial services company with a hard working culture like many of its peers in the industry.
good,Employees daily work through lunch to service their clients.  Company is large enough to provide many opportunities to shift from one area to another to broaden experience in global securities service industry
good,"Good people to work with, company going through changes, Im being made redundent.  Hardest part of the job is the operational diversity globally, hard to get things done."
good,Staff retention and career advancement needs improvement. More effort to be put in diversity and inclusion practices
good,fast paced environment that requires accuracy. meeting deadlines and multitasking through out the day.
good,"There's a lot of goals that depend on others helping you achieve them.  Performance goals seem unattainable with too much emphasis put on metrics."
good,an IT company lacks how to management finance company's processes. Their openness causing harm to financial services data integrity.
good,I learn too much thinks. I face to much compiteter in my team so i learn fast that process. Its one of challenging job to achive maximum target in a day.
good,"Ensure the accuracy of information and customer service skills by monitoring inbound telephone calls."
good,"The daily management of a support team on a trading floor is something exciting. Always on the move and working under pressure and tight deadline."
good,Company was great until repeated mergers.  Many employees lost their jobs.
good,"This is an excellent place to hone your skills in any facet of the investment banking industry.  If you are fresh out of college or are trying to get into the industry, you are in the right place.  At least in IT, you can try your hand at just about anything you want.  On desktop, everyone, Tier 1 or Tier 2, has the opportunity to create virtual servers, log into test routers, create virtual devices with any OS, try your hand at packaging software, anything.  If you put your efforts in, you can gain real knowledge.  Starting pay is just as low as anywhere else.  The issue is that after learning so much and making yourself very marketable, you are still getting the same low salary.  So, at this time many people in all departments are leaving.  But then, if the company wants to train folks in all areas of investment banking for the competition, that's their business."
good,An okay place to work but they lack in compensation and any advances made in the company only result in minimal increases.  They lose their good people due to this issue and departments find themselves struggling to meet client needs while being understaffed.  
good,great place but they have lost their family values over the past 5 years. 
good,No growth opportunities. A place to work if one has time to deal with day-to-day politics.
good,"Pros** The benefits while working at BNY Mellon were wonderful, great vacation time and personal time, as well as paid holidays."
good,"Manage daily relationship for high net worth client including charitable, pension and institutional accounts and endowments with Investment assets of 26B."
good,not providing any information about bank of new york mellon thanks
good,"Co-workers in management were intelligent and thoughtful, but bureaucracy and general lack of drive was readily apparent."
good,"Came in on a temporary assignment with the possibility of being hired permanently. However, the atmosphere was always tense and I appeared to be at the mercy of the manager's fancy. Everybody appeared to be fearful of the manager and no reward seems to be given for their hard work."
good,every day same as the last. except when management changes things and expects you to be a mind reader and know about said changes without actually being told of them.
good,Was a good place to work and learn about the regulations of the banking industry.
good,Bank of New York Mellon is one of the largest banking institutions. There is many opportunities to move throughout the company and advance to higher levels.
good,A typical day at work involved looking at legal documents and data entry.
good,"Stressful, Rude management, heavy work load, low pay, No advancement,"
good,"God place to start but advancement is very slow. Management could do a better job, but overall it's not terrible."
good,"The benefits are worth the job, but the pay is low. The more raises you get, the larger the target on your back. They seem to layoff by salary, so if you have more experience and do better at your job than others, you can get a raise, but that raise now means you are the first to be cut when they want payroll reduction."
good,"Quite repetitive jobs to be done but with a scope of growth. "
good,"No job security , Any time they can terminate your job"
good,It is a good organisation to start the career.The work culture is motivating. I got to learn more about banking and its working.I would recommend highly to everyone.
good,Good company but management is not up to mark. Team leaders are rude. Management should take care of lower level employees. Especially fresher's are not treated well.
good,"Slow Growth, good exposure for freshers, Lot of work load,No time for lunch.A lot of politics, no proper Management, lot of favourism.But goodd for freshers to learn."
good,Company needs more talents to work for because some people there do not know what they are doing. Overall the working environment is ok but work could be stressful.
good,"A lot of management have been with the company for 15+ years, everyone is basically just trying to keep their job.  The CEO changes have brought in culture changes and cuts to resources.  Became a challenging place to want to go to every day."
good,"There was a very hierarchical structure that management used to marginally advance promising talent. Middle management was often afraid of losing anyone who would put in the time and do any decent work, but unwilling to give them opportunity and advance out of their world. The technology was archaic."
good,Was a fantastic place to work up until two years ago. They are moving most of technology to India. No value in long time technology employees with knowledge of business. Focused on a younger work force now.
good,Loved my job and the people I worked with.  However our department was closed.  Sorry to see it end.  The company made a mistake closing down a very efficient department.
good,Why am I feeling this out? I havent't worked at BNY Mellon since 2015. When Bank of New York merged with Mellon..the place changed and I no longer enjoyed working there.
good,"BNY Mellon is a global company that is typically beholden to its stakeholders more than it is to its employees. Not a bad place to work, especially if you like working for large companies."
good,"There has been a lot of upper level management changes in the company over all.  Culture is geared toward younger employees right out of college, so it is a good place to work as entry level.  New middle aged employees who are used to a more traditional professional environment may have a hard time acclimating.  There are a lot of long term, middle aged employees there, so seniority levels don't change much and vertical growth can be hard to come by."
good,"Constant turnaround in the OFAC Dept due to micro-management and little to no guidance with training process.  In less then a year working there, 5 employees left department to pursue other opportunities.    "
good,"Fantastic firm, Too good for freshers."
good,"I have learned a lot through working here.  It was my first full-time job after college. I worked in the processing department here, as well as work with the technology team to introduce automatic processing during the conversion. I liked learning new things at this company.  A typical day at the office is sorting through faxes and processing the payments that were due on a specific effective date. The management style here is pretty strict and some parts of the month are restricted for vacations due to high volume activity."
good,"Good company and rest of the things depend on your profile "
good,Management could  use better training on how to speak and manage there peers . The organization trys to implement ideas to quickly without assesing the big picture.
good,"In my experience, this company focuses on bringing in young talent and promoting them quickly without them first getting a grasp of the business.  People with knowledge are not cared for and managerial structure is very disorganized.  It is extremely difficult to find the right person to talk to across the 50,000 employees it has.  This makes accomplishing a project incredibly difficult.  The company does work pretty well to provide flexible hours and work from home capability, which is very nice.  This is a good stepping stone, but growth leads to frustration with the structure."
good,Fast pace and very little guidance.. busy and many times management won’t help. They will question your time and many times won’t give you they tools to succeed
good,"Okay place to work.  Not much career advancement opportunities.  Co-workers were great, while management is not. Too many managers not getting anything done."
good,"The overall feel is that people are working on a production line, no interactions except for a few emails from upper management.  Staled environment, not personable."
good,"I handled stock holders inquires about stock, sold stock, and made account updates. The workplace culture always try to up lift employees spirits with special events and prizes."
good,Good company.  Can work from home.  Allows for flexibility with work/life balance.  Casual atmosphere most of the time.  Treats employees fairly. Nice environment.
good,"Everyone I worked with was very and helpful. I learned a lot fund structures and calculating NAV's and trade payments."
good,"Not a good place to work. Management is aggressively clueless of the goals and keep altering the objectives. "
good,"Overall, I enjoyed my time at BNY. I learned a lot about working in a corporate environment and being a professional worker. However, there isn't a solid working culture and they don't reward hard work."
good,"There were many changes in the company, and I did enjoy working there. Until they started sending jobs to other countries and letting people go here in the USA"
good,"Good to start career path for freshers"
good,From the very top of the company most emails were about the bottom line and not employee retention. I enjoyed my actual job and supervisor but there was no sense of trying to retain talent.
good,"Hard as new employee to navigate the firm.  Sink or swim mindset.  Management changes structure frequently.  If you can swim on your own, good company."
good,"Management is very paranoid about their own careers rather than doing what is in the best interests of the company.  Very little autonomy is provided to employees, but the main benefit was being able to work remotely."
good,"You kept busy.  You were given a set of accounts which were your responsibility.  You also had to learn other accounts in the event someone was off or took a vacation.  You reviewed the work of other accountants.  I was chosen to train new accountants.  "
good,"Challenging workplace.  Company provides the opportunity to learn every day.  Corporate Trust is a core business and competency, and they take  commitment to remain unbiased seriously. BNY utilizes global footprint to deliver a full range of issuer and related investor services across a wide range of program types."
good,Unusually high management turnover and managers with little or no experience promoted to technical leadership. Poorly implemented program management practices and not valued by management
good,Company has good benefits.  They provide good choices of medical insurance as well as good vacation packages.  Theyre stock options are also good for me.
good,"My position as a Customer Representative was stressful as I believe all call center positions are stressful. We were expected to, of course, be kind to the customers, but also to pick up on anything they might need during the course of the conversation. We dealt with various accents and were assessed negatively if we asked the customer to repeat their requests-even with heavy accents. The manager who was listening to the call said she understood it. For me, that was the hardest part of the job. There were numerous checkpoints that had to be completed in order for your call to be considered successful. For the money we were paid an awful lot was expected. Turnover was high."
good,"Very laid back company with benefits however the pay is not good at all. Vacations and personal time is great but again the pay is low. No micromanagment."
good,"Many of my colleagues (including myself) experience a lack of motivation as the company under pays its employees, yet encourages long hours. I am not lazy. I would prefer to be fairly compensated."
good,It's an alright place to work. Cannot really say anything too bad about the company. The people are decent and most can be friendly. Opportunities to move up are not as prevalent as you would think they would be.
good,As long as you are working in a major hub city you will have job security and it is a great place to work. Centralizing many jobs/functions across country.
good,BNY Mellon has turned into a highly competitive organization.  Many changes are occurring to increase efficiencies.  The culture is gearing very much towards being efficient through updating various technology.
good,"There is no room for advancement what so ever and only 2% or under raiser.  Most of the managers have stop caring and are only there because its a job. Management never rewards or acknowledge that you did a good job they only care what you did wrong.  Its a joyless place to be most days,"
good,"Pros "
good,"Working for BNY Mellon is OK.  I think if I was in a different department, it would be better. The pay is low for my position.  I do hear that once you work in your current job for at least a year, you can apply for others."
good,"It takes a long time to get things done. You can hide in your job for a long time by just attending meetings. There are only a handful of productive people at the company. There are several layers that manage these people."
good,"Typical cube farm environment.  Very high turnover.  Plenty of under employed people in the department looking to go back to school or for better opportunities.  Questionable politics and promotions.  Redundant and slow technology.   Lack of good communication between departments.  Upper managers are either strangely happy or totally high strung and strained, however they are rarely around us workers so these judgments are based on a few run-ins.    Executive committee appears to be quite satisfied."
good,None of these jobs are hard. A monkey can do it after a few weeks. No real career path. Managers don't have any advice for careers. Pay is lower than just about anywhere. They try to keep you there forever while paying you as little as they can.
good,"Work was monotonous at times, Clients were appreciative when going the extra mile. Did not care for the favoritism by management. Overall, The workplace did its best to reduce stress by offering work from home 2x monthly"
good,"Decent company, but lack of understanding of work/life balance. Compensation is below comparable position at most other companies. Entry-level employees do have chances at moving up, but roles are not as challenging as one may hope."
good,"A typical work day starts at 9 or 10am and you're mostly out by 6 or 6:30. It's very routine, for example everyday you'd reconcile multiple funds cash, book expenses, check for corporate actions, book trades, etc. This would not change very much from day to day or fund to fund. You learn the workings of different funds as they become assigned to you but you can complete your job without ever becoming adept or specialized if you do not take it onto yourself to learn. Typically, the environment did not foster much knowledge sharing. Management at the manager or assistant manager level was good for me. I've had colleagues with mixed reviews. The senior manager or group managers tend to be a mixed bag as well. I do not see mine in a very favorable light when it comes to management style in terms of efficiency, valuing team member, prioritizing and receptive to concerns of the team."
good,Not everyone is built to work in a bank. It is very high-stress employment and sometimes can take years from your life. The good thing is the rules are very cut and dry so it a great educator in working in a corporate environment.
good,"A typical 8 hour day would include meeting deadlines for multiple clients for monthly NAV's for the first 7 business days of the month while the rest of the month was maintenance for completing cash reconciliations, trades, accruals, etc. I enjoyed the work unit I was in as they are very friendly and got along with everyone. The staleness at working at this company for the past 15 years has caused me to look for a change."
good,"Overall good experience.  Executives could be better served by actually walking around their departments to see what is going on vs. relying upon politics.  The new CEO will clean-up shop and bring in his own people.  In my opinion, the Feds should have put a stop to regulation that only created/creates temp jobs in the USA...with business as usual jobs going offshore (Poland in BNYM's case)."
good,BNY Mellon is a great place to work.  I have been with the company for over 10 years now and enjoy working her.  However it's time for me to challenge myself and look for opportunities that will further my career as well as challenge and push my capabilities to the next level.
good,Leaving because contract is ending. BONY is highly disorganized. The company has a reputation of not treating or paying their employees well. They don't have a strong culture.
good,"Based upon job title would depend on roles performed. As a Client Services Manager, there were high levels of stressful situations. The job title called for many hours including late nights/early mornings. The training for the role I was in could have been better as I felt in my case, I wasn't given sufficient training for guidelines. The managers were good at providing one-on-one sessions, but as to learning certain situations, sometimes it felt as if questions weren't encouraged or answered in an according manner"
good,"A typical day at work is usually busy, working with my team on our various reports. At BNY Mellon, I have learned the importance of teamwork, but also how to be confident in my work. Management depends on the department, but I learned something from each management group I worked under. Regarding workplace culture, it is an old bank with old ways. I believe the company is slowly progressing as they favor technology jobs. The hardest part of my job is depending upon others in order to complete a task. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with other people, investigating wires and transactions and constantly learning."
good,"Overall, BNYM is not a bad place to work.  It is a major global corporation, the first bank in the US.  They offer decent benefits, health insurance, dental, life insurance, and a 401k plan.  However, many things can be improved as good programs that were available to employees in the past have been reduced or eliminated.  Employees could benefit from better health insurance plans as the options are very limited and offer extremely high deductibles.  The salaries are not competitive compared to other companies in the same industry. It can be somewhat difficult to move internally within the company, at times they hire externally instead of promoting their own employees.  Even though they have tried to make many improvements over the years there are still great disparities in salaries with employees doing the same functions and their salaries on opposite ends of the spectrum."
good,"A typical day at work can sometimes be spontaneous, a lot of one off requests can come through on a particular day and at times there is no training or structured process to walk an individual through these particular requests.  BNY Mellon should work more on providing adequate training for its employees; both day to day as well as overall high-level.  Mandatory professional mentorship programs should be offered to employees to receive guidance on career advancement and professional career choices;  as well as open opportunities for career transfers."
good,"BNYM is a fine place when you are just starting out in the job market. Benefits are above average, rate of pay is below average for the industry with limited pay increases. There is limited growth potential unless you are looking to work in Pittsburgh. The different departments of the company are very siloed, even in the same office. There can be vast differences in the quality of management, workplace culture, and job opportunities depending on which silo you happen to be in. "
good,"BNYM is a good place to work.  The department I am in is going through some changes and the team that I am on is not sure what is going to happen.  The management is in NY,NY so sometimes the team I am on doesn't always get messages since we are out of state."
good,"some days doing phone conversation on some accounts to be done. assistance with collections team on payment for Invoices."
good,Productive environment for an extremely large nationally known company.  Learned to work in large and small groups with others in a supervisory/leadership capacity.  Management was extremely helpful in regard to constantly changing work environment both internally and externally.  Feel this opportunity provided a slid background in order to continue working i n this field.
good,"With advancements and negative change in job culture, a direct exposure from a bank to a bpo stream of management."
good,"Good hours, co-workers are good people. Hard place to move up in. Dont really promote within. Good place to start to get some experience, if you want banking experience to take with you then this would be a good start."
good,"Deal with hedge funds and financial institutions on a daily basis.  I am the main point of contact and always want to deliver excellent client service.  As a CSM, we can have a multitude of assignments, but need to have the ability prioritize and deliver.  Having the client refer new business because of my hard work is always the best compliment"
good,Only few benefits are employee friendly.The shift timings are so  tedious.They teach a process with lots of efforts and finally it has been migrated and the other members in the team are standstill when it is migrated.Sometimes the management is biased.
good,"This is an old organization with a proud history. Once this organization completes its metamorphosis, it should be a good place to work.  There was plenty of disorganization, lack of communication or miscommunication regarding organizational direction from senior management which created anxiety for many of the employees.  Department heads and line managers had to deal with many challenges as a result of those misfires (morale, turnover etc)."
good,To many turnovers and not enough competent individuals in management roles.  Company needs more leadership!  It's your typical corporate world.
good,"BNY does not pay well at all. a senior trust admin makes less than $40,000.  In order to receive any  promotion you have to fall into the politic with the managers. if they don't like you, good luck on getting promoted."
good,"BNY Mellon's Wealth Management business does have a great work/life balance and good benefits. Negatives are that the culture is conservative with little room for advancement for younger professionals, as there is much red-tape and bureaucracy. If you do value having a good work/life balance over career advancement and competitive compensation, Wealth Management from that standpoint may be a good fit."
good,"It is a good place to start, but after many years, I felt I was going nowhere with constant excuses from management.  Repetitive work caused ergonomic injuries and I had to leave.  Found out others with less education were out earning me and wanted something new.  They have a great education reimbursement program but had no appreciation of it once the Degree was completed."
good,"The hours can be a bit long.  The pay is below market for similar jobs at other companies.  The people you work with makes the job tolerable, but even they can become a bother sometimes.  I chalk that up to the frequently demanding nature of the job. "
good,"Onboarding was done incorrectly.  There was no one to train me for 4 months.  I kept asking if I could help anyone, sometimes they had work, sometimes they did not.  After four months began to be more involved.  Still did not get the proper training."
good,Employees are not paid enough. They go above and beyond and their work is usually met with just praise and not enough monetary rewards. This provides a lack if incentive.
good,Worked with a great group of people. My manager was very knowledgable and passed on that knowledge in a very comprehensive manner. My typical day involved completing daily deliverable items for our clients who managed hedged funds for companies and private investors. The most challenging part of the job was completing the daily deliverable items while maintaining peripheral issues as they arose during the course of the day. The most enjoyable part of the job were my teammates.
good,"The job itself is fine. It can have days where it's challenging but mostly repetitive. Most difficult aspect is working with other internal teams, especially those outsourced to India who do not understand questions being asked or speak English very well. "
good,"Culturally diverse professional working environment. However, they are losing great talent and knowledge due to outsourcing. Job security is a tale of the past."
good,While working at BNY Mellon I had a good management team. Learned a lot from this job. Professional enviroment. Most enjoyable part of my job when clients were satisfied with with my job.
good,"if you stay there long enough chances are you will be promoted since attrition is so high most of the time they are desperate for people. Because of the low pay employees tend to be very young, at the start of their careers. It becomes a challenge when having young managers with not enough experience or qualifications/skills to lead a team."
good,"Recent upheavals in senior management of the Investment Management division, including new CEO, will have the business focused on reorganizations and cost cutting for at least another 12 months before the benefits are realized."
good,"A steady busy day to day work load.  Resolving issues. Mentoring and is a subject expert matter to co-workers."
good,"A typical day at BNY is usually either really busy or slow. In either case there is a lot of independence from upper management breathing down your neck. I have really learned alot at this company. The culture is quick to adapt to but ive gained alot of IT experience and there is something more to pick up everyday. We have a good mix of people here who are knowledgeable and willing to help others. The hardest part of the job for me is trying to keep up with changing technology, but that is also the most enjoyable part as well. What you learn here will really help you to grow here or even somewhere else."
good,"Daily overtime work. Go in early, stay late, work weekends, get asked to work more more more. A handful of people carry the majority of the workload for the group that I have had experience working with. Extreme lack of management."
good,It was a good place to learn processing in finance and it also paid decently. The staff was a younger group which was also beneficial.
good,"ok place to work high stress daily basis"
good,"Hard working staff and colleagues willing to teach and share information made for an enjoyable workplace. Each and every day offered unique opportunities to successfully complete daily workflows within very tight time constraints. Prided myself on very low remittance fees. I improved interoffice communications of accounting requests, resulting in a reduction of processing errors and duplicated efforts."
good,"I work with a group very talented professionals with diverse background across multiple locations.  It is a challenging work environment with recent changes related to outsourcing, migrating jobs to different locations, and changes in leadership.  At the end of day, we all work together to serve our clients.  Collaboration with various partners to achieve a common goal is the most enjoyable part of my job."
good,"Good company to expose the knowledge."
good,"Lots of key transferable skills to learn from day one at this dynamic company, very performance driven, having to interact/develop relationships with many clients both internal and external.  "
good,The hardest part of the job is the current Manager.  I believe a Manager should strengthen the team not weaken it with control issues.
good,"Management is scary, every day is an emergency. Seems like the banks going up in flames."
good,"On any working day, I adapt to shifting priorities in a fast paced environment. I interact professionally with employees of all levels within the company."
good,This is a very good job if you with great benefits.  What spoils this job is the office politics that is being played by management.
good,"Good place, friendly people, departments are laid back, difficult to match on benefits, i have learnt a lot, not always opportunities to develop"
good,"BNYM is a great place to work as a first job or if you want to work in this type of sector as it does hold some weight in on your CV."
good,"enjoyed job. i had more knowledge of mortgage loan documents,  and of different loans as far as FNMA, GNMA, FHLMC  etc. i enjoyed working with my co-workers. management wasnt so great there, definitely need to work on there work ethic and treating employees better but other than that it was pretty great."
good,Company is very good. Salary benifits are good but management is worst. Favoritism/ politics on high level.
good,Good job if you can learn on your own. Company needs to provide more required training opportunites.
good,"After spending time with this company, I have decided that it is well past due for me to try and get out.  The department I am in seems to give off the ""I am stuck here"" vibe.  I have learned a lot about the industry and how to make myself a better professional as a whole, but it is time for me to move on."
good,It is a good company to work for but it is currently going through a large turnaround therefore creating an excessively stressful environment.
good,BONY is identified as a custodial bank and therefore as an employee you are limited in learning beyond custody services.  This is the reason why I chose to seek new opportunities.
good,"Responded to all emergency situations as directed by policies."
good,"good place to get experience but not much room for advancement, but definitely a good learning experience and dealt a lot with how trading works, as well as payments, and wires.  overall im happy with the job itself, where as the environment could use some improving."
good,"I was so lucky to work with great co-workers, but the higher managers were not 100% there for you."
good,"Typical day is good"
good,my co-workers make it worth working here. the salary is below average. and minimal work life balance
good,Spent more time training for the job than working on the job.
good,"Management of the fit out process, including the Architects, Engineers, Construction teams, Landlords and agents."
good,"In the role of Production support, every day is different from the last. There is no telling when an incident will occur and what type of incident it will be. This keeps the job very interesting on a daily/weekly/monthly basis"
good,overall they are slightly above average in most areas except for job security but this is virtually non exsistant in todays world as it is almost a sign of the times anywhere you go.
good,At BNY the culture is to hire new graduates pay them minimal salary teach them nothing and have them press keys on a computer all day. Really skill is not a factor in promotion rather the person that can last the longest there is the one that climbs the ladders.
good,"Great place to start or end your career, if you're in between and seeking meritocratic environment, this isn't it. Outside of that it's an ok place to work."
good,"Nice working environment. Typical day involves working on 3 - 7 customer incidents, along with trying to build new machines to replace outdated ones."
good,"Worked for BNY Mellon as a result of the acquisition of JP Morgan's Structured Finance Department. Interesting changes, but didn't stay for long"
good,"A typical day consisted of performing account administration procedures, ensuring bond issuers maintained all covenants of the bond's underlying Trust Indenture, performing account reconciliations, preparing for monthly debt service, and investing funds in qualified investment vehicles. I learned how to quickly navigate through large legal documents for relevant information as well as how large corporate bonds are structured."
good,This was the foundation of business development career. I am thankful for the skills acquired.
good,This company taught me a great deal about how big money banking works. I dealt with collateral and very high dollar amounts.
good,Overall it is a good organization to work for.But from the advancement point of view there is less scope for experienced and qualified people here.
good,"When I worked there too managers were in NYC but most of the workers were in Pittsburgh.  Activist Investor thinks there are too many employees, so yearly layoffs.   Company looking to replace IT staff with off-shore employees."
good,The benefits do not outweigh the pay disparity compared to competitors. You will be secure in your job and can learn a lot. The team leaders are good and will help with goals.
good,"Didn't like corporate trust because you got stuck in this field and cannot go somewhere else                                   "
good,"Reputable Bank to have on the resume. Good professional experience, salaries need to improve not inline with the current job market. Career advancement is very limited."
good,Company does not stand by their employees. The security guards act as if your in a prison. The pay and raises are poor. I wouldn't expect anything from this company. People are great for the most part.
good,"When It was Inautix, It was a good company to settle down here. After recent management changes, everything gone wrong. "
good,"the entire job was meh. good work/life balance, horrible management, no organization and a constant push for work that wasn't your own being shifted onto your plate at the last second but ultimately you were able to leave it all at the door when you left at 5pm which isn't the type of career anyone should aspire too but it also isn't the worst job in the world"
good,"Hard to advance or get competitive raises.  Management drives most everything with very little input from workers and ongoing projects were not advertised very well.  It was an interesting environment with many challenges and it keeps you interested.  I will never work for another financial institution though, at times it seemed like the IT staff was just another expense to be minimized and dealt with."
good,"Overall, BNYM is an average company to work for. Like most other companies, there are desirable qualities and undesirable qualities about the company."
good,"The working environment is extremely free. Standard working time, loose attendance. Most employee work from home on Friday. Tasks are not complex or urgent. May be ideal if you value high on free time. It's not good for people in early career."
good,lot of entry level opportunity. Management assumes all young people will leave for more money so there isn't a focus on progression/development. Many teams rely on old tech
good,"My office had a very toxic culture, and I did not enjoy working there. I learned a number of valuable skills while working with the company that prepared me for other roles (and for that I am grateful). But overall, my experience with the company was unpleasant."
good,It was an alright job. People were just ok to work with. The pay was not very good at all. The benefits are good for your family and the 401k matching is great
good,"While the company offers good benefits and somewhat competitive compensation, they are having a tough time figuring out work/life balance.  Recently there was an initiative to restrict work-from-home and based-at-home capabilities by bringing all employees back to a physical office location, which caused a huge uproar from employees.  The decision was reversed; however, still seems to be under discussion for the future."
good,"Work-life balance was great since there was a 2/day week WFH policy, but I've heard they have since revoked it. Upper management is not great and will make it difficult to move up and around and compensate accordingly. That was my experience, at least."
good,Hires new graduates but does not necessarily match the correct employees to the position. Prefers to hire external rather than promote from within. Very involved with community partnership events.
good,Long service is not valued anymore. Lost my job as the new idea was to acquire new talent vs loyalty and years of service. Very professional and knowledgeable people were laid off at the last round.
good,"The management was really bad, also the training was really poor and also short . For a position such as corporate actions I expected at least 4 weeks training rather than just 3 days..."
good,"Good people to work with.great scope of opportunities."
good,A very good company to start a career after college. Great employees that really make the environment and culture of the company a fun and exciting place to work. The only negative is the salary is the bare minimum of the fund accounting world.
good,Micromanaging at it's best in the most recent years.  High-stress environment and solely performance-based. There is room for advancement to a certain degree but you are on your own.
good,"Unpleasant conditions where workers are not treated to any perks.  There is no kitchen and no free drinking water, not even tap water.  The environment is frugal to a fault."
good,It is a dull place to work. There is no organization at the work place. People are nice but it is not the place if you want grow and maximize your potential in the IT industry.
good,"Great company to work for, they may want to try to look at their employees technical skills and promote within to improve work culture and employee morals."
good,"I found the culture at BNY Mellon to be catty among the folks in my department. Folks in leadership seemed to be disconnected with the entire group, and disinterested in the folks that report to them. "
good,I was a temp worker. I was told i should be offered a full time job after 3 months. I worked for 6 and still didn't hear anything. I was told there were no positions available. Then they hired on a new Full Time employee.
good,Bank of New York melon provided opportunities for pricing mutual funds for their clients. calculating the deli now of the funds was the main responsibility. He never missed calculation greater than .5% was a major problem.
good,"Been with the company over two years going on my third, and I have not learned much nor been promoted to a better position as promised when hired."
good,"Nice place to work. No one place is perfect, but they nice. Benefits have gotten more expensive, but parking is reasonable and close to the building. A bit clique-ish and not very accepting of new people, but you get used to it."
good,"Working within internal operations, I didn't have a personal perspective on the overall company's output or workings. The focus within my unit was in making certain that our piece of the puzzle was  attended to."
good,"Depending upon the manager, could be an excellent work environment or miserable. Many of the more interesting tasks are located in New York City, not Pittsburgh."
good,"Management easy to approach if you have any work of personal issues, not always helpful in providing help if work loads hit high peaks. Staff helpful and friendly will always try to assist if they can"
good,Culture has migrated from Client centric to Shareholder centric. Focused on being best value provider vs  best service provider. Benefits adequate not interested in being a leader in this area.
good,"This company has struggled over the years to advance on par with industry peers due to a conservative senior management style that has not fostered growth and innovation. Many years of underinvesting in employees, along with not hiring top quality employees in the first place, resulted in an underachieving workforce. Recent executive management changes have sought to bring in talent in from outside top firms, instead of properly developing and promoting incumbent employees, in order to transform the company."
good,I have enjoyed my time at BNYM and I have had the ability to learn and grow (personally).  I am one that let me actions dictate my position and more importantly my earnings.  I feel that my responsibilities way out match my earnings.  I feel I may be in need of a change.
good,The effective processing of large-money transactions requires accuracy and speed. I took pride in my ability to excel at both. Yearly reviews enabled me to gauge my progress and provided constructive feedback.
good,"The salary isn't competitive, but if you are willing to relocate out of state you will be able to advance in your career. They offer shift work and you need to be able to work odd hours."
good,"I was laid off in a phone call without an opportunity to truly respond,  A meeting with my supervisor would have been more beneficial along with a more descriptive and specific reason for the layoff, "
good,"I was more stressed in the short time I worked there than any other position I have ever had. I liked my coworkers, but the environment was too stressful and I wasn't happy there."
good,"Majority of employees in Asset Servicing Department are near retirement or entry level. They do not retain talent and it is a revolving door of turnover. "
good,"A typical day within this Group was predictable and unpredictable. I was mainly responsible for reviewing documentation, verifying and confirming that the documentation that was submitted by clients was correct and in compliance with bank regulations. The accounts I worked with were mostly Hedge Fund Accounts.  The seven years that I worked there were filled with changes.  I had four  bosses within the time period I worked there.  (This was during the tail end of the merger with The Bank of New York and Mellon Bank.)    The biggest learning experiences was positively embracing change and learning how to be an analyst. All of my previous work experience had been administrative. The hiring process by management in the Pittsburgh office was more apt to hire friends and relatives.This was done more frequently than any other place I worked. Admiration for merit and talent are important to me. The hardest part of the job was explaining to clients that without the correct documentation on file they would not be able to open up an account. The most enjoyable part of my job was the work relationships  established  with the clients I served and experiencing different cultures as the Hedge Fund business is global.  And, of course the comradery with my team members."
good,"The people I worked with were awesome.  I really did not like the hours, 10-6, it was not very conducive to the work/life balance.  Missed a lot of my kids' activities because of it.  Our department was always short staffed and sometimes we had to take on multiple tasks.  Eating lunch at your desk was not uncommon, if you actually had time to eat lunch.  The job was fast paced and it made the day go by quickly, however, sometimes it felt as if the day was never going to end."
good,"Just fairly boring to work here, groups don't seem to have a real reason to interact with each other. "
good,"My eyes used to be glued to the two computers all day. I used to forget to take a break to get a drink or go to bathroom sometimes due to work being so busy."
good,"Overall, you should use BNY Mellon to gain experience for no more than 2 years. Not much exposure to management and has an individual-based work style. Not recommended if you seek collaboration."
good,The benefits were good management could use room for improvement at my location. Also the clients were very demanding and the managers did not seem to listen to employees and how the employees could have a better work experience
good,Typical 9 to 5 job.  Advanced my excel skills and written communication skills. Management is no longer libral. Responsibilities change quite too often. Workplace culture is relaxed and informal. No overtime allowed given the volume of work is very high on many occasions. Paid vacations.
good,"BNY is a decent introduction to what life at a corporate job will be like. The work itself is not terribly stressful but I there needs to be some work placed into propelling a more supportive culture amongst peers and management."
good,"It's a job. Nothing more, nothing less. "
good,"Figure it out . . . they died off years ago."
good,"A great deal of time is spent in meetings and needless ""internal performances"" that don't move the needle on the dial."
good,I worked from home so I wasnt able to build a relationship with my co workers in order determine a full workplace experience but the small interactions I had with my small team were very supportive during the night shift.
good,Non-competitive rates. minimal intensives are offered on a monthly basis only. Overtime is extremely limited and must be approved prior which is almost pointless..
good,"BNY Mellon has a good culture where people respect each other, though the career advancing opportunities are few."
good,i did not enjoy working at bny mellon the management was awful the pay was standard and there was no real carrer opportunity while working at bny mellon.
good,"I enjoyed working in a few different departments. Some of the management was overly negative and punitive, but most were approachable and fair. Though I did not find the pay to be sufficient for the work environment, and the medical insurance is terrible, I like that this company is very community based and diverse. Some of the management could be downright ornery and inappropriate, but most were approachable. Most departments are very inflexible with scheduling."
good,"Pretty challenge with different tasks everyday. Finding the possibility is the most fun part of the day. Data mining in the data and ""translate""them into useful information and present to Senior management to capture profitability"
good,"In the past 1 year of my stint with BNY Mellon is being an unique experience in my career , unlike traditional banking things are little differently done at BNY Mellon. "
good,"Bank of New York took over National Community Bank and made it seem like a very hostile takeover.  There was not the friendly, fun work place that we had had.  The company made their goals were very cut throat and difficult to work with."
good,Standard larger bank workplace. They pile on work to the people who show they can handle it and give less work to the individuals who are not able to handle it so they can coast without causing issues.
good,"Very interesting working, but not good for my soul. The guy who did the best in this company when we started was amazing. Though he was a geologist....so weird, he kept his head down, no waves and is a VP now. Could give hope to some and scare others."
good,The pay was absolutely horrendous. There was very limited paid time off. Management did not provide opportunity for advancement. I would not recommend to anyone.
good,"The stated culture at this company was very good, however, depending on the location, this culture was not often felt or encouraged at the employee level."
good,The job had high volumes at times that were unrealistic given the resources available. This often causes people to rob form their personal lives to complete the work.
good,"During my employment I was not given much training, there were no training documents I could use as reference, and there was a restructure of job titles which changed the position I was hired for in a way that looks to other companies like a demotion."
good,"I worked with some great managers and other colleagues.  However, exceedingly tight budgets, insufficient resources, and later, organizational restructuring made the overall culture hard to navigate.  I luckily developed a good reputation there which led to my advancement.  Overall, I was proud of what we accomplished but incentive compensation conversations were always difficult with my directs due to the budget constraints."
good,This division at BNY Mellon Corp. was a startup that got off the ground but senior management decided to exit the business after a few years of operations.
good,"Une bonne entreprise, un personnel multiculturel et une très bonne ambiance de travail."
good,"Good Company, Sometimes stressful environment, during my years at the company i have grown professionally and personally. However,"
good,"As an employee over 25 years for the bank, I have seen changes that will affect future performance of the company. Gone are the days of staff that really care about the company and their success. It has become so much of a - I only do my job - environment, I am concerned about the long term affects of this new environment."
good,"Low motivated employees due to poor incentives. A culture built on protecting yourself and doing minimal work while pushing responsibility on to other. Good place to work for a short time, not a great place to pursue a career."
good,working in Global Income and Tax and handling Tax Reclaim function. BNY Mellon is top Investment company in the world and mostly involved in custody business/
good,"Nice place to work and great place to learn new paths."
good,"The company is really good, the work culture is also good. But the management is not good at all. The promotion process is very slow, you end up waiting for years or change in company."
good,the company is good to work & operations executive consulting in the field of share trading I have combined experience of over 11+ years in INDIA& reputed International organization in CANADA
good,"Management is approachable and will assist if it is imperative."
good,I enjoyed the work and the people at BNYMellon.  The work was hard to get done because the systems did not always work the way they should.  Since we where on a dead line this made it difficult to get the job done in a timely manner.  Very stressful job
good,The company does try to hold events to bring different teams together. Volunteer opportunities are available. Provides opportunities and trainings to contribute and succeed within our organization.
good,"As a Project Manager, your days vary. One day you maybe  working on an ongoing assignment, then next day you are asked to handle a different assignment. You do have deadlines for specific assignments, others may just pop up and need to be handled immediately. Sometimes there are issues where there is no one available to escalate and you have to make the call. I learned a lot about Risk and Compliance and enjoyed it."
good,"Its a solid company that drains you to the point of weakness. No motivation, no decent raises and the mentality is you never do enough."
good,Nice place to work... nice atmosphere. Feels good working in such esteem company. It is a good place with learning experience and also very good atmosphere to work.
good,"In the call center there is not much room for advancement. Terrible work/life balance, once you get a shift you are stuck with it until you get out of that position."
good,"BNY has started to outsource to a lot to India.  They have been doing lay offs every three months.  I like my job, however, management has their favorites and they get all the higher profile projects.  Also, it was never told to me that we are considered a small back office call center.  Individualized attention to my firms is difficult when I am answering phone calls for firms that I do not support.  It is also frowned upon having our firms call us directly."
good,The company has a decent benefit plan. One of their focuses is on Employee Engagement. They are good with work/life balance and making necessary accommodations.
good,"Good working environment."
good,"Mediocre company with poor benefits, advancement, salary and leadership."
good,"Its healthy competition. Working with BNYMellon is very experienced & good knowledge gain."
good,"While there are a lot of good people at BNY, culture from the higher-ups isn't a warm or very positive one.  Many managers will avoid looking at you for fear of having to say Hello."
good,"Albridge solutions, a division of BNY Melon. It'a good place to learn about wealth management. It's a software company that started of as a group of developers that went through cycles of acquisition by PNC Bank, followed by  BNY Mellon. "
good,"Daily work was wonderful, I've learned alot about the legalities and what is required to process transfers, redemptions, exchanges, etc. in the world of asset servicing. My co-workers are great, the hardest part is coming; my whole department is being displaced. The most enjoyable was meeting and working with my co-workers."
good,"A typical day at work is mainly focussing on administration within the settlements team. We come across problems constantly and we look at getting them resolved as quickly as possible. Our main focus is our Clients, making sure they get everything the require from us. We must stick to tight deadlines as we have to prepare and send application forms before a specific deadline on behalf of our clients and this is vital as if they are not sent on time, this incurs fines on the business and we lose our customers loyalty. "
good,BNYMellon overall is a good company if you are fortunate to work for the right groups. I was not fortunate. I was working for a terrible and ill prepared group. Our managers were extremely behind schedule and did not have basic things in place like onboarding. it was pure chaos at times. but the irony is that while meeting others who worked for the bank on different projects whose experiences were the polar opposite. My question has always been why does a company like that overlook bad management?
good,"I come in between 6:30 to 7PM. I start my day with responding to critical emails and then writing my own emails for follow-ups. My day is always full of meetings between 8:30 AM to 6:00 PM. I usually meet with the business, my teams, employees, regulators, and business clients."
good,"It's far from the worst job I've had.  The work isn't overly interesting and the organization is a little unorganized.  You need to be a self learner, because there is little to no training,"
good,"Although I did not dislike my job for any one particular reason, I did not love it for any particular reason either.  The department did not have the kind of environment which promoted the best employees and it was quite evident that if you wanted to settle into the same monotonous position, it would be quite easy here since the work itself was interesting at times.  Overall, I would say that the position fits some people and even though I was good at my job, I did not want to settle into any level of comfort concerning my career."
good,The company is still trying to play catch up from the merger. Instead of redesigning/developing new systems they mash legacy ones together which creates issues and more work for the staff. I often though upper management did not know what direction they wanted to take the company in. Every other week it seemed like there was a hierarchy change. The pay is ok but bonuses are nonexistent. Vacation time is good and the jobs are flexible if you need to come in a little late or leave a little early. It is a big company and you do have the chance to learn a lot but you have to take the initiative to do so.
good,"Pros,"
good,Good work/life balance but not able to move in career path. No formal training. Hours are good and vacation/sick is great. Benefits are typical.
good,Good work life balance. There are a lot of internal transfers within the company. The company also  hires a lot of temps for projects with no intentions of ever hiring them even though they say the position is temp to perm. Bonus's are laughable.
good,"I like the flexibility of my current position, but I feel that management doesn't compensate its employee's based on their performance."
good,"Just another job, no real complaints. This was more of a temp to perm type of situation. If you work hard you will be noticed by management, whether you move up or not is up to them."
good,"I enjoyed in this company, lots of good co- workers, I spent the good time with them, I participated in all the activities happened in the company. the hardest part of the job is cab was coming before 1 & half hours.  Management is very good.. every thing was perfect there from house keeping to managers. I learned there that do not share your secrets to your co workers."
good,"BNY Mellon has been an institution of learning for the most part with many experienced employers who have spent 15 or more years on the job. The workplace can use a ton of updates on the tech side and do not expect a young hip culture- many things have not changed in 15 plus years in the various departments. I learned its not common practice to change processes, Much of the management implement the ""if its not broken don't fix it"" ideology and there is very little room for innovation. The most challenging part of the job is training, it is a crash course in the workplace as there is no formal training procedure due to low turnover (again many of the employees have managed these desk for 10+ years). The best part of the job is being able to tap into the vast knowledge of some of the senior managers. They are very eager and willing to pass on what they know and back you up whenever you are stumped with a problem, they know the street!"
good,I worked in the trusted department I learned a lot about investments. My c0-workers where like my family there.
good,Benefts were good- the best co-workers. Location was the best for the community needs. Managment was always willing to help employees wih developing skills
good,"I trade money market investments. I ensure trades are processed and settled in a timely/accurate manner. I ensure all wires are received and General Ledger accounts are in balance on a daily basis"
good,"Work environment is good and very productive."
good,"Analyze complex trade tickets for OTC derivatives (i.e Options and Swaptions etc) and deliver proper templates to global vendors"
good,"On a normal day, I arrive and first go through all the prior day items that were processed to ensure all processing is correct. Once those have been confirmed and closed I begin to work on the current day workload. This includes: posting and cancelling/correcting trades to submitting conversion uploads (a total 5 per day.) I also assist in training fellow associates on new procedures to ensure they understand the responsibilities that are required in our department. There are also many times that I will QC all of the work being processed by other associates. this is done to lessen the risk of gain/loss and financial exposure for our client.s"
good,"I perform various job functions throughout my day.  I work on Account Openings, Maintenance on existing Accounts with BNY Mellon per directions provided by our Client Service teams, process reports which reflect the daily workflow of various groups with our department, review and approve tax documentation for newly opened account or pre-existing accounts based on the new FACTA regulations."
good,It was a difficult environment with given the harsh economic climate.  There were constant organizational changes and budget cuts with few perks.  Very conservative atmosphere more consultants then full-time employees.
good,Upper management expects a lot from operational areas with little pay increases and advancement. Upper management praises the wrong individuals.  My co-workers made my job enjoyable.
good,"My duties consist of opening company systems for daily operations, reconciling FX accounts, managing team members to run operations and improve or streamline daily processes. I learned to handle difficult, time sensitive deadlines and work with colleagues in handling projects to completion. The people I work with are professional and friendly.  Some of the toughest times occur at the end of the month, all of us had to do twice the work because of month end reporting.  The best part of the job is the exposure I get to different departments and what I learned from them, as well as the satisfaction of successfully meeting demanding requirements for accuracy and timeliness in an ever changing environment."
good,"Work Life was very hectic. Everyday I had to do overtime for an average of 14 hours. From learning prospective the Organisation is good. Middle level Management only for my process was not co-operative and creative. Ideas placeforth where rejected without even giving a thought. But, the Senior Level Management were keen whenever approached and implemented my thoughts when I left the Organisation. One of the best payers in the market. There are very good processes to learn and excel. Enjoyable moment was Friday's after work (actually Saturday morning) when we use to go to hotels for breakfast and ease our pressures. Overall good Organisation to work if the Mid Level Management is supportive."
good,Great place to begin your career. The team is full of good people to work with day in an out. The pace is slow and there can be some long days there.
good,"- Les fonctions du travail très mécanique. "
good,"My team in BNY Mellon was Short Term Investment Fund (STIF)."
good,"This company is trying to diversify and expand; it is a great place for entry level employees to learn the ropes of the financial industry, make new acquaintances, and expand their networks. Management is typically respectful of their employees, open to constructive criticism, and willing to listen to ideas on how to make things better. The hardest part of the job is the level of stress involved, working on multiple portfolios and performing tasks that might not technically be in your job description. However, the experience and friendliness of the people around you will help you to manage your stress and teach you the most effective way to do your job. The job will provide you with lots of work at a mediocre salary, but awesome coworkers and managers will get you through the day."
good,"BnyMellon is a typical Banking workplace. Work life balance is good, pay is average, outsourcing of IT jobs a concern."
good,"As an intern at BNY Mellon, the workflow was fairly slim.  However, being in the corporate life, it gave knowledge and provided some real-world working experience.  I had a hard time finding work, because it seems as though they did not have anything prepared for me.  Most days it was hit or miss, but I had always finished they work quickly.  Everyone at work was very friendly and easy to talk to.  It was a hectic work day, though.  Co-workers were always busy and running around the office."
good,"Bank of New York is not a very good place to work because there is no work life balance.  You will work very hard with very low pay.  Even if you are promoted that does not mean you will get an increase in pay, mostly likely you will not"
good,Excellent co-workers. Always work as a unit and support each other. Management is top heavy and not supportive.
good,Excessive internal processies that might it difficult for one to do their job.  Technology is not up to Market demands
good,"First off, BNY Mellon is a great place to work if you have a good manager that actually wants to help you advance, but most do not. They prefer you sit in the same seat and rot for years. The compensation for what you are going to be doing is an absolute joke, and the raises are even more laughable. Even if you do advance they will give you the least amount possible, which is like most companies i guess. Most of the people you will work with have been there for years and are bitter people who just like to complain and are never optimistic about anything. Basically, if you want a 9-5 job that is okay and secure then this is the place for you, but it is not a place to make a career unless you have the right connections."
good,One thing i have learned here that you should be proactive & do your work then & there you should not pile it up for later.
good,"When it was just Bank of New York, it was great, a lot to learn, from several departments, and the network of management correlating with each other made work that much easier, then they merged with Mellon Financial, then came the layoffs, and everyone in New York moved to New Jersey!"
good,Salary and advancement are below average. Hard work gets no reward or recognition.
good,"Due to the site closure of the Swindon office scheduled for February 2013, I am in a position to look for new employment."
good,This was not in my line of work but I accepted the position until i was able to find a place in my line of work because I was relocating to a new area.
good,"It is typical to be extremely busy during beginning of month and month end. Typical day includes general account administration, monitoring incoming cash, preparing outgoing wires and checks, preping for fixed as well as variable rate debt service payments, settling trades, and responding to client inquries."
good,Long days long nights. Mandatory overtime consistently. Learned to work with the vicor and the dmp operating systems.
good,"From a consultancy perspective, major downfalls were the lack of job security. Management seemed generally dismissive (some, not all) of my inquiries of being hired on a full time basis although I was popular with co-workers,clients and line manager and had no complaints against my work."
good,"I was only there for two months. I like the company. However, I did not feel safe at the location I was working. I was almost mugged twice while I was running errands during lunch break. Both times, a co-worker came to my rescue. After these two experiences, I practically satyed indoors eventhough I desperately needed some fresh air to clear my mind."
good,"Working at BNY Mellon has taught me a lot in regards to handling stress, and being able to juggle multiple tasks/deadlines at one time. Working in a team environment calls for very good communications in which there could be improvements in this area. The most difficult part of the job is being in front of a computer 5 days a week for 8 hours a day. The most enjoyable part of the job is the co workers I work with. Even though our job can get very stressful at times we all still find ways to laugh and enjoy our days."
good,Fantastic co-workers always willing to help get the job done.
good,A great place with the best people in the world. I enjoyed working with the people and the managers treated us well.
good,It would be better if there were more opportunities for employees to grow within the company rather than having to leave to get a decent salary. It seems like the company is going to lose alot of talent that way.
good,The Bank of New York Mellon has great benefits. Its a good place to work if you are college student. The culture could be a little better its out dated. Work/life balance is good most of the time I get home at a decent time. Management is fair most practices are out dated.
good,The supervisors and other coworkers are always willing to help you.
good,"I was unable to finish registration for this website without providing a review of my employer. As that is the case, and as I do not feel it is appropriate to do so, I am instead writing this."
good,"With New management coming in from Top dow, there are a few changes expected, New management lines and Investmenyts in technology ."
good,Too many ppl that work there are stressed out and lots of ppl wanna leave but cant. The benefits are great and you get plenty of time off such as vacation and sick days.
good,"BNY is a good company to work for. There have been many improvements in the past year, which make BNY a fun place to work. The employees are valued and respected."
good,I was in financial services part of BNY Mellon. This included positions in shareholder services and fund accounting. I learned a lot. My direct management was fair. Most people on my team got along. The hardest part of the job was the commute. Pay wasn't great and the company has a habit of laying people off. Most enjoyable part of the job was what I learned and the people.
good,The last department I had worked in before I left the company. Immediate supervisor and department manger were not very good. I admitted to my errors I made and stand up for them. I was wrote up for the plus other issues. Then management decided to have me train a new person. Just after I got wrote and was told I would be fired if I messed up again. Why would you give me a person to trim?to train
good,"Company is outsourcing a lot of Jobs to India, there is not good job security here. The company is trying to cut costs and do more with less, for the last 5 years the company has had multiple company wide layoffs and reorgs, lots of talent is leaving the company."
good,If you are looking for a place to work to get into the IT field then this company would be a good fit. It is rather competitive within the company once you get started and some of the work can be very stale.
good,Work life balance is great but the company lacks general direction from management to individual teams. The people are generally nice but not necessarily motivated to go above and beyond their day to day.
good,"great company to work for"
good,"I enjoyed my time at BNY Mellon.  Pressure can be intense at times but the team culture is there to help.  Would like a more work/life balance environment, though."
good,"When i was there the workplace environment was wonderful . The management at the time were fair , extremely bright and profitable as were most of the trading team"
good,"Raises are typically very low, so it is hard to increase compensation internally without moving externally first. Overall it was a laid back environment, not very challenging though. Mediocrity is accepted."
good,"my previous company was outsourced to BNY Mellon, and now my BNY is having layoffs throughout the company both domestically and international. Stopped allowing employees to work from home"
good,"Contract work When contract was finished all contact employees were let go - there was no opportunity for permanent employment."
good,This is my reviewyhis job it was a bad experience and very high school environment I dont have much else to say but need enough characters so here it goes
good,"Started as a temp, was hored on after three months. Seem to be struggling between having ""too much work"" and not enough. Not enough managers per the floor I was on to handle/help the flow of temps. Two managers I had were great."
good,I was very happy with BONY and we had a very cohesive team that always attained measurable results.  What triggered my departure was a senior manager who lacked the vision to recognize a truly dynamic team and lacked the backbone to stand behind us and fight for well earned compensation increases above the normal bell curve.  Previous managers possessed those qualifications and made us feel appreciated for the tireless hours we often had to work to meet a goal or deadline.
good,"As an accounting specialist, there was 3 hours of work for a full day. I simply wasn't challenged enough in my role and left after a year. Also, the floor was so quiet you could hear a pin drop. The culture wasn't for me."
good,Not really a good fit for me. There are some good things about the company if all you are concerned with is making money. It was not really all that motivating to me.
good,"In my 5 years of working at BNY Mellon, my department head and department name changed 2 times. Many resources in my department transferred to another department essentially duplicating roles, influencing a lot of conflict and confusion, and eventually resulting in layoffs."
good,Solid place to learn. Management structure a bit outdated. Solid and stable culture. Turnover and development of staff is changing. Challenge is faced by management when trying to change established processes.
good,"good employee support "
good,"Learned the intricacies of the waterfall partnership accounting model."
good,"Since new CEO, culture is not in the best place.  Environment is not the greatest. I wouldn't recommend working there. Constant layoffs, very few job perks.  Not much room for growth."
good,The company is always looking for ways to cut costs so there is little job security. Advancement is even hard as most managers have been with the company for decades
good,Decent bank. Markets division is virtually nonexistent. Bank is very risk averse. Very Sleepy bank environment. its a tech driven organization. Corp Trust is the largest pie of business.
good,"cold atmosphere in HR and static"
good,The company was great in the beginning after the new CEO took place we had many layoffs and everyone is scared to lose their job.I am currently moving on because we know that our department will be relocated over seas.
good,"At present not recommendable to any of friends or colleague due to uncertainty and vision of the company."
good,. I was working as a project lead & overall it was good.
good,Excellent company but bad IT management has made the business loose at lot of skilled staff across the globe. Short term fixes instead of strategic solutions is the state of play. All key engineering and architecture being pulled back to the US and no link with the business in all regions.
good,BNY Mellon was a great place to work however I am going to move on since they did not provide adequate job fullfillment for me to stay there for an extended time.
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was delivering positive results. Collaborating with many teams to understand clients requirements, developing the best solution and seeing how satisfied our client has become is the ultimate measure of my team's success."
good,The jobs at BNY Mellon require attention to detail.  The need to be accurate is also a key component in all of the jobs at the company as you are managing clients money.
good,Typical Big Corporate Environment. Work is being off-shored which brings layoffs. You are just a number on the floor and there is no motivation for you to put your 100%.
good,BNY Mellon has ridiculous expectations. Time is micromanaged which is not great because it is not always possible to complete things in the required time. Their phone scoring system is absurd.
good,Same work every single day. Only advancement if you look for it. Management doesn't know how to manage teams well. Place is going down and lay offs everywhere.
good,I enjoyed working at BNY Mellon however it was very demanding.  Job was interesting as well as people.  As with all jobs some people work harder than others and are relied upon heavily.
good,"Working there isn't bad if you can make the commute. once there they kinda don't want you to leave your desk, they have had issues with people leaving their desk/ bathroom breaks, etc.... Everything counts against you, calling out, leaving early, even if you have the time to take it. I did not like that. the management was cool to work with, if you had an issue they tried to work with you."
good,Great job out of college and easy to get started on your career. Compensation is poor and the company also has a lack of culture that in today world is essential.
good,"I learned a number of good things at my work and I enjoyed working with most of the team members. My management was flexible with respect to workday, appointments, time off when needed, etc. The benefits are pretty decent. The salaries are lower than in many comparable places. "
good,"A typical day at work consisted mostly of scanning documents to make sure they are on the computer for data entry."
good,"The work and the responsibilities that I have performed was interesting. I was given a various book of accounts, consisting of New Jersey municipal counties; and also various New York accounts. Each month, invoices were sent to clients in order to notify when payment(s) are due, either by wire or by check. On a daily basis, I monitor the trial balance and the journals to make sure that the monies hit the right accounts and also, that every account is in balance. During the beginning and the middle of the month, debt services payments are due."
good,I was only at the company for a short time due to the lack of job advancement.  I was also there when the merger with BNY and Mellon was going on.  I felt there would be lay offs since the operations for Mellon were in cheaper locations.
good,The teams we were able to create a BNYM were foundational to the success of the Bank. We were always able to attract talent from outside the Bank was well as internally. We were given the right level of leadership and autonomy.
good,Company offers benefits and vacation time from day one.  The company has had its challenges with merger.  Associates in each area of the company most likely has different experiences.
good,Didn't see a lot of opportunity for advancement. The team was helpful and kind. I was there as a temp and wasn't guaranteed full hire. That seemed to be the story for most people there.
good,"Recommends"
good,"Good company to start a career,  Business processes are lacking behind from a technology perspective, but overall they function.  Seasoned technology staff are retiring or moving on and the younger generation is reluctant to step in to a support role."
good,"Overall a good organization to work with if you get a good boss to work with, after all people don't leave bad organizations but bad bosses. "
good,Good company to work with.The work culture is very encouraging and teammates are very helpful.Will always motivate to try new and new things.Management is also very supportive.
good,"Great team that created a fun work environment. Understandable work. "
good,"A good place to start your career after college, but you should begin looking for better opportunities after a year. Small room for advancement coupled with very poor wages."
good,The benefits are great. A little expensive but that is everywhere now in days. There was a lot of mandatory OT which was not OK with me but they did their best to accommodate your schedule if you needed time of. Also a good place to work if you are going to school and need special schedules. Which is what I did. Pay is ok but they do have an incentive program which can make you about $50-200 a paycheck.
good,"Developed overall test strategies for unit, process, functional, integration, and acceptance testing. Defined and maintained test system configurations, performed test executions, and wrote test scripts for integrated systems."
good,"Too many old systems running in vaccume. "
good,Good place to work and I learned a lot. I liked the hours and pay. The benefits are good. The office environment was comfortable. I will seek employment again.
good,Some changes are for the good others are not. Nothing more is to be said that cannot be found elsewhere online if enough research is done. New CEO brings changes
good,Great place to start and build your career.  High visibility to senior management.  Exposure to global leaders thanks to a flattened organizational structure.  Encourages the associate to be accountable.
good,"High attention to detail needed, building rapport with certain clients is a must, being able to handle stressful situations dealing with over $100mill in assets"
good,"I worked at BNY as a contract employee.  Overall I'd say it is an OK place to work when compared to other companies of the same size.  The people I worked with were nice and had many years of service with the company.  The job I was hired to do was not quite like what was described to me, however some of what I was asked to do allowed me to use skills that I hadn't used in a while so I got to brush up on that.  They had recently remodeled their office in NY to an open space model which in this case is a bunch of large tables set up for 6 people each.  There are no cubicles with walls to give anyone privacy.   There is no assigned seating so when you come in for the day you can take any spot as long as it's in 'your area'.  People usually take the same spot every day anyway but if you're late or come in for half day later someone else may take 'your' seat.  The office can fill up so later in the day you may see people sitting at one of the tables by the window.  People also hold impromptu meetings at some of these tables by the window which is close by where others are working.  So this is not a quiet environment a lot of the time.  There was also some debate about the work from home program while I was there, since the office was crowded a lot while I was there I got the impression that not a lot of people worked from home often.  Regarding performance reviews, they use the 'forced ranking' method, so even if you did a good job and people liked you over the past year you could get a lower rating because someone has to get it."
good,"This was a good first job out of college. I learned a lot and improved my knowledge of Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Outlook, TriResolve, Bloomberg and more."
good,This organization is diverse and job security. This organization is diverse and has job security.  Very fast-past environment.  There is diversity and security.
good,Working here has been a great experience in gaining knowledge. From a temp position they gave me an opportunity. The job is good. Just no room for advancement.
good,"As you learn more within your team you are often expected to take on disproportionate amounts of work.  Some team members have 2-3 hours of work per day while others are expected to complete 10 hours of work in 8 hours.  Depending on the team and department, some managers are excellent while others are incompetent and refuse to listen to suggestions or improvement opportunities.  Employee satisfaction is highly dependent on the managers you work with."
good,"I was hired as a contract employee, was there 2 months and they call me on a Friday not to come back to work. Hired a temp to perm, which never happened"
good,"They know how to develop software well.  They follow SDLC and run nightly regression scripts and have highly intelligent people working there.  Unfortunately, they are not helpful in training much and the complicated work keeps everyone too busy to help others."
good,"Easy work environment. Rarely work over normal 8 hours. Very low pay to market. Was told that compensation was subsidized by bonuses, but you had to fight for them and were far lower than originally stated. Very little room for advancement. Never saw them promote an associate to a Jr. Advisor. They would always hire people outside the company with substantial experience or an established book. Zero opportunity to move up."
good,"Minimal raises, favoritism, lot's of outsourcing, monotonous desk work, unrewarding and unfulfilling. A soul crushing experience for the entry level employee. Not recommended for anyone."
good,It all depends by client but BNY is a good starting point for people getting into the fund accounting business. You get a good overall picture of the processes while working for the company although it can be demanding
good,They provided a internship experience. Full time job offer was a pretty low salary. But good learning experience overall. I would recommend the internship.
good,The company was high paced but you can make a good living.  Very corporate so you have to learn to navigate through different circles which can be difficult at times.
good,"Good place to to work. This was my first experience in Networking."
good,"Empresa boa de se trabalhar, porém muito grupinho fechado dificultando a integração de toda a empresa. Empresa ética e profissional."
good,"The work life balance at BNY is great, that one of the reason I have been there so long. They salary is way below industry standards, but the culture at BNY used be a place where you feel like you want to every day. that culture has changed over the years."
good,I gained a lot of my customer experience here. The hardest part of the job was not having a lot of management involvement to help with question that would arise.
good,"This is specifically for the west borough call center. Quite a few temporary staffing agencies are constantly recruiting for phones positions in the west borough call center.  It is a revolving door with very high turnover.  It involves taking back to back calls from account holders and financial advisors with very in depth financial account and tax questions.  There is no time allowed in between calls.  You need to be able to learn a lot of information in a very short period of time.  It's a high pressure negative atmosphere causing a lot of turnover and burnout of the employees who are left.  If you can find something else for $16 an hour, I'd take it.  It isn't worth the stress that this call center will bring into your life."
good,a typical day at work is structured. Learned about various financial instruments. Management  follows the rules. Workplace culture various per department
good,"Unfortunately the company could do many things regarding talent and culture to improve the situation, but they are unwilling, unable or simply cannot identify the opportunities and refuse to ask the employees affected by policies or procedures."
good,Typical bank environment with a focus on delivery. Can do attitude helps go through the day. Relationship and frequent interaction with stakeholders is key to success.
good,I was displaced from BNYMellon after 19 years.   I have gained experience in all the years.  I enjoyed the environment and the coworkers.  I am now seeking employment elsewhere due to my displacement.
good,"Its a great place to work at, but its not meant for me. I sometimes feels like I could do more better. Other times I feel like there is something I want to do. It offers opportunity, but I lack some experience to be even pick by our HR."
good,Good place to work the hours are good but the pay is not great and the management is nice. They give you a good amount of training prior to working there
good,Good experience right out of college but did not do a good job at growing top talent. I grew a lot and had many opportunities but leaders didn't know how to grow top talent or would not push them further in the organization.
good,Workplace culture is enjoyable.  Employee appreciation days provide a boost in company morale.  The recent change in company dress code seems to be valued by employees.
good,"NO job advancement and a clicky culture. Keep your head down and work or you will be pushed out by management."
good,BNY Mellon offers opportunities for growth and gaining knowledge of corporate finance.  There are many areas of the bank that can fit the needs of the employee.
good,"Great work/home life balance, but not much career growth.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the people.  People always willing to help out.  Hardest part of about the job is lack of career growth."
good,Very under staffed and the call Que would be constantly going. Did not like having to follow a strict AUX time schedule. Lots of young people working in the call center that are not professional.
good,"Company is profit oriented , constantly adding more responsibilities without increasing salary or promoting.  Company do not care for employees, time is somewhat flexible but to a degree of comfort of your manager."
good,Busy from when i walk in to when I walk out.  Training for those interested in management levels. Multi-task on a daily basis. Many different business units within the bank. Able to work with a wide variety of people with diverse backgrounds and previous work experience. Able to collaborate with teams from overseas and domestic.
good,Standard Backoffice processing position - high pressure depending on the department that you are working in. Company was often shuffling and restructuring.
good,"Good environment - low salaries"
good,Upper management has no regard or care for what different parts of the bank actually do to ensure company success. Whenever there are changes in management they all feel like they need to make changes to make their mark but always end up making a mess of things.
good,"My job title was teller/ customer service representative and I assisted customer with their banking transactions including deposits,  withdrawals, transfers, online banking,  opening and closing accounts. I counted vault money and assisted customer with their safe deposit boxes and referred them to CS Representative for CD, IRA , trust account, etc."
good,"Good work life balance. Too many organisational changes."
good,This is a large company in the area.  It employees hundred of thousands of people.  It can be a nice place to work. But it also can be challenging.  Changes that have taken place have changed the cultural.  Change is good and in time the changes will work and be beneficial to all our clients.
good,"Lots of meetings and long email chains. Hierarchical. New leadership, evolving culture. Hardest part is managing legacy systems and personalities. Most enjoyable part is global collaboration."
good,"My impression of the culture is that it is not at the vanguard of cutting edge or innovation. This is a relatively conservative bank that places an emphasis on client service. Admittedly, my vantage is limited to a specific portion of the back-office services, but my impression is that turnover is relatively low due to most employees being satisfied with a stable job with good monetary compensation even if there is limited upward mobility."
good,BNY Mellon Provides the excellent space for those who are willing to nurture their career and they are lack in providing the salary benefits to their employees.
good,"Did not surpassed quality expectations in areas of accommodation, attitude, and expertise. Job involved providing specific and general financial information to shareholders, financial advisers, and accountants."
good,"Good company to learn new concept and process"
good,Traveled to India to train oncoming staff. Acquired leadership skills. Enjoyed working in a team environment. Great opportunity for growth and development
good,in coming calls back to back no time to breathe in between very steady. I didn't like the call that there were times under staffed didn't feel everyone did there share
good,I feel that both the culture and work to life balance are out of balance and that upper management are not in touch with day to day operations. This leads to unreasonable projects during high volume times.
good,"Many people at BNY Mellon have been there for 20+ years that let's you know what type o organization it is.  Some departments have great work life balance but managers depends on your role in the company.  It's a great company but your get out of it what you put in.,"
good,Most days at work while employed at BNYM were rewarding and made you feel that you've accomplished something.  BNYM would be a good employer for most people who enjoy working in banking.
good,"BNY Mellon is an average company to work for with good benefits. I was"
good,Very intense place and not a very friendly motivating environment to work. The opportunity was not given to the masses of people. just people in certain geographical locations.

good,"I enjoy working in BNY mellon due to the work itself being mentally challenging - which I find is great brain stimulation."
good,I personally did not enjoy working here due to the management. Everyone is simply out for themselves. After working here for almost 2 years I found going to work everyday to be a drag and to be extremely toxic.
good,"Fast, dead-line driven environment. Must be able to deliver exceptional customer service, and remain detail oriented. What i loved must is my ability to work in a challenging role."
good,BNY Mellon was a good starting point in my career.
good,In department I was in good worklife balance and area to work for. There was lack of advancement but for the most part stable with few reorganizations.
good,"It is a very fast paced place to work, which is fine. There is a lot to learn and if you are not quick you will not get a grasp on it. Learning what the company is about it also actually quite interesting."
good,"running reports to ensure clients account activity is in order"
good,"It was my first experience in the industry, and I learned a lot. There are opportunities for growth for those individuals who apply themselves and put in the extra work."
good,Second contract stint at BNYM. Involved in CCAR and DFAST project work. Worked with several managers across many departments and in several locations.
good,"Go in check reports, reconcile accounts"
good,"It is an okay place to work.  I was in an entry level job, and it was a typical entry level experience.  All of my coworkers were nice, and the work wasn't that bad."
good,Executive Management was being restructured while I was in the process of leaving.  Think this is going to position the organization extremely well for the future
good,Its pretty easy to get into a complacency trap here at BNY Mellon. Raises are around 2% with no bonuses and advancement is very difficult and bottlenecks
good,was ok no complaints at all about this place only thing is job security is scary there is alot of room for advancement but too much favoritism not enough equal opportunities
good,All of the internal systems were at least 10 years behind the current time. There was a lot of training but none of it was related to what was needed on hand on the desk.
good,"Productive workplace. Very busy workday, Team mostly friendly. Fair pay. Great location. Good commute for anyone - near World Trade Center. Very beautiful building."
good,if you like mangers on your back 24/7 this will be a great place to work they constantly complain about work not getting done when the work is done the do not train well at all.

good,"BNY Mellon has a standard large bank service provider culture. A typical day at work was demanding and fulfilling."

good,•	Taking Medical Records of United HealthCare Members from the original system of CAREONE and transferring them to their new computer system of ICUE inputting between 20-50 pieces of paperwork a day.
good,BNY is known  to pay it's employees below industry standers. It is still one of the few banks that operate under a 35 Hr work week and its good place to start your career.
good,Company tends to start a lot of projects but does not see them through to completion.   A lot of mid level management jockeying for their vision and their ideas so they can make there mark.  Long hours and little compensation.
good,"Good place to work if you lower your expectations"
good,"Good job. Bad pay. No room for advanced salary. I had an excellent team however, there was not much space for increasing wages year after year. The commute was not so bad because my hours were 2pm to 10pm."
good,"Fast paced environment dealing with confidential material.  High profile clientele dealing with large figures on their behalf.  Not very good supervisory or management or team environment at this level. A lot of overtime was required and it financially was not worth the hassle.  Management does not support or take care of their team members.  Job duties often changed midstream.  The company itself is not bad to work for, it just depends on WHOME you worked for.  It often came down to a battle between coworkers and management and coworkers between one another.  Very petty atmosphere not helped any by management."
good,"good company , stable, collaborative"
good,"BNY Mellon is a long-established investment bank (no retail branches). Due to a number of acquisitions over the years, the company has a disparate collection of new and old systems."
good,BNY Mellon has been a good place to work for the HR type activities.  Where they are losing talent is the poor management and frequent management transitioning with no real foresight.
good,"Not a bad place to work, but hard to advance unless you leave the department. Management will work with you in terms of work and life balance. There can be favoritism among groups."
good,"Good company to start our career and work in flexible times. Health care benefits are good, good people to collaborate in the team. Good place to work for persons start their careers"
good,"Not a very great culture. Employees are just a number and aren't acknowledged as individuals. However, it is a very professional work place and the corporate culture is good."
good,"Everyday is different depending on the workload. When training, it is hard to learn as information is not explained thoroughly. "
good,Overall good as per salary point of view but not secured. Working environment is good and also have growth opportunities. Long working hours with transport issues is frustrating but salary balances this.
good,"It is a nice place to work. The technology group is in the midst of much change, which can make things challenging. I like the flexibility the company offers."
good,"it has been too long since i worked for this company to give an honest review."

good,Small Independent company. They strive for nothing but the best customer service to their buyers. owners show great approbation to their employees. Great place to work if you are looking to advance in customer service.

good,BNY is a good place to work.  Especially as an entry level position.  The pay can be improved but overall still a good company.  Has plenty of benefits.
good,Job satisfaction can vary greatly depending on the specific department and manager. Merger of Bank of New York and Mellon centralized some functions in Philadelphia vs New York.

good,"Wonderful place to work, People are great        "
good,"This company from my point of view is very set in their ways. A lot of the employees and management have been here their entire lives and they aren't willing to budge on much.  It's a very ""who you know"" atmosphere when it comes to advancement and career opportunities."
good,I worked here for quite a few years. The company is a great environment and the people who work there all work as a team and are willing to help each other
good,"Old school bank culture, very conservative and pay scale was very detrimental to keeping talent there.  Technologically they were very behind the times."
good,"Workload is very interesting and varied, responsible for high value transactions."
good,Good experience for financial background and loved being able to work at the downtown location. Managers were great and was able to learn a lot. Slow placed environment.
good,I like the position because I like to process payments. it is fast pace and you really have to pay attention or you will get and error. you have to process 3000 pieces of mail per day
good,enjoyed the job for the most part - there was pressure to perform but the job paid well.  lots of politics in the workplace - which I do not like - I just want to do the job.
good,"Generally, BNY Mellon in Wroclaw is a good company for the start, but do not give any perspective for the future."
good,"Its a great place to start your career.  If you lack experience, this is a great place to get some.  However, a lot of what you learn is extremely specific to BNY. Not a lot of transferrable skills."
good,Good working environment with very friendly people. Perfect example of working under pressure especially when working to meet and beat deadlines. High employee turnover has resulted in increased work load under the same conditions and pay.
good,"Had a good time on work experience here but don't think its the place for me. Main focus is to hit targets, not much focus on the employee or progression opportunity."
good,people are very nice. work was inertesting and fun to learn. company was good to the employees. I learn a lot about the banking for accounts payable and accounts recievable

good,Best company to work if u get a good take home in EOM .infra of company is awesome .project are not that great.overall if u want relaxed and peace then best place to work
good,It was atypical Desktop Support position. I supported all the employees in the building that had computer issues. The other employees at Bank of New York were great.
good,"BNY Mellon is a typical large bank corporation.  There is rigid corporate structure. There is little room for growth.  The daily work is not very challenging, but usually managers allow you to set your own schedule as long as work is completed.  Overall work here has been average."

good,"I have learned a great deal about the financial services industry and how to manage over 1,100 accounts with clients across the world. I am now able to process an analyze wires for clients internally within the bank as well as externally to other banks. A typical day of work starts with sending out corporate actions, responding to uninvested cash, processing wires, billing, checking for overdrafts, communicating with Client Service Managers in New York, as well as clients to complete tasks. The management within my team is great. All of the section managers and team leads are extremely helpful when I have a question about the task at hand. The culture in the workplace is terrific. I have a great working relationship with the people I work with in New York and Pittsburgh. The hardest part of the job is getting in touch with people on other teams to resolve issues that the client has. With the accounts being available to so many people, it makes it difficult to keep track of the activity in the accounts and solve some issues."
good,"As a teller, the main responsibility is to count the money correctly and make sure that at the end of the day you are not short or over on money.  Salary is basic but good health insurance back in 2004"

good,"Good benefit, limited growth in asset servicing business, "
good,"BNY is a multinational organization with lots of opportunities,It's a good organization to work with friendly atmosphere but in terms of numbers (salary) there is no motivation."
good,BNY Mellon is a good stable custodian company where job security is higher. On an average most of the employees stay here from long term duration. Once a year company also provide bonus which depends on your quality of work. I can say that the bonus part is mandatory and because of this reason people don't leave this company.
good,"It is an amazing place for new joiners."
good,Relaxed environment. The attire is business casual. There is definitely room for growth if you are in the field of asset servicing in an investment bank. Good entry level work and experience into the corporate world. Not the best place if you would like to get into international/ global work because departments are very segregated.
good,Available upon request. Public posting of such information is not appropriate nor in the BNYM agreed to guidelines. No publicly posted information will be provided by myself.
good,"Good working environment although can be stressful. Managers in Westborough office are down to earth and support and provide a good working environment for the staff. Unfortunately positions are being moved to India, limited growth for domestic workforce."
good,"Very fast paced environment, although the company was very large, upper management made it a priority, to meet with the employees quarterly. All employees go to training classes as needed. Although there was a lot of turn around with  employees and management, the Customers were content and loyal. And they made the job enjoyable."
good,A very Professional Place to work with. Rigid Rules and Regulations. Culture is Good. Favouritism prevails.Hardest part of the job is maintaining the Code of Conduct. Management is Good. Most enjoyable part of the Job is the Extra activities taken place within the organisation.

good,"Recently started crosses training, its good company for startup."
good,My day was dealing with checks coming from every banks. I learned how the banking system operate and to minimize risks concerning decision making on the checks.
good,"BNY Mellon Asset Servicing is a good place to work.  They are willing to teach you new things and help you learn.  Unfortunately, there isn't consistency with Management.  Some Managers are willing to reward ideas and foster growth while others just want to put in their hours and go home.  It is the luck of the draw which kind you get.  And with recent moves of many jobs being outsourced to India, there is a low morale and feeling of insecurity within the company."
good,"The higher up you are in the company, the better of a place it is to work. I started out of college and gained valuable experience."
good,"Good company to start your career at, you gain great experience in the finance industry. Not much room for growth in the call center and the management style is micromanagement. ."
good,Standard bank platform with a conservative approach.  Provides a good work life balance but requires more support in placing the right people in the right seats.
good,"This is a great place to work.  If you're hard working and apply yourself, you can go far.  I began working as a clerk, advanced to an administrator, then a senior administrator, then a specialist.  There are several opportunities to lead projects and develop your skill set and learn new things.  The leadership is fair, encourages development and is genuinely interested in your growth."
good,"Nice that 401k contributions are vested immediately, but overall compensation is below industry standards. They are trying to hire more in the Pittsburgh area to lower compensation costs."
good,This company is good company for people who just graduated from college.  Low salary but good to use as a stepping stone if you have no finance experiences.
good,"Based on my experience, working for BNY Mellon is pretty much a standard office experience. However, there is little opportunity for growth or advancement, and management isn't well organized."
good,"Experience at BNY Mellon has been wonderful, work - life balance is promoted and provided. It's a global company with different opportunities. GOOD COMPANY TO WORK FOR!"
good,It's not backbreaking but they desire too much quality when the pay isn't qualitative to the workers' pockets. It depends who's your manager that values you as an employee.
good,"Good work life balance, lots of flexibility. People have worked there for many years and are very experienced in what they do. However, merit and promotional increases are below market rate."
good,Tends to take advantage of employees that know what they are doing and can work fast. For the amount of work some do the pay is not what it should be.
good,The group that I worked with allowed me to contribute to the company and envionment while helping me feel like I am part of their business. I was permitted to learn at my own pace and focus on using my strengths.
good,Excellent good place to work with positive work environment and flexibility with coworkers. Schedule was very flexible and was able to make my schedule according to what the needs of the office are
good,"Good company to work for but am looking to move upwards in my career now. I would recommend as an entry level, but then once you have got your experience, it is time to look to leave and move on."
good,It was an assistant position to an asset manager. I would mainly be helping with printing and dealing one on one with my mentor. She worked for BNY Mellon
good,"BNYMellon is a great place to work but can vary greatly from departments. Some areas have very strict guidelines, while others are extremely relaxed atmospheres. They offer competitive benefits and there is alot of opportunity for growth within the bank as a whole, however some groups over very little room for personal growth and development."
good,Lots of work but limited growth. This business is all about who you know. If you want to move up you have to get friendly with senior management.

good,The most enjoyable part of the job were the people.  My co-workers assisted me with my training and we work well together.
good,Busy fast paced environment.  You have to be a quick learner and ready to jump right in. Co-workers are like family.  Getting to know co-workers is very easy and they are always willing to help.
good,"Nothing is free- hence all vending machines on all floors- no free lunches- no bonuses for lower level employees. "
good,typical bank. Management is very client focused with little attention to employee accomplishments. Work life balance is fantastic for people with famalies
good,"This company would be a great place to work for if only the pay was slightly more competitive. Also, the lack of cohesion amongst departments as well as employee value from management was at times disheartening."
good,"I was tremendously appreciative of the Bank's work-life balance in previous years. A change in direction/corporate outlook no longer offers this flexibility."
good,"Great place to start a career and there is exposure to a lot of different things. However, turn over is high and morale is low among the employees."
good,"BNYM was a good place to work. Most of the day was spent in assisting clients with servicing. The people met over the years were great co-workers, and friends. The challenges were mostly related to recourses available to handle the work."
good,"A typical day at BNY Mellon consist of production of required work."
good,The sales included making sales of UK car insurance and Break down. The insurance company was Aviva. The day was complete with calls for inbound sales

good,"The company seems to be pretty good to employees, the pay could be better.  The position gets boring real quick, lots of redundancy."
good,"It's a good company to start a career at, but within this particular group, it is very difficult to move up much. I'd advise recent graduates to apply here."
good,Pays employees fairly and keeps a busy work schedule. Training was very poor and left new employees fighting for themselves to learn the job's requirements.
good,Good Management staffing. work with employee was helpful and listen and understand. Help problem and very nice place to work
good,"Work place is very well with all the fun and activities"
good,"The job is rather monotonous, same thing day in and day out.  I am currently a temp and my contract has been extended but I have not been offered a full-time position."

good,large call center servicing clients who hold mutual funds in IRA accounts. Competitive job working in customer service. Minimal tolerance for errors. Great company to work for every team is different.
good,Typical red tape and inefficiencies of a large lumbering bank.  Potential to streamline and create useful tools for employees and clients if management could learn to connect front line users with top down tech development leaders.
good,"A typical day at BNY wasn't typical at all!  In a department where the bulk of the work is generated, broken down, separated and delivered to the many different departments in this 27story building.  I've learned a lot about different money market accounts, Stocks and bonds, and how everything circumvents around the N.Y.S.E.  Management at BNY were fantastic!  We were rewarded in return for exceptional work performed.  The greatest bunch of guys and gals all working in unison!  Made daily operations run smoothly!  There were no hard parts about working at BNY!  Everyone was mature and pleasant to be around.  The Holidays were the most enjoyable part of the job!  Thanksgiving party, Christmas parties were the best!  Fourth of July company picnic, out of control!!  Great times for sure!"

good,The work was very interesting.  I setup clients to access their trading on the internet.  A lot of data processing.  I supervised employees and distributed the daily work.  Fellow employees were very nice to work with.
good,Nice place to work but hours were long. Technology could use some updating. Good Benefits.  Work/Life balance could be improved.
good,"I'm looking to transition into a career that will allow me to use my experience, professionalism and operational background to support an organization destined for success!"

good,"Poor compensation and no room to grow.  Not a good place for young people looking to grow."
good,"When I worked at BNY Mellon I really enjoyed what I did. A typical day at work would be processing checks and reconciling accounts. It was a good starter position for me to at least get my foot in the door in the corporate world. I was offered a promotion and became a work lead a year later. I gained a lot of responsibility and more skills to become a successful lead. However, with the amount of  work I had thrown upon me daily, the pay could have been a little better. My co-workers were not as outgoing and motivated as I was so that was an issue due to laziness. Overall, working for Mellon was a great start for me and I enjoyed gaining as much experience as I did."

good,"Because of global nature of company, one spends a great deal of time on phone with co-workers.  Company is in flux due to pressure from activist investor and there is a great deal of focus on expense management.  Management is trying to foster a culture of innovation but that will take time.  Most co-workers are hard working and want to do the right thing.  Overall a decent place to work"
good,There are a days when I'm busy and days when I'm not busy.  My day mostly consists of calendar management and travel arrangements.
good,This was a fast paced work environment with multiple high priority tasks to perform on a daily basis. There was always something new to learn about.
good,immediate team members were amazing and caring. The work and clients were also very interesting. Company didn't seem to show a lot of loyalty to employees. Still remain in contact with several team members.
good,Fund Accounting Support & Financial Reporting.Bny mellon having Good working culture
good,Very repetitive. Job duties is to reconcile reports every month from the Trust Associate. Management and co-workers are very pleasant. The hardest part of the job is the repetitive job functions. The exact same report on the exact same day of every month. Not easy to advance within the company. Most enjoyable part of the job is I like to make people laugh and bring humor (while being professional) to the office.
good,"The typical work day consisted of maintaining the accuracy of shareholders financial information certain tax forms.  This is done by submitting adjustments and correcting the shareholders tax information."
good,"I enjoyed my job for two specific reasons.  The people I worked with in my office and my clients throughout my time there.  Other than that, it wasn't worth it for what I was being paid.  There was no room for improvement in the company, nor any changes worth being made.  I worked there for 3 1/2 years and only received merit increases."

good,Supervise 30+ employees to ensure that the customers needs are met.
good,"I worked as a Tax Documentation Clerk, a temporary entry level position in Jan-March few years ago.  The department management just gives a high work load and very limited time to finish. My performance was compared against my colleagues who are just got our of college.  Very little training is given, basically you are on your own.  The management was not willing to invest in us because we are just temps.  A good place for those who just got out of college and want to put something on their resume. "
good,"Overall good company culture.  Working with other departments was an ease while working there, and the relationship with the vendors and service partners was always a pleasure"
good,"There is a large discrepancy between the message senior management conveys and the actions that middle management take.  Middle management does not relay the whole story for bad information upwards, painting a rosier picture than reality."
good,"Work from 10-7 or 12-9"
good,I worked for a major bank since 1998. It was a great career until I got laid off. I learned a large number of skills that I hope to use in another new career.  I have been in school and temping since.
good,"Working at the company is a good job. You get to work with a diverse group of people, be in a good work environment, and work on many unique projects."
good,BNY Mellon is a great starter company if you can live off of a very low salary while gaining experience.  The company has been hit hard recently with near 0 interest rates and poor performance all around.  They have addressed this problem by cut backs and layoffs without improving profit.  The co-workers are all easy to get along with and enjoyable to be around but for every 4 people there is probably only 1 or 2 people working hard. There are also some areas where team members are actively looking to take credit for any work produces by the group in order to advance their own careers although I think this is typical of every company.
good,"Overall experience was good, I got the employee of the year award in the year 2013 because of my ability and enthusiasm towards work."

good,"Fun place to work."
good,Stable work environment. Lay back culture and friendly management.
good,"Your work place is based on your coworkers. WHen you have coworkers that do not like where they work its hard to judge the culture. I like this company but because it is a big company and I started in a small position in a little town, it was difficult to move uo the corporate ladder."
good,"A large institution to work for.  A great group of people to work for, willing to share their knowledge and work towards the common goal of growing the business."
good,An evolving culture of flexibility. Diversity in the workforce suffered after the merger with Mellon Bank.
good,A typical day consisted of back to back meetings and too much time spent trying to get managers up to speed on current technologies and strategies. Somewhat dated project management process and tools . . . slow to adopt realistic short and long term planning.

good,learned a lot with the co.  Managemnt is helpful and knowledgeable of the comunity.
good,BNYMellon is a great place to work for some but certainly not all. Working at BNYMellon you have a good work/life balance but advancement is hard and HR policies cap raises on internal promotions and restrict people from jumping a pay grade. Often times people who move up internally get less compensation than outside hires. I think BNYMellon is a great place to work for someone who has a family and that are not 100% career driven.
good,"Great enviorment to work in, took care of clients accounts, small office."

good,"- Good work/life balance"
good,Good place for entry levels. too much focus on the Client but not the people servicing the Client which is stupid. high turnover due to poor compensation and lack of advancement opportinities.

good,"The job itself was great, however the management team was awful. The VP in charge of the department would come in, in a bad mood, and just go off on you for no good reason. There were a few women, who would regularly be in tears before lunch. And going to HR would only have made things worse, so we knew better than to go that route! But the job itself was great. I always loved the work I did, and even when he made me cry I enjoyed my work. "
good,Maintaining incoming and outgoing information for internal and external clients of the bank. Self supervising and light supervision of others.

It has since moved to another state and is starting to take it's toll on me fianancially (gas) and mentally as the ride went from 5 minutes to close to an hour ( on a good day)..My co-workers are great, learned alot about retirement accounts, but can be a little stressfull when you need to get a certain amount of work done but the system doesn't always cooperate"
good,Basic 9-5 hours. Learned a great deal out of college. Management can be better by receiving proper training. Co-workers are tolerable not awesome but good people to work with in general. Dealing with the low pay grade salary.

good,Learned about the alternative investment industry. The people were nice but over bearing and constantly mico managing

good,It was ok Job. I order pulled and made sure to documents that I pulled were the correct ones.
good,"Start work around 7pm processing loose checks that comes in from banks so they can be scanned and the client can get credit. There are three jobs that I would have to do: Final Proof with keying all pockets in the people soft system, doing all reports that need to be done before the morning, or Transmitting the files to our various customers that has been sent to us today. I work with a great team that helps get the work done. We are all cross trained so if one of us is out we are able to pick up the slack."

good,"My typical day at work includes completing client requests and transactions. It also includes researching and resolving client issues, which entails daily contact with clients and other areas of the organization. While working at BNY Mellon, I've learned to be flexible, and creative in problem solving. I've also been able to develop my ability to work within a team. Although I have not had any direct management roles, I've been involved in the training and development of new hires and made team leader of various projects and developmental efforts. The hardest part of my job has been dealing with the feeling of being stagnent. I've tried various ways of pursuing my goals, and have found that my current role has reached its peak and its time to look for growth externally. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with the clients on new opportunities and problem solving. I also enjoy working witin my team in facilitating team and origanizational goals."

good,"Enjoy the people I work with."
good,"Your experience will depend on the group/manger you work with. The dress code is very laid back and they do there best to organize employee events. It can be hard to move up in the company, but there are always opportunities to learn something new."
good,"It’s a good company with lots of products and services. The culture has been going through lots of shifts and it’s gone from a congenial one to being much more aggressive. Leadership does have a disconnect with clients in certain areas, but when push comes to shove, they sort it out and make things happen."
good,"If desired, there are many opportunities to advance and learn other areas of the bank.  Mellon supports continuous education and has many classes to foster growth and productivity."
good,"Lots of changes at this large bank. There are many moving parts and it is hard to stay updated. The bank is located in NYC, but also big in Pittsburgh"
good,Great atmosphere and it includes thorough training courses. The teams are knowledgeable of their positions. Management has the tendency to be inaccurate with their reports.
good,Many of the people working there are lifers so it's hard to move up when no one leaves. The salary is decent for the area but is severely underneath the industry average.
good,"BNY Mellon is a great place to start working. The environment is very low stress and the people are great. That being said, my job required mindless work in excel and there was not room for growth within the company. There's no incentive for employees to go beyond their job duties, it's a very mediocre workplace culture. I was fairly compensated and HR is the worst."
good,"People are worried about losing their jobs. Every year merit increases are flat or do not keep up with raise in healthcare premiums, inflation. Incentives are usually reduced each year."
good,"•	Prepare monthly and quarterly reporting for dissemination/presentation to upper management."
good,Objective and goal for the work are overstated and the average employee does not meet the criteria.  This need to be revisited when it comes to accuracy and meeting daily quota.
good,"I was a Vice President with over three years in the Company, always had good reviews, no performance issues.  To my surprise, I was laid off in the latest round of ""restructuring"" .   Beware of BNY, they will be nice to your face and cut your job in a heartbeat.   I did make a lot of friends there who I will miss....."
good,"It was a very good company to work for, benefits and salary were very competitive and people were very nice.  Changes in management seem to derail some projects."
good,"The organization is undergoing a culture shift under new management. However, changes probably take decades to materialize. Management are many unambitious old guys, some of whom don't care. With that being said, the work-life balance and time-off flexibility offered are awesome."
good,"Great starting point for your career, the company as a whole is very organised and training is excellent, salary isn't that good at all and moving outside of departments internally is a taboo particularly in the department Cash, saying that there are some great departments to work for. Generally Grads and school leavers go to for their first and second job."
good,"I worked in a stressful area while there. Training went well, but as I was fairly young when I worked here, and had little money experience at the time, I didn't handle the stress of the job very well. I ended up leaving due to the stress. If you can manage stress well, this job is for you! There's nothing wrong with it! If you don't do well with stress, like me, you may want to try a different career path."
good,"The days off and vacation is a huge plus for family purposes. Management is inconsistent through out different units of the organization. Compensation could be better for staff, especially for individuals that are loyal to the company."
good,"I don't have a good review for BNY Mellon therefore I will forgo any criticism of the bank. However, the hours were good and the commute was very good."
good,"Very nice company to begin your career with but very less room for growth, Very good when its come to salary. Good shift timings and cab facility is provided free of cost."
good,"The most enjoyable part of this job was the relationships established with peers and internal/external clients. Also, there was plenty of opportunity to enhance existing skills and gain new ones"
good,"Depending on the department the culture can be harsh and not as engaged.  Morale is some places is down and diverse talent hardly ever stays beyond the 2-3 years.  Promotion within grassroots and middle management is limited.  You do need to have a mentor and a sponsor within the company to move around if you want to move up. There are limited opportunities for administrative staff to move up in their career or even to switch careers.  Diversity of color in some offices is almost not there.  New CEO is making changes that can improve that, also culture."
good,BNY Mellon creates a superior work environment. A great place to work! The hardest part of the job is the lack of technology. This slows down the work flow.
good,There was much needed oversight that would monitor employees to see if they were properly performing their job functions. Some workers did more work than others. Not enough training in dealing with customer service.
good,"A typical day is relatively low stress, but there is a high level of importance put on high quality work and meeting reasonable deadlines.  It is a great place to learn new computer skills."
good,The previous position held was a rewarding experience. Worked in a friendly environment with minimal supervisory and management intervention. Very helpful team environment.
good,"I took the contract role as an operations specialist and found it to be very dull on a day to day basis with not much learning and growth. The people that I worked with directly were very nice, but the company as a whole seems unorganized and distant. I wouldn't not recommend the company, but it also wouldn't be a company I would ever recommend as well."
good,"Empresa agradável de se trabalhar, principalmente no escritório de SP"
good,"BNYM is a good place to work although they do not value the talent that works there.  They are keenly aware that they have a problem retaining their top talent but refuse to promote or if they do promote they do it with little to no compensation increases.  We are consistently being told we pay for performance but the budget does not reflect this.  At time of review process are told we are not allowed to force rank people into categories, but then we are told we cant deviate from a certain percentage for each category.  Go figure."
good,"The work place and people were good, the job just had lack of training and the building was older and not updated. there was no kitchen area to store food or anything. no free coffee and the bathrooms were awful."
good,"Very under staffed, and the workload was entirely too heavy.   The co-workers were the most enjoyable part of my day.  The management style was not consistent, and getting sick or missing work was out of the question for any reason."
good,"For typical project which almost involved a lot of different applications and a lot of people in different time zone, especial offshore resource, could not put everybody in same boat on timing schedule. Different opinion between business side and technology side caused late on the schedule."
good,Relaxed atmosphere but low compensation.There was also a lot of down sizing.Management was good. There was not a lot of micromanagement. You work day was limited to eight hours.
good,"BNY was a fast paced place of employment.  Management was ok when I was there, but after my contract ended, things changed,  I still keep in touch with fellow employees and understand hours and procedures changed (not necessarily to the good) and quite o few employees had left."
good,Good company to start with. Nice work culture and good team to learn from. Very well and talented team member who gives more insight into the company and the process and work. Good to be part of various activities held in the company.
good,BNY Mellon is good starting point if you are interested in the Transfer Agency business. There is a lot of potential growth within the various lines of business offered at BNY.
good,Good company with growing in all directions. I am currently work in the company. Benefits are not that great and annual increments basically nothing. Different location in US have different salary level the range wide.
good,same old same old each year.  no job advancement at the company.  there is no movement internally.  Managers have been in the same position forever which hurts advancement.
good,"A typical day at work involves me interacting with both upper management and junior fund accountants in order to communicate pertinent information needed for the current day's valuation. I spend a lot of time training and aiding the accountants that report to me in order to hasten their progress towards more independence as it pertains to delivering the NAV in a timely manner. Management is good and easy to talk to; for the most part they communicate the information well and are quick to help on any issues that I may be struggling with. The workplace culture is very laid back which made my initial position an easier transition from college, but it was helpful to teach you what you need to do to be successful in business. Hardest part of the job is when we run into unforeseen errors and are under pressure to deliver completed valuations quickly. Also at times the job grows monotonous which can be hard. The most enjoyable part is my interactions with fellow employees."
good,Was not in love with the job or the culture but it is not a bad place to start. High turnover. Moved most jobs out of the main office in Boston. Overall average.
good,"Can be stressful"
good,"Friendly people, with good work life balance. Fairly flexible with working. "
good,"Great group of people, very team oriented and bright within Fixed Income. However, there is not a lot of growth currently at BNY, which makes it difficult to motivate team members."
good,Great place to work but poor hours low pay the temps were payed only 13 per hour and only given 20 or less hours . There were no parking for employees and the train service was unreliable.
good,"For the right candidate, there are a lot of opportunities for advancement but some internal employees do get lost in the shuffle"
good,"In the time that I worked in the Investor Services Group, I found that management was fair and that staff was generally treated well."
good,Very professional company with focused goals on each team members work.  A quiet but disciplined office.  Friendly staff and workplace.
good,It was a good experience and a fun workplace to work. They also provide fun perks as well to ensure that their employees don't get bored.
good,"anything can happen.   Each day brought new challenges.  Management support (for the most part) did exist.  The company has been sold since I worked there, so I cannot speak to the atmosphere now."
good,"Large organisation, so lots of opportunities to try new roles in different areas. High turnover of staff and slow recruitment process. Salaries and performance related bonus are low within Operations and as a result, it's difficult to retain high performers. Work needs to be done on employee engagement around salaries, long working hours and flexibility."
good,I havr been working here since 2014 and since then company's work culture changed alot. In compare to others players in the same industry you will find BNY is more comfortable to work with.
good,BNY is a very large company. The groups  vary greatly in management goals and style. Each individual's mileage may vary. I have met some very amazing people in my time at BNY and am thankful for all i have learned in my time there.
good,"This firm afforded me the opportunity to fully utilize my financial degree which made me the well-rounded professional I am today.  I gained analytical experience, managerial experience, client management experience, and both internal and external compliance/regulatory experience."
good,"Good company that mostly offers lateral growth, good benefits, and compensation. The management is not the best that might stagnate growth of deserving employees."
good,"Worked in busy work environment, various daily tasks. made travel arrangements, managed and reconciled expense reports, ordered and maintained office supplies, submitted system access to programs and various applications, managed meetings, calendars, schedules."
good,"Did enjoy my peers, but too many changes within the dept that made it take long to get hired on permanent, hard to change depts too"
good,"Good place to work but pay is lower than industry standard. . There is also excellent exposure to senior leaders and executives. Good work-life balance / integration."
good,Great culture with many incentives. Management is great and great people to work with. Pay is low but there is many benefits offered.
good,"Handle all supply orders, audit requests, ITportal requests and update procedures when necessary. Review daily ASP/GSP reports, remedy any issues with account segregation, GAO Form, CASS SME"
good,"Good place for mature and experienced professionals. "
good,"BNY Mellon is a good place to begin your career but career advancement is extremely difficult.  Although I have learned a lot about Wealth Management, BNY Mellon does not invest in their employees with training programs, thus making it hard to become specialized in a particular area.  "
good,I've learned a great deal working here over the last five years. There is an abundance of knowledgable professionals and resources here.
good,Work days are longer during peak periods. Management could be better. Okay company overall. The people that work there are great. The company should invest more in their employees when it comes to training. The pay could be better.
good,"Check cash and share postion of funds vs Cusoty position"
good,BNY Mellon was a good company to work for. Most of my colleagues were great people and I have built relationships that will go on outside of work. Working at BNY I've learned about investing and the different retirement accounts that are offered out there. My management team was wonderful and encouraged individualism as well as teamwork. The hardest part of the job was the constant updates to mutual fund companies and that was something that was always being updated and you really had to keep up with the new policy that they were rolling out. The most enjoyable part of the job was the balance that was given for work/personal life.
good,"The politics and red tape were typical of a large corporation, but the recent cost-cutting above all else mentality has really dampened moral in many of the offices. It is a safe place to work, but would like to see more internal growth opportunities. An overall bottom line growth atmosphere would do well to benefit the moral instead of squeezing the existing resources. That being said, the company is very good at what it does and has the asset servicing/custody business down to a science."
good,You are basically your own CEO of your career as management tends to be very hands off. People are very nice to work with but very competitive and focused
good,"This is a good place to gain some solid work experience for a young person entering the workforce.  Gain experience and take advantage of opportunities, then move on from the company.  Growth is promoted here, but not well compensated for it."
good,"My first few years at Mellon Financial were some of the best I've had.  The work environment was transparent, management was accessible, and the work for innovative and interesting.  My final two years at BNY Mellon were poor and got worse by the day.  The CEO was slowly chipping away at benefits, morale, and any type of job security employees may have had.  The stock price was not only important (as it should be), but it became the ONLY thing that mattered.  Benefits were decreased to a point where we are no longer market competitive.  Management became very secretive.  It was truly a hostile work environment."
good,great place to learn about the corporate world and gain skills. People are friendly and willing to help. Can easily move up if you work hard and show that you want to be there for the long haul
good,A banking company trending to transform their persona into a technology company.  Many great products but many different leaders have different goals and vision.
good,"Productive workplace with nice multicultural environment. Compensation and the level of bureaucracy could improve, but the work/life balance is good."
good,"Interesting place to work for. "
good,"Worked with management on a day to day basis which involved office moves, on-boarding of new employees and emergency action plans."
good,My typical day at work is a fun loving environment. The team I manage supports me and also are good team players. Having a supporting team to work make the workplace a stress free place.
good,"We can learn lot of thinks at here, job security is very good. But intersection with management is very less.Hr department is never help full to associates."
good,"It's a nice place to work."
good,"I have learned so many good qualities in this organisation."
good,Not a bad company to work for. Its a lot of to work BNY if you looking to while away your precious life. Its very diversify. The training sucks though. They have a good company structure and its all depends if you have a good supervisor and a Manager.
good,Overall the company isn't bad to work for. I feel as though for the workload that I have and the amount of responsibility it doesn't pay for it.

good,"This job was very enjoyable to me due to the type of people that worked there..  There was a lot of diversity and knowledgeable people that worked at the bank.  It was a pleasure to work there."
good,"Regular 9-6 work hours. Daily fund accounting and administrative duties servicing mutual funds. Job description includes but is not limited to fund setup, conversions, accounting, tax servicing, financial reporting, client services, system analysis and support to other departments."
good,"A typical day consists of processing large wire transfers, delivering shares to brokers, reconciling interest and dividends, processing futures and derivatives, and daily naving of a pooled account. My co-workers have become close friends and I've never worked for such an amazing supervisor before."
good,"Review work done by accountants used to determine the net asset value of partnership hedge, equity and international mutual funds while insuring compliance with department requirements.  "
good,Usually arrived at 8 AM and left whenever the day was complete. Interaction with FX Traders and Salespeople was challenging but enjoyable. Co-workers were great. Everyone worked together to get the job done.
good,"It's very good compay , work place and environment is also good, all my team member are very supportive and co-operative. there is nothing hardest part of the job i am able to learn and do it my best."
good,"Enjoyed working with the Special Industries Group. Pleasant environment, working with a great group."
good,"A typical day required managing a group of client-facing employees that processed retirement plan distributions; it was fast-paced with multiple daily deadlines."

good,Service on the daily bases 3+ multi-asset class Closed-End Funds valued at over $3.5 billion.
good,"Flexible hours in a productive work day."
good,I learned complex stock equity and foreign bond funds. The management was great in teaching and reaching out for help.
good,"The best part about BNY Mellon were the people, and the work/life balance.  Pretty much a decent 9-5 workplace.  The pay isn't great, but it's not bad.  No financial incentives to do much more than your job."
good,"A typical day was pricing over 40 funds and verifying all check have been made on income and principal portions as far as cash and share positions. Responsible for divided checks and corporate actions that went ex on securities held in funds. "
good,"The workplace culture was sad and you sat in cubes where everybody was nosing around. Great benefits. Not much room for advancement, however, if you play the political game correctly then you are most likely to get advanced, promoted, get a bonus."
good,"Learned many things such as Process Knowledge. How the Team works and what they actually do ? Management was good and Open for all for discussions and Issues if any. Co - workers were helpful and understanding in nature and highly professional as well. I didn't found any hardest part in the job and the most enjoyable moment or the part was fun at work place and activities, games etc."
good,I enjoy working with my co-workers at BNY Mellon. Since I work in the operations side my day consist of ensuring our group meets its weekly deadlines.
good,"BNY Mellon before the merger, was BNY. Founded by Alexander Hamilton in 1784 was a secure and great place to work. After the merger it all changed. Loss of jobs and workload switched to India. Still it was a good place to work with excellent benefits. The Present of BNY sold all of down the river, job his money and ran. Unfortunate."
good,"My day starts with an overview of what was handled overnight by our offshore staff, and what is left pending. I then go into checking the application logs to make sure all is well, proceeding into a health check of the system."
good,"I had numerous short turn/ low budget challenges brought to me on a daily basis, to which I always stepped up with as much creativity as possible for a given project. Multi-tasking and quick and efficient decision making was a must here. As multiple levels of writers/management were added or got involved in the process above me, they restricted my creative freedom a bit and had their own directions I was to follow, but I was able to still make sure that a quality product was the final product even with huge technical and budgetary challenges. So I learned how to make a lot happen with limited resources. Had to remain flexible due to changing management structure and priorities."
good,Salaries are below the average in the industry. Management is very unorganized. Overall very dissatisfied with the company as a whole.
good,Started working at BNY right out of college. Good starting place. 
good,"I would start my work day off by reading through my emails and providing our client with ad hoc reports or requests. I was responsible for checking the team's cash and asset reports, as well as sending the reports to the client by the given SLA deadlines. This job allowed me to be a part of a team, but to also work independently on projects to showcase my own skill set. The hardest part of the job was making sure that everyone on the team had and equal amount of work and that were satisfied with the position they held, so that they could be productive in our work environment. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with people of all ages to learn from the experienced and be creative and as excited as the people in the entry level positions."
good,Not a bad environment to work in but they do not pay well and value their employees. Overall its ok but not the end all career I would like to have.
good,good to work
good,I've learned how to reconcile mutual funds. My managers and co-workers are nice and respectful. I like that I have little supervision and am able to work at my own pace.
good,"The environment here is typical for a banking company. We do not always get great perks as far as bonuses and high salaries; however, the company is good with vacation time given to employees. I was initially hired with Mellon Corporation, and then it merged with Bank of New York. Since this merger, there have been many changes- good and bad- but the changes have made the same position feel like I have held different positions within the company. There are constant changes and new procedures and policies and this aspect is the hardest part of the job- always trying to stay on top of the changes."
good,"A typical day at work is very constant, fairly easy and overall a stress free environment. I manage 40-50 closed end funds and handle my client's day to day activities. I learned in the business world, you have to worry about yourself. The reason why I'm still at my company is that I'm very committed and loyal to my group. My co-workers are great and fun to be around. That's probably the most enjoyable part of the job. I'm consistently thriving for my group to succeed and it feels good when the I accomplish that goal. I just feel very uncompensated and it's hard to keep that motivation working at BNY Mellon."
good,"Good colleagues, decent benefits and opportunities to learn."
good,"Working at this company some days can be very draining, Its a very busy place and not enough people to handle the work load. Their benefits package is better than most companies."
good,"Start around 7pm processing loose checks so they can be scanned and the clients can get credit for them. I have three job functions that I could possibly do: Final Proof along with keying the work in People soft, doing all reports that need to be done before the morning, or Transmitting all files back to the client that were reconciled for the day."
good,"You clock in and clock out. Very easy work, they constantly ask you to work overtime. Benefits were great. compensation wasnt that good, never wanted to give out raises or bonuses. management did alot of micromanage so it was a stressful job enviroment ."
good,The work environment is positive. with potential to advance if you are willing to relocate
good,"There are hundreds of internal and external customer transmissions we monitor daily, and customer support is provided via our hotline. A new website has been created, and we are in the process of converting thousands of users from 2 previous platforms onto our new site. The mornings are busy. We must confirm transmissions are successful, and if not alert the proper area that an issue has been discovered. Follow-up is required until the problem is resolved. I have improved my multi-tasking skills beyond what I expected. When issues arise we must be quick and precise while also manning the phones to support customers. Management and co-workers are team focused. We support our customers and each other every day. The thing I most enjoy is the technical experience I will take with me as I grow in my career."
good,"I was able to excel due to a great manager, but after the merger with Mellon Bank, changes began to take place. Downsizing and consolidation caused me to lose my position."
good,"I suppose I should begin with positives. Well, it's fairly easy to get a job at BNY. Now, if you have applied and haven't been selected do think that you're not good enough... it may well be the exact opposite. People are usually fairly nice, but not ambitious or striving to get things done right, quick and effectively. I suppose it stems from the upper management that think that they have nothing to do with the 'monkeys' and it's not their concern to motivate or develop personnel."
good,There are a number of long-time staff that have a lot of good experience.  Sadly the company appears to want to get rid of all of that experience.  They would rather send the work overseas instead.
good,"This place wasn’t the worst place to work, but it did have its challenges with its management and  a lot of turnover as well with its employees.  It was overall a good working experience though"
good,"Good place to work with flexibility and benefits. Great for college students for internships and graduates, learning and developing skills. Networking is key."
good,Mid-level employees are not treated as an important part of the company. I felt like a cog in the wheel. Departments are very siloed and technology is not great.
good,"Only worked there few months as a contractor Security officer, i've had a decent experience working there. Was a friendly enviorment and nice people to associate with time to time."
good,Salary way below industry standard and health insurance was poor. Lots of room for advancement as people kept leaving to go elsewhere to get paid more
good,"Low chance of advancement, lower level management cares a great deal about workers, upper level management not so much. Great work-life balance. Nature of work is easy."
good,"It's ok to work here.                         "
good,The best part about working here is the ability to work somewhat flexible hours and work remotely when life events require it.  The pay is fairly good as well.
good,BNY Mellon is a great company with a broad array of products and services that provides ample opportunities for learning and professional development.
good,Good bosses from what I observed.  Team-oriented approach.  Hit or miss with supervisors.  Mostly knowledgeable.  Long hours can lead to friction during those periods.  Overall solid organization.  Mostly back office.
good,"I was lucky to have the opportunity to work with various mangers over the years that supported me and provided me with growth opportunities.  In my career, my hard work was rewarded."
good,"Very stable company to work for. That could be boring for some. Not stopped for taking efforts to try new things at the same time no real push and support to innovate. Mostly because folks are pulled into doing too much multitasking."
good,I can describe me work within ADR division which is a part of BNY Mellon. International environment within the division as Relationship Managers represent different countries and speak native languages. Clients visits take place once a year. Interesting work.
good,In the beginning the job was great. They started making a ton of changes as the years went on. I felt there was very little communication between managements and the different teams you work with. I felt the direct managers did not listen to their employees very well when discussing ways to improve processes.
good,"It's just my starting days and i like the it so far.It's just my starting days "
good,"I wish I did not leave the company. "
good,"très bonne entreprise pour une 1ere experience, j'ai apprécié."
good,"It was ok, could be better. I think this is highly dependent on which department and office you work in so I am not sure if I can give a review of such a large company."
good,"Great company, but constant risk of layoffs adds a-lot of unnecessary pressure. Do not feel noticed or appreciated for the work I do. Management has been and open in regards of communication, but there is only so much they can do."
good,"Office environment was good with nice co-workers"
good,"Fitch is committed to providing global securities markets with objective, timely, independent and forward-looking credit opinions. To protect Fitch’s credibility and reputation, our employees must take every precaution to avoid conflicts of interests or any appearance of a conflict of interest. Should you be successful in the recruitment process at Fitch Ratings you will asked to declare any securities holdings and other potential conflicts prior to commencing employment. If you, or your immediate family, have any holdings that may conflict with your work responsibilities, you may be asked to divest yourself of them before beginning work."
good,just came in did our job. production work backups. printing meeting deadlines mounting tapes proofing out dollar amount coming inand out of the bank per day
good,"My most enjoyable part of my job was that I was able to learn new things and skills from other departments. If there was no work to do in my department, I was able to go to another and shadow a co-worker in that department. I have learned that I am much more versatile than I thought I was and open to learn new things that I would have generally thought of as intimidating to me at first."
good,Management is very accomodating with work-life balance. Limited advancement opportunities. Hard workers get brunt of work. Problems retaining highly motivated and ambitions people.
good,Very Fast Paced. Gave everyone equal opportunity for advancement. Very competitive wages compared to other customer service positions. Great benefits for everyone.
good,"The middle management overall does a good job."
good,"The typical work day was not excessive and work environment was flexible with the ability to work offsite when needed."
good,good place to kick start your career with. It gives a competitive environment to work under & helps to grow progressively. It gives sound benefits to its employees.
good,Working at this job helped me understand the insurances ins and outs of the business. Mainly worked on Flexible Spending Accounts. The company was a great company.
good,"BNY Mellon has been laying employees off since they bought our part of the company in 2010. I can't recommend anybody work there because of the lay-off pattern. Benefits were great, pay was decent, and I totally enjoyed my job while I was there. Wonderful people."
good,"- Ran operations teams and supported client relationships.  Main point of escalation and well as supported discussions with new prospective clients"
good,Must be able to multi task and be able to meet productivity standards. Depending on the department it can be a fun place to work. It all depends on the management teams.
good,"Overall BNY Mellon was a good place to work. The environment was fast paced and the work was ever changing. There was a very good work life balance and flexibility in hours when needed. "
good,Nice people. No the top tier of talent in this department.  No real point to staying long as you can dream of becoming a supervisor for the same salary.
good,"I have totally ten plus year experiences in accounting area, which is inclusive of core accounting, Internal Auditing and general ledger, Fixed assets areas."
good,"BNY Mellon's current work environment does not accomodate those who strive for career advancement.  However, their compensation (work from home, casul dress, etc...) and benefits are well offered."
good,"Productive and comfortable work environment, along with the ability to set own flexible hours and schedule. Direct superiors and management always readily available and easy to contact."
good,A typical day at work is reconciling and then trading sporadically throughout the day.  Since I am higher up I have to reconcile all of our dividends within the full department.
good,"Very diverse company, work environment is a little to thick. Some areas are better then some.Working with other employees on different levels were great."
good,Salaries and pay increases do not keep up with cost of living. Relaxed environment and are making strides to be able to work from home on a daily basis. Depending on position and location it can be a laid back but get work done environment.
good,OK   The atmosphere was cordial and there wer many folks there a long time. More conserative than other international banks and the work hours seemed better than most
good,"We were in a massive room, stuck in cubicles. Our work flow came in over a shared program and there was very little interaction and opportunities to advance in the area in which I was in."
good,"The culture is really awesome. I honestly love the management, my only issue with BNY is the pay. They can pay employees more than what they currently do."
good,"Good place to start career. Very diverse and culture driven. Compensation is at industry standard. Solid benefits, training, work life balance, and organizational support."
good,Pay is average. Teams are fun. Bonuses are a joke. It's all about numbers here. Hard work is not always noticed and often slips through the cracks. Been here 3 years and have never been given a raise or bonus despite crushing the output of other team members.
good,BNY mellon is a company of really nice people. They aare great at work life balance but they struggle to understand how to really make money. That is why they struggle to pay people.
good,It's a good place to start and learn. Not a lot of career development. It's hard to change people's ideas and take creative projects.
good,"I have join in Nov 2008., work environment and they managing the people was very good. I worked their account payable and Security Data Management Department, deadlines work was there and this was the one of the critical part."
good,"The company was going through a cost-cutting measures that have taken 5 years to implement, and now they are in the process of grow the business."
good,"BNY Mellon is a very large company with plenty of different opportunities. For that reason, I believe it is a great place to start with directly out of college. "
good,BNY Mellon historically has been a good company to work for but is currently in transition due to multiple mergers and acquisitions.  Excellent benefit and compensation packages.  Little job security and employee loyalty.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers.  Had a very diversified group who worked well together."
good,Be careful to follow procedure and cover your butt.  Blame can be passed quickly when a mistake occurs.  Work life balance here is awesome and they are extremely accommodating as long as you put forth some effort as well.
good,The supervisor is a patient and calm person. I have learned a lot since I started to work here. It is good experience to work with Complex Accounting Group.
good,"Oracle Dba daily jobs ."
good,"I enjoy my job and the team that I work with, however I cannot support my family on the income that I make. The raises are scarce and even when you get one, they are a joke. There aren't many opportunities of advancement into a position that pays more either."
good,"Financial product development,"
good,"Working at Bank of New York Mellon provides you with stability and less strenuous work environment than you would typically find in the financial field. The co-workers are friendly and helpful in many situations. However, in my experience, there is little to no communication from management when it comes to areas of development or career growth. BNY Mellon provides knowledge through many areas of the financial industry. Including Mutual Fund knowledge and knowledge of many key systems that are used throughout the financial world. I would recommend BNY Mellon if you are looking to have a good balance between ""home life"" and ""work life""."
good,"management styles and policies can vary wildly across departments. The company does seem to care about employees- retirement plan and alternative work schedules are great benefits.  company offers casual dress code in most areas that aren't client facing every day.  But other benefits are lacking and compensation is on the conservative side, depending on the location."
good,Over all BNY Mellon is a great company to work for - there are a lot of opportunities for growth with in the corporation itself - local location is having some growing pains while learning to incorporate all the opportunities available within the large multi company umbrella that is BNY  Mellon.
good,"This place is fast paced, a lot to do and learn and a lot of opportunities for over time.  I had the opportunity to do different projects, get my foot in the door for a more advance job placement in the banking area and administrative working area."
good,Great introduction into the banking and collateral debt obligations market workplace. Exciting coworkers but management needs training in some department. Hardest part of the job is having a supervisor that is lazy and inattentive but extremely demanding.
good,"Responsible for the oversight and coordination of daily and monthly operations for an accounting group including client deliverables.  These funds include single manager, multi-strategy, master-feeder and bank debt structures."
good,My typical day was non-stop. Business reps and management constantly requesting my assistance on different projects. I learned a lot from this job as far as structured finance is concerned.
good,"VERY MUCH interested in relocation within the US OR a position in (ONLY)midtown Manhattan.....I've been in the financial business 20 years, working with some great companies and people. I'm always willing to listen about a position that helps me grow as a team member. I look for a position with a company that recognizes a candidate's industry knowledge, good communication skills and teamwork."
good,"A very rewarding place to work. Met a lot of very nice people, always willing to help out."
good,A typical day at work is always something new due to a myriad of clients. Always keeping busy and continually learning due to the changes of the IRS.
good,"flexible work schedule, easy to get along with management and co workers."
good,Good to get your feet wet in a corporate atmosphere.  It will show you the in's and out's of corporate banking.  Very nice people and great benefits.  Management is constantly changing and it creates an atmosphere of confusion and changing policies.  You must be able to adapt quickly to a workplace that is constantly changing.
good,"It's a great company for work/life balance. I have been there for a few years and had many wonderful experiences there. I have had great trainings as well. The opportunity for advancement lacks, but that could change given the economy."
good,"There isn't that much morale at BNY Mellon. The culture is one that has everyone for themselves rather than a team. You really have to research and ask around in order to find information about other departments. People are very knowledgeable at what they do, and everyone is very willing to help and teach you what they know."
good,"If you like a change from the ordinary BNYMellon is for you. I worked for them servicing a well known mutual fund client. Each day had it's own unique challenges from deciphering client requests, late mail drops and a very brutal New England winter causing delays and power outages. Management could be better as there was a serious communication issue as well as less than professional attitude directed to the workers. Fortunately this was not always the case. "
good,The work culture is very old fashioned. A good place for young people to get their feet wet. Not a good place to stay and grow. Culture is for older  more seasoned individuals.
good,"My job had a very steep learning curve, everyone in the office was helpful and management was particularly concerned with overall well being and functionality of the office. Great managers to work with, always there to help. Job opportunities within both department and company are readily available, and BNY loves to promote internally. Compensation is the biggest caveat, very low considering comparable real world salary for similar positions, i.e fidelity, goldman, US bank."
good,Very large organization with many layers.  Great colleagues.
good,"was nice work environment , excellent management, nice to have experience with them."
good,"Typical day consists of the daily accounting duties. Staff and management work together to deliver accurate NAV's . Coworkers are helpful. Work can get challenging when those co workers call out or are on vacation. Double the work. But at the end of any day, great people and good times."
good,Work at BONYM was free of stress.  There were no late nights.  Managers were responsive.  There is job security.
good,"While working at Bank of America I was able to learn the many different aspects associated with Full Service Sub-Accounting.  I was able to learn the Corporate Actions functions within the Sub-Accounting group."
good,good place to enhance the knowledge as process wise & the core business level. people can gain more knowledge on securities & how capital market works.
good,"Got to learn many technical things in accordance to the banking domain , got a huge banking domain knowledge"
good,Answering inbound calls from brokers and providing information on mutual funds accounts. the hardest part of the job is to keep up with the updates and procedures that change very often. 
good,The company is turning the corner by producing innovative solutions for their clients.
good,Day involved receiving and delivering trades for brokers. Learned how to balance all the trades that were settled for the day. Co Workers and Management very easy to get along with
good,Good organization. Large and diversified. Tends to be highly structured.
good,"This is a great company to work for. Hours are decent, management is excellent (obviously some exceptions in each department). However, the senior management makes it very difficult for anyone to get a raise or promotion."
good,Company is good to work for but lack of management is hard to find.
good,Ability to learn new things and excel in industry standard fields. Did not always feel valued for my work. Did not feel that management cared to help me advance my career.
good,The job was ok but wished they offered more on advancement and on pay. They also wished it was a full 40 hrs instead of 37.5. And also their benefits could be better
good,I loved working for BNY Mellon. The only problem i had was that some departments Do NOT hire from with in. They will cut a department that does most of the work only to move it to a different state and with in a few years they move the work back (to where they took if from)& have to hire all new people. They will tell you that jobs are opening up but that does not matter if they are not hiring from with in.
good,"Worked there most of my career, would recommend as a starting point but not a forever company. For most higher level jobs they like to hire externally versus advancing their own people."
good,"I definitely enjoy the job but about 75% of the work is now being transferred to India.  Lots of layoffs and no job security.  I have learned lots of accounting practices I did not work with in the past, but again. layoff may be in the future"
good,BNYM has provided opportunities to several individuals and developed the overall skill set. Senior management team is extremely supportive towards the teams working here is Pune.
good,Managment was fair and gave timely raises....job culture is fast paced.....operations department had me learning alot about the banking industry.....good job environment
good,BNY Mellon is a great company to work for with very great benefits. I have been lucky enough to work with a really great team of amazing people. Some of the management could be improved in my opinion.
good,"I have learned a great deal during my time at the Bank of New York Mellon. The hardest part of the job for me is the heavy and stressful workload at the beginning of each month. I am able to handle it very well, but was very overwhelmed my first time around. My favorite part of the job is how flexible they are with the hours."
good,"Nice place, low paid. We do things a little differently at BNY Mellon Wealth Management. Here, we have a commitment to serving clients, not selling products–a client-first approach that has led to industry-leading client satisfaction rates"
good,It has been some time since I've worked at BNY.  The culture may very well be different now.  I was not impressed with the infrastructure and technology at that time.
good,"Workplace culture is good. "
good,"I have learned so many things within a group of smart people always around me."
good,I am an administrative assistant in the HR department. I took the role thinking it would help me advance to an associate role in HR but they are very set on having admins as admins unless they have their master's degree. There are not many associate level positions available in HR to advance into. It all depends on what kind of manager you have (some will take you places and others will not).
good,"BNY mellon is a great company. They are a leader in the financial industry and I learned a lot about corporate trust while I worked there. Its a lot of information to learn, but the staff are willing to assist,"
good,My review is short and sweet. When PNC owned the company it was a great place to work. Once BNY Mellon bought the company from PNC it went downhill in a hurry. Old technology. Changed the accountants position down to the next level but at the top of that position's pay scale. Pay raises became minimal. Promotions from within became all but impossible.
good,This job allowed me to be a part of there software conversion team. Therefore no training offered. I learned by trial and error. I paid for my own SQL course which helped. I am passionate about data management and always willing to learn new ways to mainstream.
good,"Decent benefits. Even the family pet had insurance, the time I worked there. "
good,"BNY Mellon is an old bank, like most old banks it has old relationships, who are very wealthy clients. But the employees all seem like they are very cool down to earth people. very fun bunch to work with."
good,"8 ωρες τηλεφωνικη συνομιλια με πελατες για συγκέντρωση οφειλών και προτάσεις για ρυθμίσεις"
good,"I've been fortunate to have a boss that values work/life balance and is extremely flexible about personal commitments. That is not the case for other teams. It very much depends who you work for if you're looking for a good balance and advancement in your career."
good,"Good place to work in terms of a work life balance but very underpaid with very little compensation increase regardless of how hard you work.  "
good,"Kept very busy, A lot of work but I liked it that way. The employees were kind but the office politics and the review process needed improvement."
good,I like the people at this job and the fact that you never have to look for work you are always busy. I don't like the different hours or shifts that they have. I thought I would like working overnight but my body says something totally different. I'm having a hard time adjusting to the night shift.
good,Good team environment. Fast paced interactive functions. Enjoy both my manager and my coworkers. Multi-tasking and consistent change.
good,"Great coworkers. Relaxed, friendly environment compared to other financial companies. Smaller company with pretty good perks and benefits. Women leaders and lots of diversity. We have good leaders and smart people. Great place to learn the business."
good,"Enjoyed the ""laissez-faire"" management style, which made everyone more productive and efficient."
good,"Working on Share owner service system has lot to cherish about with more opportunities to learn about how the trading happens. To be specific, I worked more on Tax related process which creates the 1099 forms for all the shareholders. In 2011, the new Cost Basis rules were applied to stay in compliance with IRS regulations. The team cooperation will be great and each one will support there team members as and when required. Tax season will be the critical period where we need to handle all the 1099 forms get created and Tape files are sent to IRS."
good,"A good place to work, friendly people, stable environment."
good,A typical day at work
good,Very good work culture.
good,This company is a great entry into the professional world coming out of school as an undergrad. The management staff is very positive and always willing to mentor and guide you to reach your professional goals.
good,"bonymellon is good place to start career, if you want to gain experience and knowledge of financial market mainly capital market.Good company for starters."
good,I enjoy working with the people I do but I do not feel supported enough to advance or given the right tools to advance in the company.
good,"I started at BNY Mellon part time mother's hours in 1991 and through the years advanced into management with the title Supervisor of Asset Account Services. We had a wonderful staff, hard working, good people, that worked well together. We had an excellent cross training program implemented, and the work day usually went smoothly. In operations we were very dependent on check processing delivering our work in a timely manner, prior to image. If there was a delay, we would always complete the work, no matter what. If there were system problems, we would stay through the night to get the work completed. We were a very dedicated team and strived for excellence on a daily basis. The hardest part of working in banking operations is that we were considered essential personel, snow storms, floods, any disasters, we were expected to work, yet, the payscale did not reflect that. The best part of my job was the people that I worked with, we became like family. Many people in my division had been with BNY Mellon for over 20 years, they were a great group. I thought I would retire from BNY Mellon, but plans changed, and I believe I have quite a few years left to take on a new challenge in a new career."
good,BNY Mellon is the largest custody bank on the planet.  Great place to gain experience in many different business lines.  Takes a while to get things done and for changes to be made given the multiple layers of bureaucracy.
good,This place is very inviting and comfortable.  It can get hectic at times like any other job but it's a great place to work and grow if Lockbox is your thing. I've learned how operate scanners which has been promising in my career by doing so.
good,"Good company to work for. They are improving the Technology which is great for IT folks. Very fast pace and busy environment, If you thrive under  this environment you will love your job."
good,You learn new things almost everyday. The training in on-going. The environment is relaxed but does get fast paced at times. The upper management however need to pay more attention to junior team members and pay grades/bonus structure to employees motivated.
good,"BNY Mellon is a place where you need to be flexible and ready to adapt to changes when necessary. The company offers great work life balance.  If you are a hard worker that is willing to go above and behind your position, you will advance in the company."
good,I consulted  for over two years add bank of New York Mellon and it was a great place to work you felt like you were part of the family from day one.  At the time they weren’t offering any full-time positions however if that was different I definitely would’ve stayed.
good,Needs a technology update. Going through a management transitional period.Good starting place for young people straight from University. Overall a good place to work.
good,It's a decent place to work but no one is going to help you advance even when you're vocal that you need more responsibility more to do. Decent pay but your hard work is rarely recognized.
good,There were many different departments here.  You could easily move from one to another.  The management was great.  The management was supportive.  Training was provided.  I began with an entry level position and soon promoted through the company
good,"Salary is ok but work environment is good specially for girls."
good,My original hiring was for an interesting on-line money transfer system development.  The work was interrupted/canceled due to the merger with Irving Trust.
good,"Upper Management needs to improve and understand the job before forcing changes that do not improve efficiency."
good,I love working there and enjoy the work. The salary is very low and they outsourcing to other countries. Very worried about stock price and not employees.
good,"I enjoy the work itself.  The staff is amazing.  The hardest part of the job is that you must account for every minute of the day on a computer system.  You must ask for the time you need to correct your mistakes, and when you get the time, it is rarely enough.  Way too strict with time management and it causes more mistakes by staff and less than top performance."
good,"Mellon Financial was a great place to work for. It was my first job out of Boston College, and I was very aggressive in doing my duties. I was promoted very quickly due to my aptitude, and I want to be employed in business where promotions and careers are earned by employees that show excellence."
good,very flexible work schedule. good for fresh graduate.  pay is not much but excellent benefits. job security is great. management and overall job culture is very good. good people to work with. big organizational and no close supervision
good,"I like the culture. People are friendly and helpful. The job is repetitive so it gets boring. The most enjoyable part is the co workers. I learn time management and meting deadlines. Day to day we do transfers, checks, wires, etc."
good,"I started at BNYMellon as a P&I clerk and with hard work and determination I worked my way up to the Department Head in charge of the physical vault area, Dealers Clearance and Reconciliation departments.  If One Wall St had not been put on the market to be sold, I would still be there trying to grow and learn every day.  All in all, the managers at BNYM always put the employees first and gave many opportunities to a lot of people."
good,Working with management that are very helpful and caring. There room to grow
good,"I worked for this company briefly. I started as a contractor but they quickly made me a full-time employee. The pay was very low so I had to look for another job. I really liked what I did but I couldn't live with the low pay, literally."
good,I have learn a lot about  different types of financial instruments and how they work.
good,Good place to work if you are looking for a solid work life balance.
good,"Good exposure to investment products, Became repetitive after a while"
good,"I worked for BNY Mellon for 4 years until leaving because my boss took advantage of my dedication and kindness and lied to me in a very big way. It is banking though so pretty cut throat and no one is very loyal to co-workers, subordinates, their employer or the industry. People are cut without regard and people leave in the same way. For example, you can work in banking for many years and then when you leave and try to stay in touch or use your former employer/manager as a reference, they will simply ignore you. Basically, just take what you can get - which is very good pay for pretty easy work once you have the skills - and dont assume any one actually cares about the people they work with or is loyal to anyone. Overall, a good place to work if you are only after money and dont mind spending the vast majority of your life sitting at a desk or traveling the world with people who couldn't care less about you!"
good,The location is way too far but i enjoy working here. I am on the phone most of the time. I only have about 2 hours off he phone so I can do reserach and follow up on issues.
good,"Acted as a liaison in complex corporate transactions, representing Bank as a Trustee or Calculating Agent."
good,"my typical day is from 8 - 5pm, monday to friday with 1 hour lunch. I have been learning about investment, mutual fund/hedge fund, corporate action, budget, financial reporting, government regulation, and many different derivatives"
good,Good work life balance and employee friendly work environment. Limited room for growth. Not a very challenging environment and performance to benefits has limited correlation.
good,BNY Mellon is a great place to work for someone who likes work / life balance. The downside is that it's a huge company and thus is very compartmentalized. The makes it easy to get stuck in the same position for years and that leads to boredom and lack of challenges.
good,I worked very hard for this company and due to the lack of leadership i was not able to obtain the promotions i earned because i feel my manager was unfair to women
good,"A stable and secure company to work for , however compensation is on the low end especially for compliance related positions."
good,"Friendly management, everyone works together as a team.Good work life balance, Perfect place if you have a family."
good,"-Work/Life Balance, "
good,"I made mistakes a few times.  My objective is turn those mistakes upside down and correct them.  Help the co-workers as much as I can through my experience that I learned from this job.  Management are very co-operative in letting me know the things I did wrong and to watch out for.  Carefully demonstrating the things that I need to learn.  Getting to know co-workers very well, along with bonding and it'll lead to better things."
good,Team work environment and fast paced. Handle various accounts effeciently.
good,BNY Mellon is a great place to start a career and gain experience in the financial industry. Competitive benefit packages and room for advancement make this company worth looking into.
good,About 40 of us were advised last Friday that we are being laid off in Orlando FL . We are currently seeking employment else where either within the company or else where
good,"Working in corporate trust, there is a big staff turnover. The salary and benefits are good, but in my view they are needed to match the stressful environment that you work in. They continue to take on new deals with no adequate training for Reps on the floor and expect you to perform as well as any one else who have been there much longer."
good,"i have learned a lot in bny in terms of professionalism, job culture , unity , team work , good productivity with good quality."
good,"Pros:"
good,"This is a great first step to build your career and learn some professional experience.  If you are looking for stability in an environment where you are allowed to choose your own destiny, this is the place to do it.  You will not make a lot of money in fund services, but you will be able to have the time and energy to pursue your dreams if you like.  If you want stability, this is the job for you.  Overall it was a good experience, and most importantly it is what YOU make it.  Good Luck!"
good,"It is fine, nothing amazing, I just want a better job."
good,Work at BNY Mellon it will be an experience I will never forget. I work in the corporate and retail lockbox department. At 101 Barclary st on the 3rd flr and management and the staff was good people to work with.
good,I loved working at BNY Mellon. They have an awesome cafeteria. With great food choices. I didn't have too much to complain about. Only thing was the pay. I didn't get enough to live in my opinion. I had no choice but to leave. If the pay was better I would still be there today. I loved my job.
good,I really do enjoy this job but I am looking for another opportunity to move back to Arizona.  I am currently looking for the same and or similar work.
good,A typical day at work for me is to help maintain service levels keep phone reps on the phone take ecalations and complaints from brokers or customer's. Make adjsutements to skill sets all day to keep the overflow of call out of queue. The hardest part of my job is keeping my team motivated and showing them the importance of maintaining and achieving our service levels. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that I was able to help someone and I provided excellent customer service.
good,There was always a training course available which helped as professional growth.
good,enjoyed learning about finance and investments. opened personal as well as business accounts earning clients money on there returns
good,The staff was very nice and helpful while I was doing internship at SYN Melon. I did learn a lot in the Finance world and accounting in particular. They have world resource to advance your career and they were very supportive and resourceful.
good,"Good place to work, but life and work balance are not present. Not paid the same fair wages for doing the same or more work than others. Management in some areas is very poor."
good,Enjoyed working in Property Management for Bank of NY. The people were respectful and the work was fulfilling.
good,"your training is on the job, management is not always around to help with issues. Hardest part of the day is right before the market closes. one must be able to work alone and can do without assistance."
good,I have been at bny for almost ten years.  I am to a point that my salary will never get to where i want it to be if i do not leave.  They do not like to promote within.
good,It was a good experience working with BNYMellon. my day started at 08.30 in the morning till 04.30 in the evening.co-workers were supportive in sourcenet solutions
good,Responsible for processing all assigned Initial and Final Collateral reviews in a timely and accurate manner based on the review requirements of each Servicing Level Agreement.

good,"Need to upgrade all aspects of culture physical condition of building work areas, bathrooms. Need better leadership with better soft skills and organization."
good,I worked at a satellite location after being acquired by BNYM. I have yet to see the new management or have a conversation about how culture is different.
good,I liked the job it's self But they are very unorganized. I would work for Bny bank again if given the chance. I went through a TEMP AGENCY to get the job.
good,"Was better as Mellon. More focus on fewer things that drove revenue. Now it's mostly about 'urgency' which drives people crazy. People always worked hard, now it's too much."
good,"Great to get into right out of college to gain experience and that’s about it. Doesn’t want to pay too much or else you’ll eventually most likely get laid off to cut costs. Recently rolled out new policy so there is no chance for regular work from home days, only ad-hoc."
good,There are opportunities for advancement with the company if you know the right people. Sometimes the rules don't apply to some people and the people with suffer for it.
good,morning were filled with research work. I feel I learn a lot of stuff about the wires department and had I had the chance I could go anywhere in the bank because I knew how to navigate around the computer. bosses were ok . most would try to help you if they could. my co-workers for the most part were great to work with. I will miss them. the hardest part was the pressure they put on us because they are down sizing. the most enjoyable part was the people
good,good experience 👍.. growth of an individual depends on the manager.. overall BNY is highly reputated concern with good ambiance and good work culture...
good,"Working for 2 years here was partially good and bad eventually, Down the line management does not give a  dam  about the knowledge and the talent you carry all they need is to get their work done. "
good,"I would not recommend this as a place to work because of the specific group and management in the area I worked."
good,I liked working there. Great training to make sure you're able to perform your job effectively. A bit disorganized and underpaid. Security is very strict.
good,They claimed that they wanted to make sure the team had the staffing and skills to perform their jobs but in reality they only wanted to have someone to blame when an issue occurred. This seemed to be localized to my group although upper management appeared to turn a blind eye or wished to not know.
good,"besides being a stressful day it can be an informative place to learn, advancement was more who you knew and not what you knew. the most enjoyable part was making good friends,"
good,"Slow to move in to the present in regards to work/life balance. "
good,working with BNYMellon has changed over the years and by that changing was when I decided to go the school for Medical
good,"Prior to being laid-off on 2/29/08 from BoNYM's former subsidiary BNYIC, it was a decent company to work for because you learn more about the company and the industry. It was a stable company to work for until Chase Bank had acquired the Retail Sector of the Bank in 2006 and The Bank of New York and Mellon Bank merged later that year in which both companies decided to dissolve BNYIC and relegate those jobs to BNY Capital Markets and Dreyfus. The Benefits like paid vacation time and being able to earn a 3 week vacation after 3 years with the company along with Personal Days, Annual Holiday Parties, Decent Annual Pay Raises, Health Care Coverage and some perks like when the original former long time CEO awarded all employees with Employee Stock Options besides 401-K , Occasional Free Lunches/Working Lunch and job autonomy would be the aspects that I missed very much. Management I would have to say would range from OK to poor since there is always a high turnover rate after 3-4 years and some were able to run the company decently more than others but not exceptionally well though because they were much more interested with their own personal agendas rather than having their subordinates backs in times of need nor were they caring and concern enough about their own employees. In addition, certain supervisors and people in management (not all) have the tendency to show disrespect towards their employee by yelling or to belittle at them especially in front of other employees. This is were the general lack of respect and appreciation comes from especially since you don't hear from"
good,"Underpaid and overworked in most departments, progression chances are low. Not alot of flexibility of working from home etc despite personal laptopsissued"
good,This company has given many opportunities for me to grow at personal and professional level. I have given IJP and got promoted. It's a great experience working here.
good,Good Company to work for and excellent colleagues/team. My work experience at BNY Mellon was a learning experience in the world of global markets.  The people (both peers and management were always available to assist with any questions in navigating the process and information pertaining to client accounts and inquiries.
good,"This company has been very good to me, I liked and enjoyed my job until they no longer needed me as an Executive Assistant.  "
good,"The legacy organizations of Mellon and the Bank of New York have long enjoyed a strong fundamental and historical culture of stability, integrity and client focus.  Over the most recent 5 years or so, however, there has been a great deal of disruption and turnover at all levels of the organization.  It's not quite clear what direction the firm is headed and / or what culture they are now creating."
good,"There were some structural changes which resulted in my departure, but overall, I enjoyed being employed at Mellon and can see myself returning. I enjoyed performing monthly reporting and analytical tasks.  There was a good work culture there.  Employees were recognized for their hard work."
good,"I wish I could give ZERO stars because this company treats its employees with such disdain! The pay is horrible and everyone is overworked. I am so ashamed of myself for allowing this treatment for over 30 years!. As a Sr. Treasury Accountant my pay is under $60k! At least $25 under market. I will say that there are some great people and my manager is good, but it's still not enough to give this place even 1 star."""
good,"meetings for a few hours then review of Cyber information."
good,"Like many large financial firms, BNY Mellon is a high stress environment with an expectation that employee work long hours.  This, however, is offset by their excellent benefits, focus on employee growth and strong leadership.  The compensation levels were lower than average for the financial industry, however job security was high and there were many opportunities for career advancement or new job opportunities."
good,"Benefits are better than at many other financial companies. Management very engaged and approachable at all levels, including the President and CEO. Lots of feedback to make sure your career goals are being met, and opportunities are presented to grow or change into new roles. You can be a major contributor and earn a good salary without taking the management track. Most importantly for me, this is a company that does not demand I put in all hours of my life to them and sacrifice my family. Quite the opposite. I have been dealing with some serious family health issues for over three years, and my managers have been extraordinarily understanding and accommodating with giving me the flexibility needed to take care of my family members and myself; whether working remotely as needed, having flexibility about start and end of my day, or abruptly taking some time off due to an unexpected emergency, the answer from management is always the same -- Take care of your family."
good,Mostly fine.  There is a lot of change going on some is good.  Some is not so good.  New management should pause to gain a good understanding of the current state before making judgements.
good,I served in three positions within this company during my tenure.  It was very interesting to work in different departments getting to learn pieces of the big puzzle.
good,A typical work day includes checking about 30 plus funds. Making sure we analyze and review any potential issues. It's a very relaxed work place yet fast paced.
good,"Work load is manageable, working hours are good. A lot of events aimed at staff motivation and inclusion which is nice. However I feel senior management only view staff as numbers and not people and decisions are made that affect us with no prior discussion."
good,"Cash flow was not much, sales pressure despite slow business.  Good relationship with customers and co-workers.  Hard part is slow business and enjoyable part is got to learn sales skills."
good,Good place to learn about finance and also operations management.
good,"i had a problem at the beginning part of learning ,when first time fund allocated on my name & i had to do my self but now i got it everything ,there is nothing but process follow step wise this is it ."
good,"My primary responsibilities are reconciling 1042'S and 1099 year-end and interim reporting for NRA clients. Review and research tax issues to ensure it comply’s with the state, local and international regulations. Validation of client tax forms to ensure IRS documentation are protected against liability and reflects any upcoming FATCA (including CBR) update policy requirement. Apply proper US tax withholding based on US tax documentation validation on W8 and W9 forms.  Interact with director manager and client to resolve tax-related issues and make recommendation for business and process improvements. I am a proven leader with great team building skill dedicated to maintaining reputation built on quality, service and uncompromising ethics.  I was recognized by management as a person who gets the job done in high volume, quick turn around and often meet deadline."
good,"Bny is a great starter company for recent grads or ppl looking to gain some experience in the mutual fund industry. Compensation isn't competitive at all and there's no clear advancement track. There's really no difference between bny and any large university, you're a number and your existence really don't matter for them to continue moving."
good,"on arriving I would pick invoices to aduit, making sure that the person"
good,I worked as a temp on two occasions - once from 2006-2008 in the Investor Relations Dept...and secondly within the Chief Admin Officer's Dept....both was pleasant experiences....was being optimistic that the position would become permanent but I guess that is how those positions are worked.
good,"The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation is a global investments company, which is focused on helping its clients manage and service their financial assets throughout the investment lifecycle. It provides financial services for institutions, corporations or individual investors."
good,Company is more focused on hiring from other companies than trying to retain top talent to fill roles that require experience and understanding of the organization.
good,"good place to work. friendly people. Lots of legacy, long working hours, old school culture, global bank means global working hours. Career progression seriously lacking, personal skill development lacking."
good,"With initiative, there is an abundance of opportunities to expand your knowledge on professional engagements and personal growth. Most opportunities are free of charge to employees and extended courtesy to consultants."
good,Worked with a young staff that was laid back and chill. Being a Youth Leader I had time to be serious and laid back. The environment overall was great and other who worked there were welcoming.
good,"Good work culture, free meal pass, free cab facility, flexibility in shifts. "
good,"The culture has slowly improved but the pay and benefits are below industry standards.  The company needs to invest more money in its technology if it wants to stay competitive in the industry. Overall, this place has an amazing learning environment. Perfect for young individuals who wish to get their feet wet in the banking industry."
good,They were a great company for experience in client services. I was able to work and finish my bachelors degree. Some of the managers there were micromanagers.
good,"As a consultant, it was competitive environment to work. Long hours that may not lead to more contract work. Work place culture did bread an enjoyable work enviroment"
good,Great job for someone right out of college. You will learn a lot but advancement is very slow and technology here is lacking. Low salary and no opportunities to work from home
good,"Lack of advancement perhaps due to remote location that was reduced. Office was fine, very nice people not a bad experience. Team reduction caused the stress. Just never knew when it would end, then it ended and life is fine. No hard feelings, but due to the way the reduction occurred i would not return. Felt like BNY management took to much time to communicate the end of our team and we are real people!! with bills and families, was difficult time, would have benefited from more warning."
good,I gained invaluable experience working in Bank of New York Mellon. I had the opportunity to deal with various stakeholders in the bank. I learned how the day to day compliance process works for this funds.
good,"Nice place to work..."
good,i dont want to write so many times . i would like to appy for the job. its wasting my time over here. cannot spend so much time to write reviews. people can find out themselves. only thing i can say It was good place to work.
good,Streamlined processes but continued to hire additional hire-ups to continue relocation of work to lower income areas.  Large movement of actions take place overseas and can be difficult to connect with fellow employees when client concerns occur.
good,It's an alright place to work. Compensation is usually lower than at other banks. Otherwise it is an ok place to work. Work life balance is pretty good.
good,A typical day is usually a pleasant I work at night from 3pm to 12 midnight it's usually laid back we only have about 10-12 people working. There is only 1 superviser in my department at this time the hardest part is stay awake and the most enjoyable time is when we get together for our huddle and we make jokes at each other.
good,"Corporate Trust area is stressful and it seems the production expections are unrealistic, considering management doesn't ensure that new people are adequately supported and trained.  Otherwise, I liked the job and the challenge of keeping up with busy workload."
good,"great company to work for, however management changed and that;s when everything started to fall apart. no room for advancement and no appreciation with the new management on board"
good,"Wonderful Mentoring Program at Mellon Corp"
good,BNY Mellon offers employee various opportunity to promote self within the organization.  Operationally departments need to communicate better with staff.
good,"great place to learn and be exposed to investment"
good,I had a learn a lot of professional expertise from this company. It was a fun at work as environment was very friendly and enjoyed everyday. The only concern was about remuneration where I got promoted as Analyst and got an increment of Rs 600 p.m which is neglible because was near to the grade.
good,"De um modo geral a empresa nos dá uma certa liberdade para trabalhar, sugerir e apontar pontos críticos para uma tomada de decisão. Ambiente bom de relacionamento e um bom espaço físico para desenvolvimento do trabalho de rotina."
good,We all want a healthy environment at our work place which gives a job satisfaction. I have learned a lot from my colleges which enhances my professionalism and helped me how to work under pressure. The most enjoyable day was Friday as we used to having Fun Activity on floor every week.
good,"Atomosphere is good, work culture is good. Management likes to micro management. Completing dail logs, hardest part has having on 30 mins for lunch getting in trouble if you were even 5 mins late, management calling overtime 1 hour before you shift was over. Working weekends was hard when you have a family. Most enjoyable was the people you met, coming in everyday and knowing exactly what you were going to do that day, healthcare coverage was amazing, 401K plans were amazing."
good,"I have learned how the treasury world work in an organisation. It is very vast experience for me. My co-workers are good very co-operative and even management is good."
good,"a typical day at work can be easy going if everyone is there"
good,"Typical office environment."
good,"Here at BNY Mellon, I learned some of the basics funda of Corporate world. I learned importance of balancing personal & proffessional life. I learned doing right will reap you benefits for long time. I worked, enjoyed, laugh and share grudges with BNY Mellon. I appreaciate organisation for letting me grow with it."
good,Answering German and English Client calls. Completing the inouse date base afer each call.
good,"ok to work for nothing special. No room for moving up in company. Management has it's ""people"""
good,I enjoyed my time at this job. They working closely to my school schedule.
good,"Competitive environment, good place to work, opportunities to upskill and learn, good work life balance, opportunity to travel aboard, depends on the team you join"
good,"I enjoyed my time at BNY Mellon and had a very good manager and co-workers. Being such a large company, it's hard to say if this would be the case for others or not. The 401k plan and company match is good, vacation is excellent and health insurance is average. The job security wasn't too great in my department and myself and several others in my department were laid off. There are processes and approvals for almost everything, which could be an issue for some people. Many of my co-workers were in India which made collaboration difficult. We did have some overlapping work hours though. Remote work depends on your manager. Overall, not a bad place to work."
good,"Great Place to work, offers tuition Reimbursement, Health Insurance and more. I've learned a lot about fund accounting working there. There's no room for advancement, at least the department I was in."
good,"I enjoyed my time at BNY Mellon based largely on the strength of the team that I worked with.  Senior management was diverse, thoughtful, collaborative and hard working."
good,"The company is a good company to work for, there are development opportunities for those who seek them and are prepared to work hard to take the required steps."
good,"BNY Mellon is a good company to work for but like most companies, digital and cost savings is the direction. So there are many employees that work day to day unsure of there future. In my position, I do not fear. My work cannot be off-shored."
good,"Nice place to work, not too stressful. The job was a lot of data entry work and recuirred a lot of time in front of a computer screen. Overall pretty easy work."
good,Good company to work.. Good ambience to work and nice work culture. Can get good exposure and learn new things.. Growth will be good. Will have nice work balance. Initially the bonus was good and at present bonus rate decreased. Overall fantastic place to work
good,"Good place to work with pleasant environment. Learned more from the people and work culture with respect to Hedge funds, reconciliations and Nav movement."
good,Good company  to work officr also its located in nice area  and we can manage work life balance and monitor benefits also good. I prefer to rejoin in this company if I get chance.
good,BNY Mellon is great if you have the right team and management. They have a great work life balance plan and benefits are pretty amazing! It was a great experience when I got out of college.
good,Lots of change happening at the bank that is driving opportunities for new ways of looking at the business and making an impact to earnings.  Great place to work
good,"When I worked for this company I was very happy.  The Supervisors, the management were like a family to the employees.  We were always focused and determined to meet the deadlines."
good,"I initially worked in the Research and Adjustments dept. The dept was micromanaged and people were rewarded based on compliance (with rules like don't leave your desk x times a da) rather than ability and knowledge. Most of the people in the dept were really great to work with sans management."
good,Most of the times I would process trades and commercial papers. Issue maturity wires and process interest rates as well as work with DTC system to complete my workload at a timely manner.
good,Every day presents employees with opportunities to help the company reach it's shared goals and stated values.  A team fort is expected and delivered by everyone; it is a great place to work.
good,"overall good place to work at plenty of additional training, if you follow the required career path you can advance in your career by lfirst learning the position and then enhancing the position"
good,I enjoyed the environment that this company offered. Many interesting people to learn from and the culture there is truly one of its main assets to attract talent.
good,"Social work place. The management could have done a significant amount more to help their employees develop. It was a fun place to work, but can be difficult to develop."
good,Nice company to work with but there are few departments where management is not that good hence people get frustrated otherwise company policies are good.
good,"good work atmosphere, challenging work load, management, enjoyable atmosphere, typical day at work, hardest part of the job, workplace culture, what you learned"
good,"A typical day would be low volume and depending on the client may be stressful. After a few months of completing BAU, the job becomes stagnant with little room to improve or learn. Upper management is disconnected from the office while middle management has no power to make changes. The job is not difficult but can be stressful if you are unable to pay attention to detail."
good,It has many advanced cloud technologies and is still accelerating in cloud infrastructure. There are variety of tools still being tested and many more which are already implemented.
good,Very competitive environment to work. Excellent on the job training is offered. The job required that strict timelines are met daily which can become challenging sometimes.
good,"Great place to work and learn about the global financial system.  The new CEO is driven to maximize efficiency and client service, which has resulted in a cultural shift."
good,Good company to work with. Process specific. Good perks and overtime. Work culture is good. Medical facilities are good. Parents are covered under policy
good,Working with other BNY Mellon employees was a good experience. Everybody took their roles and jobs seriously. A typical day at work was busy with no time to rest. Which is a good thing so every assignment was completed.
good,"Multi-geographical, highly-matrixed business environment. Continuous transformation and quite innovative. Always seeking ways to improve and serve the client better, more efficiently."
good,A lot of very smart dedicated people work there. Very flexible environment to work at. Remote work is occasionally  allowed in some departments. Management is very helpful.
good,"Ótima empresa para se trabalhar, bom ambiente de trabalho."
good,The intern program that I came onboard to the firm through was a fantastic opportunity. Was able to work full-time during off sessions and had a very flexible part-time schedule during the semesters. The program was grandfathered in during the merger while Mellon had a different intern program that ultimately became the only program.
good,The department that I worked in was a bit chaotic and was not organized. You would be faulted by management and other departments for things that were out of your control or did not fall under your responsibility. The company as a whole is pretty positive but it just depends on where you end up in the company.
good,I worked for 3+ years with BNY Mellon and I got promoted from Technical Leader to Project Leader. BNY Mellon believes in innovation and truly focusses on Employee satisfaction. Gives you a lot of learning opportunities and supports certifications. It gives flexibility in work.
good,"Good work environment, but supervisor was not a good manager. He didn't really know how to interact with people, but the workplace was relatively stress free. I can't really speak to benefits as it was a temp job."
good,Not a bad place to launch career although the corporate structure is not for everyone. Depending on the location and department the duties and people vary extremely.
good,BNY Mellon helped me begin the first stages of my security career helping me u understanding the concept of ethics . I was given various tasks improving my skills with data entry.

Handling reports, answer emails, put together the transmissions and daily audit reports from the day before because everything is a day behind. I key in data to either be deleted or added issues for the day. My supervisor on the input side really does not understand how to communicate with people. I have learned applications for the bank systems such as Peacock and Mockingbird (used to key in and look up data for missing information). Co-workers are friendly and reliable, hard working. Hardest part of my job would be tolerating being disrespected verbally, as if I had done something wrong when there is a simple solution to it all.

My manager is great and is very understanding but is very bound and restricted to the amount of leniancy she can provide. My co- workers are the best part of this job. They are very fun to work with and pull together when needed most. The hardest part of this job is dealing with disgruntal custormers and actually getting an opportunity of advancement is rare.

good,"BNY Mellon was a diverse workplace and it was a good starting block.  Unfortunately, in my department the advancement opportunities were not present and recognition from higher management was lacking.  The only way I was recognised for my abilities was when I had handed in my notice and they offered to increase my salary by 20% but it was too little, too late."
good,"BNY Mellon has a relaxed work environment. Deadlines and status meetings are there like everywhere but they are not too demanding, if your skills are above average."

good,i didn't like finance- i didn't like sitting behind a computer with little to know interaction with customers as a shareholder specialist. you have to really love numbers and finance and be ok with monotonous work. But it was fairly simple and easy to do for an educated person.
good,"The work environment for the most part is very routine. Managing the daily liquidity of a bank is constrained by the various settlement systems that the bank participates in, such as fed securities wire, DTC, CHIPs, etc. Determining our daily liquidity needs and  strategizing on how to achieve those needs is what makes the job interesting. The process incorporates issues of: i) where do we want to position the bank at the end of the day; ii) intraday liquidity concerns; iii) regulatory liquidity concerns. "

The toughest part is that you must pick up someones work when someone leaves their position in your department. The most enjoyable is having weekends and major holidays off."

good,"I like to use the term ""it's hard to complain"". Pretty flexible and laid back. Good 401k and benefits packages. Pay is just lower than competing companies. There is room to advance but you need to be in a good department. Raises aren't significant. Management doesn't seem to get it. Good employees are constantly leaving to find better paying jobs."
good,When I first came aboard. I  was thrown into the fire with no formal training. Group members were helpful but management always seemed too busy to train. crea

With a career background primarily in public service and nonprofit sectors, I learned many aspects of the finance industry with heightened emphasis on risk and financial management."
good,"Before working for ""The Bank,"" I'd been in management in the Financial Services industry for roughly 11 yrs.  Though I had a decade plus of the Financial World in the pocket, The Bank actually taught me the basics. For anyone in the industry, but on the periphery, The Bank has a massive internal learning network and is always ready and willing to provide its internal with industry knowledge and know-how.  In addition, there is a wealth of really knowledgeable managers which have been with The Bank for many years."

good,Hardest part was fighting for qualifications and career advancement. Restructuring was continual nature of role but on the whole done well.

good,"Like every other financial services institution,  regulation has taken a toll with greater focus inward than on external clients and revenue opportunities.  While I think the tide is turning, morale has taken a hit.  Coming in new is an advantage.   Co-workers are great but turnover has been high.  I am optimistic about the future of the organization."
good,"While I enjoyed working with my team and the local managers, company wide projects lacked focus. As the saying goes, ""there were too many cooks in the kitchen."" None of the pieces worked cohesively which resulted in excessive, unnecessary overtime. Often times with very short notice."
good,"My day starts as early as 6:00 AM EST to interact with offshore team located at Pune and Chennai India about ongoing projects and deep technical discussions.

good,Paying debt service for various entities. I learned how the procedures of paying debt service for different municipalities works. The manager of the office where I previously worked was great. All of the different offices should have co-workers that I worked with every day. The hardest part of my job was learning the job with out a training manual provide by the company.

good,"Many people have been here for years, with great years of experience. There is difficultly of advancement considering the low turnover on managers.

good,"Good vacation time, reasonable benefits.  Tuition reimbursement allows employees to pursue an MBA."
good,"The typical work day is busy from start to finish. When I got in, I would pull reports, make sure trades were settled into the portfolios correctly, made sure that any redemptions were correctly accounted, etc.  When reinvestments were being made, it would make things just as difficult because you had to verify the reinvestment and then rerun reports.  I learned a lot about the financial market, but more importantly, the stock market since my day revolved around the market.  I learned what can drive prices to increase and/or decrease and how social psychology is factored in."
good,Days used to be very hectic and long during the business days. Overall good company to work with.

good,"Working alongside professional, dedicated yet fun people, was an enjoyable time."
good,It was good but at times frustrating with the amount of red tape. Good company but slow culture at times. Not enough change for me and could do with some fresh blood.
good,It was great working at this company where I was valued for my contributions. Great work life balance with flexible hours and work from home availability.

good,"Good environment to Work and Enjoy the work culture, "
good,No complaints regarding the pay and benefits. A few areas are still very paper dependent and reluctant to implement process improvements which is a major flaw considering it's about to be 2020. Office space is dated and could use serious updating. Most management reluctant to accept new ideas for more efficient work process.
good,"Good Place to work and build. Fabulous training team and environment with a challenging work environment and growing work space."
good,"Overall a good company to work for, people are great and friendly. There are great opportunity such as college tuition programs in which they pay for your degree and it doesn't even have to be a business related degree at all."
good,A typical day starts at 9am and ends 5-530pm. the busiest day was in the mornings working on closed end funds and starting the daily work and then during pricing time at 4pm .
good,Best part of BNY Mellon are the people. The work is challenging and never boring. You will learn a lot about the finance industry and corporate trust.
good,Laid back atmosphere.  Although not the best communication between management and the supervisors and accountants. Was not properly trained since I was a supervisor coming in off the streets
good,"I have been the part of this organization for 3+ and and I find the company A very good one, you will get a good knowledge about the in and out if the process and the work culture also good."
good,independent working place and fast paced environment. The work load are high volume. You need to be a head of yourself at all time. A lot of expectations and requirement.
good,"Enjoyed the freedom, however, didn't like the mandatory overtime as I was always willing to stay, but with a child, there was a few occasions where I absolutely could not stay longer then my shift as I needed to get my child. I did not like being told I could not leave when my child was waiting for me."
good,The company itself has a lot to offer but the specific area I was in didn't have that type of management.  They chose whom they wanted to put in what positions regardless of other people's education and experience.
good,"Although it is a wonderful place to work, employees are often underpaid and are forced to seek other employment opportunities.  The company often seems to lose great employees due to their pays scale."
good,"I have been with BNY for 5+ years.  I moved around the company and had both good and bad experiences with work/life balance, management and compensation.  Each group is different but overall I would say BNY is a good place to work with a lot of room for advancement."
good,"The bank is going through a transition, trying to shake off its reputation for being old fashioned and slow moving.  This is causing painful disruption but the bank's foundations are very strong."
good,This company is not that bad. I have learned a lot here from a lot of different people. My manager was really amazing. The only issue is that they dont pay enough.
good,Typical day is just come in log into all the different systems and start working in the baskets.  There really is not a lot of interaction with fellow co workers.
good,I work in a call center. It suffers from low morale due to a high turnover rate. Or is that a high turnover rate due to low morale? Management is pleasant - no complaints about them but the nature of the work and sometimes jarring schedules make for a tough environment.
good,The company in a whole is for ever changing - they are providing new avenues for work options and overall client experience. Work environment could be better
good,"One of the most important lessons I learned during my tenure at BNY Mellon was that as the scope of your position grows so does the number of people that you are accountable to. In a large, highly matrixed organization, it is important to remember that your job will include serving multiple leaders and agendas and finding ways to do this well is critical to your success."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working in the TA part of BNY Mellon in Brentwood."
good,"I learned how to successfully create pivot tables in Excel, write minutes and collate information for board reports. My colleagues were great but career progression was limited and morale was low at the time due to the downsizing of that particular part of the business."
good,"Since implementing a forced ranking system, a lot of good employees were unfairly rated below expectations to meet the distribution.  Not good for morale, only focused on bottom line results and continually reducing necessary and important resources to save money.   All about money...not employees."
good,BNY Mellon Jacksonville FL office was a very pleasant place to work at. The environment was very collaborative and everyone were supportive of each other. There was always team building activities all year round.
good,"I have always worked long hard days, with a wonderful management structure and very capable teams under my leadership."
good,Employees worked hard.  Layoffs happened every 3-5 years. The work was interesting.  You were rewarded and compensated well for your job performance.    Relaxed work environment.
good,"BNY is a great company to work for, like every company it has it's drawbacks.   Like funneling money into unecessary employee trinkets  (mugs) instead of re-allocating that money to employee paychecks and networking events.   Touts itself as a company leading in technology, by way behind.       On the flipside, BNY is really work/life balanced and offers flexible work tours including various WFH positions.  If I had to choose I would take the latter...Hence my overall review summary ""Good Company"""
good,Not too bad to work. Work schedules can be flexible depending on your manger. I will recommend this company because of the flexibility in the work schedules
good,"Working at BNY I met a lot of great people and learned a lot. On an average day at work, I normally went through over 20 boxes of collateral, and training incoming employees."
good,Hi 
good,There could be entire weeks where I did nothing and others where I was working like a madman. The job itself was fairly straight forward but your happiness was governed by your deals and who the client contact was.
good,"I don't remember much about working at BNY Mellon, because it's been over ten years but I did like my manager and got along with her very well. I liked the fact that we could dress up for Halloween and we even had prizes for the best costume."
good,Bank of New York Mellon has been a fine place to work. .  The management team as well as peers are and have been top flight..  The company has the right business mix to move it forward.  Key managers are very engaged.
good,A fair place to work. The people you work with made thing more tolerable. Not an extremely stressful work environment. Would work for them again in Maryland if they had a location here.
good,The work environment was good. Co-workers are down to earth and easy to get along with. The work it self may be tedious after 3 month and you may find yourself gaining a lot of extra work if you prove yourself to be a good employee. The pay is not that great- industry wise BNYM pays lower than its competitors across the board. Most managers need a refresher course on management skills.
good,Demanding environment aligned to expectations of an Investment Bank. Collaboration with global colleagues is a plus and the company invests in employees.
good,"While it was enjoyable working here overall unfortunately the long term fit wasn't there. Large Corporation inefficiencies, department siloing and poor opportunities for management advancement forced me to move on."
good,Good people make it easier to go into the office.  Company has many different departments to be able to learn a lot about the financial industry and room for advancement.
good,"Due to the size of BNY Mellon with 35,000 employees, there are many opportunities to advance in the company.  However, the salaries are low.  The benefits are in line with other large corporations including health, dental, vision and 401k."
good,"Similar to other Investment Managers, but provides bigger challenges.  If you do well, you will be promoted and compensated at the market rate.  There were no big pro or cons."
good,"Great company to work for."
good,I enjoyed my time at BNY Mellon but the focus had shifted from customer-based to bottom line management. It became increasingly stressful trying to provide excellent customer service when staffing was cut and contacts were overseas.
good,The people in the department that I worked with were very efficient and a great group of people to work with.  Some of the management went above and beyond to assist their employees with what they needed to achieve their work load. It was a comfortable atmosphere and somewhat steady.
good,BNY Mellon promotes work place excellence and in many roles provides the ability to work remotely. Dependent upon the department they offer a lot of benefits that can make working for the company comfortable for employees.
good,"Not a bad place to work. Lots of personalities but overall good people."
good,Great company to gain valuable experience. Taught me how to maintain my time management. I also had the opportunity to work on a great team of colleagues.
good,"Good place to work and grow within the company. Good management and nice people to work with. "
good,job work load and responsibilities were known ahead of time. mentors available to help and assist.  working environment very friendly.  long lasting friendships.
good,"This is an ""old custody bank"" but they are looking to expand into other areas. Change can be slow but the environment tends to be collaborative. There is also a chance to gain international experience as BNYM is in 40+ countries"
good,"Recently, through layoffs and resignations the company has been short staffed. As a result, more work has been put upon those remaining to the point that we have had to forego lunch breaks (without compensation), and sacrifice work / life balance. The problem is not on direct management, it is well above them."
good,"BNY is a great place to work, staff there are extremely friendly, everyone is very polished and professional, the only downfalls of BNY Mellon is the salary, advancement and job security."
good,"Lots of room for growth. They work hard to train and grow talent. "
good,"Over the short stint of time I was employed at BNYM, I learned quite a lot, and I was given the opportunity to utilize what I have learned over the years.  Which has assisted me tremendously in my last role.  My day was busy, but not frantic.  In my last role I particularly enjoyed managing employees.  Sometimes one does not know how they would handle certain situations, until it arises, and you do well.  This gave a boost in my career, along with conflict resolution.  Overall enjoyed working there and I met great people."
good,It was good working with BNY Mellon but the salary which was provided is not reasonable to run the life and most of the projects were shutdown moved to other location totally
good,Day to day responsibilities kept my team busy. Our group would have benefited from more manpower. Compensation was low considering our workloads. Management was fair and made a concerted effort to check in with each member of the team at least once per month.
good,"Work culture is very friendly, the only concern is growth. If someone joining at junior/training levels it takes much of time to grow. Otherwise its a great organisation to work with."
good,"Good pay, vacation time & flexible scheduling. Cross training and multitasking is part of everyday workflows. Must be able to adjust to change and new procedures."
good,"Work tends to be repetitive. Not a lot of room for growth. Job security is more at risk the higher you climb in the company. Not willing to negotiate salary. Overall, decent company to work for."
good,"Hi paced ,stressful corporate company. Daily invocation is for excellence and client deliverance. We take pride in our company and work for giving our clients the best in a daily basis."
good,"Would recommend this as a workplace. Atleast in my department the managers and the co-workers were really good. Work was very interesting, no boredom. They keep up to their big name."
good,Learn more about static summit booking systems; more interaction with clients and management team; Induction training was good and covered with good topics.
good,"As an employee at BNY Mellon I would say that depending on the are you work in there might be slightly different reviews given about the company.  As it is a large bank there are many managers, job types and tasks handled.  As an employee in the multi-currency operations area I would say there is a lot of job security, but the hours can be long with moderate to high stress levels. While my area has decent management, I have heard other areas aren't so lucky.  "
good,The most difficult part of this job was when there were scheduled days that external client companies have deadlines for their corresponding plans to transact business . Back to back calls involving big money all day.
good,Good company to work for with many locations throughout US.  The company retains good talent to create a working environment where you are surrounded by talented co-workers.
good,Seasoned team with wealth of knowledge and industry leading service. Very challenging and demanding environment that lead to top performance daily with no room for error.
good,"BNY Mellon is a great company to work for if you value job security and the opportunity for advancement! The work can be challenging but if you are willing to work hard, you can advance in the company, as many have."
good,"There are many different pros and cons. The cons appear to outweigh the pros. There is not much room for advancement, and you are not truly appreciated for your work and dedication."
good,A great place to work. Well the management is not that good.The company is a good place to work for. Facilities are good for the employees and great environment to work in.
good,"Great work environment as employees really work as a team and management gets highly involved as well"
good,"Good job culture with good people, but slow work environment.  It is a good, low-risk place to work, but the pace is slow and the work tends to be more regulatory-based in nature than business-oriented"
good,"flexible with work from home, decent benefits, thin resources so long hours to get things completed. Many restructures in the Dreyfus subsidiary which lead to poor morale."
good,I started my career with BNY Mellon in 2005. I was able to meet great people and had the opportunity to work with upper management early in my career.
good,"This was my first job out of college. It provided a relaxed work environment and good benefits. "
good,"Great environment, everyone treats each other like family, overall just a fun place to work at ......................................................."

good,great company with great benefits. Definitely recommended. It typical day of work depends on the department you work for.
good,In BNYMellon is a good work of place co-worker is friendly type of nature i learn t so many things how to handle the work in a timely manner overall i have started my career from BNYMellon its a very good platform for me
good,"The work life balance BNY is excellent, however the job satisfaction, challenge and opportunity for advancement are lacking."
good,Both professional and fun environment with great people to make you feel at home and integrated in part of the bigger picture. Everyone was accommodating to say the least. Plenty of opportunity to grow with the company.
good,"Working as a Trade Processor for BNY Mellon, I performed necessary checks and procedures on all trades to ensure accuracy of processing. I learned how to scan and process incoming mail and documents to recipients and our other BNY locations, and I filed, processed and shipped outgoing documents. A big plus was gaining more experience working in Microsoft Access, Excel, and Outlook. Management was willing to teach and able to correct mistakes while training, and co-workers also had the ability to assist in teaching different strategies."
good,"Nice Place to work and learn in finance company"
good,"Work was challenging and stressful, however, the benefits were very rewarding, such as great health benefits,401k and a pension.  ."
good,"A typical day would be to provide excellent phone customer service with account holders. To have phone interaction responding to account holders inquires about their accounts. Help resolve customers complaints and issues."
good,A typical day at work starts off with getting to work 15 minutes ahead of schedule to make sure I'm able to log on to all systems and to double check each system to make sure my job wouldn't be impaired by any technical issues. After logging into all the systems and databases used to provide quality service I would log into my phone and begin to take calls. The calls were back to back and having to ability to multitask was essential to performing my job. I took on average 100-120 calls a day.
good,Good work / life balance but other limitation. Minimum opportunity for advancement. Flexible working environment.  People are great to work with.
good,I have been with this company on a permanent and temporary basis and have some great memories. Given a chance would go back any time.
good,Enjoyed being able to bring a project to completion and satisfying the client. Had the opportunity to learn other business lines activities and grow within the company.
good,"Pleasant work environment, nice people, and great benefits. BNY Mellon is a little behind the times when it comes to technology and having flexible work schedule."
good,Great for Consultants  not great for actual employees.. there is a high turnover rate due to unsatisfactory compensation and lack of advancement..
good,"Fun place to be at provided you are in the correct shift timings"
good,"Most often I come in to work and I review report, answer questions from my staff.  Approve work in our work flow system.  Answer emails, and go to meetings.  I do enjoy the work place but it is hard at this time to advance and obtain raises."
good,"The atmosphere in BNY was workalholic ."
good,"Overall GOOD... Nice work Environment...Free Lunch, Effective work and knowledge, Balanced work life... NA NA NA NA NA NA Na NA NApplicable"
good,"BNY Mellon is a good place to work, especially in the Check Operations area. I learned a variety of things from check processing, to check adjustments, customer service, and becoming a supervisor. The management cared about their employees, but also knew the tasks that need accomplished on a daily process.  The co-workers wanted to know who you are as a person, and was not afraid to assist with any job or action.  The hardest part of the job is supervising others.  It was no longer about excelling just yourself, but having the entire team excel.  The most enjoyable thing about BNY Mellon was the fact of promoting from within the company versus as hiring from outside for higher up positions."
good,Depends on the position. This is a good company with good clients. The clients expect and deserve good customer service.
good,Company provides great benefits.Overall I had a positive experience with this company. I was given the opportunity to travel and work under a great manager. I was able to grow and learn from the this company

Flexibility (tele commute option for 1-2 days of the week) was another key plus point."
good,BNY Mellon was an outstanding environment for my first job. At the time we were switching from waterfall development to agile. I became a java developer for the identity and access management space in the cybersecurity division.

It always seemed like a secure job, but at the same time, you need to have a good manager and be in the right situation for quick advancement."
good,"I really enjoyed my job for years... it was challenging, fun, and compensated me fairly. Now upper management is turning into a culture of hand holding and shipping jobs. I just don't feel right about working there much longer."

good,"Having come from a company that was aggressively unfriendly to the employees, BNY Mellon was a good change.  There is a bit too much implied you will work constantly off hours for salaried people.  Conversely if you are hourly overtime has to be approved, making it rare. Benefits were vast improvement from previous employer, but slightly below industry standards."
good,the people working at BNYM are very nice to work with and will help you when you have a problem or require mentoring of any kind. As an intern you get to lead the other interns in a monthly rotation that is very fulfilling .

good,"I am having a great time in BNY, good place to learn about the banking statistics, handling of mutual funds, financial controls, over all investment banking terms"
good,"Contractors make very little. Less than the interns. Nobody seems to like working there very much. Decent job security it seems, but there was a reduction in the workforce of some senior members."
good,BNY mellon is indeed a good place to work with. With diversified work culture and different teams you will get opportunity to learn lot more things about financial service industry.
good,Very nice company to start the career with & having lots of opportunities for growth. Within 1.5 years got promotion & also got chance to travel US for the purpose of process transition
good,I had been there for 30 years and the years at the company things changed.  The merit increase went down and when the company emerged it wasn't the same company as when I was hired.
good,"Its a large workplace that has 100s of applicants every day.  At any level they know you are replaceable and treat you as such.  It all depends on whether you have a good direct manager, they will make or break your career there."
good,"Typical schedule for a bank with a relaxed culture. I learned a good bit, but when you get comfortable in a position, they don't allow you to move up as easily as they should. The job was enjoyable, but I relocated, so I had to resign from my position."

good,"I started working at a payment processing center straight out of high school. I learned an exceptional amount from this job. The other employees there were really friendly. The only problem that I encountered was that people could only get in trouble by not showing up. If they messed up at their job and someone else had to correct it, there were no repercussions."
good,I was able to work independently with little supervision from manager and was allowed to run several projects. They allowed you to use your skill sets to assist in project development.
good,the work environment is great and is full of very young and highly educated people. The downfall is that BNY fills management position with people who are not experienced within the industry which causes a lack of communication and an understanding of what is actually happening.

The hardest part of the job was keeping up with all the certifications that had to be done dealing with stock and the sec require."
good,"We used to be very busy during our days at Mellon until the layoffs happened.Management was great.My Co-Workers were the greatest bunch of people you would know.Most people got along great, others were alittle tougher to get used to but we broke them in as much as possible.The hardest part of the job was when it was not busy enough because then they day would then drag on.The most enjoyable part of the job was the team work that was provided, most co-workers had no problem helping out one another and that made the days better for everyone."
good,"I learned how to deal with so many different personalities. I learned about IPOs, mutual funds and standing instructions on how to send a foreign exchange."
good,Set schedule workplace. Not really a flexible job for people going to school.
good,"It was a great place to work, paid for part of my MBA. Has changed over the years. I enjoyed working here very much..."
good,I liked all the aspects of the responsibility of taking control of the cash in the whole branch. I enjoyed working with the cutomers and received many awards for the great cutomer service I gave
good,"Was a solid financial company, with a good focus on its people. Plenty of opportunites to move into different areas. Management not always open to criticism or different ideas."
good,Very diverse opportunities to learn and expand your skill set. Not easy to understand all the businesses or who the right contacts are.  you can make a difference if you want to.
good,"I was a contractor when I worked at BNY. I can say that this was the best contract I’ve ever worked, the work kept you busy and I literally had the best managers I’ve ever had doing contract work. But just like any other company BNY does huge layoffs and that right there is the only issue I have."
good,Provides a different type of work that I have been able to add to my knowledge experience.  Is a production environment.  Able to listen to my books on tape.  I have enjoyed my working there so far.
good,It was a good place to get starting in the world of banking and finance.Great job opportunities once your hired on and there are many locations to choose from.
good,"I was sad to have to leave, but the commute got to be to much.  They outsourced quite a bit and I was also worried about eventually getting laid off.  It was a great job though that I really enjoyed working at."
good,I worked around 13 years in BNY and i learnt a lot from this organisation and also grew from Executive to Backup Supervisor and then Team Leader that is only because of excellent management coaching.
good,"During my years at BNY Mellon, I was treated with respect and was able to go because my leaders recognized my talent and skills and promoted me without me ever asking for a promotion.  I was given the opportunity to  because a trainer with all the tools needed to excel and it was one of the roles in my career that I enjoyed the most.  This allowed me to travel to countries in Asia and Europe and many states throughout the USA.  The job security is not there as more and more jobs are sent offshore."
good,"Love working here. Love the culture, love the location! Very flexible, business casual, FREE PARKING! However, there is no opportunity to grow, that's my biggest issue."
good,"Great place to work, with very good work life balance. Very good compensation."
good,"I worked there as an IT Support technician and assisted the employees with both hardware and software related issues.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with our employees to help resolve their problems. The workplace culture was very positive and everyone treated each employee with respect and dignity.  I feel that one of the hardest parts of the job was that certain departments were understaffed, when a BNY Mellon employee left the company my workload was increased and that was just part of the job. I did address this to management and was told there wasn't much they can do about this.  As I mentioned in my review summary; my overall experience working there was positive, I have met many friends at BNY Mellon and still keep in touch with them when time permits me to do so."
good,"The overall atmosphere was fast paced but it was a fun place to work.  The management was good, but not great.  They can switch up the different machines you may work on so that there is no tedious repetition."
good,I loved working in BNY as i am used to working long hours and so was the staff who aged with me in the company but as the attrition hit i realized its not everyone's cup of tea its difficult the managers are seriously dumb and they have no empathy I mean over all the company is great culture technology cost savings and blah blah but they still need to add a human factor My advice do not join GIA former CARS any other dept i think is comparatively fine ..
good,A very good career job if you like a fast paced call center customer service representative. Always on the phone assisting customers of their investments. There are times when you'll be working during your lunch break.
good,Be patient if trying to gain employment here. It takes quite a while and is an arduous process to get hired. There is a pride in being an employee with Pershing and many lifers. I have learned very much working here and I am pretty happy with my role and life here at the firm.
good,"I enjoyed working at BNY Mellon, but due to restructuring of the company my position is going to be eliminated effective 6/3/19. Therefore, I am looking to advance my career with another company as soon as possible,"
good,"Very good company."
good,"Love my coworkers, training is a bit challenging especially if you work at a different site than the rest of your team. With the new reduced layering system that was implemented, decisions will be made quicker, but advancement also will be slower."
good,Good place to start work as an fresher and get great experience in various departments within organization.company has strong work ethic and it adhere to same.
good,Overall good experience working in Bank of new york mellon.Good life and work balance but less salary so quitting it and searching for a better opportunity
good,Employees who are self motivated and willing to listen without speaking will thrive. BNYM allows talent to grow and develop within its lines of business.
good,"It is an organization that drives with its mission and vision and encourage employees to act as if one is driving its own business. We have an excellent CEO that not only cares about the growth of the business, but it is very focus on be compassionated among each other and respectful."
good,"I worked as fund administrator and despite being very good at it since the start it took me over a year to be promoted as other were waiting before me, not entirely based on skills / quality of work done."
good,It was a great place to work at. My direct team were very helpful and the collaboration with other departments demonstrated teamwork. I would recommend this employer to anyone.
good,"I worked as a temp, the 6 weeks training is cut throat but once you make it out it's fine. They offered me a perm position but I declined because no matter how much better you are at your job, they pay all the reps the same. (I was uptrained twice and got the same rate as someone who was only trained on one line of business).  Other than that it's a pretty chill environment."
good,"Management is very great, I operate many function and enjoy having more than one task per day., "
good,My position working within a busy and productive department was very satisfying.  I learned to take charge of many projects and was constantly asked to learn new procedures that I had to adapt to in my role.
good,Overall my experience here was great. They are very flexible with your time as long as your work is completed when it needs to be. The Job/life balance is great. The people that work there are great too with plenty of diversity throughout.
good,Good place to work and retire and ample opportunities to learn. There is a lot of emphasis in bringing new technology paradigms into focus and a great place to get exposure to exchange of ideas on a global scale.
good,There is an ability to contact team member regardless of their location globally. Readily available job aids will help assisting any customers quickly.
good,"As a project manager I worked long hours, often 8 to 8. However, there is guidance and mentoring from formal programs and the manager I had for many years. She was a terrific manager and we voted her manager of the year. I was grateful for this when I got promoted. "
good,I have learned a lot at BNY Mellon.  It is a good company to work for.  The peole are great and leadership is great they should change nothing about their model.

good,"BONY was definitely a great place to work."
good,"The team I was on had good leadership and promoted a work life balance. Never felt overworked, and they seemed to give you the tools you needed to be successful."
good,"Good to work  ,work environment is good "
good,"Good company. Great benefits. Encourages and provides training for business and technology as well. A highly structured organization, which unfortunately makes it very resistant to change."
good,I worked here temporarily while looking for a higher paying job. The environment was nice and I worked with a great team and management. Unfortunately the income was less than half of what I normally make. but it was a blessing while I had no job.
good,Typical day was wonderful I learned a lot there were days I love to get up and come to work and there were days I didn't the Management had alot of favorites who got away with alot of things wild other empolyees work hard. The work culture were more blacks then white which I find it hard to see coming from California. The hardest part was learning a new system compare to what I usually work on which was good for me more things I can add on my resume. The most enjoyable part can't remember
good,"It is a good place to work, good people and collaborative.  Would not reject an opportunity to relocate to another department.  Reason for looking is due to reorganization and minimal opportunity to expand and distinguish myself in current department"
good,I loved working at Mellon and really enjoyed their community involvement aspect.  Accelerated learning curve and work/life balance was comparable to other companies nationwide. A lot of volunteer opportunities
good,"The entire department did feel like one big group of friends. Not many places can say that, because usually that leave of together-ness is reserved for only a few people you work with.  In this company, it was the first place I experienced such a level of help, cooperation, and fun that has not been seen anywhere else for now."
good,"I did enjoy my days there.  A lot of things was constantly changing.  Very competitive, stressful at times, but still rewarding with great co-workers.  Located in a beautiful Corporate Center with a very, very nice park and exercise paths, Great benefit package, matching 401K, Taking time of sometime proposes a problem,  Always open"
good,"It was a great place to work, the employees were very friendly and the management treated all with respect. Working conditions were up to par and they were great with understanding/dealing with personal issues."
good,"I have held many different positions in the company over the years.  This company, like most, is hard to gain advancement without switching teams or areas."
good,"I've been at Amazon for a month now, and I've seen none of the horror stories being communicated to the public, although Amazon is a large enough company that I'm sure there are good pockets and bad pockets. Everyone here is really smart, and wants to succeed both personally, and as a company"
good,It was really fun to work with my peers and how together we were able to brainstorm an unexpected situation to resolve customers' issues. Teamwork was the main point to keep production up and running.
good,"Worked as a pricing specialised so always had very busy afternoons with very tight daily deadlines, although good team support. However did not feel there was any advancement."
good,BNY was a good company. I was there over two and a half years and was dissatisfied with level of pay increases and career advancement. In retrospect I think that was I impatient and I probably should have considered more carefully before leaving.
good,"SLOWE PACED FRIENDLY ATMOSPHERE."
good,Easy job with a great environment. The people were friendly. I must say that this job was one of the least stressful jobs I've head. It is a great entry level position.
good,"Vacation time is generous, however pay is low if you are working your way up.  If you come from the outside in a more senior role, likely you are starting 20% or more higher than long term employees."
good,"It was a good company to work for, unfortunately I was let for business reasons. "
good,"The biggest issue with this company as a career would be the continued desire, by the company, to save money on staffing wherever possible so they move functions overseas if they can.  Good jobs are routinely being phased out of the US and that leaves only so many upper level positions for many applicants.  Advancement can be difficult.  It's not impossible, but difficult.  Many of the people there are terrific, supportive people.  But as with any large company, a few bad apples can spoil a bunch.  The benefits offered are nearly the greatest I have ever come across.  If you find a job with this company, you will be a very content employee for the majority of your time.  Working hard will benefit you, but it might take longer than expected to get rewarded for it.  Overall, this is a very good place to work."
good,"Company gives you very good perks additional benifits, incentive,bonus"
good,"People here are nice. You can advance your career. However, there are so many levels of management and so many unnecessary protocols that a lot of growth gets stunted."
good,In my opinion this company has decent healthcare benefits and push for you to continue your education. Relaxed environment and decent pay. Great location and work hours.
good,"I worked at BONY only for over one year period. A typical day was involved in audit work paper, interviewed with clients and provided a supervision to staffs. I have learned audit software, capital market products and risk management oversight process. The management was very much by engaging in the audit process and provided an overall support to our audit tasks. The hardest part of the job was to deal with so many people at such large organization. The most enjoyable part of the job was working at a large audit team and learned things from each other."
good,Bny Mellon is maintain a verygood workplace culture .Everyday is challenging. The most enjoyable thing is that all of us are  enjoying the works provided all diffuculties.
good,"BNYM is a great place to work.  The teams are friendly and teamwork is fostered there.  Management is very fair and always treats people well.  Although it is a high paced environment, there is always room for a bit of down time to catch up on emails, etc."
good,"I enjoyed working at BNY Mellon, my department was like family away from home.  A typical work day is balanced may start slow then end up busy or vice versa. I have learned much more skills than expected and pleased with my accomplishments.  Management are always available to listen and assist."
good,"BNY Mellon is a great indtroductory company to work for and get your foot in the door for a young professional, but there are not a lot of opportunities for growth."

good,"It is quite good experience working in BNY Mellon. I work on pension funds. Daily work involved resolution breaks between custody and accounting, income processing, daily review of profit and loss allocations. Preparation of balance sheet and profit & loss a/c at month end. Management keeps changing so there are some good managers and few worst too. But always got opportunity to learn new things and i always gave my best to the organisation."
good,"BNY Mellon is financial services company providing work life balance, their only down side is their salaries which are below par of finance industry in Houston"
good,Working at BNY was very competitive and awesome because in our competitive business world you have to make sure that you are giving the best of yourself and make sure that you are a truly asset into the company.

good,BNY Mellon is very professional organization that justifies the skill set of the employee. Nice system to take care of gradual employee growth simultaneous with organization.
good,"the document management centre worked on a shift pattern covering hours from 5am to 6pm. Post is received and opened and scanned onto the system so that the other departments can access the work via the CMS Image and Workflow. "
good,"1. A Typical day is never typical as change is constant"
good,"I have enjoyed my time at this company. The benefits are infinite, which is why I have stayed so long. The people have been great to work with and we all are very supportive of each other. I joined the company as a fresher and have learned a lot for which I will always be thankful. I have realized the potential that I have only because my team leader and manager have always been pushing me to extend my horizons. The main issue I find here is that no matter how much extra work we do, we do not receive applications for it. We are always made to feel as if it's just a part of our job description."
good,Liked working as a Official for CNY Family Sports Centre. It was a fun job but was short term. Good to help assist in the growth of soccer.
good,"My initial hiring experience was unsatisfactory as i was intitally informed I would work in a completely different position than I am currently in. Although the training system needs improved, the overall experience with the company has been a pleasant one."
good,"A varied and challenging environment with tremendously dedicated and resourceful colleagues.  Some truly great people to work with."
good,work partly at my desk and then meeting either with the Business. Good facilities and nice offices.  We could do more as a company on career progression with the organisation
good,Not a bad lace to work at all. Overtime available for non salaried positions. Excellent Healthcare plan. Management is lack luster.
good,"Typically we have the daily schedule and work routines, everyone are assigned to certain clients/funds unless someone else is out for work. We are managing/processing the funds for our client and providing any services upon for requests. overall the company and the team are good but just the manager managing skills need to improve."
good,BNY Mellon is a great company to work for.  Everyone is usually friendly and easy to work with.  The management can award you for your efforts however can be easily overmissed. Low compensation compared to other companies in the industry in the area.
good,Heb hier met veel plezier gewerkt in een leuk en enthousiast team.
good,"Meeting with client"
good,"I have started my career with BNY Mellon. I have learnt a lot of new things which was not even taught in college. There is good working environment , management is good."

good,"9-5 with good benefits, low likelihood for advancement, Pay is okay but should be better given job and company. Overall a solid job."

good,"BNY was a great opportunity for people who want to with international securities and markets. Great people. However, the governance was old fashioned and there is limitation on the personal growth. Other than that, great place to work."
good,"I had the privilege to represent the group with internal and external clients across EMEA and the US."
good,This is a customer service job that gets you familiar with mutual funda and finance. Bank hours are utilized for the call center with is good because you always have weekends off. Great work environment and coworkers.

For an entry-level job, the pay is decent, but nothing to brag about. The management is great, very understanding and calm."

good,"This company was a good one to work for. The management I felt could have been a little more flexible when it came to their Depatrment Heads. If though you were in charged, you did not have the final say for your department. I know the Department Head does have someone over them but, I feel you are the one that is running the department, day in and day out. So, I should be the best person to make the final decision. Example: If I'm having a problem with a staff member in my department I should have the final say on what happen to that person. I don't feel it should be a person who visited occasional. This was not this case for all departments but a few."
good,"I had worked there as a Data Entry Spc II no more than 2 months or so. I enjoyed it. Pay is same as others and benefit (never had the chance to use it) is good as well. There is no micro management, but they have set of daily goals and you have to meet the production rate with minimal errors. Most people working at the Richardson, TX center is older and have been there for some time. You sit there and just key in data, so I really didn't see much office politics or drama. Not a bad place to work."

good,"Everything about BNY Mellon was pretty good for me. When I first started I had a rough time but that was due to a nasty co-worker. After she left everything was great, minus the pay. I mean they started me at what they said the "" market "" allowed at the time. I did get a raise, not much but better than nothing at all. Overall it's a great place to work pending which dept you're in and the people you're around. Only downfall is there isn't room for advancement and they'll pile more and more work on you but your pay stays the same.  EX. There were plenty times I had to take over my dept. for long periods in time. When the supervisor returned it was a simple thanks for doing that. ( Really?? I had no choice ) lol but anyway, during my time here I recieved more thank yous than ever. Of course we'd rather have more raises or a chance to develop into managment somewhere else. I'm still here because we all know how hard it is out there to find a job. Take the earlier info with a grain of salt cause here comes the bad news. At some point in time a dept may be outsourced, ( if you don't know what that means, please look it up) long story short. Another company has bought your area/workload. And yes you have to apply for your own position all over again. You lose your vacation, years of services and benefits. Only good thing about it is when you're outsourced generally that new company wants to keep you, I mean lets be honest.They can bring in there own people but at the end of the day they wanna keep everythig flowing so it's up to you if you want to stay and accept the changes.

Sometimes we had to do other jobs when we were short handed and I also had to type checklists.  Our supervisors were very nice and if we had a problem or something else, we could talk to them about it.  The hardest part of the day was from 4:00 to 5:00, you are ready to go home and the clock goes so slow.  I did not like riding the trolley either.

good,"A typical day at work would consist of turning up in the morning, and going to the kitchen to make a hot drink and get your breakfast. You would then go to a desk of your choice and log on to begin your days work. The management are not your typical management, they would express their assertiveness if required, but they have a very relaxed approach to work and treat you more like a friend, rather than an employee. The culture in the workplace is very laid back, and everyone there is friendly, and willing to help you with any problems that you may have. One of the hardest parts about the job only applies if you are not able to handle yourself under pressure. If you are able to handle yourself under pressure and multitask, working at BNY Mellon is the place for you. In my opinion, working for BNY Mellon is enjoyable itself, there isn't really a specific aspect of the job that is most enjoyable. As long as you get along with everyone else there, you will never have a bad day, and you find that the days seem to fly past, as there is always something to do, and you will never be bored. If the occasion ever rises, that you have no work to do, you always have the option to be able to go and ""shadow"" an alternate department, so that you can have exposure to what they do, and should the position ever arise, and you wish to apply, you can always say that you have some experience in the field."
