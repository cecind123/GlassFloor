bad,"Jamie Brogan Electric shop manager the worse low life individual ,backstabber and lot of favoritism."
bad,I worked here i only lasted two months.the managers have no respect for you .and over work you.this place lives for drama
bad,"Management goes out of their way to make the workplace miserable for the Security Officers. Knew an officer who had a heart attack on the casino floor, was taken out on a stretcher, and when he came back to work he received disciplinary action. Just one of many such stories."
bad,"Stressful environment because team members were hostile. The managers can only do so much with the power (or lack thereof) they are provided. If a team member is sick, they are docked points (because of people who have taken advantage of the system) and it's very easy to rack up points because working on the floor of a casino is much like a Petri dish. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with people which frankly was discouraged although it was technically part of the job description. Some team members were great and totally undervalued; others literally did nothing all day and took smoke breaks and were somehow favorites of management so suffered no consequences. Pretty abysmal overall."
bad,"Terrible company to work for that does not value their employees. Incompetent managers that treat most staff horribly. Some of the security staff (who think they're police officers) are unprofessional and rude, and managers/ supervisors do nothing about it. There is plenty of favoritism within the department. Seemed to be no room for advancement."
bad,"Anything that can go wrong will, you’ll be to blame. Coworkers will tell you it’s best to leave. You will have arguments with the other shifts. Use this position as a resume builder. Take frequent breaks and deep breaths. Other departments and clients are going to speak to you as if you are the most incompetent person they’ve ever met. Write ups are a definite. I have worked in other departments for Sands and they aren’t ran this poorly"
bad,Please dont work security is basically my advice. Management would pretend to be your friend and call you in the office next day for killing a fly. They would back stab you very quick. You could be the best employee in security then be out the door in 5 seconds if you let a minor in.
bad,"A typical day at work is either your at a lobby checking for room keys, to being outside at a post checking vehicles at random, or doing pit fills. The job itself is very easy and can be tedious at times, but handling each call with integrity is key within this business. "
bad,"I am speaking from my personal experience and others who worked in my role. I was fired without a stated reason. I received no feedback prior to losing my job. My five year pin was practically tossed to me. No loyalty to their employees. No respect for those who are looking out for the company. Most of the bad actors are gone. Maybe things are different now, but I doubt it."
bad,"The management staff does not build their employees up for success and instead enables an unprofessional working environment in which staff and managers continuously talks negatively about each other. Feedback from long term employees who are negative and stuck in their ways is what is valued most because ""they can't change how they act"". Many of the managers are immature and would not be managers in otner companys. Las Vegas Sands prides itself in claiming to be the best resort to work at but it is far from that. Extrememly unprofessional working environment."
bad,There is absolutely no room for advancement in the Security department. Most of the Supervisors have no experience in criminal justice/ Law enforcement/ Military. The favoritism is the worst ive ever seen.
bad,"Horrible Management Team.  “Executive Protection” with absolutely no relevant experience.  I expected to be working with Ex-Secret Service, FBI, SpecOps Military, or Prior Law Enforcement Managers. Instead, it is run by Israeli “Special Forces” (where everything is “Special”) with Questionable Credentials. The subordinate employees have more actual combat, and leadership experience.  For a multi-billion dollar company, the “Executive Protection” Team Management is a joke.  Hostile Work Environment, Management Retaliation, Poor Scheduling, Favoritism, Discrimination, No Team Cohesion.  Absolutely Embarrassing."
bad,"Despite the facade, it's essentially a mom and pop shop.  Daddy A at the top and his son in law running the show."
bad,"I work for sands corporation for over ten years,  they have great health benefit and decent meal program for the employee, however management is another story. Most managers I work with are uneducated, over paid, arrogant, pretentious, sanctimonious and very corrupt.  Favoritism is rampant, advancement is nil unless you are brown noser in management circle. Remember this is the company where low level hourly service employee  shot two  executive managers and kill one. Many employees are marginalized unless you are managers."
bad,"I worked for LVSC for several years. The pros were the great health benefits, and there is generally commitment from many of management and teammembers to provide excellent customer service."
good,"I found the management generally ignorant.  The operation is so large and unwieldy that the book is the book.  ""Here is the book and it says this, see ya."""
good,"10 yrs ago Las Vegas Sands was the best places on the strip to work. Now it's the worst! About 4 years ago it turned into a Hostile work environment! You can expect to be written up by management for anything and everything, like eating sunflower seeds, breaking a rules that you weren't told existed, or clocking in 1 min late. They will do this every 4-5 months and use them to justify not giving you a raise. Health care package is not as good as it used to be (higher deductible & less coverage), same with 401K (less match), company picnic (discontinued), Turkey at Thanksgiving (discontinued), and Christmas party (also discontinued)."
good,"Minimal advancement opportunities, but does provide great benefits. I have learned a lot in my position. Great place to work for experience, but probably not a long term career place."
good,"There are plenty of challenges, but you need to prove yourself to the management team before trust is created."
good,"Working in Las Vegas is all behind the scenes deep in the bowels of the resort. It takes some getting use to if you are not from Vegas. Things change quickly and although the technology is not cutting edge - it is unique. You will have to register for a gaming license to work on the systems connected to the casino, but that is a pretty painless process and sponsored by the casino."
good,Work Place Politics got in the way of a lot of day to day functions. Advancement is upon who you know not merit. Company is still a great place to work for good benefits and pay just keep your head down.
good,"Provide service or assistance to meet the needs of a guest. "
good,"The amount of work is not reflected on the base pay. There's a lot to be desired from management in terms of logistics,such as scheduling. I learned about working in a professional setting."
good,"Fun company to work with, however I was not employed by the company. This was an academic project that involved market research based on the companies sustainability program."
good,"This IT QA manager position has offered a great opportunity to understand Hotel, Casino, and back of house (HR, Payroll, purchasing, etc) appliation development and QA experience. In addition working with extention Las Vegas Sands properties/teams in China and Singapore."
good,Job can be great when your department happens to be the flavor of the month with executives.  Sweeping organizational changes can come without warning or consideration for individual talent and resources.
good,"The Venetian|Palazzo  is one of the most beautiful resorts in the world.  I was very excited when I first started working there.  I was able to move up from being a Dealer to an Assistant Shift Manager in four years.  I think that most of the departments there are full of people that genuinely like working there, and care about the amount of effort that they put forward to create an outstanding guest experience.  Unfortunately, I worked in the Poker Room, and after new management took over in 2013-2014, the department started to decline.  Directors and Managers made decisions that directly affected the salaries and morale of everyone working under them.  They began to use unprofessional intimidation tactics to force team members into resigning, so that they could promote people that blindly agreed with their management philosophy."
good,"There is a lot of power struggles, politics and fear woven throughout the work culture at Las Vegas Sands Corp.   Be polished, politically correct and watch your back."
good,"Working for this company is a mixed bag, as is the case with most companies. LV Sands pays well above average for the Strip and they are a very demanding company. They let it be known that they own your time and they pay you handsomely for it. As the largest (7,049 suites) hotel in the US, there are predictable challenges with cross-departmental coordination. All in all, it has been a learning experience and I am very grateful to have worked here. After working here as a manager for the past 4 years in 3 different departments, I am confident that I could work anywhere in the world."
good,The Management Team has to many of them. Not all the time there together. One say one thing and the other say another. They have there favorites. In briefing I was yelled at from the Management team to sit down. I felt like a Dog.
good,"Working there used to feel like a privilege. 5 stars, 5 diamonds and there was pride in the role you played in making it great. They would have company wide Christmas parties and bonuses. All of that went away after 2008, never to return. Morale dropped as what was once an incredible health and dental plan normalized to industry standards. Management seems to always be looking for small infractions in dress code or conduct just to have a reason to exist. "
good,"Very nice organization.  Pay is not good at all, however. Mgmt seems to appreciate employees and are flexible with you as long as you perform your duties and show up for work."
good,"Corporate demands late hours and a demanding culture of perfection.  "
good,"Very fast paced and deadline driven. Not much of a work-life balance, but the pay and benefits make up for this. They also provide a lot of training to grow your career and it's a great company to learn everything about hospitality."
good,Typical day at work usually starts with any issues regarding checkpoint firewalls or any switch related issues mostly.Work environment is usually corporate style focusing on the issues with utmost care to ensure that the company management rules are met and satisfied by making sure the clients are given high priority regarding any issue related to their networking outrages.
good,"Was a contract position, which I was never able to complete. I would say the company as a whole is a great place to work. As like most places there are a few bad apples."
good,"Growing company and leader in the market."
good,"*department funds available for industry certifications and chapter involvement"
good,Experience was great for career development.Collaboration between IT department and business. Company had great reputation and many repeat clients. Team members always willing to assist.
good,The company provides opportunity for education continuation and assistance with new programs.  Education reimbursement is very efficient and are done within a week of completion
good,"I loved my time at the Sands and wish there was an opportunity to stay. Once you are qualified for a promotion, it takes about 7 months once you start the interview process until you receive an offer letter. I understand that things take time but I believe 7 months is a little excessive."
good,"pretty relaxing workplace as a dealer. decent tips, easy to get EO, management is generally nice and understanding; also flexible. hard to get full time status (most dealers start off as on-call)."
good,"Mostly good things to say. Can only speak for my position, but advancement opportunities are limited. Like most other places, co-workers and management are a mixed bag. Seems like the company overall looks out for the hourly workers more than they do middle management. My experience in my department is good, in my opinion very talented co-workers, both line and management. Very high expectations, but still hard to get rid of entrenched employees with sub-par ability/work ethic/attitude."
good,"In the past five years at Las Vegas Sands Corp., I've had great exposure and opportunities for advancement. With the most comprehensive and best benefits on the strip, I definitely endorse it as one of the best places in Las Vegas to work."
good,"I was given a wonderful opportunity to experience working in a global PMO group of a very prestigious company after working as a contractor on a project. I was very grateful for the opportunity, but found out that being a global project manger is quite different than IT management at one property.  I realized that this was not the best role for me and I communicated that to my management. They were very understanding and supportive and appreciated my honesty and hard work ethic. They are trying to find another role that better suits me at the local property (Las Vegas) and is being very supportive and helpful. I truly enjoyed my time with the Corp IT PMO group and I thank them for the opportunity they afforded me. This is an amazing company to work for and I do hope that ey are able to find a new role for me."
good,"Sands is a great place to work. Employer pays all medical, Dental And Vision."
good,I enjoyed working at Venetian|Palazzo Casino Resorts very much. Good company and great culture. The company provide a lot of opportunities for internal promo.
good,"My typical day at work involves managing tournaments ranging from 40 to 4,000 entries and a staff of as many as 6 Tournament Coordinators and 100 dealers. I'm also required to help develop new tournament ideas as well as control labor costs. I am involved in targeting higher revenue generating events and tracking our guests play in cash games before and after tournaments. I am also involved in the discipline process as well as training and hiring of new employees. My typical day also includes constant review and creation of upcoming Deepsatck Extravaganza schedule of events and structure sheets."
good,"Good benefits, talented people.  The only thing is lack of holidays, as we only observe one holiday per year."
good,"Great place for career advancement. "
good,"Fast phase and very detailed oriented when dealing with documentations, and balancing your drawer.  You have to have a lot of patience with gamblers.  Regular Employees are looked down a lot by superiors (Cage Department/Shift supervisors)"
good,The SANDS corp has the employees back no matter what. Best experience of work I have ever had. Seeing crowds come from all around the world was a real shocker. Las Vegas is a truly international city of LIGHTS and MUSIC
good,"The job was ok and ,but i needed way more hours and a place to grow .I have learned a lot working there as a cook. Over all its not a bad place to work"
good,"Working here has been a real good experience for me,its a good place with great benefits ,managers treat people with ethics and respect,coworkers make the place a good teamwork"
good,Everyone is a Team Player and there are a lot of perks working for this Company.  We have great Rallies.
good,Company takes care of team members better than anyone in Las Vegas.
good,"At times, very high paced, fast action scenarios, with multi tasking problem solving situations. Enjoyed comradery, Hands on experience. troubleshooting with fix resolutions."
good,Ecpetacular atención y el ambiente de trabajo muy buenos resultados
good,"While sometimes stressful, definitely a great place to work. Great sense of family and community. The benefits are outstanding. Career advancement is there for the taking so long as you put in the work."
good,"Company provided room to expand your skill-set and provide daily value to the mission."
good,"Great Management, Awesome Co Workers. Great work environment, good customers and easy but fair advancement. Multiple place to work within the company."
good,"A great company to work for....sad that I had to leave.  Darn heat.  Otherwise I would have gladly stayed on for as long as needed or a dozen or more years at least.  Loved Vegas, loved the job, and even loved the ""night shift""."
good,"Excellent organization that offers excellent training to help further your career. They offer the best benefits and meals, as well as, onsite daycare for those in need."
good,"Not only did they provide medical, dental and vision for me with no payroll deduction, they paid for my spouse and children as well with no cost to me"
good,A typical day at work was not typical in comparison to most places! Our role as a Security Officer changed from one moment to the next. At one time we may be providing the utmost in guest assistance; the next-breaking up a fight.
good,The application process seems very fair and not overall to lengthy. Las cegas sands is an excellent company to work for amazing benefits and over involvement with community
good,Great place to intern. Pay is really good for all positions including entry level. Benefits are free meaning the company covers the premium costs. Las Vegas traffic can be a hassle getting to work everyday.
good,"Always on time , a people person . Can speak spanish also. Help othere when needed"
