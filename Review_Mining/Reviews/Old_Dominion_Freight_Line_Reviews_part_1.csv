bad,"the manager favors family."
bad,21 years down the drain help build this company and for what never took off or took a lunch for what no respect for everything I did worked holidays gave up family time and there supposed to be a family company to bad they sold out to corporate  America and now the snowflakes win because you can’t manage them you might hurt there feelings
bad,They have white privilege in the company and they fired all the African Americans in the company. They also terminated plenty Latinos including me wrongfully
bad,"management give zero f**ks about their employees they preach they do but their just corporate puppets, they never back you up if you have an issue all they care is about is saving them self money."
bad,Solid company. They promoted within and stressed family. I do not regret my thirty years with that company.  I wish them well and I will miss the people that I worked with.
bad,You’re only as good as your last good deed. Nothing goes on punished. They will fire you for anything people losing their jobs here after 19 and 20 years for the stupidest stuff
bad,Alway talking down about other freight company... If u work for a union job before don't apply they won't hire u. Terminal manager such a liar. Alway making u sign something for safety everyday.
bad,"They are not the company they use to be.  Been there long time.  No bonuses for Supervisors, no room to move up.  Hire people from other trucking companys.  Not a place that recognizes hard work.  No room to move up unless u have family at corporate or no someone or job was made on gold course."
bad,"Last manager at this location was the pits.  He never knew what to due and always past the work on to someone else to do.  Supervisors ( one was a deacon) acted as though they cared, but would run and gossip to the manager with everything you thought was confidential.  I was told I wasn't doing part of my job, but the work never got put on my desk to be done. My cubicle was not in the same office as the others and the drivers would hand the work to the two guys that were over scheduling etc. and as I said never forwarded to me to do.  I didn't know that any was even turned in at any time.  My manager refused to even give me an annual cost of living raise due to this situation.  So, I didn't receive a pay raise for over 2 years.  I only hope that the corporate office is seeing their errors and can become the company I told it was when I started working for them over 6 years ago.  I have been retired for over a year and grateful to God that I don't have that stress on me any longer."
bad,All this company does is lie to it employees and customers worst freight company I ever worked for was lied to to come over this company from a competitor regret leaving other company
bad,Worked for them for close to 9 years. When I started it was a great company. They took good care of the drivers. Now they are more corporate. They run you into the ground. It got to a point I couldn't take it no more and I quit. I feel I wasted 9 years of my life. But quitting Old Dominion was one of the best things I have done.
bad,Unsafe place to work they will push it to the limit bad management specially dispatcher and terminal manager they won't comply with d.ot regulations like placar trailers with hazmat.
bad,"you work more than 60 hours per week no overtime is paid, you are expected to do more than 12 hours per day with only one 30 min break not paid, management is worthless they always change things to their convenience."
bad,"They are scumbags! Their driver hit me and they refuse to pay my damages and they did not back their driver! Beware! Horrible human beings at this company. They will do anything to get out of having to take care of their employees and pay for their wrongs and they will fire you and not support you if you are in an accident, even if you are not at fault."
bad,No support for the sales team by management or staff. I was warned not to take a position here. I was the only person that care about the customer but was powerless to do anything to help the customer situation.
bad,"They hire you part time to get out of giving you  benefits,but they still want you to work full time hr.They  harass  you about leaving at your scheduled time."
bad,"I just have to say this... this is by far the worst place I have worked at. Management is a big joke, co-workers are terrible to work with, favoritism is allover, you are never good enough for them, not matter how hard you try, long stressful hours no overtime at all"
bad,Requires more effort for less pay. Management and governing rules change by the day. There is no job security and very little chance for job advancement.
bad,"They treat employees like children .they think they can talk down to you !! You are being monitored through your whole shift !! I would recommend fed ex,ups if you want to get in LTL .."
bad,"We had to work on a dock that was exposed to the outside environment.It was always cold in the winter.We got wet when ever it rained.We found snakes on the dock, insects and vagabonds."
bad,"Current driver, management is great, but the mechanics in the Columbus, OH terminal can be rude."
bad,they force the mangers to wite up as many employees as they can. this way the will have alot of paperwork for the unemployment hearing.
bad,"Long story short, they let me go because I didn't have enough hours to run a second load. Go figure"
bad,"I've worked for OD for almost 2 years. They refuse to promote those that actually work hard and follow guidelines and they do not discipline those who lack in doing the job appropriately . They practice favoritism of the highest paid guys who are beyond lazy and complain way too much for guys making 24+ dollars an hour... Although proud non union they don't promote by work or numbers, they promote by seniority. They have lied consistently about the hours you'll get. They're outbound crew is absolutely lazy and their is no leadership or pride in working... They're supervisors are incompetent,  and the terminal is a greedy old man who only cares about his bonuses.  Easiest work I've ever done, dumbest managers I've ever worked for and the worst company I've ever worked for.... Charlotte and kings mountain terminals are both trash.... thanks old dominion for pushing me into poverty while being employed..."
bad,"A small office with everyone in your business.   All cliques and nasty.  Constant back stabbing and drama.   Corporate loves Trump and have to deal with it mixed into company newsletter."
bad,Management is a joke they talk to you and treat you like a child it's very unsafe to work here and no room to advance DON'T DO IT  not worth it if you have other job offers take them
bad,Not a very friendly family company to work for it took me three years to get a full time schedule while everybody that was hired after me was offered full time schedules after thirty days some moved immediately to supervisor and lead positions but only if you were in with management or other supervisors
bad,They may as well follow you around with a bullwhip. Your production will never be enough. Prepare to be wrote up for whatever they can think of. Don’t trust anyone. Say goodbye to your family
bad,"Toxic management team . If they are around you can be bet they are making things worse than they need to be. Always making threats and talking down to you. Don't ever plan on advancing at this company either- they have a management trainee program where they take recent college grads with no real direction, no experience, and no qualities- these are the people the company creates the management positions for now. Not the person who has invested years into the company."
bad,"Its nice to be able to work for a place where you can have confidence in the management team and that has a nice family culture... However Old Dominion if NOT that place.  As far as its ""family culture"" goes, the closest it comes is that of a highly dysfunctional unorganized crime syndicate family.  You constantly have to watch yourself  for the back stabbing, wade through a constant barrage of lies, bad politics, threatening,  and bottom of the barrel managers.  In this 'family' , its ""do as I say, not as I do""  , but even then, you are not even safe doing what they say, as it constantly will be changed from one moment to another as to what is acceptable or not.  You only have assurance of security if da' ""boss"" has favor on you... and that only comes when you 'bend the knee' and 'kiss the ring'.  Consistent hard work,  dedication, and work ethic means nothing in this family if you are not in the 'kliq'.  If OD truly desires to have a meaningful positive 'family culture' then they may want to get their management team here to a reeducation camp ASAP, as they have taken this 'family' thing and ran full speed in the wrong direction."
bad,Expected to come in and work hard while many in management do as little as possible.  Supervisors always on us to get our numbers up while they sit playing on their phone most of shift watching youtube videos and movies and stuff like that.  They play favorites giving easy trailers to some guys their whole shift while handing out bad loads to some other guys all the time.  One guy will do something stupid and they make someone else fix it instead of the guy who did it.  Upper managers just give supervisor jobs to their chosen people with no experience who know less about the dock than any dock worker.  Cant trust any manager and almost no supervisor for all the bad politics and back stabbing climate here.  Just depends who you are whether the rules apply to you or not.  Who are you in with?  that's all that matters.  If you are not in with the right ones you have no real security.  They have taken what should be a good place to be and turned it into pure misery.
bad,"It doesn’t matter how long you have worked for this company because reaching the top of the seniority list means nothing more than a big fat target on your back.  I mean, why pay a forty year old who has worked for your company for more than ten years a decent wage and benefits when you can hire a twenty year old, part time, for half the salary and little to no benefits, right?  It’s all about the bottom line and the less they spend on payroll, the better the management looks to corporate.  "
bad,Corporate and management play favorites! To push out those who are not of the same mind set. If you’re a person who likes to get the job done and g right home. Stay away from job! Open door policy is a joke every one in management will know your concern even your co. Workers!
bad,Dont work on the dock to get your cdl it wont happen. They dont care about you and expect you to learn your job through current employees not training.
bad,"Worked here well over 10 years... pay was good.. management was an absolute joke... management had ZERO  knowledge of what the heck they were pretending to manage.... of course, that doesnt matter when you were gauranteed a job when your father sold out to old dominion.  This company, and many others like it... are the reason labor unions exist... when your so called "" upper management""  spends untold time and resources to remain "" union free ""... uuhhmmm... ya might need a union."
bad,They give 1 sick day a year and 10 days of paid vacation.  Other than that if you call off more than 2 days your fired. Also they make you  suffer in freezing temperatures without providing anything clothing to work 10-12 hour shifts a day. No family or life working here.
bad,"This company is frought with favoritism, the management is extremely unprofessional. Some rules apply to some people while others are free to do as the wish. One man got fired for taking and extra five MI item on his break in the heart of winter when it was below zero, while another consistently took two to three extra 30 minute breaks and worka there to this day."
bad,"Not enough training, Fun but Harsh environment. Force sometime to do over time."
bad,The worst managment  and lowest profesionalism to take descisions
bad,"I worked at odfl and went threw the driving program, at the time i was excited to be put on full time and learn a new trade, but wow odfl has maditory 70 hour work weeks and they do not pay over time util after 60 hours, i would go in at 5 am and not get off most days before 8 pm,,,,money is not everything,, these people will run you dry"
bad,"30 years ago OD was a great place to work but when JY passed away the heart of the company passed away!  The work load on some is very unfair.....some do the work load of three employees while others can’t do more than one thing at a time.  The managers are corrupt and issue false write ups.  They place the blame on the wrong employees (the workers even if the managers told the employee what to do)  They like to hire people that have a college diploma but have zero experience and let them take over.  There was always snakes there but they wasn’t poisonous. The snakes that are there now are the most venomous type ever!  They let these people run off the long time dedicated employees that genuinely care for the employees, their job and the company without question."
bad,"If your plan is to work on the dock, I would look elsewhere. You will work 5 ten hour days, and there is no overtime until you reach 60 hours, which will never happen. Because of the amount of time you spend at work, you won’t have time for anything else."
bad,"If you wish to be treated like you are child and don't deserve respect, if you wish your hours and safety to be screwed with just because they can, Then Old Dominion Milwaukee is the place for you!"
bad,"Good pay but 12 hours working shifts / 5 days a week. Old Dominion does not pay Over time. Bad work conditions, open dock. Poor management comunicación and, favoritism for some employees."
bad,If you enjoy working for A 5’3 Donald trump this is the place for you. Upper management will reign down nothing but negativity. You will get to see with your own eyes the emails sent to supervisors cussing dockmen or the supervisor himself. The hiring process is horrendous. If you have any ties to management go ahead and chalk yourself up as a superior. They will hire dock supervisors with no experience and proceed to keep retraining them 5-6 times throughout the first 3-5 years. The pay here will be the only thing worth looking forward to. Vacation is provided but must not be taken during a black out period (whole summer). You will be put on night shift working weekends as soon as your probation is over. Also you are provided a 30 min lunch while you work 10 hr shifts everyday.
bad,The company overall was a very stressful place to work favored employees family nepotism no advancement and no life work balance just a very terrible experience..
bad,No management for the drivers dispatchruns the show and no tm needed because he dose nuthingno questions asked favoritism and repercussions if you have a thought
bad,"This is an absolute terrible place to work. Management aren't even fit to shake fries, much less be in charge of a freight company. All they are interested in hiring are either brain-dead people, or yes men. If you are a good worker, you will likely be ""walked down the ramp"". Let this be a warning to potential employees. I'd seriously consider looking elsewhere. It's just not worth it."
bad,"When I started this company I felt I was a part of something good and it was somewhat enjoyable. However , these past few years have changed my view entirely. The management at this particular service center in Parsons, KS are the worst sorts of people you can imagine. They are able only to wield their two-edged sword of hypocrisy and inconsistency by the firm grip they have on the handle of lies and deceit. Constantly doing one thing and saying another, but expecting you not to notice.. and if you do notice, you had better not make it known. If you do you will be on the outs. The terminal manager here considers himself a deity of sorts, and if you want to make it here, you had better learn to do the same.. or at least pretend you do. "
bad,"As I stated in the title the only good thing is the pay, other than that there is nothing good about this company! They keep you long hours 12+ every day. They pretend to care about you like they're your friend but it is total B.S. they could care less. I would not recommend this job to anyone who enjoys having a life outside of work. If you want to work all the time and make good money then this is for you."
bad,I completely wasted the last 2 years of my life working there.  Management was extremely terrible and once you have taken a job within help desk or desktop support you will never be able to promote out and this is actually said to you when you interview outside of your job.  They claim it is because it takes to long to move someone to another job.  HR is awful and will do nothing to help you if you are not part of a certain group.  Work place bulling and harassment is rampant yet this is always over looked.  Management treats you as if your stupid and the moment you show your advanced skill set they treat you as if they don't want you working there.
bad,"The Dock work duties where OK and employees are helpful, now when it comes to management and Supervisors they don't care about the Dock workers they expect you to work when severally sick or if you're having a family emergency basically they are not understanding. They will fire you with no warnings, here DOCK workers are expandable."
bad,"My start-time could vary up to 6 hours daily.  Never knowing when you were going to start till the night before.  Equipment (tractor/trailer, pallet jacks, etc.) was in terrible condition.  Optical/dental insurance was awful.  Health insurance was mediocre at best.  They don't pay OT, and require you to work a minimal of 45 hours, most weeks much more.  Was not a driver friendly company..."
bad,"Only thing positive about Old Dominion is the pay is great.  The benefits are awful, the management is horrible.  They will fire you for anything if you don't agree with everything they want.  I was fired simply because I stood up for the drivers on policies that were unfair to them.  They didn't like it and instead of listening to the drivers and a supervisor that stood up for them, they fired that supervisor.  Not a good company to work for!!"
bad,Old Dominion was a great place to work as far as making money but you had to watch your back every single day and hope that you can get fired for production or taking the fall for somebody else's mistakes if you want to have a life outside of work forget about it because you're going to work 60 hours a week every single week and don't dare ask for a day off because if you ask for a day off you're going to have to actually work on your actual day off and better hope that you don't have a family emergency because they won't let you take care of it
bad,Hookingup to my trailers and doing my job.I had to learn all the things that i have on my own didnt get no help from the company.If managment didn't like you they would make your job the worst job to have to get you to quit or so they can firer you.Most of them were for themself.Working in the rain.Just getting my pay check every week.
bad,In a never ending search for better productivity and efficiencies. The management of this terminal chose to stay status quo. All operations can be tweaked to improve.
bad,It’s a great company but they are heavy on the favoritism. Lazy people move up faster then anyone. Office Manager sits in the office all day looking at her phone.
bad,If you working part time you have to have another income because you will not get hours like you think you will. If you can’t go full time it’s basically a waste of your time
bad,They played favorites with who got the easy loads and who got tough ones. They did the same with who had to stay 12+ hours and whocould go home after 8.
bad,"Very poor management and no overtime, they don't care about there employees and treat you like unfairly, makes you feel like your in a prison. Once they found out I was looking for another job they pushed me into quitting."
bad,Busy fast paced run run run you would have weight quotas n if you made quota you just keep pushin at end of day they would have postedall the time 1 more trailor befoere you can leave
bad,"Be prepared to work 12+ hours everyday. Most days with no breaks at all. Management doesn’t care, productive drivers are pushed to the max while others goof off. Doesn’t matter who does the work just as long as all pick ups and deliveries are made. "
bad,Unorganized and not all employees are treated equal. Management is totally lacking in equality. The hours are not easy and time off is treated unfairly.
bad,"There are some fishy things going on in Chesapeake, VA at ODFL.  DO not work for the container division.  Manager keeps creepy pictures of you and has a handicap that is almost impossible to deal with.  If you are a driver and complain to her boss she will be vindictive and punish you,   beware of working there.   Also they might cheat you out of your final pay"
bad,It's was a very physical job working in extreme cold weather and working with hazardous materials all kinds of different odors some bearable some not but besides all of that it was a excellent paying job and a good learning experience
bad,I work at the white pine tn dock for a year done my job showed up for work on time an never complain about anything run there little production bs an nothing that you do is never good enough for them an your section supervisor will throw you under the bus to make themselves look good an they are pencil happy bad they write you up over dumb stuff. There is a big difference between white pine dock an everywhere else they need to clean house over there for they employees walk out...
bad,"When you are interviewed and hired, they always tell you the companies philosophy is ""we treat you like family"". That is the furthest thing from the truth. Nothing but lies."
bad,"Manager was horrible. The hours were very unpredictable, one week it could be 30hrs the next it could be 60. They also wouldn’t hover overtime pay unless you went over 60hrs"
bad,"If you are a mechanic RUN! DO NOT work in the shop! TONS of  cronyism, drama, lies, lies and more lies! They have one idiot who googles how to work on the trucks! He has more tattoos then brains! The shop manager hired a brother and sister who showed up with nothing! No tools, no toolboxes and no experience! RUN RUN RUN far far away form that clown infested place."
bad,No room for advancement only does for themselves will replace any anytime for any reason. Lots of damage to freight.undependable promises never kept .also no breaks allowed
bad,For a company that started out as a family business it’s not family oriented. The hard workers get screwed and the lazy ones get catered to. Not much of a home life.
bad,"Warning if you are thinking of working for this company here some advice.No overtime,work 12 just about every day when it can be done in 10 ish hrs.They strive to keep you there to gamble with your family life.Dispatchers are a joke haven’t ever drove trucks.Manager has no back bone and will lie to you.Look down and around won’t ever look into your eyes.Everyone else in management does his job to make his easier.Mechanic’s can’t get pay when there suppose to cause he doesn’t know how to enter job in computer to submit to corporate.Stealing from company in my eyes.Assistant manager no better harassed employees  and always feeling like a big man writing up employees for anything and everything he can come up with.Saw 6 employees canned 1dick supervisor and 5 drivers for various medical issues.If your not back in 6 months your gone and will receive a letter cut you off the insurance.All of these men where wanting to return to work.Now if that’s not dirty then what is?Have talk with previous employees from other terminals that have worked with company will tell you the same just ask around.They got there picks of employees which is not the right choice to be in management.Management is never wrong when they are they lie like he!!"
bad,Horrible management but good pay we all have to work on one of the week end days for 10 or 12 hours so not much life outside of work but at least 48 hours is a good check but management does not listen to us when we have a good idea on how to be more productive
bad,If you just got your license it's a good place to start but after you get your experience get another job so you don't died miserably. Manager and supervisor are horrible.
bad,Very stressful places to work for. They wil terminated you cor any little mistake you do. They dont even explain eant you did wrong they will just let you go in a heartbeat. Even if you killed yourself working for them they dont care about you. Management very unprofessional in terminating drivers.
bad,the job required hard work over very long hours with little to time for breaks.. there was very little time for home life wife and children.. the management was very demanding and almost seemed inhuman
bad,"Only corporate office might be family oriented because orders come from the top orders rolls down hill supervisors are always to Blame for someone else mistakes  "
bad,Management at this facility is so far out of touch with the dock it's sad. Pay is great and the benefits are too. The other dock workers are a great group of people to work with. But all that still doesn't make up for how horrible the upper management is.
bad,Only company ever work for that can't give you schedule start time except on Mondays.Terminal manager relies on everyone in management under him to do his job.Good ol boy system and they have there favorites.Terminal has no cut off time for pick ups.That there fore holds up the whole system on both side p&d and line haul.Assiantant terminal shouldn't even be in management most of them in office acts like little kids.Beats all I've ever seen.
bad,"They don't know what they doing been there for over two year n my start time still isn't early enough, freight come out late so every day we got to leave late with a lot of deliveries"
bad,Very demanding job. the pay is awesome but this job makes you realize money isn't everything. The upper management is bad to play the favorites game. you can be the best worker in the building and they will pass you up every time for someone they like. Nothing is ever good enough for this company.
bad,To much micro managing. To many leads/supervisors that don’t know there jobs. Very dirty work environment. People will tell on you to further their careers.
bad,The job was great but the management is dictated . I enjoy the job type and working with and for many different customers on all different parts of the state. I enjoy being in different towns every day of the week. Seeing different products. Most dispatchers were good to work with. I enjoyed the job but not the management.
bad,"I started off working part time for two years, would work 59.75 hours because after 60 hours they pay overtime they work you like a dog and don't want to pay any overtime unless you're in with management. I started working there as a dock worker worked my way up to City supervisor and because the amount of hours they wanted me to work salary was way more than 16 and I was only getting paid for 50 period so I stepped down back to a dock worker and transferred to another terminal where my hours went down to 25 to 30 it just got to the point that it wasn't worth the aggravation anymore period distressed took its toll on my life on my marriage and my relationship with my kids and I said something that I'll never go back to again. Be very careful working for this company especially in the Atlanta area they have dock worker and supervisor positions posted about weekly period my five and a half years working there you couldn't really get to know anybody because it was always new faces and all the good hard-working reliable people would get fired for the most Petty things period but it's good to know that some of the bad managers got what was coming to them and they all got fired period but for some reason they still can't get it together. Yes to pay is amazing but be prepared to work weekends and holidays and have no family time."
bad,The pay was ok more concerned about their selves than the people who come and do their best. Don't apply for this company. Monitor your breaks they follow you don't give their employees a break.
bad,would not want to work for this company ever mgr is racist!! they don't not treat you right theres a lot of favoritism. they over work you and don't let you have a dayoff when you want too only when they want too.
bad,they want to many hours and expect to much out og you on the first day if you had no experience in logistics they did no do much in the way of helping you out
bad,"Job wasnt bad, fast paced sometimes usually around 9pm expect to work until 3-4 in the morning during peak and until 10-11 during slow season. Favoritism is big and if you want to move up you'll have to kiss managers butt. Make sure to try and negotiate your wage or else you will be low balled."
bad,This place Richland ms (JCK let friends work before you. Supervise bring there friends in an give dem all the work You can advance at this job the good O boy system drop the mic I’ll never go back and look at the building!!!!
bad,It was pretty cool until u make a mistake a they will get rid of you quickly. Everyone is respectful and laid back but like I said dont make a mistake
bad,"Don’t like say something, wasting my time in this company, not recommended people work in this place, unsecured, nasty, poor management. That’s all can say of this company"
bad,Crooked and corrupt. You will be framed for misloads if someone doesn't like you. They will pay you less starteing wages than others with the same title and lie to you about it.
bad,The management team not right at all. They make up rules as they go an buddy system is totally out of control. People are afraid of reporting anyone because it comes with repercussions. They put people on final for any reason instead of fixing the problem to gain trust of the employees. It's like there running a slave factory
bad,"Great company,  run by horrible people.  They are spiteful,  any chance they will get to get back at you for anything you do that its not ok with them (dispatchers) they will get you, trust me.The big guy has completelly lost contact with his drivers,  all he cares are perdonal accolades from this point on.And favoritism its at its highest,  some drivers get away with anything (if you are a management drink buddy).They have lost that huma  feeling,  I understand work has to be done,  but have and threat your drivers with some respect."
bad,"A place where the vast majority of drivers and dockmen are great people and great to work along side.  Unfortunately, upper mgmt creates an environment of false trust by getting employees to trust them and confide in them, but that information will be documented in employee files and used against employees when deemed needed.  They are good at these tactics.  Mgmt cares for you only as long as you are on their side.  This facility has so much potential, but lacks genuine leadership.  Again, overall the backbone of the facility is the people and the people (dockmen and drivers) keep the facility running smoothly."
bad,"OD2.NO! This place could be a great place to work and have some sort of career,BUT! Management is all about which terminal or city looks the best on paper. So in turn they treat their employees like trash and think it's acceptable because your getting paid $20 some an hour. You work a minimum of ten hours a day but they get mad if you won't work eleven or twelve. Super high turnover rate so they are pro at hiring you and pumping footballs up your rear telling you how good it is to work there and how you won't find any other jobs to pay better. Btw first shift is off limits for 5 years until you build seniority. Never see family and your weekend may be mid week. You definitely earn your money there it's hard work. People like me who went above and beyond strapping freight down and preventing claims it doesn't matter they still hate you. 60 men on the dock and most are egotistical aholes. Don't fall for their pitch and work elsewhere!"
bad,"A bad manager can take a good staff and destroy it, causing the best employee to flee and the remainder to lose all motivation. "
bad,Don't care about home time they just want you to get their freight delivered on time.You don't have a personal life work work is all they want out of you.
bad,It was ok the boss was ok to get along with wish they didn't let me go if u like to drive truck it's a good company loved my co workers
bad,They will find a way to get rid of you. Not a great place to have a career.management will find a way to get rid of you after you have been there for a while.
bad,Dispatchers rude. No opportunity for advancement. Overworked underpaid. Company won't pay overtime but will have a meeting to brag about profit. Sucks!!
bad,"This place has really good and competitive pay, the benefits are so so but the management and supervisors are some of the meanest people that you could work for. They dont support your decisions, they chastise you for making your own decisions, they WILL fire you for any reason they can find whether it be a big reason or small and give you no notice, except be called into the office only to be told you are being let go. If you get hired from day one you will have a target on your back."
bad,"Overall was an okay experience but I wouldn't consider doing it for long, considering they rarely offer full-time positions and expect you to do 10+ hours a day as a part timer."
bad,Employed managers that were not truthful with higher management about employee work ethics and with discriminatory placement attitudes.  Choose Caucasian worker over others to promote while passing over other qualified employees.
bad,"Been here since OD was the laughing stock of the LTL genre. They have grown to where they are by employing quality, and giving incentives to those that produce to a higher standard...in the past!! "
bad,"I worked as a o/b supervisor at the Richland, MS company and upper management lacks responsibility and knowledge of freight honestly, I would not go back for nothing in the world."
bad,Isn't a bad place to work but mamagmemt doesn't care about you. If you have a family you will barely see them. I do not recommend working for this company
bad,Poor Management. Bad human Human resources.  Communication with the office. Dealing with corporate office when needed professional assistance was not helpful either.
bad,"will work with an intimidating management team. Constant threats to your job. unrealistic expectations. If you arent part of ""the club"" then you will be gone!"
bad,Good Company’s can have poor local management. In freight your manager can help or ruin your career. Important to find that balance. You can be their best friend or their target. Dictatorship is still much alive in current culture and in larger corporations often encouraged. Options are to speak loudly or stay quiet. Only of those will keep people employed in this location.
bad,terrible management-very condescending and arrogant while the work load is very unsteady. management has been known to nickel and dime customers which in turn lose the customers causing lack of work.
bad,Would not recommend a them for work. Bad upper management. Not a family atmosphere. Upper management did not support lower management.  I worked there for 12 years. Did not feel apart of the company.
bad,Ok to work there i started as a os&d clerk then as a dock worker i moved upto driiving last year still working there as a driver but need something else.
bad,"Horrible management, the people there are back stabbers and will try at anything to get you in trouble, it's like a big game to them. If you like micro management this is the place for you."
bad,"Was hired on. Did 2 days of training and was told that they didn't have work for me. Better off going to Dayton, R+L Carriers or Estes.I wouldn't recommend working for this company to anyone. Just keep in mind if you choose to do so. Just remember that you were warned."
bad,Work was very stressful. Have a solid good boy system in place. If one person of importance decided they dont like you for any reason then it makes life really hard on you. Going in to work everyday stressing whether or not you are gonna get sent home and lose your job over minor micromanaging issues. The pay and benefits are very good. But can be very unsettling always worrying. Your main focus is on trying to not get fired instead of doing your job.
bad,Management in the IT department is very shady. The managers are very much out to blame their team on project delays rather than their own mismanagement. Constant changes in department policies are resulting in a higher turnover. IT team members are stressed and have low morale as benefits are being changed between teams.
bad,"Have been employed with this company for six-plus years.  When we received a new terminal manager, the culture changed.  We now work 15 hours more a week on average (not an option).  The morale is very low,, and the managment is detatched from this reality."
bad,"They are growing faster than they can accompany the work. Indy is crazy as of late 2014. 108 guys can be on a lift at the same time running in an area much smaller than most warehouses. They will promote just about any dip stick as long as they brown nose and show up everyday despite their incompetence and unprofessionalism. The work environment is brutal. There are no pull down doors on the building so wind, rain, sleet, and snow blow right inside. The summers are hot hot and the winters are absolutely freezing and extremely harsh. Every thing is filthy and most of the guys out there have bad attitudes and some with anger problems. Upper management treats you horribly and the management to employee ratio is way off so don't expect to get individual attention or assistance. They don't provide you with anything for the job. Everything is buy your own including dock hooks, safety glasses, steel toes, gloves, etc you name it. The list goes on... The only thing good about this place was the pay check, but don't expect the money you make here to fall on your lap. You have to deal with a lot and work a lot."
bad,Loading trucks. I met some hardworking people. the hardest part of the job was dealing with the elements on the docks at midnight and 2am in the winter. the best part of the job is I had an opportunity to leave that department and train for a CDL license. the most enjoyable part of the job? Loading trailers.
bad,If you want a good paying job for about 6 months before they find a reason to let you go then this is the place for you.
bad,"Working here was tough. The hours were not appealing ( early am )."
bad,The pay is good and benefits aren't bad. The company is a good all around but avoid this location the Manager and dispatch is horrible and all friends so nothing will ever change. The couple of good supervisors have all given up and don't seem to care anymore.
bad,"Higher management is extremely difficult to work with. Moody and controlling is the words I would like to use.  OD has a lot of very capable and worthy employees out there but the constant nagging, constant mood swings of some individuals are completely out of control.  Praise is not given where Praise is due to  outstanding employees that show up every single day and do their work as efficient as possible.  There is a lot of back stabbing and bitterness that filters out there and that is really sad considering I truly believe that OD as a whole is a great place to work.  Yes I am extremely frustrated at how some things are done and handled, I think the Parsons site could be far more productive and less turn over if the management in these departments, from the front office to the back end were held accountable more so for their actions and start listening to your employees."
bad,"linehaul driver "
bad,"...but maybe worse. Management is only concerned with numbers. If your's aren't good they are all over it, even if you are just having a bad day. They haven't done the job you will be doing in many years if ever, but will criticize what you do it at every opportunity. If you are ok with flying below the radar, putting up with constant bureaucratic management idiocy and working bizarre shifts, its not a bad job."
bad,"Each individual departments management is given too much power instead of having across the board company rules for all to go by. This causes favoritism among the Directors and Managers and if you are not one of their favorites, they can dictate different rules toward you than they do for others. In other words, you may not have the same benefits and privileges as the person working right next to you and HR won't change it. If you file a complaint with HR about being singled out, then it won't be long before you are terminated."
bad,The attitude and culture of the senior management is one of the best. They seem to generally care about the company and its goals. The problem with ODFL is the senior management ideals are not communicated or conveyed appropriately to the field and operations. You are held to a very strict standard in the LTL industry with respect to your work  schedule/expectations and micromanaged regularly.   You simply can’t have operations personnel managing the sales force.
bad,"Terminal manager was insulting, verbally abusive.  "
bad,Dock manager targets employees. Gives false written write ups. Will lie to your face to protect the company. Has a line of wrongful terminations. Don’t recommend this job to anyone.
bad,"Each service center is ran like an individual company.  In my opinion the most important thing corporate office cares about is the operating ratio, bottom line numbers, and attendance.  Moral, working conditions, personal issues, and several other issues go unnoticed. The largest service center requires the workers to work 55+ hours without overtime and made to come in on an extra day.  Attention has been sent to the manager, human resources, and regional VP by numerous current (and past) employees without any response.  Hourly pay is very good but would advise not to go into a salaried position with ODFL as the people you supervise will be at a higher pay rate.  Hardest part has to be the constant pressure faced in making all the goals and amount of tonnage.  ODFL will help get your CDL's if wanted."
bad,"Load and unload trucks, while learning driver routes,and solving load problems. Also there are times we cross load to pic up more freight. Also decided which routes would be faster for on time delivery."
bad,"Pros: Start at $20/hour, Really cheap and well covered insurance (if single), a few discounts at other places just for working there.  Saturdays off."
bad,lofty expectations.  doing the job of a manager and supervisor simultaneously was tasking.  management couldn't understand why managerial duties were slipping but expected to not miss a beat operationally.  being pulled in many different directions
bad,Poor management. Poor work environment for female truck drivers. Biggest over paid kindergartens I’ve every seen. Stay away from Wichita terminal male or female.
bad,The BP manager on Old Dominion container division don't have any idea how to defend his workers. he don't think. bad management lacking on communication he is a last minute decision maker.
bad,"Good company as far as benefits, but local branch is run poorly.  The company is very big into volunteering and philanthropic events, but it is not supported at the local terminal.  There is no cohesiveness, departments are not encouraged to work together, it seems management enjoys bickering between departments.  The blame game is strong at this terminal.  Management has a hard time admitting any mistakes, and generally gets rid of employees that challenge their decisions.  The company encourages an ""open door"" policy, but when employees contact corporate for issues, they are punished."
bad,Terminal managers have too much power and don’t care for employees. If you want a good paying job that doesn’t have desirable managers this is a good place to work.
bad,"Stressful working environment and poor management. This is a good company to work for, however the Oakland California facility lacks the management necessary to make this a good place to work. No one has any idea what they are doing and the same mistakes are consistently repeated."
bad,"No steady structure in work procedures.  Procedures changed on a daily basis there . Not a family oriented company anymore.  Very micro managed. Management is poor and they have no people skills.  If an issue arises, things are either swept under the rug or you are written up without them hearing your side of story. Management does not want to hear anything, They will not back you up. Whatever corporate office say's goes, then you are out the door."
bad,I worked at OD for almost One year had two written commendations and was considered a good employee from all upper management. I got one write up after being there for seven months with out one for excessive breaks which EVERYBODY DOES well that write up was considered my finale write up so months later I told my supervisor how some other supervisors wasn't doing their job the way the should and things needed to be fixed then weeks later I get fired for an unauthorized break which all I did was step outside to cool off no different then other employees but yet I was the one being watched and loss my job . I have heard they have fired more people . its not a great company to move up in when they are being shady to just get people out .
bad,Your child hood past determines weather or not you eligible for employment at this company.......sad company
bad,ODFL was a good company with great business management.  The IT group was micro-managed and gave the impression that the employees were not trusted to do their jobs.
bad,"Typical dock work, loading and unloading freight."
bad,I met alot of new people learned alot ways to load a trailer. Management needs work. It's a fast pace job so your always on the go time goes by fast when your working.
bad,"This place was too good to be true. Pay way better than any of the same starting out and quick advancement and large raises. Lots of training. Good benefits. However. The manager was hired on a little while before I was. He had zero management skills and tried to play policy games only when he saw fit. He would turn his head at many things against policy and ultimately fired me with no warning over these policies. Policies that are not written anywhere for me to review. Policies that aren't just given out for everyone to reference. The manager won't own up to any of his mistakes and tries to point fingers rather than addressing the issue professionally. Never any positive feedback, only criticizing how you need to do more and telling you he could have done it in half the time (He says this to everyone). Shop morale was great besides one person and the manager. Awesome parts coordinator. Great team effort most of the time. Drivers were pretty nice and easy to deal with when you had drive up work. All I can really say is, if there is an issue addressed with an employee, the higher up management should see both sides of the story. Which they don't. This job has so much potential. But they wreck it with poor management skills."
good,"Management, supervisors, and dispatch are lazy, and they all pass the buck down the line. The terminal manager is incompetent. There is no leadership. Everything is put on the driver. There are no clear duties in your job description, and there is poor training. This leaves the door open for management to write you up for some offense that they can make up as they go along. There is favoritism, and retaliation if you try to speak up for yourself, or address issues with management. If you don't mind being talked to any kind of way by incompetents, this is your place."
good,this was a gd place to work. The hours is what really hurt people. They didn't owes stay busy. I drove about a hour to go to this job. The biggest thing was to go there and work a hour a go back home.
good,If u apply in Chicago.....don't. The terminal manager is a jerk. There is beyond favoritism there. If u are a supervisor with real dock experience dont apply because they micro manager there.
good,"Allways felt like walking on egg shells read to crack. People hard to get along with. People always messing with other's stuff . Sop was fairly new ,that was one good thing. The night shift supervisor was good to work for, The shop manger wqs trash. Came in smelling like been on week drunk. Did'nt know from one day to next if he walked in and fire everybody."
good,"Great Company. Poor Management."
good,I work for Old Dominion for 13 years it was a fun experience for me made a lot of friends coworkers are pretty cool management is lacking except for a few overall experience was good but at times it can be very stressful to work there
good,"You are pretty much under the gun of what the drivers ""perception"" of you is. If there is one bad driver, that is enough to rally the troops against management to get you out. Pretty much have to do what the drivers say or they can call corp and complain. Enough calls and you are out."
good,"Not a bad place to work.  The pay is great even though there is no overtime pay.  The benefits are lacking and the work life balance is non-existent.  The supposedly recognize I believe 7 holidays, but you are still on call."
good,"It was challenging but paid well "
good,"No overtime pay unroll after 60 hrs, lack of communication/leadership. Uneven treatment. Lazy management. No set time to leave. No choice on when you leave, not flexible"
good,"The people that you work with are for the most part great, but management seems very removed from reality. They are very difficult to work for. The executives on the other hand are very pleasant and visible."
good,"They push family atmosphere, was when I first started and as the company grew, they forgot about the people who got them there and you just became a number"
good,"Some drivers had normal days, but all the other drivers had to pick up there slack."
good,"Job is focused solely on making productivity, not who you are as an individual. If management doesn't like you, you're gone. One Line haul Manager does all the work while the TM and ATM sit in their office all day believing all the gossiping to be true."
good,The management on the dock is very bias if you are not one of their favorites they will throw you under the bus and not care about it. They only look out who for who they want and will do anything to protect them.
good,I have learn in my about 12 yrs with the comp. that I can not advance to a new level with the experience that I have ranges from Business to Accountin
good,"decent job, pays well, management and work environment needs improving, would be a lot better without cliques and favorites, need to work with employees more"
good,"Uncertainty regarding start time, routes, equipment assigned along with ending time."
good,"Company is a very good trucking company and is one of the best in the industry.  They need to improve on their management and their employees benefits, pay and growth opportunities."
good,This was my first warehouse job this is were i learned the basics of my warehouse knowledge and began my forklift experience. My typical day was spent unloading and loading trailers by hand and with a forklift. This is were i really found the passion i have for working in warehouse and working of forklifts.
good,"not a bad place to work, mangers need more training so they can treat their people better"
good,"The MRT terminal force teams drivers. If you are looking to team then this is for you. The list to go solo is somewhere between 4-5 years."
good,Manager at Tulsa terminal stays in office 95% of time no interaction with employee’s.     When other supervisors were off on vacation he couldn’t do their job .
good,"When I was first hired  they treated me like a  superhero. Poor kiss butt management system. They don’t like people with opinions. Decent Benefits. Definitely a solid non union model: employees are always walking around on eggshells in fear of their job. Pay is fair. Seniority in Kansas City is a joke. "
good,"Management in the edwardsville maintenance shop is not good. Untrustworthy, not knowledgeable, plays favorites and hires people’s family who have no experience. The shop manager literally hired this guys kids who showed up with no tools, no tool box or experience. Lots of favoritism and cronyism. Don’t waste your time coming here, believe me it’s not worth it and I’m currently looking for a new job."
good,Company talked a good game about the balance of work and home life but did not live up to it. Very poor management and work hours were terrible. Would not recommend working there if you have a family.
good,After 11 years of service with the company i failed to self certify the D.O.T. medical card in a timely manner.  My employment was terminated.  Do everything by the book or else you will receive the same fate! You're just a number.  Good luck
good,"Got into accident. T boned by another vehicle and rolled over. Was injured from head to toe,out of work for 2 1/2 years . Got cleared from doctors to go back to work. Workers compensation won't let me. Because I was a liability... now I got to search for another job and start all over."
good,Nothing to say about it. While on the dock I succeeded in job advancement. I took a position that lead me to getting laid off because the company had no need for my position anymore. You'd figure if you generate the company close to a half million dollars a year that the position would be needed but i guess not!
good,"Initially when I accepted this position, I was supposed to be in Truckload Dispatch. Instead I have been added in customer service. A typical day is answeing phone line, accepting orders from customers via phone or email and entering load in system, Keeping a professional upbeat personality when helping customers whom are irate or helping to find a solution."
good,Just the paid. Manager is bad. They are racist company they don't move Africa American people who have the experience to be in position. They pick at people they don't like.
good,"Decent pay , no growth opportunities"
good,The immediate management doesn’t care about the employees that are trying to advance. They only want yes men that won’t question anything and are willing to overlook minor things.
good,This place. OSH terminal. Preach work/life balance until you need time for life. All things are based off of seniority and not merit but management will forego the seniority list when advantageous to them. Routing could be better done by a blind monkey with a crayon. Dispatch is not far behind. I will say the pay is good but they just switched to PTO but you cannot take anything but full days so it was a pointless switch for drivers. Benefits are alright.
good,Des plaines management not so great communication what was need work environment was ok not the best just dont have accident and you will do fine. Safety manger joke.
good,job was ok just not enough stability sometimes I would walk in to start my shift and they would say we don't need you today so you could go home it would have been nice to get a call letting me know.
good,"Great place just not the right fit for myself. Very fast paced. Not at all a comfortable atmosphere, for myself. Others that I worked with were in the field for a while and thrived. I just did not see myself making this a career."
good,Handle any problems that surface from the dock personnel and drivers.  Make sure all bill of ladings and delivery receipts are properly signed and completed by customers and drivers.  The hardest part of the job is working nights but the most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the dock personnel and drivers.
good,I was with OD for 18 years and most of that time was great but as the saying goes one bad apple can destroy the whole bunch. The last person I worked for treated us like children even though we were all managers and most had more experience than he did
good,"Nice co-workers, long drive to work daily. Enjoyed what I did however, they would promise you advancement and never follow through with things, the insurance went up."
good,"Always enjoyed working with people and growing revenue - making new friends with customers and watching the territory grow."
good,"Dark & early 4 AM starts were a thing to get used to, but I learned to appreciate this because my days ended at noon, at the latest. After everyone (4 of us) arrived, our supervisor handed us our manifests that told us which trailers were ours to unload & away we went to our forklifts to start working. On some trailers, as we pulled more and more freight out, we would discover damaged and spilled loads either from the previous terminal ""passing the buck"", or from an improperly secured load. This wasn't a common incident, but it happened too often in my opinion. Problem solving skills were useful quite often; we had to use teamwork to level a crate or skid & the other had to pull in while it was level. After unloading the loads from the overnight drivers, we'd load the morning crew's trailers in order based on delivery. After everyone's trailer was loaded properly & ready to go, we'd be dismissed to go home."
good,No life work bal in this job no time to get to no people 1day home maybe two at most if you need anything you have to pay for it
good,One of the best freight runners in the company and I was released cause use of cell phone ... like cell phones are part of everyday life .... but pay is excellent... no work life balance sometimes 6 days 10 hour shifts ... no job security
good,"If you want great pay but, have a chance to be let go without notice it’s a place for everyone. When work is busy expect long hours and the don’t allow overtime, they make you leave before that happens. The benefits are awesome. Your fellow direct coworkers are what make the place. Management plays favoritism towards certain people at all levels of positions. If you’re the person that brown noses, you’re golden. You get steaks cooked for you every once in awhile."
good,"Generally a decent place to work until they lost 30 contracts, double driving force only for 1/2 to quit 6-10 months in. Manager K.L. is alright..wont bother you if you're working,  but wont fix problems either. Dispatch will skip u if they dont like you.  No one to tell the problems too. Fired old terminal man. So very cut throat, with brand new line haul building"
good,was a difficult place to work. too many supervisors to do things their way every time supervisors changed. Not given a chance to improve as asked and no time to do it before getting written up again. I answered and directed phone lines more than 300 times a day.
good,"They took away work from home, forcing employees, contractors, and vendors to drive 30 minutes to 2 hours to and from work five days a week. Like any place of work some are very happy there and other people are not. You will learn a lot given that most employees wear several hats."
good,You basically had to know someone to get promoted within this company.  Their philosophy was writing people up to where my belief is you get better response  from verbal interdiction first.  Why take the time to train someone the proper way then terminate them.  It is a waste of time and money
good,Fast paced environment. Work very long hours. The pay is exceptional but the work is unbearable. They are managed horribly but the team of docl workers help the shift go by.
good,You are required to show up and work hard. They are constantly not happy with your performance even in you are doing a great job. Supervisors will throw you under the bus if they feel it can approve their work place security.
good,It was a learning experience i learned alot there never take a easy job for granted cause at Old Dominion you really earned your Dollars. But the pay was good starting at 18.00 a hour.
good,"day consists of 12-14 hour days,  learned how I don't want to be treated.  Management is afraid of political correctness, environment is very juvenile.  Most enjoyable part of this job is every time you leave the building."
good,"Good equipment, benefits are fair, most equipment is well maintained, steady work, uniforms provided good 401k match, simple to use electronic log, positive customer review"
good,This is a very busy company. I learned a lot about customer service. Management at the location I worked for needs adjustments. The workplace is overall okay. The hardest part of the job is dealing with poor management. The most enjoyable part of that job was the yearly pay raises.
good,"Constance and steady work, great group of people. The great thing that I learned at Old Dominion was when I became a Lead. I learned so much when I got the position, the part I enjoyed the most was helping others learn the task in hand"
good,I was an OTR driver who didn't get a second chance. After 2 NON-DOT incidents I was terminated. If I had destroyed One of their tractor and trailers I could have understood a termination on the spot. I never damaged one single piece of equipment O.D owned ...Safety people do not care if you work there or not. When you get terminated good luck finding another job; they will run you in the ground and try to throw you under the bus...
good,"It was a good paying job ,but no job security , and the breaks we're too short for the long drives . Also the equipment would fail and would take too long to get back in service."
good,"This position requires multi-tasking abilities, physical stamina, and detailed focused abilities in a noisy and fast-paced environment. You will become familiar with the freight industry, especially as it pertains to the actual dock activities. This position requires a lot of walking in a somewhat dangerous atmosphere and the ability to communicate in a clear and concise and friendly manner as there are multiple interruptions to your work load. The employees at this terminal work very hard and are enjoyable to be around."
good,Don’t work at the Indianapolis terminal. You’ll get paid very well but it’s only a matter of time before they try to build up a case to have you fired . No job security at all .
good,"Every terminal is different. For the Seattle location I would not recommend working for the office. I experienced bullying and harassment from peers. The office is very “clicky”. Often micro-managed. Favoritism: They treat every employee differently, “situational based”. My first year of employment was decent, however in the last year, there has been a high turn over rate due to employees being fired or quitting due to the toxic environment. Pay is reasonable, but not worth the drama."
good,"Good spot to work at for new Forklift Operators, this company been the most patient and forgiving when it comes to lots of mistakes being made. But communication is really awful at times when backed up with freight. Management is only fair to those they really like. So my advice, just stay on their good side, come there to work and leave. That’s it. The raise happens often and is better than your avergae job. I’d say it’s worth it if you don’t mind all the stress."
good,"Great experience, good people their to work with. Communication between supervisor and work related work load get misaligned at times do to technical hard wear such as I pads not working. Other then that wish over time was allowed.  Over time is only considered after 60 + work hrs are reached"
good,"arrive at work and put your stuff in the truck that you would need for the day/night operations. then do your pre trip of your tractor. then I would wipe out the interior to make sure it was clean ,because previous drivers had a very bad demeaner on housekeeping of such vehicle .then I would clean the outside mirrors and then the windshield inside and out . And then go to the office to see if my loads were ready to be dispatch. And if they were not ready ,I would go to the break room and sit down at the table and wait, when the dispatcher would call you then you could get ready to leave,  for your run out and back."
good,Good Ol boy network.  No opportunity to advance.  Don’t hire from within. Never compensated for going above and beyond.  People are placed in jobs that shouldn’t be (no experience) because of the good ol boy network.
good,too many drivers not enough freight poor management everyone wants to lead with no plan you never know what time you have to be at work until you clock out
good,"the days/ nights are long. you will get recognized and are able to advance, but then you are scrutinized to the max. they get rid of the wrong people for the wrong reasons, and no one there in management will give you a straight answer or care for you; but the pay is good for what you have to do. the majority of the dock workers there would not be able to work at McDonald's for the most part, or should work there instead."
good,"This company offers a truck driver program from the dockto drive.  It's a joke, I went thru it a couple months ago and work the dock most of the time."
good,You get paid good and receive good benefits but you work constantly. You know a day in advance what time you would start the next day. You could start anywhere between 11pm to 9 am.
good,"very cool faced pace to work with great pay co workers are very nice , but the management was very two faced and non understanding of what the reality of everyday on the job can be they expect a certain number of things moved by yourself weather it be 1 5 lbs box or 800 tires those loads were counted the same way , so management had thoughts of your production very low if you just so happened to get the trailer that was all messed up ""kind of the luck of the draw "" Literally"
good,Pay is horrible management is nice though. Not much room for growth with in a reasonable amount of time
good,"Was actually recruited from USF Bestway to travel throughout assigned territory to call on regular and prospection clients in securing business.  Did very well in first year of securing new business, enough so that I was able to meet sales quota and bonus.  Second year I was not so successful.  Was terminated for not meeting new sales projections."
good,management talks to employees like they're absolute trash no respect. ALWAYS IN FEAR OF LOOSING YOUR JOB. they threat your job like its nothing and will replace you that day they dont care you are a number to them. they dont hire you in so that they dont have to give you the benefits
good,"Worked in a high pace environment where my skills were put to the best use. Lifting heavy objects, operated forklifts, palletized and broke down boxes and items. I have learned to work very well under pressure. I have also learned to build thick skin. Be a team leader and work well with others. Manage and maintain clean facility. Co workers were difficult to work with in the beginning. Most enjoyable was the company barbecues and benefits."
good,I truly like and respect each and everyone of the management personnel. I have been treated more than fair by everyone there. I get along great with my co-workers. We have a great since of accomplishment at the end of every work day.
good,"The guys I work with are great. Management rarely addresses concerns. While there are several shifts to choose from when bids come up, none of them are family oriented."
good,"I normally worked anywhere from 12 to 14 hours a day which left no time for my family and I'm a single father with custody of my son.I learned about the freight business and about working in the operations side of the business instead of the delivery side.Most of my time with this company I liked the management but towards the end our new manager(who had no management experience) was coming in late and leaving early but expected us to work all day and half the night and offered no help whatsoever as our previous manager had.Overall I got along great with my co-workers,as with any job you have your people that don't want to do their fair share,but overall it was a good relationship.The hardest part of this job was never knowing how long you were going to have to be at work or what time you were going to get off.You literally could never make any kind of plans unless you were on vacation so there is no time for a family.I really enjoyed getting to know our customers and taking care of them,I loved the customer service part of the job."
good,Working here was a great experience for me and to help me get my career started.
good,"My kinda work, although I do wish the job security would have been better"
good,Interview process was easy and laid back. Management for the most part was great. Hardest part of the job is the extreme fast pace. The most enjoyable part of the job was the friendly and helpful co-workers.
good,not for eveybody have to deal with peoples issues and very straining with weather all year round and very easy to get sick unless clothed properly with what is needed
good,Productive and fun place with family atmosphere. The company hires from within which creates a sense of self worth and admiration. The company provides a platform that challenges as well as creates a foundation to build upon.
good,"Very demanding job, 10 hour shifts. Upper management is very well trained. First line supervisors need more training. Great compensation and benefits."
good,Old Dominion is a good place to work for the hourly staff. Management if very loose and policies are different in every location. A lack of discipline creates a difficult situation for middle management.
good,"Workplace culture is alright, management needs some additional training on how to interact with their employees.  Typical work day is non-stop processing of AP invoices."
good,"If you are new to driving I would recommend a job with the pension and union. "
good,"Ok Place to work. "
good,"hard work and dedication gets you nothing. brown nosing gets you promoted.long hours,work load not equally assigned..................................."
good,Old Dominion is really a great place to work but not at this location. The management team has their favorites and they don’t hide it. They let the Drivers do whatever they want.  Dispatch is unorganized.  Managers/supervisors are lazy .
good,Overall great paying job but you have to watch you back with the cut throat management. Coworkers were cool pay was great. Keep to your own and stay off the radar and should be alright.
good,Treated you like family if you needed anything they would try and help you out anyway they could and everyday before the shift started we have a meeting sayin safety first and becareful
good,"Decent salary, long hours and poor upper management. The hardest part about this job is trying to keep your supervisors happy, as they will write you up for just about anything."
good,A large corporate company where the people in the office or lower on the pedestal were not treated with as much respect as I feel should have been.  Raises were not based on performance.  Everyone got the same yearly raise. Nor where you given any incentive.
good,"Good overall place ,hours of operations not the best but manageable. Great inhouse promotions great benefits and great people working there driving classes offer for employees."
good,"My position as Line Haul dispatcher, was a 7 days on, 7 days off schedule. Very fast paced. Enjoyed the drivers that I worked with. Over all loved my job, and schedule."
good,"Old Dominion is a growing company that is actively hiring for drivers and dockworkers. While OD claims to be a family-oriented company, upper management is not visible and manages from afar."
good,"The job was very demanding, which most companies are!! I worked for the company for 3 yrs . You never knew what the day was gunna bring due to the type of freight u had to handle!!!"
good,Meeting quota is one of the hardest parts of the job if you are a detailed oriented person as I am.  You feel rushed and pushed to hurry up and do things that I feel like you should take your time doing.
good,"Old Dominion Freight Lines is a good place to work. The other employees are great to work with as well. I will say that the environment is stressful due to the fast-paced culture. The drawback of the company is that management doesn't care about the employee, per se, but rather about the numbers and results they produce."
good,Money is good but managers have favoritism new hires will get majority garbage loads cut hours and send home early locations are far if you have to travel far its not worth it.
good,"Old Dominion Freight Line was a good place to work. The freight gets slow in the winter months, which means you don't work many hours."
good,A typical day at work is life going through hard time trying to load trailers the right way. For what i have learned not much i have load trailer in the past.
good,The equipment was pretty good and truck assignment was not hard compared to most places. Dispatch is pretty fair and do not pick favorites.
good,"a typical day, show up find a decent forklift, trying to stand the heat, learn about new rules that they decided to come up with, co workers standable, management somewhat standable, hardest part of job would be showing up, most enjoyable part would be leaving."
good,"Freight line business."
good,typical evening would be loading and unloading trucks at a fast pace to make freight appointment and keeping your production up.
good,"Pay is great, management treats you like scum"
good,"Company is growing rapidly, a typical day is very fast paced with many employees to manage."
good,"ok place to work. I learned teamwork,managment were ok. Hardest part of the job was working on an open dock during incliment weather"
good,"It's a great industry to get into.  However, working in a brand new facility with brand new employees (including management) has many ups and downs.  Lots of trial and error, communication, and trust issues.  The most enjoyable part of the job is when there is a to-do list that I can pick one by one and run through them.  I like feeling productive.  I don't like never knowing what time you will get out.    "
good,I learned a lot about myself working for this company. Gain lots of knowledge in supervising large crews and made great relationships with my coworkers
good,"Every day holds new challenges, you never know from one day to the next if your going to have a job, so the job security is lacking, which leads to anxiety when there are people depending on your support."
good,Face paced work environment but with very tedious policies. Long hour days. Odd shift times. Decent employee benefits and employee appreciation days. Good pay.
good,"I can start by saying, you are there to work. Just like any other job... if you stay away from the drama and not make too many mistakes, then you will be fine. Worked at OD for just over 6 years now. It's had it's up and downs. Overall though this has been a fine company to work for."
good,Great company great pay work in cold and hot conditions long hours everyone conpete to be in the top five in productivity numbers everyday. A a a a aa
good,Dispatch management  horrible does not know how to talk to drivers   Disrespects drivers first company I work for that  corporate allows this to happen . They won’t let you move  One division to the other  That’s on the  Terminal Manager
good,Overall i would say its a pretty good company with good pay.  There can be delays at service centers and they do not pay delay time.  The trucks are governed at 65.
good,Job was great until I needed FMLA and was denied and wrongfully terminated. supervisor talked down to me because my start time was changed and he got upset when I became a driver and was told not to clock in until my scheduled start time.
good,Money is good but Dock managers are childish and two faced have favoritism new hires will get majority garbage loads cut hours and send home early . only get 30 minutes for break out of a 12 hours shift. Co worker's were very friendly and helpful some would talke all night and watch you work and have nothing said to them while others would would help each other. Managers would not come out of the shack only to take pictures of damages in the trailer. Very stressful job overall.
good,the job wasn't bad at all in my personal opinion.  main problem was the fact you had to pretty much sell your soul while working the dock. and management were very biased and showed a lot of favoritism.
good,"Full Time as a Dockworker is 60 hour weeks, Overtime is paid over 60 hrs. You are working out in the environment. Loading and unloading pallets of freight."
good,"I would use as much information provided to generate a freight plan for the next days deliveries - separating the freight into separate load for  zone destinations,Each load route had its own limits and restrictions to maximize the plan for delivery . The best way to  route was to be as efficient s possible . Threw the shift I would add trailers / freight to the plan as needed , based on due date freight"
good,OD is a growing company and is heading in the right direction. The worst part of the job is the four 12 hour days for supervisors. The idea behind what they are doing is right on.
good,"Compared to other LTL freight companies, ODFL shines above the rest. A lot of good people trying to do the best job for the customer."
good,Most of the people were great was able to learn the needs to make sure that all bases were cover to help the shop flow smoothly the sad thing was that there was little or no room for advancement and hard to get a pay increase or recognized for doing a good job or performance during my time there.
good,"This is a great company to work with, but at the time they kept hiring drivers, and didn’t have enough freight for all of the drivers to have sustainable work."
good,The job isnt hard the pay is amazing but most management often treats you just as a number and rarely cares to know you personally. They do offer good ammounts of paid time off though.
good,"I have been with Old Dominion for about 8 years now. Although I have had a good experience there and good relationships with other employees, I have started to seek other employment due to poor job advancement opportunities."
good,This was fast paced job and kept you on your toes. It was pretty easy cause all you had to do was load trucks. The management was ok just never got much feedback.
good,"Great bunch of guys to work with, great pay and hours, can be hectic but I liked the challenge. weekends off which is always good if you have a family."
good,Old Dominion was a fast paced work environment with something different going on everyday. The pay and benefits where a great compensation for the stress that the job came with.
good,Usually start out part time working the grave yard shift from 4pm to 4am. Constant moving as you do have to meet a bills moved per hour quota. You're told if you work hard there are many opportunities for advancement. The hardest part of the job is working 12 hours a day.  You don't get overtime until after 60 hours of work in a week rather than the usual 40. Some management is good but not all.
good,I would move boxes and other items with the forklift from different assigned destinations. Each day would consist of operating heavy machinery. This was a simple job for me because I enjoy working on a forklift.
good,Some positions seem to be understaffed in this company which frequently requires working past normal hours to fulfill your job obligations.
good,"Good place to work.  Good equipment.  However, when freight is slow they dismiss people right and left with possibility of never returning to work.  Have multitude of things that people can be fired for."
good,"I DO love my job, the customers, equipment and coworkers. The company itself is great. Communication sucks. People in the office, up to and including managers, don't relay messages to one another. Late start times and no real desire to get to the bottom of the problem. Seniority doesn't really mean anything as far as routes or trucks go. You could work your tail off, proving yourself a great employee, but all you're going to get back is more work and tighter deadlines. There is no such thing as merit raises, bonuses or overtime. You get paid the same as the slacker, no ifs ands or buts. If you want to move up, you have to do the job for ""free"" (you're doing the job of the supervisor AND driver for driver pay) and still may not get the job applied for. Asking for training is pointless. They always seem to have one excuse or another. Transfers are fairly easy, but all the terminals are ran COMPLETELY different. No REAL uniformity."
good,This is a job that doesn't require much intelligence. The management is horrible. They hire some of the worst people that make the good people look bad.
good,"Very busy everyday, learned a lot and moved around a lot. Liked everyone in management, got along with my co-workers. Doing 5 different things at one time was tuff. Time went really fast."
good,"Dispatch had some problems but overall it was a good place to work,"
good,I moved trucks around the yard to and  from the loading dock. I liked my co workers. The most enjoyable part of my job was the pay and steady hours. The hardest part was it almost got boring doing the exact same thing every single day.
good,"At this job a regular day consist of, loading and unloading trailers. Driving a forklift and moving pallets from bay to bay. This is a great job and pay well, but the only downside is the hours."
good,great company to work for. Corporate office is the best. They will go above and beyond to help. I mostly communicated with corporate payroll and HR
good,"I would go door to door and sell a product I would walk up and down the street in various towns to sell this product. I learned how to over come rejection and how to sell and how to close sales."
good,OD was a great job but they didnt allow me to work when I would call and ask them if I was needed. I have family that also works there and they would tell me if the dock was full and many nights they informed me that the dock was full but my manager will tell me that the freight was low.
good,"Old Dominion Freight Lines is the best place to work with, and the employees are the best workers out there. Its a nice place to work but the management are lacking."
good,"I loved working there but they don’t let you leave when they say it’s time to go they disregard the fact that your family comes first, also they choose a lot of favoritism in this company"
good,It’s ok to work with Old Dominion Freight Line. They offer a great 401k plan and celebrates an entire week of employee appreciation. Also gets a paid day of your choice for your birthday
good,Odfl is a great place to work at if you're willing to work 50 plus hours a week. The wages are good  but no overtime is allowed. Overall is a good place.
good,"Typically, as a supervisor at Old Dominion, I was responsible for checking the inventory in my area when I arrived and when I left. During the rest of the shift I was responsible for closing trailers to make service times, ensuring safety from all employees, and making sure our claims prevention tools were being used properly. "
good,"A typical work day was for me was what else was management going to come up with today, I was stressing everyday before work and wondering  if I should come in or call out. They hired a new manager and things went down hill from there. Two people quit because of that plus me, I tried to ride out this wave of change, I tried to communicate with management, would go unheard. you bring up a idea on how to improve efficiency and management would tell you what you are doing wrong and just beat you down. They would use seniority when they see fit. There training program was really good, they want you to train, so you can get good and proficient at your job and I took advantage of that. The more training you do and level up, the more money you make. the hardest part of my job was to try to get trucks done while you have to help other techs with there trucks also because they were inexperienced you have to meet a quota of trucks or tailers, so much questions were asked that were common sense or you can look it up online and trying to stay below the management radar. I was also told when I went to the highest tech level , that I needed to not take many days off. Family comes before work."
good,"I worked at 2 Old Dominion locations during my time there. The first one was very reasonable and very well managed. When i relocated to the Chicago area, the management style changed drastically. The management at my new location were incredibly short sighted and made routinely bad decisions for the company as a whole. They were completely inattentive to employee concerns and threatened those who voiced concerns with termination several times. There were a myriad of unsafe and inadvisable practices that took place under this one management group that are too many to list here, but i do view it as an isolated group, not a company wide attitude."
good,While I was there it was a laid back place. Only if the manager liked you.I was at the dallas location and made 2 simple mistakes that were caught and no damage was done but was let go anyways. Manager sits in his office all day and doesn't know what's going on in the shop area. Got a few people who like to run and cry to supervisors to help get you written up. And if you have family in higher up then your untouchable no matter how bad you are at your job
good,"Experienced a case of constructive discharging/management targeting. Worked excessive amount of hours,and was held accountable for issues that happened after I left or after 11+hours"
good,"Great company to work. Great team to work for. Management is good. A great work environment. "
good,"Its a good company very fair . but the invironment is not for me, it wasn't motivational for me with life balance with my wife and kids."
good,The runs and pay were great. The drivers were good. Management was poor. If management had a beef with you they made you pay. It didn't matter if you were guilty of anything.
good,You are a spoke in a wheel but it's a good wheel.  The company navigates well in the changing winds of the marketplace.  You can retire with this company but will only match 30-80% up to 7% if you're a high income employee.  You'll need to invest your money after taxes in other things.
good,"Great place to work if u a line haul driver, pnd gets work like a slave . Just neeed more better people in office, like coporate offices. Mistakes happen but they will go with no second chances"
good,The company itself is good with pay and benefits. However a good portion of management is not open to ideas and positives changes. Communication is very lacking and departments dont pride themselves in working together.
good,I’m a good switcher and I get a lack of respect from management. They hire new switchers that don’t do their job. I do my job every day. I get my production numbers every day. We have yard supervisors that sit in the switchers and stay parked on the phone all night. Which is a huge waste of my 401k profit sharing. When the yard supervisors do work they do all the easy work and don’t work as leaders. I’m writing this review because I’m tired of being harassed about doing my job. I do my job very well. The yard supervisors do not know how to read the production from the computers so they point me out with wrong numbers. I have to get another supervisor to give me a print out of correct numbers. My advice to management is focus on the people that don’t do their job. Leave me alone because I get my production every day. I’ve sacrificed a lot for this company. Management won’t say anything to the new switchers they hire because of Favortism towards them. By the way this job is not a production job. It’s a highly dangerous job and I take my time and I always drive safely. Some of the other switchers run really fast and stop and slide the tires swinging the truck around and then hook up to the trailer. If they did that in my vehicle if I owned a trucking company I would have them fired. I just want to say that I like to do my job at a normal pace for safety. Please tell your management to do their job. I can’t say anything to them because they don’t like for you to say anything to correct them. That’s why I’m writing this review because of their lack of respect to listen to me.
good,"Aviation is a wonderful, but tenuous area in which to work.  I learned a whole new way of looking at aviation from the owner's perspective.  OD is all about customer service.  I loved the nonstop pace of work."
good,"a typical day was just to clock in and have a daily meeting, hop on collect my manifest for the day hop on my fork lift and get to work, the workers are very help full, they will stop what they were doing to help out."
good,"This is a good company to work for, especially for truck drivers.  I was the administrative assistant.  I collected the money the drivers collected from the customers during their deliveries.  I ran the reports each evening and made the bank deposits.  There were customer service tasks as well.  It was a very relaxed atmosphere."
good,"Dont break the company rules or even come close to breaking them are you will be fired. But its OK for them to break the rules. Your're not a employee, your're just another employee number to corporate. Superiors will leave you hanging in more ways then one"
good,It's a nice place to work if you want to be in it for the long run. you make good money bur if you're planning on going to school then be sure your schedule can handle it.
good,Good company to work for when it comes to security. They are always improving. Management could use some Improvement though. Excellent pay and raises given yearly.
good,OD is a great company to word for with alot of room to expand your experience as you work there. OTR Truck driving is good money with little home time and intense work schedules
good,"Old Dominion’s Corporate Office in Thomasville, NC had made a company wide implementation for Downsizing. I fell victim to their personnel decision this month for the Central Region or would still be employed."
good,Great job to work far as far as benefits and pay but that's just as far as it goes. Management is horrible and it's so easy for you to get terminated their it isn't even funny. As far as work life balance i'll let you be the judge of that considering you work 50 hours a week at 5 days a week.
good,Great place to work as far as people pay and benefits goes... production is set at 3 bills an hour but you could end up with bad freight all day you're not in favor
good,I worked as part time and it got very slow so I was let go. worked with a great team and just did not have enough hours so I was laid off. If I was called back I would go back to work for them.
good,Most of the employees are great. It’s a fast paced environment. There’s lots of room for advancement if you are willing to wait. The pay isn’t great but the benefits are.
good,"The pay was great and had the best benefits. Made great friendships during my time that I have carried on past my employment with Old Dominion. Management overworked the drivers without consideration for their personal time and family time. No overtime until 60 hours. There was no room for advancement. Once a driver, always a driver."
good,Good depending on where you work . People are friendly and job is simple yet difficult due to fast pace. Good company to qork for depending on who the manager is.
good,"I love the job I do.  Would like to have better pay and a little more time off but the benefits are pretty good.  Management is willing to work with the individual on private matters and they have an open door policy.  They do their best to keep the property clean and safe.  They keep up on maintenance on the truck, trailers and dollies.  They do their best to help the world keep promises"
good,"Great benefits, they offer great discounts and 401k matching. Discretionary match and competitive pay. Very strict and all tasks must be completed beyond satisfactory."
good,"Team environment"
good,"I really enjoyed working here the supervisors were great people and the Sacramento terminal is a newer building. The only problem i had is I was skipped several times when it came to being made a full time employee, i was part time for 2 and a half years when people who started before me were being made full time, i ended up quitting because of this. Other than that I really enjoyed working here."
good,I would rather not give specifics about the company due to possible conflicts that may arise in the future for potential employees.
good,Takes a while to move into a good run but the pay was great. I did extremely well until there was a new line haul manager. Communication was scarce and everyone seemed to have an attitude with the drivers. Overall great place to work to pay all your bills but it can burn you out if you don't pace yorself
good,Outbound shift is a very fast pace job. time is always against you and you just have to learn to handle situations as they come.
good,"Worked in a very fast paced environment and learned a lot about the freight industry. Hours were inconsistent, much of the time due to a lack of organization."
good,"Did Local Deliveries in Chicago Area, short on pallets jacks and hand"
good,I loved this job. Due to the economical failure going on at the time I was laid-off. I had to find a job otherwise I'd still be there.
good,"I had been working at this job for 3 years when I first started the job there were 4 dock workers and then 3 of the dock workers were fired so that left me 1 dock worker there by myself for about 4 months there were other people coming in for the job but they always ended up getting fired or they would quit. Then on top of me working there I was going to school and I couldn't really study as much as I wanted and work , they absouluty gave no lunch breaks what so ever and when I asked for fulltime because I had been parttime for so long they say I cant get the fulltime because there is to many people to pay so then they hire more people to work the dock so me working there for 3 years things were changing there was 6 guys there and we don't have lots of weight to move and I was parttime and some days I would get called off work because they wanted to see how the other dock workers would do with out me. It was not a hard job but I was the best worker out there I was dockleader and I never worked in that invironment until I started working there I never knew how to use a forklift until I started working there. it was a good job but I needed fulltime and more hours and they weren't going to give it to me ."
good,A typical day on the job  would be that I clock in and move freight from one trailer to the next. Sometimes you might have to recoup the freight but that is not too bad. The only hard part of the job would the hrs. I work the overnight shift and its gets to you especially if working at night is not for you.
good,"Great place to work!"
good,Fast paced environment. A lot of pressure from upper management. Hardest part if job is dealing with issues quickly and efficiently.
good,Data entry was a lot of fun at ODFL. It was a very easy environment to work in.
good,Every Day Was Challenge no 2 days were the same. Meet a lot of nice customers
good,I learned how to use a fork lift and about the trucking industry.
good,"Management actually listens to honest safety concerns. For instance, we used to have to lift chemical drums by hand or with a hand dolly: after only one simple suggestion and a picture, we now have a new forklift attachment. No more injuries, no more back breaking barrel moving. Sincerely, a grateful forklift operator."
good,This position offers an ever changing work environment that provides challenges on a daily basis while also giving hands on challenges that require a person to make quick decisions
good,This job was a fast paced; sales job in which I sold a service to my many customers. Typical Day began at 7; with a focus on seeing quality new accounts; or existing loyal customers. To generate new revenue; through many services within the company's portfolio.
good,• Verify and research customer shipment claims and investigations of lost or damaged freight.
good,was a great work environment.worked on graveyard shift for 7 years.Liked my job
good,This corporation cares about its employees and their families. This job began as a career starter and offered numerous benefits. I only left to take on part time employment.
good,"Great company to work for. Great solid company that’s growing and always looking for new ways to expand their business. Comfortable work environment, with late model equipment and equipment to ease the work burden."
good,a typical day at work.what you learned.management.workplace culture.the hardest part of the job. DO not include confidential company information or personal
good,"I worked at ODFL for 3 years, starting with maintenance and moving on to forklift operation and supervision. Working here is laid back and fun, but can be demanding, and interferes with home life. There is no paid overtime, and management has a way of playing favorites. During peak seasons there are mandatory work days. Pay and benefits are great. They take care of you if you do well. There is opportunities for advancement if you wish."
good,"Pays great, but youll have to work 48 a week as full time, more ppl seemed to be part time tho, the turn over rate is high too, its a production based job"
good,"Old Dominion is a beautiful job to have significant benefits. Have appropriate management with excellent communication, excellent pay and home time. Old Dominion has great equipment"
good,"Overall great company to work for. Free meals, great management to work with. Long hours but no overtime. Pays good to start. Good benefits too. Flawed productivity system though."
good,Great company to work for if you are single but it is definitely a tough job if you have family.  The pay is one of the only reason most people stick around.
good,"I worked for Old Dominion Freight Line, of Indianapolis, IN for nearly 13 years. I saw the local organization transform from a small satellite location to a large hub and saw a significant changeover in management occur over that time as well. It was a fairly decent place to work and being that I was a dedicated employee who also conducted myself professionally on all accounts, I was a respected driver and representative of the company. Due to rules related to interstate commerce, drivers typically worked 50+ hours a week with no overtime pay.  The job did not fulfill my criteria for life/work balance.  After deciding to pursue higher education, needing the time to focus on coursework, I finally departed Old Dominion Freight Line on favorable terms."
good,a good place to work I would love to wrigh a review but I got fired from old dominion it not easy being a truck driver drivering is hard and it suck to get fired
good,not a bad job if you don't want assigned trucks or Start time. Dispatcher is difficult to work with. Manager and Operations Manager are decent people.
good,"Solid overall company with good equipment,you have the opportunity to work as much as you like as long as you have the hours and there is freight availble.If your specific terminal does not have work you can work out of any local terminal on your day off.If you do your job and follow all the rules you will be fine but any accident on the road tou will be fired,but you can appeal and hope that they give you another chance  every accident is different but company process is the same for all accidents."
good,"•	Developed Information Builders WebFOCUS code to create procedures, and accompanying HTML and Java Script using App Studio and related tools to generate SQL that compiles report data from multiple database platforms for multiple business departments"
good,"Most coworkers were very good to work with."
good,"Great place to learn job skills for people who are new to the trucking industry, and workforce.  Great advancement opportunities for dock workers looking to becoming truck drivers."
good,"Working at Old Dominion is a good experience however management isn't fair. They always have their favorites, other than that very good pay and good place to work"
good,"The pay is great there. The hours are 10 to 12 hours daily and 4 to 5 days a week. You can get promoted quickly if your good at your job . Performance reviews are given in timely order. The upper management is very indecisive Hhard to please .you seem to aleays be job scared becausr of that.The company does offer 401k packagethat they match up to a certain percentage. The health insurance is expensive.  ..."
good,"Very strong culture, tremendous amount of great people who love the company, management not supportive when tough situations happen, big claims etc.  leave you hanging, yes men cutlture"
good,"great pay, good medical and overall one of the best freight companys out there, good hours year round. the highest paying freight job that i personally know of"
good,"company pays well,  takes care of employees with top of line equipment   no forced dispatch and will send you home whenever you want'"
good,A typical day consists of a lot of activity. A lot of freight is being moved in a short period of time. The system is easy to know and far more advanced than most once you get it down.
good,"Processing the paperwork for the sale of tractor, trailers and company cars and trucks consumed the bulk of my day."
good,"very exciting place for employment, every day is different and never boring."
good,"I enjoyed the job, but management was unfair and would do anything to get rid of certain people they do not like"
good,"hours are odd , but co-workers are very friendly. Training staff will set you up to suceed and get ahead. Hardest part of the job is learning how to use the dims computer on the forklifts."
good,Best of the Best in LTL...  Especially drivers and dock.  It is hard to advance but that is due to high retention in the ranks.  Advancement will be through ODs growth.
good,"Good company to work for, good benefits and annual raises for full time, I was part time so I was exempt from all that but $18/hr starting could be worse. Guaranteed 30 hrs/wk. Can be difficult to obtain a full time position."
good,Money is great. Hours are long. Pay raise every 4 months. Management is ok. They expect a lot for the money they pay. Customer service is the number one priority behind safety.
good,Great pay bennies coworkers and culture. Only bad things are the late start hours and the sort and segregate stops. I would recommend old Deminion to anybody
good,They tend to add new runs to quickly. Not enough freight to sustain them. We get canceled 1-2 days a week. Instead of canceling the new runs. Trucks are to slow.
good,Good company to work for but let there young service center managers push people around. Drivers and Supervisors all get along and enjoy working for the company..
good,A typical work day was on a forklift loading and unloading an 18 wheeler trailer. I learned great teamwork skills in a fast paste environment while operating heavy mechanics.
good,"good place to work, lot to learn, new management started pushing harder on productivity and started to make employee scared of losing job,  Even with this I still enjoyed my time here, Biggest con is the over time doesn't start until after 60hr, Lots of great people to work with great opportunity"
good,This is a great place to work as long as you dont make any mistakes. If you do make a mistake you may be fired immediately. This job has great benefits and tons of room for self growth.
good,"We typically process over 45,000 bills a night. Each specialist is required to bill 400-600 bills a night. Production based department; the faster you bill the more money you make."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Old Dominion, but there is not a lot of room for growth. The management was not the best, they had favorites. The most enjoyable part of this job was the people."
good,Was a good place to work definitely recommend working here best freight company in the game. People are easy to work with. And great pay. I would try to get in as soon as you can.
good,"time goes by really fast because of the fast paced work environment."
good,great place to work fast pace a lot of overtime during the summer slows down in winter around Halloween and Christmas.do not pay overtime but good part time job.
good,Great part-time or full-time job. Requires someone that can multitask and work without constant supervision. Fast paced at times especially when you get freight that has to make a scheduled trailer. Overall fun job with decent benefits.
good,"Average job, work with decent people, there's always work to do, don't know what time you get off every night, hours are mainly afternoon throughout the night early morning, pays well for the type of job."
good,"Learned how to manage other employees to get the best result out of their work while maintaining a fun, and serious work relationship.  High stress job that requires an attention to detail, and punctuality in the work place."
good,"overall this is a great company to work for"
good,Thing seem to change on a daily basis. Best job I've had. Really take care of their employees. Pay and benefits are excellent.  Equipment needs updated and serviced.
good,"Great place to work for a trucking company. Management at this location is awesome thus far. Dispatchers definitely need improvements, a few seem to really dislike there job. Old Dominion central dispatch is horrible! They don't pay attention to weather very often. Some are rude and never answer the phone."
good,"A typical day would consist of a meeting then getting out to the dock to unload your first trailer of the day, fast-paced and can be a bit stressful but rewarding. The pay and benefits are probably some of the best I've received and most of the people are cool but management is a little shady. Overall though a good company to work for."
good,"Fast Paced...Safe Competitive and productive working environment."
good,Very good experiences at OD. Family type work environment which i love. Not allowed to get overtime and that sets me back because i get paid below average when it comes to my position.
good,Company paid well and had excellent benefits but under new management policy changes result in more times that not automatic termination. But other than that the work is very demanding and takes a toll on your body.
good,Little strict if u get in accident not like other places they will fire you no second chance. Plus you are just a number like any big company. But better than most companies over all.
good,"Been here over 3 years. I been there and done ""all of that"" as a pro driver. This is the best company I have worked for yet. But the overtime rules suck, especially in the Calif Bay Area where rent alone is $2000 to $3000 a month.  Many of us commute in from outlying areas daily. "
good,"I went through Old Dominion's driver training program last year I got a total of 8 months experience doing LineHaul but Due to cuts my class and the class before got laid off."
good,As far as pay goes this is a solid place. Unfortunately corporate mentality ruined the experience for me. Your only as good as your last load. With the right manager and dispatch can be a good place to work.
good,There was no overtime unless you worked over 60 hrs and it was an open dock and you were subjected to the elements but not a bad place to work and was good
good,"As a long haul driver, we are treated very well with excellent pay and benefits. The pressure of job security is almost non existent compared to city drivers and dock workers. The company has great benefits."
good,"Old Dominion praises themselves upon being a family-oriented company that promotes from within. My experience has not been reflective of this. While I did feel like it was a family-oriented company, I also felt excluded at times from said family. Overall IT management seems more focused on getting someone to ""hit the ground running"" as opposed to building their staff up through training."
good,"Drivers start at $22-$23/hr and get get $1 raises at 12, 18, 24, and 36 months; as well as cost of living raises.  You can also start on the dock at $15/hr and get your cdl through old dominion."
good,overall great workplace culture. Some cons were not set hours. Some days you do not know what time you will be starting or ending. No overtime after 40 hours.
good,Great company for drivers.  Office support at the location I worked in was not a pleasant experience.  There is no support for lower level employees only for upper management.  Management was not supportive.
good,Good place to work best paying job I had you can work on your own with no one on your back benefits are great I will never quit until I retire at old dominion you fired your self
good,I worked at OD for two years as a forklift operator while attending college. I made enough money while I was there and the work hours were flexible. i had to leave eventually though because my transfer college was too far of a driving distance.
good,had to leave Old Dominion for family leave reasons. I would have stayed there if a family had not become sick. Sometimes life circumstances do get in the way of your career
good,Old Dominion is a top of the line freight company that is rapidly growing. Its not climate controlled but the pay is good. The only bad thing is to get overtime you have to work over 60hrs in a week. Other than that it is a good company to work for.
good,the company is good to work for paid good alot of hrs either driving or forkilift depending on ft or pt hrs if u fit in with the compant things r easy if u dont fit in life can be difficult  i was a good worker had a good reputation from other i worked with upper managemennt ha da different view on it everyone is different
good,"Job can be very stressful at times but compared to other companies in same field, the pay is great. OD is also number one ranked compared to its brother and sister rivals."
good,Good leadership amongst crew trainers there Most of the people there where very friendly and helpful Management however isn't Majority of managers there try to harass people instead of helping them
good,"Was a very good job,management could have done a lot better with situations.Overall I enjoyed my time as Oper. Supervisor and getting the experience in Management that I did"
good,you earned your money- management very attuned to employees- taught me many skills-monday thru friday work week- work schedule sporadic- equipment was always maintained
good,"I like the place to work but I think management could do a lot more for the drivers. I think that the managers they are more concern with their bonuses than taking care of their drivers it is really sad to see because the drivers here where very happy and united and now they're leaving the company and looking for other places to work, when we talk about what is going on with the company they said the same management have change and looking out for the drivers."
good,"This company is a very fast paced and if you can't keep up they will let you go because they are a very busy company. The typical work day is, you come in ready to break freight. You clock in, have a short meeting, and get assigned to a supervisor. After the meeting you go to the supervisor he will give you a manifest and you go and break the freight from the trailer he gives you, you do this for 10 hours and you go home."
good,Family atmosphere. Very fast paced. Good pay and benefits.The best part of the job was working with fellow co-workers.  Opportunity to advance in company. Company makes changes to meet market needs.
good,Just a strong company that keeps its eye on what is and isn't needed to be successful. well run and organized and feels like a family. They practice taking care of their employees and the employees will take care of the company and that is rare in todays market.
good,"The company is very demanding, in a good way. They have very high standards and expect only the best from their employees.  All of the drivers are top-notch and very friendly. Management is strict and firm, but fair. The hardest and most enjoyable part of my job is the variety, never dealing with the same customers or situation twice."
good,"The best paying LTL company in the country , period."
good,One of the hardest steps is getting hired here. Very selective on there employees. You get good pay and retirement here as well as fair insurance. This company will work you hard and long.
good,a day here is a lot of unloading and loading truck that have to go out and done in a certain time span. The people are friendly and also just great environment.
good,Great place to work good pay good benefits a lot of hours tho work 6 years with then had to leave to spend time with my kids other than on the week ends
good,"• In charge of loading and Unloading of all incoming trailers. Securing and strapping down all outgoing freight for transport"
good,Good leader ship fast paced great pay for part time working great work environment easy to transfer world wide company great job opportunities can advance
good,"Old Dominion is a pretty good place to work.  The pay is good, the work is steady. Management can be a little tough to deal with at times.  Overall, I'd recommend it."
good,Some days can be stressful and jam packed full of work. But the wage compensation is great and overall management seems to care about employees. The docks are not heated or cooled.
good,"Being a data entry specialist is probably one of the highest paying entry level positions in the company especially if you are good at your job. However, with good pay comes stress and possible long hours. Sometimes we work consistent overtime and other times we consistently get out early. It just depends on the time of the year. It is a production job so you'll be working constantly from start to finish."
good,I made a stupid mistake and was terminated.  I would retire from there had they let me.  It's a great company with well maintained equipment and clean terminals throughout the US.  Beware though.  If you work here you won't want to work anywhere else.
good,Good group of people to work with and for. Company has good benefits and they care about their employees. The pay is good and opportunity for advancement is available if you want it.
good,"Considering that all I did was type the pay was very good.  There is stress regarding keeping a minimum pace throughout the entire night, but it got easier.  You have to go through a temp agency to get the position."
good,Its a good company to work for with good benefits. The culture is relaxed and the pay is good.  You have 2 shifts to choose from and the management is okay.
good,"I was a supervisor for the company and loved working there, the people around me were great. It can be a high stress job at times but it was always about making things work for the customers satisfaction."
good,"This was a busy office, but there were times when you had a chance to breathe."
good,They always talked it up as a family oriented company. It used to be that way but not anymore. New Management came in and changed up everything and everyone.
good,"Promoted from Class A CDL driver for long and short haul cargo and freight to Account Manager. Work many hours and great overtime. As my family grew, work balance was slightly affected."
good,Very fast moving job on forklifts. The management that  were on my shift were good. The workers bud heads a little  but is a good company to work with
good,"From the CIO to my direct manger, I could not have been working under better individuals.  My day to day work load was a high but I was able to affect change and make improvements that left me feeling satisfied at the end of the day.  Work life balance was good.  The company embraces new technology and encourages engineers to be independent leaders of the technologies they are responsible for."
good,Fun Job unloading and loading trailers with a forklift. Worst part of the job is the weather and being in the temperatures
good,The management has made many changes over the years that have totally changed the atmosphere for the worst.  The hours available aren't great for a family.  You are payed very well and the benefits aren't bad.
good,"Manegemnet was fair.  Pay and benefits were great. "
good,This is a gem of a company located in an an unexpected area. I learned so much about always-connected mobile computing.  This company is serious about keeping promises and they show that commitment in resourcing their technology.  I loved my co-workers and would work with them again.  Perhaps my favorite part of the job was going directly to the service centers and learning how to improve our technology directly from the in-the-trenches employees.
good,"after about a 3 month process to get the job of a p&d driver and working for only 11 months some guy in an office looked at $$ numbers and made the decision to not only fire a driver but also a dock worker, 2 weeks before christmas because of low freight levels!!?"
good,This company provides excellent opportunity to any individual willing to work with a high degree of commitment. It provides strong customer service backup but like any other major freight carrier in this country it is affected greatly by the downswings of our economy which could lead to internal downsizing of its workforce.
good,"Relaxed environment with proper available resources."
good,"Doing reports first thing in the morning , answering phones, scheduling pickups , copying , faxing , also making phones calls to check on freight ."
good,This company is good to work for but there are some drawbacks like the balance of work and life.  It is a constant grind with nice rewards but they need to figure out how to balance the work load with a personal life.
good,once u enter the floor its go time.I learned how to use the scanner gun to load trailers.Management was easy to work with.The co workers were easy to get along with and worked as a team.
good,ODFL is a very good company to work for as a career. It is a demanding job that requires you to be at your best at all times. The customer service and attention to detail is the best thing about this Company. They treat everyone fairly
good,good benefits and pay rate would increase frequently. would have been better with some normal business hours. Management was great. co workers as well. the hardest part of job was working on open outside dock.
good,I was with ODFL for 2 and a half years and they are like no other LTL company out there. Their work ethic for freight claims is head and shoulders above all others that I have seen. The protect the customer's freight because they know without the customers there is no business.
good,"I’m happy working for OD. There isn’t perfect company but this one is definitely special. Winter can be a little tough but other than that, I feel everything works very good"
good,They were a fair place to work. You always new what your job task was and what was expected of you. Lower level managers truly cared about their employees.
good,"Very good company to work for. Good pay and benefits. I’m a Linehaul Driver out of Forest View, Il. Decent work schedule with weekends off. Home EVERYDAY!"
good,The job was quick pace but great work and good hours. The pay was excellent and the fact that they gave you a chance to grow and further your career was amazing
good,It's a great place to work. They value their employees. Very competitive company. Great environment and management is always willing to help. They promote within and hard work will get you there.
good,"On average the work day ranges from 8-12 hour shifts; Ten hour shifts being the most common. Supervisors were wonderfully nice, great to talk to and easily approachable while still ensuring a productive day."
good,I would recommend Old Dominion to anyone who wants to make a decent amount of money and is willing to work hard. The management is pretty strict but overall not a bad place to work as long as you are willing to work hard.
good,In the short time I was at OD is was enjoyable they are really laid back and I got to learn a lot of different jobs it was a good learning experience.
good,"Old dominion is overall a good company to work for. The pay is fair for ones efforts and the open door policy is followed throughout the company."
good,I was a dock worker and started out low but in no time I moved up and my pay was good good insurance and work at night so had the day off to get things done
good,Typical day would include loading and unloading freight safely in all weather conditions and time. Also hosteling trailers to and from multiple rollup doors
good,"I've worked here for more than two years, and its a great opportunity to make decent pay , but requiring manual labor. You get paid fairly for the work that you do."
good,Complete Pre-trip on commercial vehicle and trailer. Check that all freight in trailer matches the route Manifest. Deliver or pick up freight at customer business or residential. Complete post-trip on commercial vehicle and trailer.
good,Fun place to work if your not afraid of hard work. Can be long hours depending on the time of year. All training is paid. Up to date equipment. This job is not for everyone.
good,Old Dominion was a very good place to work at. Unfortunately I was let go for a minor accident and no longer work here. I would drive a double at 9pm and would arrive around 8am or so. I would drop and hook and at times I would need to create new sets.
good,The job was nothing complicated. It was move freight from a to b and secure it. Nothing too hard. It was just out in the heat or cold. Management did not bother us too much. There were times when they would be annoying but it usually subdued within a couple days. The biggest problem for me was that the job got too monotonous.
good,"The open door policy is very effective at od. It allows the workers to get familiar with management and express their comfort and discomfort. Above all, the pay is very good."
good,I have been with O.D. for around 15 years. I love the culture and couldn't imagine a better CEO and COO to have running a company. As a whole O.D. is a great place to work. Individual terminals have their issues. Mainly promoting people who work harder at kissing butt than actually doing work.
good,I worked at Old Dominion for 4 years with a variety of assignments. The management is intelligent and know their business. Though the job can be demanding at times the also reward their employees with good benefits.
good,Nice company to get in too. Need more diversity with management. Need to up date policy...................... But love working there but just did not fit in
good,"I like the physical challenge that Old Dominion requires to work this job, with handling heavy freight by hand and forklift. This is a very fast paced career, and sometimes can be very physically straining."
good,"This company truly revolves around the ""family"" work place. You are treated well, and the company treats the employees well. The hard part of this job is the fast pace that old dominion moves. Everything is go go go. I enjoyed learning how logistics work and how important it is to make sure that you do things as you are instructed to do."
good,Very good place to work. I enjoyed my job here. It is a very fast paced job and you must be on your toes. Weather Temps were whatever outside temperature are.
good,Good place to work. Pay is good and management takes care of problems. Its a good place to stay awhile if you can withstand the slow seasons. Mostly part time work.
good,Many good qualities.  Good benefits and pay.  Comfortable schedule.  Good balance between work and personal life.  Room for advancement.  Brand new facility to work in.
good,"Great place to work.. growth will continue and stability will follow."
good,"I love working for Old Dominion, they pay very well and they have flexible hours and they treat you like family. They also have good benefits and lots of opportunities."
good,Construction industry feast of famine depending on economy and local growth.  Layoffs in winter time and long hours during the summer.  Laid off entire work force in 2010
good,"Loved this company"
good,"A typical day would consist of waking up at around 4:45 am and working till 10:00 am and sometimes 12:00pm.  On the occasion of more freight I would be up by 3:00 am sometimes.  In addition to the early hours, on Sundays we would be at work at 12:00 am to 8,9,10 or 11 am. My responsibilities included  documenting damages by photographing dents, scrapes and cracks and recording them in a log.  Also I had to adequately move freight at a quota and avoid damaging freight with my forklift."
good,"good starting pay rate for part time,"
good,"This job is hard at first, just getting the hang of driving a forklift, loading, and unloading trailers that weigh upwards to 25,000 lbs, but once you get the hang of it, everything becomes second nature and it becomes a nice place to work."
good,ODFL was my first shot at a real future. Every place has its flaws but this one was worth staying for. Life got in the way of me advancing at this company. If you get lucky enough to get into this company never leave.
good,"Good work environment nice trucks great pay.Management helpful drivers given valuable info on policy an procedure ,work place good freindly environment ."
good,I liked working for OD. Had no problems with any of the managers. Open door policy at any level. Always treated with respect. I would recommend working for OD to anyone interested in making a good living.
good,My review of old dominion is that there is opportunity within the company if you are dedicated and a team player.i learned a lot of useful skills on the job and outside of the job.
good,I've put in 10 years there and over time change is always an enevitable. They seem to make the right decisions almost every single time. They have been highly supportive of everyone's career.
good,Good place to work.  Do your job to the best of your ability and everything was fine .  If you need help just ask.  Don’t be afraid to get dirty.  Ask questions if you don’t know.
good,"OD has a very respectful workplace, management doesn't tolerate a hostile work environment. Hours were tough to work at first, but the pay made it easy to live with.  Dispatch emphasized safety over anything else.  Missed pick ups, or deliveries were not punishable if safety was a factor."
good,"Liked  and found it rewarding at OD, plus enjoyed working with co-workers"
good,"A typical day at work was to was to set up drivers on the line haul board, making sure the dock supervisors got their loads closed on time or the schedules. I learned leadership skills well as being the best supervisor possible. Management was very understanding. Hardest part of the job was being at my workstation for 12 hours with no breaks. Most enjoyable part was the respect the drivers had for me."
good,"If you like to work hard and like what you do this is a good place to work. You have to prove yourself to be a team player, but once you do you become a part of the team."
good,"I started off in an office position and then became a driver.  The hours are extremely difficult as a driver, constantly switching from days to nights and only one day off a week.  Driving is not the life for me, but kudos to those that love to drive."
good,"Corporate management detached. Pay was reasonable. Location manager was very flexible to accomodate work life balance. As a female, was not much consideration for advancement."
good,"A great company to work for, with outstanding benefits. Great team of guys that I work with and would never talk bad of Old Dominion. Take care of their employees."
good,"Great company to work for. Great compensation, benefits, and salary. Treat their employees well. Although it is a large company it feels like a small family."
good,"I liked being busy, very organized manner. Orders have to be very accurate and make sure everything is damage free. Safety is very important when your dealing with forklifts, tractor & trailers, 2000 pound skids. Timely unloading! Everyone new their job and the importance of it. Management trusted your decision making that it was a good one. Enjoyable part is getting everything done in the time frame it should be done."
good,start day by getting a manifest from your manager then select your forklift and inspect your forklift for any defects or problems. Go to your selected trailer and start to load or unload the freight.
good,Good company for getting into the double trailers. Compensation is good. Good company if your not a family man/woman.
good,Awesome shop to work at. Enjoy a newer facility with up to date tooling. Everything that you work with is brand new. Tractor technicians have a truck lift they are able to use along with 2 other bays for other repairs. Trailer technicians have enough room to pull in 2-3 trailers attached to each other and still be able to shut the shop doors. The shop has amazing huge fans inside so its nice and cool during the summer and a burning hot heating system in the winter. You will rarely find anything wrong with working for this company. The worst part may be working with a handful of drivers who don't really see the equipment as their own and tend to be rough on it.
good,A great place to work. The work weeks are long. Over time after 60 hours. Paid weekly. On the job training. A lot of responsibility. A lot of different jobs to choose from.
good,The job itself can be stressful but the pay is well worth it. The benefits are great. The time use to work a shift fits well with outside life errands.
good,"The drivers were always pleasant to me ,I helped them when they called in with issues. The office staff was also good and we all helped each other. The time I was there was good."
good,"new progressive work place, Don't allow or accept old school work habits. A lot of childish games, They set people up to fail. They need to pay attention to the drivers and keep the drivers on a set schedule and rout,"
good,"Coworker believe in helping each other . The hardest part was the winter time . That's when it separate the men from the boys. The most enjoyable part was the cook outs , and the awards for years of service"
good,"unload trucks load city and outbound trucks"
good,"OD stresses the inclusion of all employees in every aspect of operations and strives for employee happiness and satisfaction.  Customer satisfaction is important to the company as well, but OD knows the importance of retaining working individuals that share their goals, vision, and mission."
good,"Good people I enjoy this job. I have not had any troubles with any one, as long as you do your job no one will bother you. For the most part it is a very calm place to work."
good,The OD family treated me fairly and Gave what they said they would. when there was times of stress you always felt the terminal manager was there to help you work through tough times. The staff in the operations department are well trained and deal well under the pressure of the industry
good,"Maintain updated knowledge of products, industry trends, and methods."
good,It’s a great company wish they didn’t have managers who worried so much about the wrong things and firing the best people that have worked there. Buts that’s there call love the company and thank them for the good years.
good,"Come in, delegate work, attend to vendors, etc. Laid back, easy work environment with great benefits, retirement, PTO, life insurance and 401K retirement plan"
good,different races got catered to more then others. Got written up for random nonsense like doing the right thing. when we loaded skids into a trailer we had to put cardboard around all 4 sides of the skid an strap it in once if the skid fell over during transit we would get written up for it.
good,My review of Old Dominion Freight Line is overall it is a great company to work for. The specific terminal location I worked at the management was not very professional and there wasn't much room for advancement. I don't want to make it sound like they are a bad company at all because I still recommend friends to try to get in there. I just suggest if they are willing to move and transfer that they should because of the management at the Harrisburg terminal was very unprofessional.
good,The job is very fast paced that only allows minimal to no errors when unloading and loading freight. You are required to unload and load your trailers in a certain amount of time other wise your name will be called over the PA and asked to go to the office to find out why your scans have slowed down. Some of the freight that you have to unload and load are very expensive and at times difficult to move around. The worst part of working there is that you will be on an open dock meaning that there are no dock doors so the winter time can become a very big issue if you don't have plenty of layers. The dock is like a huge wind tunnel so if you have a drink on your lift it's very possible for it to freeze within 5-10 minutes.
good,the work was great but no time for family.
good,You get told  your worthless by your manager. They had 2 that no longer work there so i bet  it's way better to work there now. Other then that its a great place to work.
good,Over all it has killer pay and great benefits. The shift times are not optimal but they pay you enough to lose your days..............................
good,Great pay for the industry and many raises but job security can become stressful.  Home time can seem like only minutes at times but time on the road can feel relaxing.
good,My experience at Old Dominion has been a rewarding one.  I am looking now for more opportunity to grow in the financial field.  I recommend ODFL to anyone looking to grow their own personal goals.
good,"Hard worker and ready to work! Fair, and family like. Great people to work for. Good trucks, good trailers to pull. All around great equipment. Was always realing to work with you."
good,Great place to work where the company treats its employees very fairly and the benefits are great. Management has open door policy and works with you to solve any problems you may have.
good,Very friendly and helpful co-workers and staff. Constantly receiving incoming calls due to it is a call center. The days seem to drag due to various daily schedules.
good,"Had a personal fall out with supervisor which led to my quiting with proper notice. "
good,"Cool Place to work, very laid back as long as you got your work done right and on time. Lots of Room to advance, Professional work place. Very good benifits."
good,It was a great opportunity for me because it was my first driving opportunity less than a month after truck driving school. I would recommend old dominion to any Driver even though I had very poor management in the department I was in.
good,"This job was an excellent opportunity to do something a bit different. I loaded and unloaded trucks. I was able to become forklift certified while there, and learn shipping and receiving ."
good,Good work if you can drive a forklift really fast and tight. Coworkers respect you and help you if you do your share. Great way to get into the door if you want to learn to drive big rigs.
good,"The overall work is average labor, some days were tougher than others especially during summer hours when the tempeatures are higher. Management was very involved wih the workers but nonetheless very helpful to employees."
good,"Worked hard, and it paid off. Driving a forklift, and completing orders with your crew. It is physical labor. It is a great place to start your career in frieigt because it offers room for growth and constant learning opportunites within the company."
good,Great company with an open-door policy and very family oriented. This company had wonderful health insurance as well.
good,"Maintaining proper paper work, packing lists and pickups from various companies "
good,The Atlanta shop would be a good place to work for anyone interested in being a technician for tractors or trailers. It would not be a good place to work for anyone desiring to eventually move off the floor and into the office area. For someone like this it would be a dead end job.
good,"Hooking and un-hooking doubles, driving to meet point or terminal, doing PTI's and fueling truck at end of shift."
good,"Overall the place has a very very inclusive family feel in day to day operations. The supervisors try to help anyway they can, and the management take the time to speak whenever they see you."
good,"When it comes to Old Dominion Freight Line the company and culture are great. Sadly, the level of work decreased. After 4 years of full time I was made to be part time and take a pay cut. It is sad how much change happens due the economy."
good,how to drive a forklift  how to run freight fast  work in a warehouse   driving school benefits good money  how to deal dirty enviroments learn about the company   good hours
good,Old dominion is a well organized company culture. Opportunities for advancement. Good compensation. They have excellent benefits that include paid birthday holiday and immediately earned PTO.
good,Good company to work for. Good people. Vacation is for hard to get approved.  I would like to stay but looking to relocate looking for new opportunity.
good,The best trucking company in the industry to work for. Pays great for the manual labor involved plus the exposure to the elements. Lots of room for advancement in management.
good,A work day was pretty simple. I learned how to move freight a little bit faster. I was satisfied with management and my co workers. The hardest part of the job was the weather.
good,"Start my day at 2 A.M., teach you how to drive and operate a forklift in a very relaxed environment. Management really don't understand communication with others. One manager can tell you one thing where you can completely do wrong what the next one in line would like. Co-Workers, some of the best employees to work with. Hardest part about your job is trying to figure out what management wants from you. Enjoyable - the pay is top notch and job is fairly relaxed."
good,"Liked the job, didn't like the hours. Hooking and Dropping triple trailers. Overnight Linehaul from TWF to SLC."
good,"Its a fast work environment, company expects 2.0 service nothing but the best. operation works 24 hours 7 days a week. I worked for the terminal in Bloomington CA."
good,"Old dominion was a good company to work for, some of there deliveries where not thought of well, the medical and dental plain as well as retirement plan are well worth the pain of working there"
good,"Old dominion is a great company. Love working there, as long as your hard worker you will be fine. Time management and communication is key to success"
good,Not much to say. Its a job that once you learn the ropes through it is quite easy to get the hang of. Build a good habit of doing a great job and you will be fine.
good,plenty of work overall good place to work. management was fair and helped in every way they could. The hours tend to be long and can be stressful at times.
good,It was an easy job but alot of work. I had a number of responsibilities wich were loading and unloading tires by hand . moving at a fast past. Working on a dock
good,Advancement opportunities become available and they give the in-house crew a shot.  Your have your slow seasons and your extremely busy seasons so work hours may vary.
good,The more with less attitude in full force here. Long hours spent away from your family. Salary and pay is good you just have to work your butt off to get it.
good,A lot depends of management and location. But I can proudly say that this place is most certainly a great place to work for. A good paid truck driving program. Although it is challenging to gain a full time dock position.
good,I am a new to the industry and have enjoyed my time at Old Dominion. They have an excellent training program for new drivers.
good,My typical day is driving to customers to deliver freight. Your normally hours are 830 am to 830 pm. I learned how to deal with customers and improve the ability to deal with different situations.
good,"All aspects of this company are great, from labor to sales to mid and upper management, Up to date with technology, Some of the best equipment n the road. Growth is constant, Freight claims are some of the lowest in the industry."
good,Employees were great to work with. The benefits were simple and easy to manage
good,"Thoroughly enjoyed my first 10 years with Old Dominion, first in Denver as we grew from 37 doors to 108 doors in 2 years, Then we had similar results in Cheyenne as we opened with 3 doors and then had a new terminal (21 doors) built this year.Very positive and productive environment."
good,Good compensation for what you do. Family life suffers being gone for extended times. Immediate/Lower Management needs improvement. Upper Management is excellent to work with.
good,Fantastic company. The only downfall I had after 15 years was seeing my superiors(who no longer work at the location) promote dockmen because of length of time served like a union
good,OD is a really good place to work. I started out part time cos I was working another full time job and it took about 4 months to get on full time. Been a couple years since I worked there but when I was there I loved working there. Your co-workers would help you out if you needed it. The supervisors let's you know what you did wrong but they would also tell you what your doing right. Very good place to work
good,"Great place to work and great atmosphere as well as the coworkers which are always willing to help."
good,"Old Dominion is a really nice company growing annually.Has nice benefits , family oriented,love there workers.Worked 10 hour shifts for 4 days,scheduling goes to seniority.You will have paid time off based on work."
good,It's a fun place to work at that's if you know people that work there. If you dont they will pick at you. You always have to watch out for yourself make sure no one is messing up your route
good,"This workplace provides financial stability, fair compensation and room for career development. Great family atmosphere and good management. I would recommend this workplace."
good,"The supervisors at this company were great, and the working environment was friendly. They paid a competitve wage with bonuses and other work incentives."
good,"If you want to be a truck driver, there's none better than OD.  If you do your job with professionalism you are left alone.  Friendly people.  Approachable management."
good,Stay busy all the time.  Most the guys are team players.  Drive forklift to unload/load trailers.  Move a lot of odd sized freight and most of the leads and managers were really helpful.
good,"It was a great job. I was responsible for finding different pieces of frieght, and delivering it to other trucks on a  fork lift. I learned to really work hard, as my hours consisted of midnight to six a.M. And still was going to school."
good,This is an awesome place. There a little it can work on but other than that great people. I wish they would give out a little more opportunities and made people full time after a certain amount they have been there
good,"Great pay, excellent benefits. The work schedule and hours leave little time for outside life. Almost impossible to pursue education with the schedule."
good,"A good company to work for and ship with"
good,"Very busy work load, professional.  Constant phone calls making appointments to schedule deliveries. Very fast paced.  It was important to call companies to schedule appointments and make sure deliveries were made on time."
good,"worked for old dominon in San Jose, Ca for 2years. needed a transfer to Arizona. had letters from the owners of Old Dominon what a great employee i was. was in Arizona got laid off after 3 months due to down turn in economy. i belive terminal mgr in Arizona didnt want to keep me because he was concered about all my experince and i had a bigger salary. if you get a good terminal mgr its a great company to work at. if the terminal mgr dosent hire you look out."
good,"Great place to work and feel part of the Family .  I would recommend OD to anyone looking for a career with opportunities to grow ."
good,A day at OD as they call it was nothing fancy i would punch in at 4 in the afternoon get my trailer from the window of what i needed to unload and work with the supervisors on what needed to be out the door first. The hardest part was when they needed something in the very back of the trailer. i enjoyed the employees the most
good,Loved my job. Great place to work. Managers were very friendly! As long as you did your job you didn't have to worry about anyone looking over your shoulder
good,"Great company to work for, an good benefits. I was a line haul driver there for over 12 years. Only thing I didn’t like, is the management there ain’t all that great."
good,Was a good place to work and could get the job done and go home in a timely matter. Pay was always on time and could take off if needed. Could take a lunch break.
good,This is the best company I've ever worked for.  Just like any other company there's always some lil drama but  I would recommend to who ever is looking for one of the best paying and family like companies to apply.  The benefits are almost unheard of. I always feel excited to go to work because I know I'm going to make bank! My managers are hard working and they show you that they're not scared to get down and work there assesoff also.
good,"Good Company to work for. Still do not understand why P&D drivers have to pull sets. Good and bad days just like every other job. Good pay, management is good. Fleet is decent, lots of miles on tractors."
good,"I love working here great place to work friendly staff. Really great benefits. You can get time off when you need it the equipment is nice."
good,Great company to work for.  They treat employees well.  Good salary and bonus program is exceptional.  Great senior leadership team and good management team as well.
good,"Old Dominion gave me several opportunities, showed me appreciation for my work, and has great benefits. There isn't enough i can say about Old Dominion i love it."
good,"I enjoyed working for Old Dominion & loved the staff I worked with. It saddened me to have to depart from my position, but I took another path in careers & went into the medical field. I tried staying on with Old Dominion either PRN or Part-Time, but due to the hours of the position it clashed with my hours working at the hospital."
good,"great work place and i would not change anything bu i had ti leave because of personal issuse. if i had to tell anyone about this career, go for iy. wonderful place."
good,"great company to work for. you will have day's when you work long hours, this is expected in the LTL business. very stressful at times but the pay is worth it."
good,If you're wanting to have a great paying blue collar job. Old Dominion is a great and fin place to work. Just working nights is a drag. But if you work hard amd smart you'll be promoted fast.
good,ODFL is a great company that takes care of its employees. The job is really simple and straight forward. Management and dispatch are OK. You are paid well so it's worth it
good,"At old dominion typically day starts at 8 am till 5pm including a lunch  break, I was working with billing team where i was developing a web application which take cares of 20,000 trucks across the united states, This application will track complete shipment from pick up to consignee doors including material handling and no of trailer it has. It was an agile environment everyday meeting followed by two weeks sprint planning.It was very friendly environment and good thing was free snacks every alternate day."
good,"Management is understanding of taking time off when need be. Lots of benefits, health insurance with a portion of premium paid as well as vacation pay. A great place to work!"
good,Overall a good place to work at. supervisors are easy to get along with have no problems with any. good pay with long hours.job could be difficult at first but could be easier in the long run.
good,"I worked there for about a year and half as a bill entry production specialist. The work was boring, but the pay was $20+ per hour depending on your level of productivity. There wasn't a ton of room for advancement, but they did promote within the company instead of hiring outsiders. We were treated well by the company. The health benefits were amazing. I developed carpal tunnel from my job which was ultimately why I left. I didn't much like the hours since they were from 6pm until about 3am monday through friday, but it wasn't terrible. They gave two weeks of vacation for one year of employment as well as 2 paid sick days. I would work for them again."
good,Although some members of management are hard to deal with over all it is a great place to work.  The company treats their drivers very well.  The pay and benefits are the best in the business.  They are very strict of safety.
good,"I have worked at several LTL carriers and this one is by far the best. I worked as a dock worker and crew lead. I was offered positions to train as a driver and supervisor. Management does tend to micro-manage but its a very profitable company so they are doing something right. Had lots of employee appreciation events and frequent raises in wages and benefits even in a poor economy. My only complaint would be the schedule, but if you have ever worked in trucking you know how it goes."
good,"Great company to work for , i would go back if called back no questions asked. I appreciated the opportunity to work for old dominion and will miss the company and my co-workers dearly."
good,"If your ready to make money this is the company, whether it's on the dock or driving.Get in and get started.Money money money money money money money is that good enough indeed? Wtf"
good,I'd recommend OD to anyone who wants to make money. Top pay is over $30 per hour. Some days can be long but it's worth it. Sad to leave but I'm relocating and they do not have an OD where ik moving to
good,Old Dominion has a great team. The management team takes care of their employee and make sure they feel appreciated. Old Dominion is the best team I have worked for.
good,"Report to dispatch For instructions for the day duties. Inspect your equipment before heading out. Management is easy going as long as requirements are met, makes their day less stressful. Ruff part of the days is the Los Angeles traffic and residential, retail, and non docking stops. Coworkers are great we Have unique relationship and allowed by to collaborate with 1 another"
good,"It’s a great job to work at , they train you as soon as you start , it was tough the first two weeks because I was new at driving the Hilo but I caught on quick and learned everything by asking questions even the drivers would help me out if I needed it . But they’re very strict if someone over hears you cussing or making a joke they’ll let you go without a warning ! No second chances you can have perfect attendance and be the best at what you do and they’ll still let you go . Everyone was buddy buddy but but they will turn their back as quick as they can in that terminal"
good,A very competitive work place with good work life balance. Many benefits and incentives. Safe work practice. Great health benefits & compensation. Great staff.
good,"Amazing company but the hours are extremely hard to balance with a home/family life."
good,"I wish I never left this company.Best trucking company."
good,"Geat place to work, team and family atmosphere . Company takes care of there employees the best they can as they grow yearly.The best trucking company to work for and have a career with."
good,"Its a great company to work for, never had any major problems everyday was a easy day,always enjoy goin to work, i learned how to operate the forklift."
good,Easy place to work supervisors do not bother you pay is great hours suck 10 hour days and work scedule suck Tuesday through Saturday but is worth it for the pay
good,watches for the best of its employees and what it takes to make OD a strong company . Like everyone else in the transportation industry it is having to make layoffs to keep P & L strong.Great company  and great training methods and tools to use everyone is will to help out co-workers
good,A great place to work with amazing benefits and family atmosphere.  Great people to work with and upper management that takes care of their people.
good,I enjoyed working for ODFL. The people in my department were great. The level of teamwork was outstanding. It could get stressful during peak season but we all devices to be able to work from home to help with the overload.
good,I was a driver and loved the company.  Lots of hours but great pay.  People cared about each other.  I was offered an opportunity as a new driver that very few people get.  Grateful!
good,"very productive even around the holidays you would think the freight volume was kind of unreal. great compensation, great employer"
good,I have worked there for almost a year now. All of my bosses are the coolest and I have the best shift ever 1st 4am-noonish. The pay is good and the people are better. This is the kind of place I would love to make a career out of.
good,"great place to work, however if you want to be a line driver prepare to have no life outside of work."
good,"This job has provided me with a good life, management in my dept is awesome! Dock life is stressful and very fast paced, if you don't bring your numbers up by the time your probation is over, your out!! There is a high turnover rate on dock, but the pay is very good!!"
good,"I've never worked@ a place where the folks really seemed to care, took a while to get used to it.not another job out there like it.enjoyed working@ OD more than any other job I've ever had"
good,"A good paying job with really good raises. The benefits are really good to, company paid if you are single and very reasonable for families.  Overall no complaints"
good,"Management, OK ,good money , great working structure  ,great company to work for, no overtime untill 60 hours but that's almost not allowed,   great equipment  ,good environment, respectful from management"
good,"If you have a positive attitude everyday your job will always be easy. Now if you have a negative attitude everyday your job will be hard, a job is what you make of it not what your job title is."
good,"When you start off you may have trouble with hours. Managment intentionally hires over staff for busy season, then when its slow the people on the bottom of the list have less hours. Managment could care less about the drivers personal lives or family situations. ""Make it happen"" is the motto for sure. Pay is good, and benefits are OK."
good,Great place to start a driving career. Wish I had started when I was much younger. They have a good retirement and great benefits. Would recommend Old Dominion to anyone interested in a job.
good,"Old Dominion Freight Lines is top of the line when it comes to rates and claims ratio, I for one made sure freight efficiency and quality was ensured for customer satisfaction. In turn this kind of drive got me a promotion as a Foreman/Lead"
good,"I have been part of the RTO team for almost 4 years.I love my job and my Coworkers, if you can get along with others and help others I recommend working at Old Dominion. Benefits are decent here and salaries are average as well. Summer time is busy with lots of OT! I hear a lot of lack of job security here but it is up to you if you want to keep this job, all I can say if be honest, be ready, work hard, don’t get to comfortable, be on time be productive and don’t call off if you don’t have vacation or sick days be drug free and don’t slack off and you will have a job 😬.respect others & humble."
good,"Comfortable environment. Great company to work for. Excellent Benefits. Open door policy. You work close with all areas of the company, from the management to the drivers. Helping the clients is rewarding."
good,"This is by far my most favorite place to work. I had an extremely good time working and learning there. They're fast paced, innovative company and have very compassionate people."
good,"OD is a great place to work.  All they require of you is to show up and do your job.  I have always felt valued as an employee.  The pay for a linehaul driver is excellent.  I feel that the p&d drivers deserve overtime after 8, but OD does not pay overtime until after 60, and you will rarely get over 60 hours/week."
good,"Schedule has been flexible: if you need days off or to leave early, they are always approved. The health benefits are great not to mention affordable. 401k match is great. I was new to the industry and they trained me completely. Management is fair and easy to talk to. The hardest part is knowing seniority is more important than performance. Raises are given based off of company growth and not provided for personal reviews/growth unless promoted to a different position. Working for a small terminal, relocation is almost necessary to advance. Transfer is not guaranteed."
good,Old Dominion is a good company for anyone to work for in general and provides a good benefit package.  OD is a company striving to improve the benefits for their employees each year.
good,"Manifest Loading and Unloading trailers. Idenitifying  contents by load.  Benefits package good with 401K, but no pension program."
good,very laid back everyone gets along i love the hours of operation my co workers are esy to get along with supervisors hepls when they are needed and pretty much a good job to work for
good,Old Dominion has been a very good company to work for. We pull 10 hour shifts as supervisors.  Our coworkers are like family.  The hardest part of the job is being away from my daughter.
good,"Very busy day in a fast paced environment"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of loading and unloading freight. During my time here I learned to read manifest and organize loads so that they were easy to unload at the next terminal. The management team were excellent communicators and always let us know what needed to be done in a timely manner. My co-workers were typical dock workers overall we worked as a team. The hardest part I would consider was having to re-coop freight, but it wasn't that it was hard just time consuming. The most enjoyable part of working there was the atmosphere, it was like a family especially when they had cookouts."
good,"Job life balance: took a while to get used to nights"
good,I loved this job! the only reason i left was because i moved states. Great management and staff!
good,Best LTL Carrier in Region. A typical day at work was challenging but I love a challenge.
good,Since I started in 2012 this company has changed completely. At first I was worried about it’s future but now I see it’s future is strong because they invest highly in the young people coming up through the company and tend to lean on them to get innovation running through the terminals. Always innovating new vehicles and better equipment so nothing is outdated except for the AS400 operating system. Everything  about this
good,"My time at Old Dominion was a great experience because the Terminal Manager trusted me to do my job. Other than the required safety rules and computer check in/out of freight, I was able to work with my own method and pace. It was a relaxed atmosphere, but fast paced at the same time."
good,Every one around me is supportive and willing too go the extra mile too help and also demonstrate wisdom . We are all human and having the chemistry too preform as a group is very satisfying. Top too bottom ;no matter what job occupation you have at ODFL the main focus is our customers most importantly earning an honest living.
good,"20+ dock workers throughout a typical shift and everyone is on the same page, moving in one accord just as long as you do what you're supposed to do at a steady, efficient pace ."
good,i very much enjoyed working at OD good co works fast pace for the most part employees are treated fairly good pay an benefits too some room for advancement
good,"Been with OD 15 years as a line haul driver, I drive new equipment and treated as a valued employee, basically I'm told when I'm expected to leave arrive at my drop yard and return to the terminal and as long as the expectations of my job are met my interactions with managers and supervisory staff are on my terms.  I make an average of $2300 weekly with benefits."
good,Old Dominion Freight Line is an equal opportunity employer. They care about their employees and their families. It's a wonderful family style company with caring attitudes
good,"Great opportunity, just gotta work for it. You can move up in management if you are willing to put in the work or you could go driving through the company school if that’s what you prefer. But don’t expect handouts."
good,"long days with a lot of hours very good pay great plave to work, you can advance in to many positions within the company if u want to move there is terminals all around the country overall a great work place"
good,"Fun place to work with the many different cultures of people who are employed there. With the opportunity to apply for openings within the company such as supervisors, operators manager, tremnial manager. To drive the state of art equipment with electric logs"
good,"This job has given me great experience. My manager is nothing but positive reinforcement. I've had no issues feeling welcome to this company, and if didn't have to leave, I wouldn't."
good,"I am a part time worker who is very happy with the company,they treat me very well! Work when I can and pick my own hours some weeks one day some weeks three days !"
good,"Good place to work. Excellent salary and benefits. Treats the workers good. Job advancement is good. Enjoyed my co-workers, they were like your 2nd family"
good,"I highly recommended ODFL to anyone who is looking to drive for an employer that takes excellent care of its employees.  As a driver, I was always treated with respect and allowed to complete my job with both safe equipment and any assistance I required to perform it safely and complete my runs in a timely manner."
good,"It hard sometimes "
good,"Old Domnion is a very good truck driving company to work for. Their pay scale is above average and their benefits package is excellent. "
good,Great place to work. Very strict and sturn. Management handles and take care of employees very well. Great benifits and fair competitive work place. Pay per hour is very good.
good,Driving a motorized forklift. Loading and unloading trailers in timely manner. Management was strict but friendly. Hardest part of the job was unloading barrels off a trailer with no skid to carry it out. Also heavy metal that won't come out with a forklift. The most enjoyable part was working together as a team and getting everything done.
good,"A typical day at work was challenging but rewarding. Rewarding in the fact that the pay was excellent. The only thing I would have to say about the place is that you have to have a strong work ethic, because not one moment of work easy."
good,The hardest part about this job is getting use to how the system works on the computers. If you've operated a forklift before the rest of the job will be a breeze.
good,"Progressive company with employees.  I manage over 480 people in a 24 hour operation.  City pick ups and deliveries as well as Line haul, over the road freight operations. Dock operates 24/7.  Human Resources, hiring/firing, disciplinary actions.  Manage sales and service points."
good,I wish I could go back. Awesome company! I loved the people I worked with and the environment. I experienced many professional drivers and management leaders.
good,"ODFL was a good place to work. upper mgmt. was patient with me since I had never done the local p+d gig before and it took me awhile to catch on.There was some stress like all this kind of work every thing happens so fast. I was only ask to work the dock not forced, at least at the Canton terminal. Even after I quit( which was probably a mistake) the terminal mgr. called to see how I was doing on my own. Awesome guy would go back in a heartbeat."
good,dispatchers very helpful. company takes cares of their employees and can be flexible with hours if need be.great benefits.can be a little to stern with some company policies but overall a great work environment.
good,This company family orientated and tried their best to accomidate employee needs
good,"Loved my job and loved working for this company,  Too bad my job went to China,,"
good,it was a goog to place to work at .. i regret leeving...i wish could have fit more in to there plans better
good,"Old Dominion has a culture, in which individuals work together to create a cohesive team. It is necessary in this environment to create lasting bonds with your teammates and to overcome challenges together.Because of this atmosphere Old Dominion, places a priority on doing right by its employees and their families."
good,The job was very simple and self explanatory. Management works with there employees to the fullest and is very understanding of life problems. Pay is amazing for my area. Benefits were spectacular. Plenty of hours if you want them and if you really want to work..
good,"Old Dominion Freight Line is a wonderful company!  While I cannot speak to the experience of all positions within the company, within the corporate center there are plenty of opportunities to grow your career if you are dedicated to that pursuit!  This position has allowed me the opportunity to learn and grow towards my goals!"
good,"Going on 5 years got a raise every year, trucks are maintained often, if you share the other guy isnt always clean. Most of the terminals are nice easy to get into. Night shift for linehaul, you get to bid on runs by seniority...that and taking days off is the only time seniority comes up. Small terminals usually dont have the best runs like the big terminals and hubs do but it depends. My terminal is small and only has a few runs so you cant change much. Freight volumes dictate lanes and runs. You do the same thing everyday unless your a wild driver, 98% of tbe time its doubles, drop and hook yourself. They dont like to change much or take ideas from employees just drive thats all we need from you. They have cook outs every so often, saftey meetings with breakfast, cake and a birthday card, you can get uniforms if ya want them not required for line haul. Its a great place to work I really shouldnt complain or leave but Im bored and burnt out. I ran 100000 miles in a year on one 115 mile stretch of road. Ya get used to pulling doubles in the snow, and if its bad and you dont feel comfortable in it stop and wait till it gets better or dont go at all. Theyd rather weather delay it then clean it up out of the ditch. Ok this is enough i could go on for days about the good and the bad."
good,Great benefits. The pay is great across the board but with that company expects a lot of productivity. Company does care about employees and is always looking for ways to improve. Sometimes old ways work best.
good,I’ve been with the company for over 23 years and have watched it grow into the best LTL carrier in the business. I take great pride in the fact that I’m able to provide our customers with the quality of service they deserve and helping the world keep their promise!! I enjoy sharing and teaching what I’ve learned with our new employees so they can continue the tradition of exceptional service to all.
good,"Great company to work for! Best benefits I've ever seen. Awesome guys at O.D trainers, supervisors and upper management are all cool and like hard working employees"
good,pay and benefits are awesome. The equipment and trailers are top notch. Dispatch is amazing. Terminal manager is the best guy to work for. Fast pace work but it’s so rewarding at the end of the day. This is my second family here. I plan to retire with ODFL!
good,The only thing here. Is we hired to many line haul people.and we don’t work full weeks. Around 3 days a week. Which concerns me. As much as I love this company I may be forced to look else where.
good,"Family oriented company,clean environment, open door policy,nice wages,vacation time, retirement plan "
good,"Good pay, great benefits. Several paid holidays and always willing to work with you. Great place to have a career and not just a job. Hands down, a solid place to be."
good,Great job environment. Safety is number one. And amazing managers. They start you out at great pay and give you raises every year. They offer great opportunities and recognize the best workers.
good,Love Loading and unloading trailers and love the people around me. We all work together as a team and get the job done. Supervisors make sure everything is good and yourself
good,"No work on the weekends, paid holidays, paid birthday holiday, great benefits, amazing pay, incredible benefits - just an overall great place to work."
good,"Fantastic place to work! You're paid to drive and that's what you do! No touch freight ever. It truly is a family operation . All major holidays off paid, and also pays for every drop, hook and fuel"
good,great compnay pays well benefits are good equipment is great after 1  year of service 2 week vacations pay is up to par little slow in the winter time may take 2  years to get a bid run .
good,I drive semi trucks delivering freight. I deliver freight from different cities.
good,the benefit or great pay holiday great place to work always overtime for worker who wanna work and you can get your cdl with them .good growth with the company
good,Awesome!!! many chances to advance at this job . management very helpful. Good chance to learn the LTL business awesome equipment and travel experience.
good,I would recomend this company to anyone who likes professionalism. Old Dominion strives on being the best and keeping promises made to customers. It has been a tremendous positive learning experience for myself.
good,Excellent job to work for  I was there for couple months and the experience I had was incredible and easy  I had no experience what so ever...........
good,"I am a ex employee at old Dominion, this trucking company is also a good company to work for they pay  good pay rate. I recommend people to work for old Dominion."
good,"Loved every minute of it"
good,This company is really good it just does not have teamwork environment between employees and management in the warehouse in the shops they stick together as where I work
good,Just started orientation. Great atmosphere. Very positive. Great benefits on the 61st day of employment. Open door policy if you need to talk to anyone. Great starting pay. This will probably be my last job.
good,"Good pay, good benefits, flexible hours. Great environment, fast paced work good and try not to destroy freight and recoup freight when it comes messes up and try to make it look good for the costumers."
good,Focused team destined to succeed. I dont have any complaints about the company. A family environment be prepared for that coming in the door. Otherwise cool place...no malice
good,Old dominion freight line inc. is a great place to work. Great people and management. You have the opportunity to advance at this company and grow with it
good,"A great place to work with a family atmosphere, great pay and benefits.  Enjoyed working at OD and would work here again if opportunity arose for me to work here again."
good,I've worked for OD about 9 years now and love the environment. Like any freight line company they always have the availability to grow to be better for themselves and there employees. They are very family oriented and considerate or everyone. Great company to work for.
good,"Good company and good place to work , they have a lot benefits at all you need and if you do your job nobody bother you,Also they have good new equipment , Tractor and trailer"
good,You was always learning something new everyday. Know matter how long you had been there. You worked at your own pace. You handled problems they way you could by the rules that they applied in there 100 rules.
good,"I am a dock supervisor, of over 200 dock workers at Old Dominion Freight Line. I also oversee the day to day operations, of the truck loading, and making sure that the most important shipments get out on a timely manner. Before all trailers leave the dock, I give my stamp of approval that they have been loaded correctly,and the freight will make it to its destination safely. I have learned to work with many different, diversities and cultures. The most enjoyable part of my job is sharing my knowledge to my subordinates, and the most challenging part is teaching them that, they should want to do their jobs because they want to, not because they have to."
good,"First off, I work with the NUMBER 1 freight line in the buisness and it shows....☝️💯🌟"
good,Great company with great management. Job security and benifets are great. Hard work pays off. Work for this company and tgey have great benifets.  Anaxing associates
good,"Great company in the LTL. Great pay. Nothing bad to say about Od. Good equipment, local or line haul work. Excellent benefits and 401k. Reason I left was to start my own trucking business"
good,ODFL is one of the best companies to work for. Coming from a competitor it was mind blowing to see the difference in morale and how much easier it was to work for them versus the competitor
good,It really is a good place to work. I have learned every available at my terminal and given opportunities to prove my value. I would recommend this job to others.
good,I was one of their best workers. I got fired for reason i didn't understand. But great place to work I wish i can go back. Great management. And people I miss very much
good,I love working for Old Doninion freight line.  They have a good staff and I like that it a family owned business and everyone is treated like family. I want to retire there
good,"The customer service girls and I would get to work early at least by 7am.  Phones would ring off the hook so we all in the office had to cover someone at some point of our day. Dispatch and I gave estimates to clients on a daily and made sure to keep those customers with us if at all possible and following their shipments to make sure they were delivered on time. "

My manager was very family oriented and was a joy to work for. I got along with all my co-workers. Even though we may not agree on every aspect we had enough respect for each other to sit down and talk out any issues we may have and come to an agreement that was foreseeable for us all. The hardest part was getting attached to the reuglar phone calls from the employees who were employed here for many many years. They have gotten sick and are not used to sitting at home alone.

I was quickly promoted to dispatch and OS&D demanding to learn every aspect of the industry. This allowed me to Open a terminal in Sarasota where I was 2nd in command handling customer service, accounts receivable, IT, dock and yard management, city and over the road dispatch. After the terminal was successful with the southeast regions best operating ratio I was called back to Tampa to fix there city dispatch. After 2 years of record breaking sales and service I was asked to move to Ocala and spearhead there inbound operations. after two months we were able to bring the operating ratio and customer service to all time records. meanwhile my home was in Riverview outside of Tampa and the market was not condusive to a sale. The 3 hour commute became too much and I had to part ways after 7 years. the hardest part was leaving for a job closer to home. I made a lateral move to EDI in Lakeland but unfortunately the companies upper management had put the company out of business. I left on good terms from ODFL but a hiring freeze kept me from returning. I truly love the company and have been told I can return but I am looking for a job here in Tampa near my family.
