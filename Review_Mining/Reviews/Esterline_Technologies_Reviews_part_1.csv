bad,"When worked there was a foreign team leaders who gave English worker the harder jobs and polish workers the easier ones, English workers not allowed to talk but Polish could."
bad,"In Coeur d'Alene, Idaho on Wilbur Road. For an IT Infrastructure Upgrade project corporate wide. An IT manager was going for the glory and through all the contractors he could at it."
bad,"I’ve leavened a lot from working at hytek, lots of ups and downs. But, the management there isn’t the best. The supervisors have no problem throwing the employees under the bus, to make themselves look better in front of their bosses. I feel like, people are given these leadership positions and they take it to their full advantage and that isn’t right. A lot of people come and go at hytek and they wonder why. I think hytek needs to reevaluate their people philosophy! The employees on the shop floor are the ones who do all the work and get no credit."
bad,High School is the highest level of education some managers have so that negatively impacts how the lower rungs are treated. Wage discrimination exist here.
bad,"Only stakeholders matter! Customers are the last priority. Yes, Man Management. Stressful, no work balance life, low moral, back stabbing rampant, total disconnect between Department, overall disfunctional company with over 20% turnover. If you have a choice I strongly recommend you work for another company you will spare yourself from anxiety and depression."
bad,"If you are looking for employment, look somewhere else. My personal opinion Armtec in Coachella is not a good place to work. They preach about dedication - truth - trust - teamwork - open communication - respect. Not the case specially the respect part. Upper management level do not care about anything only numbers and are not good planners, we end up working weekends because of that. No labor union here so that is the main problem I think. This is a very busy job and can give you a lot of stress and can become very bad for your health. Production coworkers are nice like family and we find support in each other so we make it through the rough days. Production supervisors here are nice, but they are always stressed out too and pressured by directors and managers so the pressure come down to us. The people that work in the front offices, like marketing, purchasing and all the rest of the departments are also very stressed out, I know few people there. They always have openings here for different jobs because lot of people decide to quit. Not a good sign."
bad,"Used to be a great company until absorbed by Esterline! 20% turn over since lean transformation a year ago. Overworked, stressed out employees, overall tense atmosphere. Noisy factory with chemical or burning smells. Yes Man, kind of middle management, huge disconnect with upper management."
bad,"This not a company for a person that thinks for themselves. Management knows everything and is never wrong. Mid managers lie and get away with it, because upper management allows it. This company will fail because of the current leaders. You have to be in the click to survive. Accounting also runs the show and tells what and how production will run. You have people in accounting that have no idea what it takes to run a production company."
bad,"Management does not respect the employees. They over work you, when you’re only supposed to work 10 hours Monday through Thursday. They make Friday and Saturday mandatory, you’ll work 10 hours that Friday and Saturday it’s up to them how long they want to work you. There are times that the weather might get bad and then they’ll send you home, or they might just tell you to not come to work the following day. You can’t plan anything outside this job cause they’re constantly changing the work schedule and hours."
bad,"Management plays favorites, no advancement, low pays, stressful workplace. Poor management support to floor workers, indecision and complacent in problems not being rectified"
bad,Very stressful work environment replete with continuous upper management changes.  Very high turn over rate and poor morale.  Hard work and dedication to the company was not rewarded nearly as much as playing politics.  Favoritism is very prevalent throughout the company.
bad,"Cero apoyo para crecimiento profesional individual. "
bad,"Norwich Buena Park Esterline facility, I wouldn’t recommend anyone working there. Management has favorites on who she wants to move forward in the company. If your an agency working in this company, don’t waste your time."
bad,Hard workers have to work harder to make up for the slackers without compensation.
bad,"They had a contractor training me, who had no clearances to anything and was seen as a risk. The manager didn't know how to paint, had me looking at forms that didn't have anything to do with my work. Got mad at me for being on the computer working on training that he put me on and told me to complete because it was very important. Had me working on things that no one else had to do or knew what it was for. Others were mad that I was there."
bad,"it was great, loved working there. I will recommend this place to everyone. great culture, encourages growth and they invest in their employees. Great Management team."

bad,"The management changes as often as the temperature in SoCal with no clear direction, which stops the work flow and there's no room for advancement unless you're part of the ""upper mgmt click"" and do what you are told.  Corporate is only concerned about the Shareholders not the customers or employees. They want high quality workers but is reluctant to pay for them.  The days are long and stressful with no end in sight.  The lack of daily accomplishments wears down even the most enthusiastic employee eventually."
bad,"The company is highly dysfunctional. Nepotism and favoritism are rampant. They have increased the job requirements, due to export compliance failures, continuously without the personnel to handle the workload. Too many meetings and little time to accomplish tasks. Regulatory and document control requirements have become overwhelming with little improvements. Few additional staff to handle it, so everything is done half baked and EXTREMELY SLOWLY. Systems and documents are desperately out of date."
bad,Everything goes smoothly unless there's a defect on the parts. The hardest part of the job most of the customers wants their parts and not enough time to complete them all. I learn quality is very important. The most enjoyable part of the job is recognition a job well done.  Work together to complete expedite jobs.
bad,"Alta rotacion de personal, ambiente laboral inestable, cultura laboral enfocada al negocio, poco interes por desarrollo del personal."
bad,"A typical day was a team meeting listing to a family member of the vp talk about irrelevant information"
bad,great pay but the work environment has gotten quite toxic in the past years.
bad,"Management is no support and are all ""yes"" people when asked to jump.  Regardless of how unreasonable a request may be,  they don't mind since they pawn things off on others."
bad,Does not have the leadership skills to run and or produce quality product.
bad,"Do not apply unless you just want a paycheck and be told what to do (as in hourly employees).  Middle managers will never get ahead.  They come and go constantly (quit or fired). The employees run the company (cry to HR over ANYTHING, whether right or wrong) and upper management will pressure you to do the impossible (work weekends all the time, fix the company culture).  Their quality is in the gutter (scrap rate is super high) and they can't get any products shipped on time (on time delivery is embarrassingly low).  Customers hate them!  I don't know how they're still in business."
bad,"Workload is very heavy and likely to get worse.  No feeling of job security.  Morale is extremely low.  Constant problems, things don't seem to get better."
bad,"did 10 hour shifts, a very big company and I had a fun manager. the smell in the warehouse was very strong from working with plastic and many other chemicals."
bad,"Ils n'embauchent pas, ou au strict minimum dans le but de MAXIMISER LEUR PROFITS ET S'EN METTRE LE PLUS DANS LES POCHES,  Les employés partis a la retraite ne sont PAS remplacés, fonctionnent avec des employés BRULÉS en surtemps, le surtemps EST une condition d'emploi, prendre des congés est mal vu et au retour rien n'aura été fait, vacances en meme temps de la construction et aucune autre date possible........comme dans les années 20...... Semaine 40 heures au lieu de 37.5, le management est flou et les relations patronales-syndicat sont pourries. Le francais est la 5e langue, beaucoup de gens ne comprennent PAS un mot de francais, Grande quantité de personnel désintéressés et blasés entrent au travail que pour LA PAYE, les lieux sont similaires a un CHSLD personnel agé +60ans représente 75% et plus du personnel et aucune offre de départ, pression a produire insoutenable. Grande quantité d'erreurs necéssite des reprises de travail effectué, sans cesse, travail baclé, lieux de travail et laboratoires malpropres, matériel usé a la corde et rafistolé. C'est des conditions typiques d'une entreprise privée parmi tant d'autres, le privé, c'est ca..."
bad,"Low pay, unqualified co-workers, poor benefits, and management totally lost. Keep looking for another job for there is nothing here for you."
bad,managers have no idea how to utilize their workers. no respect for the workers. long hours. no advancement unless your in the click. no deserved raises.
bad,"I have worked for BVR Tchnologies for many years. I really thought new management was going to be the answer to help us advance into the 21st century. Instead they treat the people like dirt, constant back stabbing and lies by upper manaagement. The original BVR employees are a GREAT group of people, but unfortunately work daily in fear of thier jobs. If the operations manager does not like you you will be targeted and our life will become unbearable."
bad,"On the job training"
bad,"Good decisions take for ever to make and bad ones are made on the spot."
bad,They allowed employee attitudes to suffer as they moved 1/2 of the product line to another facility and sold off the other 1/2.
bad,"work 7 till 3:30"
bad,"Workplace culture is lacking in motivation"
bad,"Most of the employees are great, however the mentality in just about all departments is ""that's the way it's always been done, that's the way we continue to do it"". Huge backlog in orders, late deliveries. Angry vendors & customers...if you kiss up to the right people, no problem...but if you stand your ground, look out---upper managers/directors meddling In departments that do not pertain the them, having people get fired or forcing resignations of good employees because director(s) ""cannot work with them""---HR Is a joke!  Too many  people with titles and all but one Mgr does any work...employees do not feel comfortable going to HR w/concerns, nothing is kept confidential and one director in particular is great at retaliating against anyone that voices their concern/opinion."
bad,The benefits are awesome at the job. The sad part is the employees do over and above work for little pay. Unless you have been there 10 years or more advancement and pay raise is very little.
bad,"Started out as a fun place, working on cutting edge technology. Big corporation takeover turned it into a place where you have to look over your shoulder all the time. I still loved working there."
bad,"Was bypassed several times for a promotion & work credit given elsewhere. Expected overtime, underappreciated and left out of common activities. Denied sufficient pay raises."
bad,"I was told so may things over the last three years...and now we are on our fifteenth (15 th)  boss in a little over three years...not good.  "
bad,"my experience at Esterline was overall not one of the best jobs. honestly because, The managers there are not very good. overall this could have been a better experience if management was better"
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job was the people you work with because they have the same common goal to support the bottom line. However, you will hard and not have the time to play hard. Management will feed you but your incentive is supposed to be the OT pay but I would rather go home to my family when I want."
bad,Très bonne entreprise ou l'on peut évoluer car il y a des perspective
bad,"Some departments are better than others depending on the projects,"
bad,"On a typical work day, the job is very interesting and the co-workers try to work together. The hardest part of the job is dealing with management. The most enjoyable part of the job are the working hours."
bad,A nice place to work and I would recommend this company. There are advancement opportunities at the Everett site in Washington.
bad,"There is very little opportunity for career development. Management expect analyses and cost saving measures but give you no authority and little time to implement or develop initiatives.  Unfair performance reviews."
bad,majorit of engineers are incompetent. Management has very littl eknowledge of the business practices and how to run a company and develop new products.
bad,"Poor task direction, Given little introduction to what was expected of me. Was informed by my recruiter, not manager, that I should not report to work Monday."
bad,The planning and purchasing department currently in Chaos. People want out as the things being rolled out are not being well executed. Trying to take BIG steps when they should be taking baby steps and ensuring each employee is properly trained. Lack of work instructions and other key materials needed so employees have the tools for success. Upper management needs to realize that people are there greatest assets. I dont think they have good upper management to lead teams for success.
bad,"Esterline's Board of Directors needs to bring in new leadership to try to turn this company around. "
bad,Its Job if your looking for something. Not a place for advancement. Too many family tithes within the job which creates trust issues amongst employees that are not family.
bad,There is absolutely no work life balance at this company .  They are always 8 steps behind the ball.  Management overall needs to be reconstructed.  Lots of old management folks that have been there too long and cant keep up with the new demands.  The old management does just enough to keep a float.
bad,"The company has lots of supervisors, line managers, program managers and so forth. What they need is actual workers such as engineers to actually meet deliveries. Impossible to advance when the odds are stacked against you."
bad,"I have been at Darchem several years and am now trying to move forward and progress, however this is near impossible with this company. I am currently leading a team of up to 20 operators but i am not getting paid to be in charge. i really feel this company is simply trying to get something for nothing out of me."
bad,Upper management does not listen to your concerns. Job procedures and were always trying to be changed without testing first. Pay was not great never got a raise like I was intended to. No room for advancement or movement within. Wages were low for the environment and material we worked with.
bad,Long hours with no recognition.  Turnover in leadership didn't allow any single president time to adjust and learn the business.  Micro-management very prevalent
bad,"There are lots of great people there. If you're a contractor and the absence of your manager is celebrated, don't count on ethical treatment from management. Such a manager has been known to hire for work they don't have, terminate and blame the contractor. "
bad,"Not bad"
bad,"Pros:"
bad,Darchem engineering good working hours early finish Friday easy job times bad points poorly managed lots of favouritism things aren't ran fairly no job security when you are a temp
bad,"More than 5 years ago Leach was a good company to work but not today. Company laid off too many employees,Leach still offer a good benefits to employees such as: healthcare insurance, vision, dental, sick pay, holidays pay, life insurance, 401 K."
bad,"Esterline CMC is filled with great people that are unfortunately being overseen by very poor executive leadership, lack of direction and communication."
bad,"Great people to work with on my team. Manager was difficult but fair."
good,"not always does this place run efficiently, management makes so many wrong turns. we just want to work they can't get the parts to us on time and documentation takes a backseat to the actual building of the product"
good,"Poor management and culture. There is no focus on future growth of the company by looking at Technolgy for the future.  The company was based on Engineering, and today the stradegy has changed and there is no value for engineering and R&D."
good,The company to include the senior management team takes shortcuts that results in personal injuries to employees.  Ethics are only spoken but not prac.
good,"Poste complet : emballage de pièces, préparation de commandes, expédition de pièces chez les sous-traitants."
good,"Power Systems has recently gone under a major change in an effort to make it more appealing to their shareholders. Unfortunately the employees are the ones paying for this change. Granted the removal of the numerous managers is a welcome change they did not remove some that have contributed to issues in the past. This company struggles to attract talent as they are continually unable to have effective leadership and the benefits are less competitive than they need to be to keep their existing talent. There is still the prevalence of promoting from within, however they continue to ignore those who truly have the skill to advence this company. Overall the company is very male dominated and a strong sense of sexism is a constant deterrment from any woman advancing. I continue to hope for change but after providing objective evidence to refute the claims made by my manager I do not know if I will have a future at this company."
good,"The company culture is not progressive and they use a lot of outdated processes that make customer service impossible."
good,Management tends to change operating procedures on a whim. Emphasis on lowering costs without consideration to impact on production. Limited opportunities for advancement. Supervisors are all hired from outside.
good,"The place is a zoo since all of the work is late and everyone is stressed. For salaried engineers, there is no difference working 40 hours to 80 hours. The pay and the compensation is the same which is little or none at all."
good,"Pros"
good,"The engineering area is a carpeted area of cubical work areas, organized into functional groupings. The work area is well lighted and warm. care is taken to ensure proper visitor access is maintained."
good,Esterline had a very people oriented culture that is now changing under the new leadership.  It has become more competitive but it is now a more political and there is little work life balance.
good,This is an aerospace based company that has multiple locations worldwide.   Company is trying to unify practices and policies across multiple business units spread across 33 countries.
good,"Le rachat de Souriau par la plateforme américaine de l'aéronautique Esterline m'a obligé à diluer ma zone géographique ROW dans les zones principale ce qui m'a fait quitter ce fleuron de la connectique française, n'ayant plus de place dans l'organisation qui se dessinait."
good,"the 1st thing about this place is the people , most are great workers, the new management is something else not fun to work with, they don't listen to good ideas from employees. the company will be around only because of the DP department other wise is loosing money. but again the pleasure to work with some of the people."
good,Very busy organization and progressive for Engineers.  I do not have any other comments to make about the organization.
good,"I worked there for many years, but in that time nothing really changed.  In the end, the differences between the company values and mine collided and I moved on."
good,"The company provide good health benefits but when it comes to appreciating their employees for all the hours they put it is they are lacking. Management needs to lead by example. They will be able to meet customer needs better if they are able to understand the process it takes to get parts built, inspected and shipped."
good,">>> parking "
good,It was a good paying job with a bad culture. The average day is made longer by the stressful environment. Hardly any time away but is made up for by the pay.
good,"empiezo revisando articulos"
good,"Entreprise agréable pour le travail , mai pas dans le salaire pour les nouveaux arrive"
good,This is a great place to work however beware of middle management stepping in to make unreasonable decisions within your department.  Overall a positive environment without the petty micromanaging and lack of organization.
good,"Great place to start your career but advancement is limited. It takes knowing people to grow rather than skills. Management needing to be tightened up, but working towards that goal."
good,"This is a struggling company trying to improve, but the improvements set in place isn't working as expected.  The company has much to do before it gets healthier."
good,New CEO many changes to the culture had been a great place to work in the industry.  They have not kept up with the industry benefits and pay since 2012.
good,"Esterline is still trying to fix processes they do and bring in new perspectives and systems. The management is lacking leadership"
good,Its a job. Not a career for me. Some people like it enough to stay for 30 years and others do not.
good,"nice place to work"
good,"Part of Esterline"
good,Okay to work  friendly places and people great company to work for very relaxing and many things to learn  with awesome people to teach you how to do the work
good,"Management is okay, but could do better. Supervisors need better training or understanding of the meal/break times. It is not a 25 minute lunch break then be at you work station by the 30 minute mark."
good,L entreprise m a fait grandir mais je souhaite découvrir d autre domaine
good,"It's okay to work there, due to lack of commitment in some of its key employees.Besides, most of its  employees have many wrong habits at work, and this hurts the company."
good,"The Company was relocated to Mexico, nothing to review.  Position was temporary.  Nothing more to say.  Moved most jobs to Mexico and some to California."
good,"Wallop defence systems could be a great place to work, but with bad management and bad employee attitude this company does not make a profit."
good,"It was a great learning experience for me in all aspects of the workforce. I just had trouble with my supervisor and the director due to my supervisor claimed my work for her own and when I reported this to the director, he made it very clear that he did not care who got it done or how it got done, as long as his dates were met for completion. I have no problem of who or how something gets done but if you are going to claim my work and put it on a spreadsheet for everyone to see ""you"" did it with your name and give me no credibility that is where I draw the line. So besides that the staff as a whole is great just a select few are not desired to work with."
good,Manufacturer of relays for aerospace industry. Working hand in hand with abroad sister companies in both Europe and Asia. Ensuring on time delivery for sister companies stay above 95%. Responsible for purchasing product for large OEM's.
good,"Accurate, Good Environment, Good opportunities, Good training, Can move up in position to bigger and better things."
good,"Some groups and managers are good. Had several high-level turnovers during my employment. Employees were generally good to each other. Consistent aerospace environment, few major surprises. Some of the work was tedious and not very exciting. Steady stream of projects. Benefits were below average."
good,Good place to work. People are friendly company have many locations.  Good benifits medical and dental.  I learned new things about my works specifically about solid state power supplies.
good,"good hours to choose to work on a shift, management needs to be more involved with the departments they are in charge of to be more productive on the production floor."
good,"If you don't mind living far out in a rural area, below average pay/benefits, occasional layoffs  and doing a lot of verification it might be for you."
good,"Another aerospace company recently acquired Esterline so it is uncertain what the future holds for the former Esterline companies. The culture at Esterline was generally very good, so hopefully that continues."
good,"Groupe américain oblige, tout est tourné vers les chiffres."
good,Very political. Management often gets involved without letting the system work itself. Frustrating to say the least. Wrong people are rewarded. Okay for the time being.
good,"Ambiente de trabajo sano."
good,"Responsible for planning, design and fabrication of aircraft control panels using EUCLID Solid Modeling Program which reduce the cost from design to order fulfillment for the company. Management compensation was adequate.  Management had issues with non productive engineers."
good,"a lack of money reinvested into machinery causes a lot more work than it should do, and there is a very low ceiling for you to aim for with regards to pay, but the working hours are good."
good,Too much overturn in management which prevents solidification of leadership.  Senior management appeases customers and does not support the operations
good,"A recent change in leadership has changed the culture, not for the better. Three layoffs since the new leader came on board. He is impersonal and does not engage in conversations with employees. He is definitely not a people person."
good,"CMC is always on the leading edge of technology. Working with colleagues around the world is both challenging and motivating,"
good,Revenue target driven company.  There is much pressure to make the monthly revenue.  The people over all are the best part.  There seems to be a culture change occurring.
good,The salary could have been better.....considering it was aerospace. Management was okay...workplace could have had better quality. I believe the hours were okay and I did learn a few things about deburring as well as quality assurance. The most enjoyable part of this job was the friends I did make.
good,Empresa correcta en la que desarrollar la responsabilidad adquirida
good,I don't recommend it it's a very low paying job for what people do here! It's also a very hot environment to work in on the other hand the good thing about this company is that there always hiring and there's always work here
good,Pas grand chose à dire sur cette entreprise étant donné qu'elle est en pleine réorganisation
good,"Mes missions: "
good,Une bonne boîte mais un manque de sérieux dans le management..
good,"I see several things that can be improved upon like process improvement and communication."
good,"réglage de composant électroniques."
good,". long hard hours "
good,Good leaders but uncertain future as we deal in the US Government Defense sector.  In our current environement it is really tough to meet all of our assigned financial goals.
good,It is a public company and typically benefits and bonuses and opportunities are only for senior managers and CEO's.
good,Good place to work but could be run better people are friendly and you can learn a lot and if you work hard they can offer you opportunitys like nvqs and welding courses.
good,"Good secure job as aerospace industry will not leave anytime soon. However, improvements take a long time to develop and even then do not stick. Things change quickly but without much improvement or extra money making it to the workers."
good,"Typical Work Day:  Stressful, fast paced"
good,"I was responsible for setup, testing and repair of Aerospace products such as Helicopter Data Concentrators, Searchlight Actuators for Helicopters, Autopilot Servos, and various other products."

good,"A fair workplace, with great benefits. They care about their employees."
good,It was a good place to work. It was a very productive atmosphere and  I enjoyed the jobs that I did there. The people I worked with made my time there worth while.
good,Electroplating is frequently labor-intensive work. In the areas with crane access this wouldn't be so bad. But coupled with Zinc Nickel's deplorable training and lack of plating management made it an undesirable place to work.
good,Nice place to work. People are friendly. Place where could progress yourself. Sad to leave but Esterline couldn't offer any more to let me progress myself.
good,"Company is a business in recovery. If you are looking something challenging, this is the place for you. There's a lot of opportunity to grow and there a managers that will help develop you in your career."
good,I was responsible for the overall  contractual responsibility for the Countermeasure product line representing three different sites serving as the primary Point of Contact on all contractual and business matters.  The concern was that the line of responsibility was divided into three division and a lot of conflict existing between those division as it relates to Executive leadership.
good,I currently love my job itself but the management could use some work. The management des not communicate well with the employees.
good,"es un lugar agradable solo que el desarrollo esta restringido solo para unos cuantos, hay muchas preferencias de personas y los salarios son buenos.... pero solo para unos cuantos"
good,Esterline as a whole is a great company. Lots of lifers. However promotions are based on who you are buddies with therefore a lot of management does not have the skills necessary to lead. Management is always pointing fingers.
good,It was a welll established place many of the warehouse were all over the west coast so there is room to grow. Had a lot of fun working with the new equipment they taught me
good,They give you clear goals and fair timeline to complete them. Space was enough to complete projects. There was a kink with most of the availability of the test equipment.
good,This is the corporation that owns over 25 companies mostly in aerospace field. It is very much centralized. Till couple of years back corporation had acted as holding company and so at each individual company decisions were made. this has now changed
good,"poor management at its best. good wages. not much skill involved in job in main factories. Treated poorly, no bonus, no 'thank you's' no rewards. managers do not have an idea."
good,El trabajo esta cómodo no hay mucha presión y la gente es muy amable
good,beaucoup de découvertes à travers les déplacements dans le monde entier.
good,"Point positif :"
good,"During a typical day at work I worked on a couple of the projects I was assigned to. I learned many things such as python, software development process applications, software verification and validation, and test station development. I worked on hardware and software. The culture of AVISTA was pretty cool, very friendly. I really enjoyed the scope of what was done at AVISTA."
good,"Interesting co-workers, a lot of autonomy and an overall great working environment. "
good,"I used to work in a room with 4 or 5 more people. We were responsible to assemble diodes that where used in military missiles. We all knew how to run every step of the process, but where assigned to a specific one."
good,There was nothing typical about my day to day activities. Working in Document Control required a lot of flexibility. I worked with every department and they all thought their jobs had priorities over all others. I learned to get a clear understanding of when jobs are truly due so I could prioritize accordingly.
good,"A typical day at Darchem starts at 7.30 you get your traveller/job card log on to the computer that logs your times. Then you start working on your component that you are manufacturing."

good,"buen ambiente de trabajo."
good,"My day beings with reviewing various log files: i.e backup logs, IDS alarms, server alerts etc. Next I complete or follow up on any tasks I did not complete prior day. Because I am the sole source of IT support for my organization, I must prioritize any trouble requests that I receive with production critical systems having the highest priority. The second half of my day focuses on staying on task with all site projects such as deployments and upgrades. I conduct research as needed to solve a wide variety of problems. Work with local and platform management to ensure local site security posture is in line with contractual and organizational requirements."
good,"I came out of this with RCRA/DOT training and Hazwhoper certificate. "
good,My first job from high school. Good people to work for. Job title was eliminated.

good,"After 32 years of employment I am grateful for the employment and the ability to balance my family and personal needs with my work responsibilities  "
good,"Working for CMC Electronics-Esterline felt like family. Great work/family balance. Being a remote site, there was not much verticality and the opportunity for advancement was limited."
